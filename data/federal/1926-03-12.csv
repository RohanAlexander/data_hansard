In the event of any States definitely standing aloof from the agreement the allocation of the whole of the money among those States thab do sign will ba considered. The actual carrying out of works will be controlled by the States, but the works must first be approved by the Commonwealth Government.

CUSTOMS ANU EXCISEDUTIES . In Oommittee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 11th March (vide page 1574), on motion by Mr . PRATTENThat the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1021-4 be amended as hereunder, set out, and that on and after the fourth day of March, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, Victorian time, duties of'Customs be collected in pursuance of the'Customs tariff as so amended. That, excepting by mutual agreement, or until after six months' notice has been given to the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand, nothing in this resolution shall affect any goods entering the Commonwealth of Australia from the Dominion of New Zealand {vide page 1228). . . .",16
23,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Hindmarsh) [11.14] - Before the general debate concludes, I desire to place on record my views of the schedule now before the committee, and of the general application of the principle of protection. When the 1921 tariff was presented to this Parliament by the then Minister for Trade ancl Customs (Mr . Massy Greene), I stated clearly my attitude on the fiscal question. I have no desire to reiterate the arguments I advanced on that occasion, but I shall reaffirm aud supplement them. I am disappointed at the omission of many items from the schedule. Later I shall express my views on that phase of the subject. I have been astounded to note during this debate that the number of free traders in this chamber has been augmented since 1921. That is particulary surprising when it is borne in mind that the accepted policy of this country is to foster local industries. The spirit of the free traders is entirely foreign to Australia; they express the thoughts of a dead generation. Fifty years ago, when we were relatively at a primitive stage of development, pasturage aud agriculture were almost the only industrial undertakings, and to the majority of Australians rura l activities appeared to be the only source of national wealth. But we have advanced since that time, and with our growth as a nation there has been a corresponding growth of essential secondary industries. Those who are blind to that change have not progressed with the times,, and have not realized the position occupied by Australia among the nations. The people of this country have recognized the value of secondary industries. To discover what an important part secondary industries have played in the progress of this nation, it is only necessary to consult the statistics published by the Commonwealth Statistician. Their development has created a more reliable market for Australian raw materials, and Australian sons are asserting their right to be artisans to serve their country's needs rather than menial purveyors of raw and unfinished materials for the skilled operatives of other countries to .manufacture and sell again to this country. Australians are determined to be something more than the labourers for the rest of the world. They will provide at least their share of the skilled artisans of the world. Many persons are blind to these changes in our community life, and to them the law of cheapness seems to be the allabsorbing consideration. Their regrettable point of view is likely to lead this country into a very invidious position, and to increase our industrial difficulties, which are already greater than they should be. Our difficulties will certainly be accentuated if we give ourselves over to free trade, and thus prevent this country from manufacturing its requirements of finished products. The speeches of free traders express the old-fashioned views of the last century; they do not meet the needs of the present moment. Some honourable members think and talk as if primary industries were the only consideration. Their narrow outlook is especially dangerous to those who are engaged in primary production. The man on the land needs to beware of these false prophets, who are endeavouring to make him believe that his interests are opposed to the development of our secondary industries.",16
24,Mr FORDE,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Member s of the Country party do not speak for the majority of the farmers of this country. . Mr MAKIN - I agree with the view of the honourable member for' Capricornia (Mr Forde). Limited as my experience has been in this House, I have, at least, been able to form the very definite opinion that those honourable members who designate themselves the Country party act only in the interests of foreign countries. Their policy will certainly not benefit the primary producer in Australia. The man on the land should make up his mind where his interests lie. for he is the most important factor in the progress of this country. I have not heard any honourable member of the Country party express satisfaction with any of the items contained in the schedule. The Country party is alone in direct opposition to the Government on this measure. Some of its members assert frankly that they believe in freedom of trade. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) and, I believe, the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) very largely subscribe to that policy, and I do not think that I should he doing an injustice to the honourable  included him in the same category. Some members of that party say that they believe in ""moderate protection."" I assume that ""moderate protection"" means virtually a revenue tariff only, with no effective protection for Australian industries. The ""moderate protectionists "" are very careful not to explain what they mean by their particular brand of protection, but it is highly desirable that we should know how far they are prepared to go in assisting Australian industries.",17
25,Mr GREGORY,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The honourable member might say how far he is prepared to go in the opposite direction.,17
26,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"My object is to obtain the best terms possible for Australian industries. The development of our secondary industries will provide the best possible market for our primary products. If we adopted the free trade principles enunciated by some honourable members, what would become of the industries already established in this country? Owing to the inequitable economic conditions in other . countries most of them would be crushed out of existence. Even our isolation would not save us in the face of such competition, because some foreign governments subsidize by bounties and rebates the shipment of exports to this and other countries. Before the war that was a very important part of the trading arrangements between the government of Germany and German exporters. The view of honourable members in the cowier is that protection, if any is given, should be as limited as possible; in which case our secondary industries would not be able to resist the competition of more highly organized countries with a lower standard of living than wo have in Australia. Our factories would be closed, and those engaged secondary industries would have to engage in primary production or in the marketing and transport of primary products. Will those engaged in wheat-growing say that, even with a continuance of the favourable markets and the high prices which they have ei:joyed during recent years, it is wise for Australia to.go in for unrestricted primary production ? Are they agreeable that those now engaged in secondary industries should engage in agriculture, dairy farming, or fruit-growing, and, by adding to production, reduce the price obtainable for their produce ? If that happened, men would be taken from employment for which they were suited, and from industries which were helping to build up th« nation, to become competitors with the primary producers. Mr CHAM . TON - There would then be no home market.",17
27,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"That is so. The consumer would become a competitor with the producer. I have visited the irrigation areas on the Murray River, and I know something of the conditions there. Not only has difficulty been experienced in finding markets for their produce, but it has also been found that so many men have been engaged in one industry that the returns from their blocks are insufficient to enable them to live in accordance with Australian standards. I do not want to accentuate that difficulty. I desire that the men engaged in dairy farming, wheat-growing, fruit-growing, and other primarv industries shall obtain reasonable prices for their produce, that noovercrowded market shall deprive them of the just reward of their labours. For Australia to become a great nation we must not only encourage primary production, but we must also foster our secondary industries. The home market must be developed so that more of our primary produce will be consumed in Australia.",18
28,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,At what price?,18
29,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"At a price which is keeping with the standard of» living in Australia. I want the primary producers of Australia to enjoy a reasonable measure of comfort; but if Australia adopts free trade as her policy the man on the land will have to compete in the world's markets, not only with the proin duce of other countries which have a lower standard of living than we have, but with those who now constitute his best customers-the persons now engaged in secondary industries.  members in the corner are strong on potatoes.",18
30,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Yes . They advocate protection, even to the point of prohibition, for those things which they themselves produce; but when it comes to assisting industries which are equally essential to the maintenance of our prestige among the nations, they are inconsistent. If protection is good for maize, onions, potatoes, and hops, it is good also for machinery and other articles manufactured in Australia. I believe that the majority of our primary producers have a broad national outlook, and do not subscribe to the views held by the honourable members for Riverina (Mr. Killen), Perth (Mr Mann), Forrest  The man on the land recognizes that as a citizen of Australia he has responsibilities towards the rest of the population. That it had been considered necessary to grant bounties to assist some of our primary industries is evidence of the difficulty of finding suitable markets overseas. The workers have offered no objection to these bounties, and the increased price of products purchased by them, believing that they will assist to improve the lot of the primary producer. Those engaged in secondary industries have treated the man on the land sympathetically. They have endeavoured to show that they desire that the farmer, the fruit-grower, and every other primary producer shall enjoy the full results of his labour. Our primary industries can extend only as our secondary industries develop. To increase our primary production indiscriminately, without regard to the development of thp. home market, is economically unsound.",18
31,Mr SCUXLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Our primary and seconin dary industries are interdependent.,18
32,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"In an able address last night, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) presented Labour's case in relation to the tariff. He made it clear that our primary and secondary industries are interdependent, that' we are all brothers, associated in the advancement and progress of our country, that each section should realise its obligations to the Other. Instead of the primary producer being told that thfmen engaged in secon. dary industries are his sworn enemies, he should be told that by assisting to develop our secondary industries he is providing the best market for his own produce. The honourable member for Y a r r a and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) referred last night to statements made by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to the farmers assembled in conference at Ballarat. They exposed the Treasurer's hypocrisy, and made it clear that his statements at Ballarat were unworthy of one occupying such a high and responsible position in the affairs of the nation. U n fortunately, the Treasurer is not alone in giving expression to views which are unworthy of men in high positions. Addressing the National Federation some time ago, the Prime Minister said that the Labour party stood for a system of prohibition that could only result in building up industries which would be inefficient in controlling labour, and would place an intolerable burden on the people of Australia. The Treasurer and some of his supporters have alleged that the Labour party stands for prohibition, yet they are prepared to support the . new tariff schedule, which is really a step in that direction. We should take these gentlemen to task for their inconsistency, and ask them how far they are prepared to keep f a i th with the public.",18
33,Mr SCULLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,And not talk with voices.,19
34,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Exactly . ask them how far we can credit them sincerity in relation to the tariff. I the 'honourable member for Riverina (M Killen) what industries should not be supported ?,19
35,Mr KILLEN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,We should support them all.,19
36,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"If the honourable mempare ber's reply is genuine, let him be pared to give it practical effect. The tariff, if its purpose is to protect Ausdone so. tralian industries, should be effective. I am out to get the best possible terms for Australian industries, whether primary secondary. There seems to have arisen in Australia of recent years one section that advocates imperialism and another section that advocates internationalism as against the interests of Australia. I ask for some consideration for Australian in dustries. Our patriotism can be judged only by our willingness to assist the country in which we live. How true is the saying that charity begins at home. As patriots we should do everything possible to build up our primary and secondary industries. If we fail to do this, we shall be doing an injustice to our countrymen, to the stock whence we came.",19
37,Mr KILLEN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Does the honourable member contend that in order to be patriotic we must support prohibitive duties ?,19
38,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,We must support duties that will effectively protect Australian industries.,19
39,Mr SCULLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,A protection that will protect.,19
40,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"That is so. I challenge honourable members in the corner to name one industry that should not be supported by the tariff. Mr E . RILEV - The manufacture of agricultural implements, for instance.",19
41,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"A few years ago honourable members of the Country party, to support their argument, quoted the conditions of New Zealand in relation to agricultural implements. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) in particular gave a glowing account of the advantages that the people of that country enjoyed owing to the low price of agricultural implements. Of late, strange to say, very little or nothing has been said about New Zealand. That country has two now adopted the principle of tariff protection, which applies, among other We should things, to the manufacture of agricultural with implements. Honourable members of the ask Country party are not prepared to admit r . that. Instead of referring t,o New Zealand, they switch off to other countries such as Canada to make comparisons to suit their own purposes. They should act more consistently. They refuse to comthe price of the imported implement prewith that of the locally-made article.",19
42,Mr ABBOTT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I think that we have,19
43,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Honourable members in the corner have religiously refrained fro m or making that comparison. By comparing the two prices the honourable member will find that the Australian implement has the advantage not only in cheapness but also in its durability and its suitability for Australian requirements.,19
44,Mr ABBOTT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,:-Figure s can be produced to prove the contrary.,20
45,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I refer the honourable member to the report of the Tariff Board on agricultural machinery. The Country party, in common with other parties in this Parliament, constituted that board. It has amongst its members a direct representative of the primary producers, and this gentleman has signed the board's report, which states that the Australian made implement is cheaper, more satisfactory, and more adaptable to Australian conditions than is the imported article. Honourable members of the Country party . should use more substantial arguments, and place their feet on firm ground., rather than on the shifting sands trodden by them of recent years. It will be of interest to honourable members to know the number of persona that are employed in the secondary and primary , industries of Australia. There are engaged in primary production-males , 588,310, and females, 10,385, totalling 598,695. There are engaged in industrial institutions-males , 604,676, and females, 118,883, totalling 723,559. These figures show that more persons are engaged in industrial institutions in Australia than in primary production.",20
46,Mr ABBOTT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"In other words, the people are leaving the land for the cities.",20
47,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Not necessarily. It is only the growth of our secondary industries that enables the primary producer to find a profitable market for his produce. According to the latest Year-Book available, the output of factories in Australia in 1923-4 was valued at £348,577,583. The value of the raw material .used in that production was £197,038,726, leaving a balance of £151,538.857, which represents the added created by the factory operation. I now give figures showing the value of primary production in 1923-4. The value of the wheat crop was £29,936,055; pastoral production, which includes wool, skins, &c, £65,.095,676; milk, butter, cheese, bacon, hams, pork, lard, live stock, poultry, eggs, honey, and wax, £42,111,747; fruit, £6,282,552. I do not think that I have left out any important brand of primary production, and the total of the figures I have .given is £143,436,030. So that the value of primary production was in the year referred to, in round figures, £143,000,000, whilst the value added to raw materials by processes of manufacture was £151,000,000.",20
48,Mr ABBOTT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Accordin g to the honourable member's figures, Australia is ceasing to be a primary producing country, and is now a manufacturing country. Does the honourable member agree with that statement?",20
49,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I do not. The statistics published in the Year-Book indicate the growth of both primary and secondary industries. I believe that, because of certain circumstances, primary production has been restricted. The holding of valuable lands out of use by the landed interests, high rents charged for land, and high rates of interest upon advances made to men on the land, result in the restriction of primary production. It is these circumstances, and not the incidence of the tariff, that constitute the burden of the man on the land. I desire to see the secondary industries built up in Australia in order that an adequate home market may be provided for the products of the man on the land. I do not regard either free trade or protection as a panacea for all the ills which civilization is heir to. I recognize that the emancipation of the workers cannot be secured by either free trade or protection, - but at the same time. I believe that it is our duty to maintain the high standard of living^that we have in Australia. That can . only be done by giving effective protection to our industries against imports from countries that have lower standards. I have said that I am sorry that protection for certain industries is not included in the schedule under consideration. I direct attention, first of all, to the industry for value the manufacture of incandescent mantles. The man on the land or in country districts may be seriously concerned by what is happening in this industry. The extended use of electricity, of course, lessens the use of gas mantles, not only in Australia, but in all parts of the world. The Tariff Board considered whether this industry should receive a greater measure of protection, and reported favourably on an increase in the existing duty. The increased protection the board recommended does not appear in this schedule, and I should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to explain why it has been omitted. The Tariff Board was appointed by this Parliament to. advise it as to the industries which should be encouraged aud protected under the tariff. We should be able to look to the Government to give effect to the advice of the board. It has failed to give effect to the board's recom- tribunal. mendations concerning this industry, and there should be some explanation of the failure. Firms engaged in the manufacture of gas mantles in continental countries, where electricity is used to a much greater extent than in Australia, have been dumping their goods into this country. In view of the difference in the standards and ditions of employment in industries in those countries, as compared with those in Australia, - we shall not be doing our duty to Australian industries if we do not protect them against the dumping of goods manufactured abroad. I find that overseas firms engaged in this particular industry employ girls of about fourteen years of age at a wage of from 2Jd. to 6id. per hour. Australian firms carrying on the industry employ no female under 21 years of age* and pay their employees anything from Is. 4d. per hour for their work. Do honourable members opposite contend that we should lower the standard of wages of those engaged in this industry? I feel that there is a desire on the part of some of them to lower the industrial standards of our people,",20
50,Mr STEAVART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I do not think that that is fair. Mr MAKIN"" - I am not referring to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart). If there is a broad minded democrat in the Country party the honourable member is one. I hope that his qualities will be recognized and his example followed by some who claim to be his colleagues today. I had in mind particularly the honourable member for  in dealing with the duties affecting .the primary producer had special reference to the rural workers' log. This suggests that the honourable member does not desire to maintain the standards of conditions aud wages in this country. He desirc3 apparently to lower those standards. The honourable member should recognize that those employed by men engaged in primary industries have a right to some consideration. I . remind him that the rural workers' log does not fix wages and conditions in rural industries, but has to be submitted to the judgment of an independent tribunal, and the wages and conditions to be determined will depend upon the evidence submitted to that The honourable member's remarks indicate that he is agitated in mind about the wages received by rural workers, but improvement in their conditions will lead to improvement in the conditions of those who actually control rural industries.  con- high tariff, by increasing the costs of agricultural industries, led to the rural workers' log, because the employers have no way of passing on their increased costs.",21
51,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"That is not hoAv I understood the honourable member. He seems to rae to have consistently opposed improved conditions for workers in rural industries. He is associated with others in the Country party, who are the most avaricious, greedy, and selfish public men it is possible to find.  honourable member!",21
52,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The honourable member is himself a notable example, because he has secured more than his share of the perks and positions in the gift of this House. The party to which the honourable member belongs has more representation in the Cabinet than its numbers entitle it to, and I marvel that those who constitute the direct following of the Prime Minister are prepared to tolerate its demands. Honourable members of the Country party endeavour on every possible occasion to induce the man on the land to believe that the tariff is the cause of increased prices for the machinery he requires. It will be agreed that engines used for chaff-cutting and pumping are of great value to the agricultural industry, but I find that although an increased duty is proposed upon these engines, it is demonstrated by an advertisement in the Melbourne press that there has been a reduction in the price of the Fairbanks-Morse 10 horsepower "" Z "" engine for chaff-cutting and pumping. If the arguments of honourable members on the Ministerial cross benches count for anything I ask them to explain that fact. Unfortunately, they are not prepared to do justice, but they seek to cloud the fiscal issue and make the man on the land believe that those who support Australian industries are opposed to his welfare. It . was quite refreshing to listen to the speech of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) yesterday. doubt his convictions are based on his experiences as Minister for Trade and Customs, and I believe he correctly interpreted the fiscalviews of the man on the land. His speech should be conned carefully by those other honourable members opposite who claim to represent rural interests. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) last evening regarding the factories engaged in the production of aluminium ware: I visited the factory in the honourable member's constituency, and last week I inspected a similar establishment in my own electorate, and I was astonished at the very efficient methods of production employed in both. Particularly was I impressed with the high standard of the goods they manufacture, aud I regret that the Minister has not recognized the need for giving greater encouragement to this industry. As all Australian industries should do, the aluminium factories are producing goods of the very highest quality.",21
53,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Hear , hear! Honourable members should visit those factories. of the engineering trade.",22
54,Mr MARIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I urge them to do so. Unfortunately, their high-class products have to compete with inferior imports, which enjoy in the Australian markets an advantage they do not deserve. I ask the Minister to give added protection to the aluminiuni industry. By encouraging the production of goods of the very best quality he will be adding to the good name of Australia. Last evening the need for efficiency in industry was emphasized, particularly by some of those honourable members who claim to be ""moderate protectionists,"" but have not explained what they mean by moderation. Efficiency was stressed by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster). No doubt he had in mind the engineering firm of Hawke and Company, of Kapunda, in his own electorate. His knowledge of the very inefficient methods employed by that firm led him to do an injustice to Australian industries generally. At one time 1 worked for Hawke and Company as a patternmaker, and I know something of its lack of organization. Its outstanding characteristic is the manner in which it stands in its own No light, and handicaps itself by out-of-date methods. Unfortunately Kapunda, which is one of the most beautifnl towns in South Australia, and is populated by a very good class of people, experiences only intermittent prosperity because of the operations of this firm. To-day it may be employing a large number of men, but tomorrow, not being able to compete with the more efficient establishments in South Australia and elsewhere, it has to reduce hands, and in consequence depression falls upon the"" town. It is unfortunate that such conditions should exist, but the honourable member for Wakefield is wrong in judging other Australian industries by the standard that obtains in his own district. In contrast to Hawke and Company are such firms as Hadfields, Newcastle S'teeel Products Company, Perry and Sons, Forward Down and Company, Bradshaw, the Austral Otis Company, Thompson, of Castlemaine, and the Clyde Engineering Company. Mr Fenton.:-Do not forget the railway workshops in the various States.",22
55,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"They are the backbone I wish that the South Australian Government would arrange for some firm of repute to take control of the works at Kapunda, and give security to the employees and the townspeople who are. dependent upon their labour. Though honourable, members opposite have spoken of inefficiency in industries they have not advanced any concrete suggestions for the improvement, of existing conditions; all they have done has been to give a bad advertisement to Australia. If we in this Parliament are not prepared to speak well of our own industries and workers, no one else will do so. Mr Fenton.;-Dozen s of British firms have established branches in Australia. Mr MAKIN"" - Mian y Britisli firms have established branches in Australia recently because they realise the value of th© local market and the industry of Australian workmen. We welcome them, and hope that other firms will follow their lead. Certain newspapers, however, are never content unless they are disparaging Australia in the eyes of the world. Last year I saw in a leading journal a cartoon which represented Australia as a mendicant for favours from the United Kingdom. Such misrepresentation is deplorable. Our people have paid to the last farthing for any financial accommodation or trade advantages they have received from the United Kingdom or any other country. Our artisans are as skilled as the workers in any other part of the world, and it would be well if Australian statesmen would realise their duty to their own country and increase the avenues for employment, instead of constantly depreciating the efforts of our people, and declaring that they are unable to produce even their own requirements. I offer no excuse for standing up for the country of my birth. . 1 desire it to progress and prosper, and its people to be peaceful and contented^ and enjoy the highest standards of living. That ideal can be realized only if we adequately protect our industries and uphold the existing wages and conditions of employment, which are better than those that obtain elsewhere. I hope that this schedule will receive the earnest and sympathetic consideration of honourable members, and that justice will be done to all interests. Anomalies in the tariff should be rectified. It is the duty of the Minister to add to the schedule new items which will give relief to industries .that are sadly in need of further""protection. Honourable members should combine to help in every way in the building up of a great and self-reliant nation by the development of our natural resources and the manufacture of our own requirements, thus providing a rich market for those engaged in primary production.",22
56,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Wimmera) [12.29] I listened attentively to the speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and ticularly to his eloquent appeal for the building up of our industries, the improving of the standard of living, and [65] the maintaining of an Australian outlook. With those excellent sentiments I cordially agree. I , too, believe in the upbuilding of Australian industries. I , too, believe that it is the duty of every member of this committee, and of every Australian, to do everything he can to help to make his country great and prosperous, and its inhabitants happy. We can pass a resolution unanimously agreeing with those sentiments providing we can hold our own opinions as to the methods to be adopted to reach the goal; It has been said that protection is the settled policy of this country - Those honourable members in this corner who have had the courage to stand up and combat the demand for continued increases of duties, have been referred to'as "" foreign traders,"" and charged with deliberately endeavouring to lower the standard of living of the workers of this country. I protest against such charges being made, and I think I can speak on behalf of my colleagues in this corner",23
57,Mr FOBJDE,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I do not think so. Mr STEWART I hope I can-al though I do not agree with the views they hold on many things-whe n I say that while honourable members may be entitled to argue that the effect of the fiscal policy we advocate will be to lower the standard of living of the workers, they are unjust in saying that that is our deliberate intention. What do those honourable members mean who claim that protection is the settled policy of this, country? Do they mean that the majority of the people of Australia, having declared for a protection policy, have declared for unlimited protection, or the imposition of prohibitive duties ?",23
58,Mr COLEMAN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,They have declared for fair and adequate protection.,23
59,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,That is another illustration of what I referred to when the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) was speaking. We can all 1 agree to provide fair and adequate protection if we are allowed to place our own interpretation on the meaning of the words. Therein lies the whole difficulty.,23
60,Mr FENTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Protectio n is protection only when it protects.,23
61,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I give the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) par- credit for being at any rate completely consistent on this question, which is more than I can say for some honourable members on his side of the House. . Mr COLEMAN - What of the inconsistency of honourable members in the Ministerial corner!!",23
62,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The charge of inconsistency may perhaps be levelled at some members of this corner, but honourable members opposite should not forget, when they are busy hurling charges of inconsistency at others, that many of them, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton;, are open to the same charge.",24
63,Mr COLEMAN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Will the member give a specific instance?,24
64,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I answer that interjection in one word-explosives .,24
65,Mr COLEMAN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The Leader of the Opposition gave a very satisfactory explanation of that the other evening.,24
66,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"If he has repented, or if his explanation was satisfactory, I did not hear it . '""V . COLEMAN - Does the honourable mep'iber tnink that one departure on the compact. part of a member of this party merits criticism ?",24
67,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"There are other i stances, but the honourable member asked me for one specifically, and I gave i him. I wish to quote some resolutions show that there is a large body of public opinion in this country opposed to continual increase in Customs duties. a meeting of the Victorian Farmers Union in Ballarat yesterday these resoluMinister tions, as reported in the Argus, were passed on the motions of the Warragul and West Wimmera District Councils the unionThat the burden of the tariff on argicultural machinery and other necessaries of life make tinual increase of Customs it impossible for Australian farmers to comthat I considered they pete in the world's markets against those are exempt from this burden, and that Federal Country party give this matter more attention and treat it as of primary ance, with the object of at present lessening these duties, and finally their total abolition. That this conference protests against ' action of the Tariff Board and the Arbitration Court in continually increasing living. Those resolutions were carried at a large conference of delegates of branches of the Victorian Farmers Union from Murray to the sea. They show is a big body of public opinion, right or wrong, which holds views definitely opalone. posed to heavy Customs dnties. agreement between the National party with and the Country party in Western Ausdustry tralia for the conduct of the last election has been quoted, but I shall quote it againThat as the present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two associations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. Tliat as a reduction can only besecured through our parliamentary representatives, neither' party shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement witli this policy. That, subject to the above-mentioned condihonorable tions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to the electors, the Primary Producers' Association is willing to co-operate with the United party of Western Australia in Tunning a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the United party and one representative of the Country party, for the forthcoming Senate elections. 'Ihe team so selected shall receive the endorsement and support of both associations, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association.",24
68,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,That was an immoral,24
69,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Whether it was n - moral or immoral, it was assented to by both political parties. One member of t to the Cabinet, the Minister for Home and to Territories (Senator Pearce) accepted those conditions, nominated under them, the and won his seat under them. He would At not have been returned had he not accepted them. On the other hand, the for Trade and Customs (Mr . Pratten) claims that the election was a victory for the policy of protection. Now of let me refer to my own election pledges. From every election platform I said that I was opposed to the conduties, were the who prime cause of the increase in the the cost of livin g and the cost of production, importthat some industries were taking undue advantage of the excessive duties, and that those who continually clamoured for the high, and still higher duties, ought to say the cost of where the process would end.",24
70,Mr FENTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Did the honourable member say that at Mildura?,24
71,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I did , and I rethe received a five to one vote against my that there opponent in Mildura .",24
72,Mr COLEMAN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Not on that issue The Mr STEWART - No . I shall deal the question of the dried f r u it s in and its relation to the fiscal issue presently, because I wish to reply to the gibe of the Minister for Trade and Customs when he referred to me as "" the dried f r u it s protectionist."" No one knows better than he when he is criticizing other people that he is not immune from criti cism himself. In introducing this schedule he painted a rosy picture of the effects of it . He stated that it had already had beneficial effects in building up industries, and throughout his speech he seemed to adopt the view that the imposition of duties, by curtailing imports, would build up local industries. It was mainly for that reason that he asked honourable members to support the schedule. My 'mind went back to his predecessor, Senator Massy Greene, who introduced the tariff schedule of 1920. That schedule provided for substantial increases, and the Minister, in introducing it , painted exactly the same rosy picture as the present Minister painted.",24
73,Mr COLEMAN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Since that time have not exchanges depreciated and wages been reduced?,25
74,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"No w we have the excuses. I shall quote from the speech of the then Minister for Customs when the 1920 tariff was introduced. During the Minister's speech, Mr Austin Chapman interjected, '""'Will the Minister say what he expects will be the effect of the tariff on the revenue ?"" To that the Minister repliedTlie Treasurer believes that in the immediate future he will probably get a little more revenue than he has been receiving in the past, but my belief is that it will not be very long before there will be a reduced revenue fromCustoms and Excise duties as the result of this tariff.",25
75,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The same thing has been, said in every financial statement that has been presented to us during the last five years.",25
76,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"In that case, I shall give the exact figures which I have obtained from the Customs Department. In 1921-2-the first year during which the new duties operated-the Customs revenue, apart from excise, £17,328,310. By the year 1922-3 it had increased to £22,597,306; in the following year it was £25,177,822; it rose to £27,299,864 in 1924-5. For the period from 1«* July, 1925, to 28th January, 1926, the amount received totalled £16,558,138, or £664,638 in excess of the amount received for the same period of the previous year.",25
77,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Will the honourable member give the figures for excise ako?,25
78,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The receipts from excise have remained practically stationary, the amount being approximately £10,000,000 per annum. There has been no corresponding increase in the excise as compared with the Customs duties.",25
79,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"H as the honourable member compared the figures for 1920-1, the year before the new duties operated, with those for 1921-2 ",25
80,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"No . The first year for which figures, under the new rates, are obtainable is 1921-2.",25
81,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,What was the amount before those duties were imposed? That would be a better basis of comparison.,25
82,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I think not. The proper way is to show the increase under the tariff schedule which the then Minister predicted would have the effect of reducing the Customs duties. When the present Minister made his rosy prediction of the beneficial effect of this tariff he was only following the example of his predecessor, who spoke similarly regarding a previous tariff. I remember well the eloquent peroration with which Mr . Greene concluded what was admittedly a fine speech. I shall read it for the benefit of honourable members. We stand on the threshold of great developments. The door of opportunity is open widely for us. The path beyond lies clear and plain if we have only the courage to tread it and put our country's interest before otlier considerations, bending to no influence, yielding to no pressure, and refusing to be diverted one hairsbreadth from our purpose, pressing on in our endeavour to lead our country to the goal of national greatness. If we have only the courage to do this, besides rendering a great service to our country, we shall also buttress that Empire of which we form a part, by building up in this great southern land a nation furnished with all that is needed to make it self-contained and truly great. That was in 1920. What is the position was in 1926 ? We are told today that our in dustries are languishing, that our workmen are walking the streets, that foreign imports' are greater than ever. If that is the result of the increase of duty in 1921, what guarantee can the Minister give us that the duties about to be imposed in 1926 will not have the same effect? The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), during the course of this debate, quoted some elaborate statistics, but I have been unable to determine what they had to do with the subject under consideration. He presented figures to show the expansion which had taken place in agriculture since the last tariff came into operation. He referred to the wheat yield, and the number of eggs laid, and quoted figures from the Commonwealth Year-Booh to prove that agriculture had expanded under protection. I shall quote from the same volume to show that it has not. I shall not, ever, weary the House with so many details. On page 243 of the Commonwealth Year-Book for 1925 we find that the total primary produce exported in 1913' was valued at £72,833,454; that in 1922-3 the amount had increased to £110,636,535, with a further increase to £111,898,488 in 1923-4. That appears to show that progress has been made; but if we eliminate price changes, an entirely different story is told. The figures from 1913 remain as before, namely, £72,833,454. By 30th June, 1923, the value of the primary produce exported had fallen to £70,146,692; and in the following year a further reduction to £64,106,932 took place. .",25
83,Mr EOBOTB,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"What about the expansion of secondary industries, and thegreater local consumption?",26
84,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I shall deal with that later.,26
85,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Will the honourable member tell us whether the volume of business increased; will he give the number of bushels of wheat, or tons of butter?",26
86,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The value of our exports is the best basis of comparison.,26
87,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The best test is the total production in volume, not the value of the exports.",26
88,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I challenge that as being the best basis of test. A man does not base his agricultural operations upon the number of bushels of wheat that he will grow, but upon the value of that wheat when grown.",26
89,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Expansio n can be tested by volume, but not by value. We cannot control value.",26
90,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Does the right honourable member suggest that overseas prices have not varied since 1913 ?,26
91,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,It is because they have varied that I suggest that figures showing value are unreliable as a test of the expansion of any industry.,26
92,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I have not studied the question from that aspect; but shall do so during the luncheon adjournment, after which I shall be able to reply to the honourable member's contention. Let me now quote from the same table the figures ih connection with manufactures. In. 1913 the value of the manufactured goods exportedfrom Australia was how- £2,304,693. At the end of ten years the value of our manufactured exports had increased to £4,114,774, and during the year 1923-4 there was a further increase to £4,264,057. Eliminating price'changes in this connection also, we get the following figures, namely, 1913, as before, £2,304,693; 1922-3, £1,912,959; and for 1923-4, £2,160,110. The figures for 1923-4 exceed those for 1922-3 by £247,151; but as compared with 1913 they show a decrease of £144,583. .",26
93,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The best test is not the value of the goods exported, but the quantity produced.",26
94,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Thos e figures also are obtainable from the Commonwealth Year-Book. My point is that, under a protective tariff, our manufactured exports have not increased, although there has been a tremendous increase in the volume of manufacturing production. The whole of the increased production has been consumed locally; our secondary industries are not competing in the markets of the world.",26
95,Unknown,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Sitting suspended from 12.59 to 2.15 p.m.,26
96,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"When we adjourned I . was endeavouring, to show that since the imposition of the 1920 tariff, the exportation of primary products had declined; and in support of that contention I quoted certain figures. Instead of quoting those figures, the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) suggested that I should quote figures dealing with the volume of trade. I do not know whether I have made myself sufficiently clear, but I might explain that the last figures that I quoted eliminated price changes. This, to my mind, does, in effect, give the volume of trade.",26
97,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Will the honourable member now quote figures relating to the home market?,27
98,Mr STEWAET,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,No .,27
99,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Why not?,27
100,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Firs t of all the home market figures have been quoted not by one speaker, but at least by half a dozen, who have dealt full y with the subject, and proved, at any rate to their own satisfaction,. and certainly not to mine, that the primary industries have expanded.",27
101,Mr MAKIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Does not the honourable member think that it would be fair to place the home market figures alongside the export figures?,27
102,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I assure the honourable member that I am not purposely avoiding doing so, but as other speakers have avoided the export tradethis being the first time that these figures have been quoted- I am now putting that side of the case.",27
103,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Is not the honourable member merely carefully selecting his facts 1,27
104,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"If I am, I am following the lead already given, not by one speaker, but by at least a dozen. I am quoting figures to show that by the imposition of higher duties under the 1921 tariff, our export trade in primary produce has been adversely affected.",27
105,Mr MAXWELL,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Does the member attribute that to the tariff?,27
106,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I attribute it to'the tariff amongst other things. In view of those figures no advocate of high protection can say that the imposition of the extra duties in 1921 has fostered our export trade in primary produce. same applies to our manufacturing exports. Taken on the 1913 prices, we are exporting less .today than - we were in that year.",27
107,Mr WEST,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,A Labour Government was in power in 1913.,27
108,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"-There again my honourable friend brings in the old party contention. I have quoted figures to show that importations this year were greater, so far as value of receipts was concerned, than they were in 1920-21. There has been an increase in value during each successive year since 1920-21. I assume that the volume of importations today is greater inasmuch as prices for Customs taxation purposes were, owing to the abnormal post-war conditions, higher in 1920-22 than they are today. It seems to me that the tariff has failed to develop the manufacturing export trade.",27
109,Mr SCULLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The t a r if f was not designed for the export trade.,27
110,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"That is an important admission by the honourable member. The Minister, when speaking, said that we had to export goods worth between £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 annually. The right honourable member for Balaclava in terjected, "" Or else borrow it . "" No country can live alone, in spite of all the talk about making Australia a self-contained nation. One country must trade with others. Our position today is that we must export between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 worth of goods. I leave alone the question of borrowing, because few honourable members, if any, would advocate the continuance of borrowing overseas as a means of stabilizing our financial position. Therefore, we must export between - £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 worth of goods from this country. If , as the honourable member for Yarra says, this tariff is not designed to facilitate the export of manufacturing products, then I take it that the primary industries of this country must bear the sole burden of equalizing our financial position. That is a very important adhonorable mission by the honourable member for Yarra.",27
111,Mr SCULLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,There is nothing wrong with if .,27
112,Mr RODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"No tariff in the world is imposed for the purpose of creating export trade. The Mr STEWART - V e r y good; the tariff then, is not designed to facilitate export trade. Mr Rodgers.'- I explained the other night that the purpose of all our reciprocal tariffs was to help the primary industries.",27
113,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"If this tariff is not designed to facilitate export trade, and does not do it , we must ask ourselves whether it harms our export trade in primary produce. If by increasing duties it increases the cost of living and the cost of production, rendering it more difficult for our primary industries to compete in the markets of the world-and these in dustries, according to the honourable member for Yarra, have to bear the whole burden of keeping us financially sound, then we have made out a prima facie case that this tariff is not in the best interests of Australia.",27
114,Mr SCULLIN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Exceptin g that the honourable member is assuming that, in protecting our industries and building them up, we increase the cost of living.",28
115,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"To answer the honourable member, I shall deal with the point raised by the Minister by interjection in regard to the dried-fruits industry. The following is an extract from a speech that I delivered in this chamber. on the 28th August, 1924, comparing the costs of production in the dried-fruits industry in 1912 and 1922-4: I shall now read some tables compiled by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, which give comparative costs of production in respect of 15-acre blocks; and though I consider that all the figures are on the low side, they are of value, in that they provide a fair basis for comparison. The tables are as follow:I then gavefiguresrelating to the cost and value of production, showing that the cost of a 15-acre block in 1912 was £1,025, and in 1922-4 £1,880. In other words, the average cost of development per acre was £68 6s. 8d. in 1912, and £125 6s. 8d. in 1922-4.",28
116,Mr MAXWELL,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Is that from the time of purchase until the block comes into bearing ?,28
117,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The figures relate to the clearing and developing of a virgin block.,28
118,Mr MAXWELL,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,U p to what stage?,28
119,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"U p to production stage. These are some of the items:House and outbuildings, £150 in 1912, and £250 in 1922-4; raoks and harvesting materials, £40 in 1912, and £80 in 1922-4; stock and implements, plough cultivator, and tools, £17 in 1912, and £40 in 1922-4; lorry and harness, £25 in 1912, and £60 in 1922-4. Those are the costs of development and, as I have said, the figures were compiled by the Victorian Rivers and Water Supply Commission, which is responsible for the settling of thousands of returned soldiers on dried fruits areas in ""Victoria, and is in a better position than any other authority I know to give reliable information. Now, as to the costs of production on a 15-acre block for a 1 ton per acre crop in 1912 and 1924. The figures cover expenditure for living, harvesting-additiona l labourmanure aud spraying material, horse feed, repairs, water and shire rates, depreciation on stock, implements, and vineyard, and interest. The total expenditure in 19.12 was £317, and in 1924 it had risen to £555. Mr E. RILEY - Was that due to the tariff?",28
120,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I am showing that the cost of production went up considerably.,28
121,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"In every part of the world, and not only in Australia. We have to thank the war chiefly for that. Mr E. RILEY - Price s have gone up too.",28
122,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"My figures show that the average cost of production per acre was £21 2s. 8d. in 1912, and had increased to £37 in 1924. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) suggests that whilst the cost of production was increased the settlers received an increased price for their dried fruits to compensate them. The average sweatbox price to the grower, which is the price of the fruit in the rough, before being graded and cleaned, was £39 12s. 6d. per ton between 1907 and 1914, to meet a production cost of £21 2s. 8d. The average sweat-box price to the grower was estimated for 1924, though I believe that less was actually received, at £28 6s. 8d. per ton, and that was to meet a production cost of £37.",28
123,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The honourable member's figures show that we need a home market for the growers of dried fruits.,28
124,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I am quoting this particular industry because it had a good home market, but under the repatriation activities of the various governments there has been a tremendous expansion of the industry.",28
125,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"And the party the honourable member supports wishes to put £34,000,000 more into it.",28
126,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I am speaking against time, and I should be glad if the honourable gentleman did not further interrupt me. The point I am trying to make is that the so-called expansion of primary production is quoted by advocates of a high tariff in support of high protection. They have carefully omitted to mention that tens of millions sterling - have been spent in repatriation operations by the various State Governments of Australia. Just what is the total amount so expended I am not in a position to say, but it could be easily ascertained, and it must reach an enormous sum. That has been a big factor in the increase of production, which has not been due to any alteration of our protective duties. The dried fruits industry has to meet extra costs of production, which include wages. The growers are exporting from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of their total crop, and have to compete in the world's markets. It has been said again and again, and I do not hesitate to repeat it once more, because it cannot be repeated too often, that whilst the growers' costs of production are fixed, and cannot be avoided, their receipts are governed by the world's market rates, and their output is brought into competition with the output of cheap-labour Mediterranean countries. The precarious position of the dried-fruits industry is indicated by the fact that in 1924-this Parliament passed a Dried Fruits Advances Act to help the unfortunate growers. The advances were to be subject to repayment with interest from sales of dried fruits by the growers in 1925 after costs of production had been ascertained. We now have a proposal from the Government that if after costs of production the receipts are shown to be insufficient for the repayment of the advances the repayment is to be extended over the 1926 crop, and, if necessary, over the crop of 1927. I ask the question: Where is all this going to end? The working man is benefited to but a very little extent by the increased costs of production. I admit that there have been some exceptions. His representatives in this House advocate high tariff duties because of their desire to raise the standard of living. They do not in this way raise the standard of living of the worker. What happens is that prices are raised andthen wages are raised. value of wages is not their amount but what they will buy. To-day we have a vicious circle of rising costs all around, and the only remedy proposed is to put more bricks on our tariff wall. In the circumstances, honourable members are entitled to ask the advocates of high protection: Where is it going to end? We have, been told that high duties are necessary to enable us to develop industries in this country, and when they are developed the duties may be repealed and the industries will be able to compete without protection. The experience of America is quoted.' We are told that duties which were imposed there on agricultural implements are now being wiped out. What has been our experience in this country? I challenge any one to contradict me when I say that our experience in this country is that when so-called struggling industries grow bigger they ask for higher and Still higher duties. The Minister made a very important admission. He stated that industries have not only birth pains, but when they are established develop growing pains. That is a very significant admission. It would appear that the Minister has abandoned the old idea that tariff duties are necessary only for the establishment of industries, and that when they are established the duties may be removed. He admits that after industries have become established they develop growing pains, and he considers it the duty of Parliament to relieve those growing pains by more and still more protection. Not only are organized manufacturers in this country using all their influence to raise the tariff wall higher, but we have organized labour joining with them. These are strange bedfellows.",28
127,Mr FENTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The honourable member and his friends have the organized importers behind them, who pay out their money, too.",29
128,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I have heard honourable members opposite talking about solidarity. There were certain incidents connected with the passing of the 1920 tariff, and I venture to predict that in the ensuing weeks we shall again find representatives of organized labour and organized capital joining together and giving the finest exhibition of solidarity The that any honourable member could wish lo see. I ask the representatives of organized labour in this chamber to consider whether they are not making a mistake. When they find the representatives of the combines which they condemn so eloquently, the manufacturers, and waterers of stock, joining solidly together and using their influence inside and outside of this chamber to pile on more duties, are. not the representatives of organized labour in this House making a mistake when they rush to the aid of these people?",29
129,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I confess that when we see them finding the funds for the election of honourable members' opposite we have some doubts about them.,30
130,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"It is not often that I defend the interests of big business this country against the charges of honourable members opposite, but I must acquit them of the charge of having supplied me with funds to contest my elecreductions, tion. They have not been guilty whatever else they may be guilty of. In addition to the pressure brought to bear by manufacturers to raise our still higher, there has developed a position which is significant and highly dangerous. I quote from the Morning Post of the 27th January lastIMPORTED MATERIAL DECLARED BLACK. Support for Australian industries was given by the Blacksmiths Union at its annual ing on Monday night. The union decided to endorse the recommendation of the Iron Trades Council as follows:""That all imported material for tanks, gas meters, &c, that could' be manufacwere tured here be declared black."" That indicates a very serious state affairs. If , in addition to the pressure exerted by organized capital to pile up these duties, trade unionists are to a boycott of this character, where will the community land itself? This is a development which all persons who not blinded by prejudice and self-interest must regard with concern. The continual increasing of duties, makes easier the portation of foreign goods in spite the tariff wall, and makes it more diffiturn cult for the secondary industries to compete with them, and for the primary inprovide dustries to continue.",30
131,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,How can higher duties make the position of the importer easier?,30
132,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The higher duties are designed to increase prices. Inevitinstances ably an increase in prices is followed an increase in wages. The increase of primary producer. wages means greater cost of production, and that obviously renders it easier the foreigner to compete in our market.",30
133,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The logical development of the honourable member's argument is asked to pay protectionist prices and Aus ""lower the duties and imports will tralian cease.""",30
134,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The lower the duties, the lower the cost of living. lower the cost of living, the cheaper cost of production. Therefore, the defence against foreign competition is not to be found, in piling higher and still higher the tariff duties, because every addition to-the tariff wall is followed by increased cost of living, and production. Then up goes the tariff and wages, and in the vicious circle starts again.",30
135,Mr RODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,This schedule provides for the reduction of many duties.,30
136,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"It provides for some but the general tendency is of that, to increase duties.",30
137,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"If the honourable member's arguments are true, why put a duty ""of tariff wall 3d. a lb. on butter?",30
138,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Until recently, when the dairymen took action in their own defence, the duty on butter did not operate, except in time of drought. It was something like the duty on wheat.",30
139,Mr RODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Ne w Zealand butter meetwas imported at certain seasons.,30
140,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Yes . A duty was imposed on wheat many years ago, but the only years in which it could have operated 1902 and 1914, when Australia experienced droughts, and then the Governof ment removed the duty so that cheap wheat could be obtained from abroad. Therefore, that duty has given no protecto resort tion to the wheat-growers.",30
141,Mr RODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The honourable member is very logical, but is there any duty on are primary products that the honourable member would remove or reduce ?",30
142,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,That interjection im-. involves a consideration of the general of effect of duties on primary products. I back to the duties on dried fruits.,30
143,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,Stic k to them; they the best case the honourable member can have.,30
144,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,I am glad to have the admission of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that there are in which a good case can be by made out for the protection of the,30
145,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The trouble is that too for many people are engaged in the production of dried fruits.,30
146,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The producers are r fixed rates of wages in respect of 100 per cent, of their production, but having to sell 75 per cent, of their proThe duce in the markets of the world, they the receive Australian prices for only 25 per cent. I think that if all the tariff burdens were removed from their shoulders, or, alternatively they were allowed a rebate of all duties in respect of the 75 percent, of their produce which is exported, those engaged in the industry would be glad to forgo the duties on dried fruits.'",30
147,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The whole trouble is that they produce 75 per cent, more than the local market can consume, and they cannot compete in foreign markets with the product of cheap-labour countries. But they cannot expect Australian wages and living standards to come down to the level of those in competing countries.",31
148,Mr EODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,All the land industries enjoy a protected home market. Would the honourable member remove any of the duties on primary products?,31
149,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The gibe is often hurled at honourable members who sit in this corner of the chamber that they advocate the imposition of duties on what their constituents produce, and oppose protection of the products of other industries.",31
150,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,There is some truth in that charge.,31
151,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"There is, for this reason: The duties already imposed have increased the cost of production in primary industries, and two schools of thought have developed amongst the representatives of those industries. That is why we are twitted with having contradictory fiscal views. One school of thought, to which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and Forrest  up of duties on all commodities is wTong, inasmuch as if the duties on butter, meat, and other primary products are increased, and Australian prices are paid for Australian goods, the troubles of the primary producer do not end, because immediately the cost of living rises, wages increase, the cost of production becomes higher, and his second condition becomes worse than the first. The other school of thought contends that if the 'primary producer is to be required to. pay protectionist prices for the tools - of production, his best means of self-preservation is to make the community pay protectionist prices for butter, meat, wheat, and other products of the-soil.",31
152,Mr RODGERS,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"A Nationalist government imposed the duties on primary products, and I again ask the honourable member if he wishes to disturb any of them. [66]",31
153,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I think the majority of the primary producers would have been prepared to stand pat on the tariff of 1914. They would have said, "" If this represents the l i m it of the duties on manufactured articles, and we are not to be further burdened in respect of wages, we shall not ask for increased duties on primary products.""",31
154,Mr WATT,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"In other words, they are protectionists at a price.",31
155,Mr FORDE,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,The Queensland primary producers do not agree with the honourable member.,31
156,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"And I do not agree with them. If the duty on butter is in creased in order that the local industry may be established, and then Parliament increases the duty on agricultural implements, fertilizers, and other requirements of the dairy farmeT-if in return for the increased price he gets for his butter he has to bear additional imposts on his own purchases, the protection afforded him i removed, and he is entitled to resist a further impositions. Speaking on the formal motion for adjournment last week, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) referred to the prices of - agricultural implements. He said that a 1,280-acres Mallee farm would have about £ 6 0 0 worth of implements, exclusive of wagons. _ I do not know from what, source the Minister obtained the information. A Mallee farm of 1,280 acres cannot be worked with £ 6 0 0 worth of implements. On my own f a rm of 600 acres, the plant, although not unnecessarily extensive, is worth more than that sum. Indeed, on occasions I am obliged to hire or borrow implements. The Minister also made a wonderful mathematical calculation that the increased price of £600 worth of implements, because of the operation of the tariff, was equal to only 2s. a week. It was a strange and wonderful calculation, and he based it on an assumed l if e for implements of fifteen years. I do not know where he obtained his figures, but I suggest that he should carpet the individual who gave them to him . The T a r i ff Board did not make the same blunder; it had sufficient knowledge to mention only ten years as the l if e of agricultural implements in the Mallee. If the Minister will go into the rough, stump-jump country of the Mallee and talk to the farmers there about implements like reapers and binders lasting for fifteen years, he will make himself ridiculous..  ber's view is correct the figure of -2s. should be increased to 3s.",31
157,Mr STEWART,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Then why did the Minister make the calculation on the basis of 2s. ? Progress reported. POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL. In committee (Consideration resumed from. 15th January, vide page 134): Clause 1 (Short title).  Trade and Customs) [3.2] - Upon this clause may be based a few additional remarks relating to the principle of the bill: Honourable members will recollect that this bill was fully discussed about nine months ago, and again in January last. Consideration was then, by mutual consent, deferred until the report of the Public Accounts Committee on this important subject had been made available. The committee has now reported, and its report has been printed, and is in the hands of honourable members.",32
158,Mr MANN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"No . That is the trouble.  the needs of honourable members by readmost probable."" ing those parts of the report that relate to the bill. The report statesReviewing the evidence heard concerning the possibilities of various starch-bearing the committee considers that there is for doubt as to whether such crops can be grown at a price which will permit of their being utilized for the production of alcohol on a commercial basis. Cassava, however, appears to be the most favourable of these crops, provided it can be successfully cultivated at a reasonable cost in the tropical parts of the Commonwealth. Owing to the fact that the cultivation of this crop has not been hitherto attempted on a commercial scale in Australia, no evidence is yet available on which accurate costs of production, its yield per acre, or the alcohol contents of Australian-grown cassava can be based. The experiments with cassava now being conducted in Queensland will no doubt give useful information, which will form a valuable guide for the future. The committee also submits valuable information on the production of power alcohol from molasses, and gives a very practical lead to those interested, among .them"" myself, in the manufacture of power alcohol from prickly pear. It recommendsThat a qualified person, unbiased by preconceived ideas as to the possibilities of prickly pear for power alcohol production, should be appointed to fully investigate the process and subject it to a technical and critical examination, with a view to determining the extent to which the project should be helped if the claims are substantiated. I have done something in this direction already, and assure honourable members, who are all keenly interested in this great national question, that the suggestions of the committee will be followed up so far as my department can do that. The report deals also with the production of shale oil, liquid fuels, and benzol, but the matter now under discussion is the production of power alcohol from starchbearing plants. The committee points to the great potentialities of molasses as a material for the manufacture of power alcohol. Partly, if not wholly, as a result of the committee's inquiries, I am in the pleasingposition of being able to inform the committee that it is most probable that two more distilleries will be erected at an early date, at Babinda and Mulgrave, in northern Queensland, to utilize the waste of the sugar mills of those districts for the production of power alcohol.",32
159,Mr FORDE,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"The Minister says "" it is Can he furnish the committee with anything authentic ?  crops, cutting from the Sydney Morning Herald room of about six weeks ago, which reads- - Cairns, Sunday. An important decision regarding the manufacture of power alcohol from the by-products of sugar-cane has been reached by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee. The decision marks a definite step towards the early realization of the project, and, it is understood, will result in a power alcohol distillery being erected at the Mulgrave Mill this year to cope with the molasses output of two or - three local mills. - An important feature of the decision is the alliance with the International Sugar and Alcohol Company, a large British firm now operating in the Mackay district for the distillation of power ' alcohol from cassava and molasses. The. distillery at Cairns is expected to be the forerunner of others on the Tully River, the Burdekin River, and other sugar mill centres. The decision of the Power Alcohol Committee to co-operate with the British company has met with a favourable reception on all sides in local sugar circles. Mr Boardj the representative of the British company, will visit Cairns next month. It is confidently expected that the growers ait the two local mills-Babind a and Mulgrave-wil l fully endorse the Power Alcohol Committee's proposals, and agree to finance the first distillery at the Mulgrave Mill. The main points of the committee's report are-'That no difficulty is anticipated in the manufacture of power alcohol from molasses; that the Northern Power Alcohol Commitee's scheme for Mulgrave alone would produce 60,000 gallons of power alcohol per week, and, if Babinda joined' in, this quantity would be doubled; that the consumption of motor spirit in the Cairns district is 100,000 gallons weekly; that, after very careful inquiry and investigation, the committee is convinced that, in view of the diverse and numerous obstacles associated with marketing which would have to be overcome, it is not considered advisable at this stage to risk the ultimate ""success of the whole of the northern movement; that the consensus of opinion 'is that an effort should be made to associate the movement witli the International Sugar and Alcohol Company Limited and the Plane Creek Alcohol Company Limited, Mackay; that, with this object in view, arrangements have been made with Mr. Board to visit Cairns in March to discuss details of the proposed arrangements; that, if these arrangements are to be carried through successfully, they will, of course, be connected with a sugar mill, and every opportunity will be afforded to try out Mr Seymour Howe's scheme of utilizing syrups, which the committee is convinced merits a proper trial; and that, in view of the foregoing and pending further developments, it has been decided for the present to defer approaching the Federal Government further for its aid by way of bounty or other economic assistance. That article is confirmed by a telegram I received from Mr Draper, the chairman of the Northern Power Alcohol Committee. During the debate on this bill several honourable members asked what the Government purposed to do with the scheme evolved by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee. Mr Draper's telegram, dated the 12th February, readsNorthern Power Alcohol Committee withdraw application at present for further extension of bounty. Committee co-operating with Mr Board. Mr Board is the representative of the Distillers' Company, which is putting machinery into the Plane Creek M ill . As a result of the discussions in this House, and the investigations . of the Public Accounts Committee and the Tariff Board, a definite organization is being created under this bill for growing cassava as a subsidiary raw material for the manufacture of .power alcohol. The Overseas Distillery Company is co-operating with the Plane Creek M ill , to which the Queensland Government has made an advance, and with the Northern Power Alcohol Committee which is erecting distilleries farther north. Should these schemes be given effect, and I believe the y will , sufficient power alcohol will eventually be produced in Queensland to largely meet the needs of that State. The Government's assistance has been called for only in the direction of assisting the growth of cassave on a commercial basis, so as to ascertain, in the large area that is suitable for cassava-growing in Queensland, whether that crop can be grown on a large commercial scale to supply, another material from our own soil for the manufacture of the power alcohol so urgently required in this country. The money has been advanced by the Queensland Government for the building, and the necessary machinery is being installed by the new company which has been formed under Australian direction. F a it h will be kept by the committee by the passing of this bill which, in place of its present title, could as well be intituled, "" A bill for an act to encourage the cultivation of cassava."" *",32
160,Mr MANN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,What does the Minister mean by keeping f a it h ? W it h whom have we to keep faith?  that the Government will keep f a it h .,33
161,Mr MANN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Has an undertaking been given ?  Government has introduced is a considered measure which has as its object the. encouragement of the manufacture of power alcohol in Australia. The Government believes that the principle underlying the b i ll is sound; that this legislation will mark the beginning of a big national project. I ask the Hou3e to pass the bill as it stands. In order to encourage the growth of cassava, a bounty is necessary. I point out that 6,000,000 tons of cassava are grown in Java annually. If a similar quantity of cassava could be converted into power alcohol in Australia, we should not have to import one gallon of petrol, except for mixing purposes. I submit the bill with the assurance that, so far as investigation, care in preparation, and the outlook for power alcohol are concerned, it deserves the approval of the House.",33
162,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Hunter ) [3.18] I am not opposed to this bill , the object of which is to encourage the cultivation of cassava, and the production of liquid f u e l ; but I object to the' manner in which it has been presented. This subject has been before us on former occasions; we dealt with it nine months ago. The debate was then adjourned to enable the Public Accounts Committee to complete its investigations, so that honourable members might have the benefit of their recommendation to assist them, in arriving at a decision. I complain that this measure has been introduced hurriedly today. It was not until after the luncheon adjournment that I was informed by the Minister that he intended to move at 3 o'clock that progress be reported in connection with the debate on the tariff, in order that this bill might be introduced. At that time. I anticipated that before the bill came before us copies of the report of the Public Accounts Committee would have been available to all honourable members. That report is fore us, and it is, therefore, unfair to ask us to deal with this measure now. Of what use is it to ask the Public Accounts Committee to advise the House regarding the manufacture of power alcohol from cassava, if we are to deal with this bill before that report is in our hands ? It is not sufficient for the M in i ster to read extracts fro m the findings of the committee.  the report was not in the hands of honourable members. I have had a copy for a week.",33
163,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"I feel that I have a right to protest. Honourable members should have had the report before this bill was introduced. I , as Leader of the Opposition, should certainly have been supplied with one. ",34
164,Mr CHARLTON,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"Who is responsible? When this question was before us formerly there was a difference of opinion among honourable members, and for that reason it was decided to await the report of the Public Accounts Committee. The committee has now presented its report, but it is not yet in the hands of honourable members. In its absence honourable members have nothing to guide them, and they are not justified in passing this measure. Whoever is responsible for introducing this legislation at this juncture has made a mistake. I have .risen only to enter my protest against this bill being dealt with at this stage. Now that the Public Accounts Committee has presented its report there is no reason why we should not wait another two or three days to enable honourable members to peruse it . We have already waited nine months for the report. Although the amount involved in this bill is £25,000 only, there is a distinct difference of opinion regarding the bill. I remember that when it was before us last the debate was keen. I want to assist the Government to establish the power alcohol industry, but I contend that before we deal with this measure the whole of the information available, especially that collected by the Public Accounts Committee, at some expense to the country, should be placed before us.",34

Honourable members are aware that I have taken a keen interest in this subject, and that previously I have discussed it at some length. During the last Parliament I moved for the appointment of a select committee to investigate the many points raised. My motion was not agreed to, as it was understood that the Public Accounts Committee had already inquired into the same matter, and had practically exercised the functions of a select committee. The committee has now completed its investigation and has submitted its report. But , as the Leader of the Opposition has stated, that report is not in the hands of honourable members. At a late hour last night I discovered that a few advanced copies were available. Mr CHAKI / TON - I haye not received a copy yet.",34
166,Mr MANN,DUTIES ON POTATOES AND,"T h r o u g h the courtesy of officers of the House I obtained a copy of the report last night, but I understand that honourable members generally have not seen it .

I had no suspicion that the Minister would introduce this bill u n t i l honourable members had had an opportunity to peruse the committee's report.

I take exception to the manner in which the business of this House is being carried out. The least the Government could have done was to consult me regarding an alteration of procedure. I was under the impression that we were to continue the discussion of the tariff, and was greatly surprised when other business was called upon. The purpose of this bill is to validate certain refunds of income taxation, I have had no time to study it.  for Yarra (Mr Scullin) debatedthe measure at length.",35
169,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Many honourable members have done so. Surely I should know when it is intended to discuss new business.

I know that the Leader of the Opposition was not in the House during the whole of the debate on the bill; but it was discussed at length by members of his own party. It certainly did not occur-to me that it was necessary to inform him of the Government's intention to bring on this measure.",35

172,Mr BRUCE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I want the Leader of the Opposition to free me from any suggestion of discourtesy towards him. When new measures are to be introduced, requiring, perhaps, a second-reading speech by the Leader of the Opposition, I agree that the Government should give him due notice of its intentions. This measure, and the preceding one, were placed on the top of the notice-paper yesterday, with a view to bringing them on today. The Government requires their early passage in order to provide another place with work.",35

But this measure has been so fully debated that it did not occur to me to tell the Leader of the Opposition that it might come on for discussion this afternoon.",35
175,Mr CHARLTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I accept the explanation given by the Prime Minister. It was my duty to protest against the procedure that was taken, because, after all, we as an Opposition must conserve our rights. In view of the statement by the Prime Minister, we are prepared to continue the discussion of the measure.",35
176,Mr MAKIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hindniarsh) [3.35] - I regret that at this stage honourable members . should be required to discuss the bill. I feel that some little notice should be given to us when legislation of this description is likely to come before us for consideration. Nevertheless, the valuable information imparted to honourable members by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) in his second.reading speech has enabled many Of us to form a definite and accurate opinion concerning this class of legislation. The Government cannot take any pride or satisfaction in the introduction of this measure. Its purpose, at least, demonstrates the ineptitude of previous governments of the same political faith. It is also a reflection upon the counsels upon whose advice the Government acted when the original measure was introduced. It is strange that when refunds of taxation are made .by the Government they invariably benefit the wealthy classes, while the great body of the taxpayers are subjected to the pains and penalties of the law for any attempt to evade their taxes.",36
177,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is that statement fair, considering that we have raised the exemption from £200 to £300?",36
178,Mr MAKIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That exemption was an insignificant factor in comparison with the liberal and substantial refunds of taxation made to the wealthy classes. This bill is designed to annul legislation that was introduced into this Parliament by a Labour Government in 1915. A change of government took place, and, of course, a change of view. The Labour party, in introducing the original legislation, acted on the advice of learned counsel. This Government has no justification for granting these refunds of taxation. The decision given by the High Court in the Webb case was in respect of one company only, the South Broken H i ll Proprietary Limited. That company had been reconstructed, and the point at issue was the taxation of the old company's profits, which had been distributed as shares to the shareholders in the new company. The Government took the view that the interpretation then given by the High Court governed all bonus shares distributed from profits, and that refunds of taxation on those shares should be made retrospective to 1915. I understand that the Commissioner of Taxation would not accept the responsibility of making the refunds. The Government accepted the doubtful advice of counsel, and made the refunds from revenue. It has refused to divulge the opinion, and also the name, of that counsel. The people of this country have a right to know his name and what advice was tendered by him to the Government. Surely the amount involved under this legislation should be made known to the . committee. A quarter or even three-quarters of a million of money may be involved. The Government has told us that as refunds of taxation were made to certain persons on account of the judgment of the High Court in the ""Webb case, it would be unfair to oblige the taxpayers to return the money because of the later High Court decision in the James case. I contend that taxes which are legally imposed ought to be paid. It is quite possible that when we are asked to deal with subsequent legislative proposals by the Treasurer, we shall be asked to discard the premises on which he has based this bill. Personally, I am opposed to retrospective legislation, generally speaking. As a rule it is unpopular - iver y much so when it deals with taxation. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) endeavoured to obtain an assurance from the Treasurer that in the future accumulated or current profits that were distributed in the shape of bonus share's would be taxed, but the Treasurer evaded the question. His non-committal reply showed the weakness of his case. If profits are distributed in dividends they are taxable, and it seems to me to be undesirable that persons should be able to avoid taxation by the subterfuge of taking profits in the form of bonus shares instead of in dividends. The provisions of this bill are in marked contrast to those of a measure that was recently before us which sought to punish workers who dared to assert their claim to better conditions of living. I protest strongly against the proposal of the Government to allow certain persons to be immune from the law. That is quite inequitable. It appears that prizes, perks, and privileges may be distributed to the wealthy classes of the community, but that imprisonment and banishment must be the lot of the workers. The honourable member for Yarra is to be congratulated upon having explained in such a simple manner the intricate and technical provisions of this bill. But for him it is probable that we would not have known its far-reaching effects. Will the Treasurer assure us that the Government intends, in ' the future, to tax bonus shares distributed out of the accumulated or current profits, in accordance with the provision of the Income Tax Assessment Bonus Share Act of 1915?",36
179,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Honourable members will have an opportunity to discuss that matter when the Income Tax Assessment Bill is introduced later in the year. Mr Sooxuir - What we want to know is whether the Treasurer will provide in his bill that these shares shall be taxable.,37
180,Mr MAKIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is the point; for it must be remembered that the Treasurer is all-powerful in this matter. In a bill of this character we are absolutely subject to his whims and wishes. We want to know what he is prepared to do in the future, in respect to the collection of taxation, which the High Court has decided may be imposed. We require to be informed if companies are to be permitted to avoid their taxation obligations by distributing their profits in the shape of bonus shares instead' of as dividends. If they are, the Commonwealth will be so much the poorer. We know that the Treasurer has big company interests to serve, and those with whom he is associated are prepared at all times to give those interests special consideration. It would be well for the people to recognize the partisan nature of the legislation introduced by this Government. It is not long since the Federal elections were held, and the Government declared its policy to be to consider the interests' of ali sections of the community, to apply the law equitably and fairly, to put down lawlessness, promote the best interests of the country and its prosperity, and make every one, according to his means, contribute equally to the cost of government. But we are now asked to consider class legislation which will not affect any persons receiving incomes of less than £4,000 per annum. Such a concession as is here proposed is not made to other taxpayers. In view of our previous experience of the Treasurer in relation to matters affecting the interests of the wealthy, I am uot prepared to accede to his request to allow this measure to pass without further consideration.",37
181,Mr COLEMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"All that we want the Treasurer to do is to ""switch on the light."" Mr MAJfriN - My honourable friend reminds me of an interesting observation for which the Treasurer was himself responsible - prior to his inclusion in the Cabinet. I should like to hear the honourable gentleman, as the private memher for Cowper, discussing the merits of this class of legislation from the Country party corner. - Mr ATKINSON - What other steps could be taken to meet the case involved?",37
182,Mr MAKIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"To see that the law is administered without favour. Does the Honorary Minister consider that we haye no right to know the amount of revenue that is involved in this legislation, or what the intentions of the Government are for the future? It cannot evade its obligation by the quibbling of the honourable gentleman. I shall have much more to say if it is the intention of the Treasurer to persist with the bill, but I think that it is reasonable at .this stage to ask that progress be reported. Progress reported. House adjourned at 4.2 p:m.",37
