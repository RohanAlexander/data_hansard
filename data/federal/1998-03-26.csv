2,Mr COSTELLO,REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I rise today to introduce a'package of landmark legislation to fundamentally reform the Australian financial sector.' The reforms follow the policy announced in response to the 1997 financial systems inquiry chaired by Mr Stan Wallis. This series of bills puts in place a structure designed to. improve tl-e efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian financial system while pre-erving its integrity, security and fairness. Once implemented, Australia will have a stronger regulatory regime designed to better respond to developments in the finance sector, including globalisation and technological change and the needs of businesses and consumers. Once implemented, Australia will be a world leader with best practice, leading edge' financial sector regulation. These reforms to the financial system, together with the wide ranging reform of Australia's corporate laws to be delivered under the corporate law economic reform program, provide a launching pad for this government's drive to make Australia a leading business centre in the Asia-Pacific region. In September last year, the government announced its response to the financial system inquiry which fouhd that Australia's financial system faces rapid change as a result of technological innovation, increasing globalisation and changing business and consumer needs. To ensure that Australia secures the enormous potential benefits of these changes and keeps up with the continuing rapid pace of financial system innovation, our regulatory arrangements must be modernised. By encouraging our financial system to achieve world best practice in an increasingly competitive international market for financial services, we 1998 will see the sector contributing strongly to employment and growth prospects of the entire Australian economy. The changes will help provide not just more jobs but better jobs for Australians. The government has accepted the inquiry's recommendations that measures consistent with the basic goals of financial system: safety and stability be introduced to better focus regulation on its underlying objectives, to ensure that regulatory arrangements minimise restraints on new entry and competition, and to ensure that regulation applies' in a competitively neutral way across existing and newly emerging market sectors. A central part of the reform approach is the creation of a new organisational framework for the regulation of the financial system which is objectives based, in,place of the current institutionally based structure. There are three fundamental regulatory objectives for'government intervention in the financial system. The first is the maintenance of financial stability, including through ensuring' a safe and reliable payments system. This goal, which has close links with the price stability objective of monetary policy, is to be the regulatory focus of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The second goal is the provision of specialised regulation of conduct, disclosure and dispute resolution for financial service providers and financial markets: This regulatory objective will be pursued across the financial system by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, which will be based on the Australian' Securities Com,mission. The third obj-ctive is the prudentia- supervision of those parts of the financial system which require more intense regulation for safety and stability reasons. Australia presently has several agencies providing this form of regulation in a structure that is increasingly outdated and inefficient. To provide more efficient and competitively neutral regulation across all of the prudentially regulated sectors, the government will establish a single prudential regulatory authority replacing all of the institutionally based agencies. This bill, the first in a series of financial sector legislative reforms, establishes this single agency, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. APRA will be the prudential regulator of banks and other deposit-taking institutions, life and general insurance companies, superannuation funds and retirement income accounts. APRA will have comprehensive powers, including for licensing and regulation of the institutions authorised to provide these financial services. In recognition of likely continuing change in the financial system, provision is made for regulations to accommodate future changes in APRA's regulatory coverage. In the case of superannuation and retirement savings accounts, APRA will also be responsible for regulation designed to achieve retirement income objectives. This reflects the close association between regulation for that purpose and prudential regulation in these sectors. While APRA will initially take regulatory responsibility for all superannuation funds, it is anticipated that this responsibility in respect of most excluded superannuation funds will later pass to the Australian Taxation Office. Provision is made for APRA to be accountable through an independent board and to operate under a charter that ensures that the safety objectives of prudential regulation are balanced with efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality considerations. The bill sets out the framework for APRA's operation. This bill establishes the powers and functions of APRA while other legislation in this package of bills will provide for the laws and regulations to be administered by APRA in relation to each sector. APRA will be an independent regulator, but, like the Reserve Bank, will be subject to an overriding policy determination power of the Treasurer in the very rare event of unreconciled disagreement with the government of the day. As a Commonwealth authority, it REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, 26 March 1998 will be accountable to the government and the parliament, as provided for under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. In addition, the bill provides for additional reporting requirements in APRA's annual report, including a report on any investigations on prudential matters under section 61 of the Banking Act 1959. Any reports presented to parliament by APRA may, of course, be referred by parliament to a committee, such as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, for detailed examination. APRA will also be expected to appear before parliamentary committees on request. APRA will be governed by a nine member board, whose terms and conditions of appointment will be subject to determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. To ensure that there is a close relationship between APRA, the Reserve Bank and ASIC, two of APRA's board members will come from the Reserve Bank and one from ASIC. The bill provides for the duties and statutory appointment of the Chief Executive Officer who will also be an APRA board member. It also provides for the powers of the board to set terms and conditions of APRA staff. It is envisaged that in the first instance the bulk of APRA's staff will come from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, and the Reserve Bank supervision area, together with the staff of state based regulatory agencies when they join the regulatory scheme. Provision is made for the funding of APRA from moneys. appropriated following the collection of levies paid by regulated financial institutions, and from charges for certain services. APRA is to have powers to borrow moneys, but these are intended only to facilitate its day-today operations. Secrecy provisions in the bill will ensure the protection of information and documentation obtained as part of the regulation process but allow for effective information exchange between the financial sector regulatory bodies, including the Reserve Bank and ASIC. The government envisages that APRA will . become fully operational, at the Commonwealth level, on 1 July 1998 or as soon as possible thereafter. In this context, this bill provides for the changeover of responsibilities for prudential supervision of the financial sector at the Commonwealth level. Transfers of staff and responsibilities for state based institutions may require separate legislation at a later date, once final agreement has been reached with the states and territories. As I announced on 17 March 1998, the headquarters of APRA will be based in Sydney to ensure that a close relationship is maintained with the Reserve Bank, which will continue to have responsibility for the overall stability of the financial system. This will facilitate close communication and operational cooperation between these two bodies. In addition, the government expects a presence to be retained by APRA in the major state capitals and, at least for some considerable time, Canberra, which is the current base of the ISC. I conclude by noting that this bill provides a centrepiece of the proposed new regulatory structure, a specialised regulatory agency focused on clear regulatory purposes. As the single prudential regulator, APRA will be able to provide flexible, efficient, coordinated and consistent regulation across the financial sector, particularly for financial service conglomerates which now make-up the major part of the financial system. It will be in a position to achieve regulatory excellence, provide broader and more enriching career opportunities for its staff, and develop close and comprehensive links with the whole financial system. Consistent with the need for regulatory flexibility, APRA is provided with comprehensive powers, including over licensing, and generally will develop financial standards based on its own policy making capacities within the framework of laws established for it. This should ensure that APRA is adaptable and responsive to the changes occurring in the financial system, and that its regulatory work always balances the objectives of financial safety, efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned.

3,Mr COSTELLO,INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY LEVY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill, as well as the other levy bills which form part of this legislative package, is to impose levies on those industries that will be prudentially regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA. These levies will fund both APRA and the cost of additional consumer protection functions in the financial system undertaken by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC. Essentially, the levies will ensure that the cost of regulation is met by those who benefit from it. These bills allow for a levy to be charged on the entity being supervised according to a percentage of the as-ts held by the entity, subject to minimum and maximum levy amounts. The rates, thresholds and limits will be determined by the Treasurer. This will ensure that the levy paid by each class of entity reflects the actual cost of supervising those entities and the benefits to entities and their customers of supervision. At present, the different regulatory authorities have separate funding mechanisms, which have significant disparities between the nature and level of funding associated with them. These funding disparities can act to create significant cost disadvantages for one category of financial institution vis-a-vis another. The government's aim is to establish an administratively simple and uniform scheme based on the principle of full cost recovery from the institutional categories that are regulated. Separate provision is made for charges for direct services provided-such as licences-but the major part of the cost of supervision will be met by an anriual levy sufficient to cover the costs of its operations. It will be broadly similar in nature to the financial charges that building unions, insurance companies and superannuation funds already pay. The banks at present are effectively 'charged' through interest forgone on non-callable deposits held by the Reserve Bank. With the exception of the banks, the net financial effect on the institutions will be small; some institutions may fare better and some worse, and existing cross subsidies favouring some sectors will be removed. Separate levy bills have been drafted for each industry. This will provide the flexibility to determine the levy on each industry according to the actual cost of regulating that particular industry. This bill provides for a levy to be paid by the banks for the. first time. The banks will, however, no longer forego a much greater amount of income on non-callable deposits. It is envisaged that once the deposit-taking institutions currently regulated by the states and territories come within APRA'sjurisdiction, then they too will transfer from their existing cost recovery regime and be subject to the levy provisions of this bill. This bill will commence on 1 July 1999 or when the supervision of non-bank deposittaking institutions is transferred from the states. The other Levy Bills will commence on the same day as the Australian Prudential Regulations Authority (APRA). I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill, which is also the explanatory memorandum to the other Levy Bills and the Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection - ill 1998.

NA (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
10,Mr COSTELLO,FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This omnibus bill deals with amendments to a number of acts to give effect to the new regulatory framework for the financial system being introduced, consistent with the recommendations of the financial system inquiry. These include: the establishment of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which is based on the Australian Securities Commission; amendments to the Banking Act to establish the new regulatory regime in the banking and deposit-taking sector to be administered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA); the establishment of the Payments System Board within the Reserve Bank; the splitting of the responsibility for relevant insurance and superannuation legislation between APRA and ASIC; and transitional provisions relating to the estabdisbanded. lishment of the new regulatory bodies and the associated regulatory reforms. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission The bill renames the Australian Securities Commission as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and will result in ASIC being the pre-eminent consumer protection and market integrity regulator across the financial system. In addition to the current corporate regulatory functions of the Australian Securities Commission, ASIC will, in the first instance, be taking on consumer protection and market integrity in the areas of insurance, superannuation and aspects of banking and the payments system, and ultimately across the full financial system. Under the current system, responsibility for consumer protection functions in the financial system is split along institutional lines between a number of Commonwealth and state entities. If this situation is not addressed, globalisation, technological advances and innovations in financial products and distribution mechanisms will result in an increasing incidence of regulatory gaps and inconsistencies which are not conducive to efficient competition in financial markets. Responsibility for consumer protection and market integrity vested in a single entity will enable ASIC to adopt a functional and objective-based regulatory approach, thereby promoting competitive neutrality and permitting better comparability by consumers of different financial products and services. The amalgamation of consumer protection functions in a single regulator is supported by industry and consumer groups. There will, of course, be close co-operation between ASIC and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The functions relating to insurance and superannuation were previously exercised by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, a position which will be abolished with the commencement of this bill. The consumer protection functions relating to aspects of banking and the payments system were previously exercised by the Australian Payments System Council, which is also to be Included in the functions transferred from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to ASIC by this bill are functions under the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. In addition, there are some acts currently administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) which contain both prudential and market integrity and disclosure requirements and, as such, will need to be split between the two regulators, APRA and ASIC. ASIC will take on regulatory responsibility for parts of the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Insurance Act 1973, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997. While the bill effectively transfers responsibility for administration of existing laws from the ISC to ASIC and APRA, it does not, except to a very limited extent, seek to alter the substantive rules applying in this area. In this regard, the task of rationalising and harmonising the financial system regulatory framework with that applying under the Corporations Law will be undertaken as part of the second stage of implementation of the financial system reforms in conjunction with the implementation of the corporate law economic reform program reforms relating to financial markets and investment products. In particular, the reforms will introduce a single licensing regime for financial market intermediaries as well as a consistent and comparable disclosure regime for financial instruments. In accordance with the corporations agreement, the ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the relevant amendments to the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the Corporations Law. Banking Act Amendments The package of amendments to the Banking Act 1959 will: establish a single licensing and prudential regulatory regime for deposit-taking instituvery tions by providing for authorities under the act to be issued both to banks and non-bank deposit-taking institutions; strengthen and clarify depositor protection powers; facilitate the regulation and, hence, use of non-operating holding company structures by financial conglomerates containing a bank or deposit-taking institution; and strengthen the regulatory powers of APRA as the prudential regulator, giving it powers to make standards and enforce directions broadly similar to those now provided under the Financial Institutions Code (applying to credit unions and building societies). The proposed single licensing regime will facilitate increased effective competition, reduce regulatory inconsistencies between institutions conducting essentially the same deposit-taking business and improve efficiency. Over time, consumers should benefit from increased choice, improved quality and lower cost products and services. Facilitating the use of non-operating holding company structures will allow conglomerates greater commercial freedom in selecting their appropriate business structure, thereby potentially lowering business costs, increasing transparency and reducing barriers to entry, with ongoing benefits both to investors and consumers of financial services. The stability and safety of the financial system will not be compromised by these reforms due to the enhanced powers provided to the prudential regulator. The three key ingredients to ensuring financial stability and depositor protection are: strong prudential regulation to lessen risks; effective intervention to prevent or manage a crisis; and . depositor preference to ensure confidence. APRA will be able to make standards on prudential matters in relation to banks, deposit-taking institutions and non-operating holding companies of banks or deposit-taking institutions. The standards-making power provides APRA with regulatory independence and is flexible, certain and able to be used quickly in the event of a crisis to prevent contagion effects in the financial system. The standards themselves will not be directly enforceable. APRA will, however, have a power to give a direction to any licensed non-operating holding company, deposit-taker, or foreign bank branch, if they fail to comply with a prudential standard, regulation, or where this is otherwise necessary in the interests of depositors. Failure to comply with such a direction will be an offence. The directions power is intended to facilitate early intervention by APRA to prevent a crisis from emerging and is similar to that now provided to state and territory regulators of credit unions and building societies under the financial institutions code. Intervention powers to manage a crisis will also be improved. The amendments proposed in this bill both clarify the mechanisms by which the prudential regulator may take control of a troubled deposit-taking institution, and allow the prudential regulator to appoint an· administrator for that purpose. While these statutory management powers provide the means for control in a crisis, they will also enhance APRA' s capacity to act in a preventative capacity by using less direct strategies, such as facilitating the takeover of a troubled institution or its business by other sound institutions. In Australia and elsewhere, such action has provided the most common response in practice to financial distress in deposit-taking entities. These intervention powers are further supplemented by a new power clarifying that APRA may initiate the wind-up of an institution that is insolvent and cannot be restored to solvency within a reasonable period. Such action may prevent further losses from accruing and would therefore be in the best interests of depositors. Again, state supervisory authorities already have the clear power to wind-up building societies and credit unions. Depositor preference is manifest both in depositor priority on winding-up and in APRA's duty to exercise its powers within division 2 of the Banking Act in the interests of depositors. These are existing, long standing provisions in the act. While depositor preference can mean disadvantage for other creditors, APRA's intervention powers, particularly the proposed new early intervention powers, also lessen the risks faced by such other creditors, both by reducing the likelihood of insolvency and by increasing the options for resolution in the event of insolvency. The bill also provides for the abolition of the requirement for banks to hold non-callable deposits with the Reserve Bank. These requirements no longer serve a prudential purpose but have been used to impose a form of regulatory charge. In light of the proposed imposition of levies on all industries that supervised by APRA and consistent with the intention to remove non-neutral treatment of deposit-taking entities, the non-callable deposit requirements will be abolished consequent on the transfer to the Commonwealth of regulatory responsibility for credit unions and building societies. Payments System Board This bill introduces legislation amending Reserve Bank Act 1959 to establish the Payments System Board within the Reserve Bank. The Payments System Board will be independent of the bank's main board, which will no longer have powers to make payment system policies for the bank. Rather, the Payments System Board will operate as the policy making board of the bank in relation to payments system matters. In particular, it will be responsible for ensuring that the bank's powers are utilised so as to improve the efficiency of the payments system, to promote competition in the market for payment services and to control risk in the financial system. The PSB will operate on a basis that is very similar to that applying to the main board of the Reserve Bank. For example, similar procedures will apply for the resolution of any disagreement between the policies of the government and the Payments System Board. The Governor of the Reserve Bank will chair the Payments System Board. It will also include another Reserve Bank member, one from APRA and up to five others. The Payments System Board and the Reserve Bank will be given explicit regulatory powers in the payments system. These powers will be conferred under the Payment Systems and Netting Bill and the Payment Systems (Regulation) Bill, the latter of which I will introduce shortly. Other Amendments To prevent excessive compliance costs on building societies and credit unions, the bill also amends the Financial Corporations Act 1974 to exempt these institutions from the data reporting requirements under that act when they are regulated under the Banking Act 1959. The bill also transfers to the Governor of the Reserve Bank the Treasurer's will present powers with respect to categorising registered corporations and exempting corporations. The transitional provisions in the bill preserve the effect of decisions made before the commencement of APRA, including by preserving existing approvals, transferring work in progress to APRA and facilitating the effective transfer of the prudential regulation the of building societies and credit unions to the Commonwealth, subject to agreement. There are also transitional provisions protecting the accrued entitlements of ISC and Reserve Bank staff transferring across to APRA. The accrued entitlements of the ISC staff will be largely protected through the transfer provisions of section 81 C of the Public Service Act 1922. The bill also gives the Treasurer the power to transfer the assets and liabilities of the ISC to APRA or ASIC. Finally, the bill provides for the repeal of certain acts, including the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 which is replaced by the consolidated Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill, which I will shortly introduce, and the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987 consequent on the establishment of APRA. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. PAYMENT SYSTEMS (REGULATION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
11,Mr COSTELLO,FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill details the proposed new regulatory framework for the payments system which is being introduced consistent with the recommendations of the financial system inquiry. Amendments to the Reserve Bank Act 1959, as provided for in the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 provide for the creation of the Payments System Board-PSB-within the Reserve Bank to provide for policy making in relation to the payments system and to increase the accountability of the Reserve Bank in relation to its role in the payments system. The payments system plays a central role in the financial system. The government has decided to strengthen, and make more transparent and accountable, the regulation of the payments system undertaken by the Reserve Bank. Until now, the Reserve Bank has played a substantial regulatory role in the payments system as a direct participant and through the use of its banking powers. Payments system regulation ed from the· prudential regulation of banks because an increasing number of non-bank participants. in the payments system are emerging to increase competition in the system. More direct means for achieving effective regulation are required for this purpose. Such direct means are also necessary to ensure that the payments system retains its high standard of safety while adapting to the demands of new technologies and globalisation in the payments system., The Reserve Bank will be the regulator of the system, given the importance of the payments system to the overall stability of the financial system and given the central role of the Reserve Bank itself in the core areas of the payments system, particularly settlement. As with all the other reforms I have announced, this decision highlights the government's commitment to encouraging innovation and competition . while not, in .any way, jeopardising the stability and soundness of the financial system. The payments system covers payment instruments such as cash, cheques and smart cards, their delivery, the exchange or clearance of payment messages and the final settlement of value between intermediaries providing payment services. This bill proposes a new regulatory framework for the payments system. While existing industry self-regulatory arrangements will be retained wherever these are performing satisfactorily, the bill provides powers to the Reserve Bank to enable it to undertake more direct regulation by designating payment systems as subject to the law where it is considered in the public interest to do so. I Once a payment system is designated, the bill provides that it may be subject to the imposition of rules of access for participants on commercial terms, the determination of standards, the giving of enforceable directions, or the voluntary arbitration of disputes on technical standards. The development of access regimes and standards will be undertliken, as far as possible, in conjunction and consultation with the private sector. This approach ensures that fo-mal regulation will be imposed on - he payments system only to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the is to be separatpublic interest. ' The bill also provides for a comprehensive regime of prudential regulation of the storeof-value backing purchased payment facilities. This will apply to all forms of such facilities, including stored value cards, travellers cheques al1d Internet cash facilities. These are all arrangements whereby payment is made for an instrument which can be used for making subsequent payments with the value available recorded or stored on the instrument. Ultimately, the value is redeemable from the holder of the store of value created by the original purchase of the stored value. dence in such systems depends on confidence that the store-of-value is safe. The bill provides that the holder of the store-of-value must either be an institution regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority-APRA-under the Banking Act, in which case there is no requirement for further regulation, or otherwise be authorised by the Reserve Bank, in which case further regulation may be required. The bill provides powers for the Reserve Bank to impose necessary regulation. It also enables the Reserve Bank to grant an exemption from the requirement for an authority where it is considered appropriate to do so. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanaple, tory memorandum. TIebate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA (SHAREHOLDINGS) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
12,Mr COSTELLO,FINANCIAL SECTOR,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill streamlines the existing legislation and rules governing ownership and acquisitions in the financial system consistent with the recommendations of the financial system inquiry. It will replace the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 and the relevant parts of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991. The streamlined provisions will be particuAcquisitions larly useful for corporate groups which contain more than one licensed entity. Common rules will apply to each class of licence, simplifying regulatory applications and their assessment. Moreover, provision is made for authorisations applying to the non-operating holding companies of financial conglomerates to flow through to all of the members of the corporate group. The bill subjects all prudentially regulated Confi- financial sector companies to: a 15 per cent shareholding limit by anyone person, and their associates; or such higher percentage as the Treasurer may determine as being in the national interest. This provides for simpler procedures than existing laws, a common threshold, which is also that applied under foreign investment policy and law, and harmonises the treatment of different licence classes. The laws are the administrative responsibility of the Treasurer, but provision is made for delegation to APRA. Delegations may be made, for examin relation to small financial institutions. At the same time, the effectiveness of the laws is strengthened along the lines adopted in other recent shareholding restriction provisions. Provision is made for the Treasurer to declare a person to have 'practical control'that is, the power to control the policies and operations of the financial institutionregardless of the size of their shareholding. Under such a declaration the person must relinquish practical control. The bill also provides for the imposition of conditions on approvals of stakes higher than 15 percent, for the Treasurer to apply to the Federal Court for remedial orders in respect of unacceptable shareholding or practical control situations, for fees to be imposed in respect of applications and for information to be obtained by the Treasurer from applicants. The law relating to financial sector shareholdings is applied for prudential, competition and other national interest purposes. and mergers in the financial sector, as for other economic sectors, separately and additionally remain subject to competition regulation under the trade practices laws and to foreign investment policy and laws. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (PENSION BONUS SCHEME) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, for Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
13,Mr WARWICK SMITH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. By introducing the pension bonus scheme, this bill fulfils another government election commitment. This scheme, which complements other government measures for the aged, is designed to provide an incentive for older Australians to remain in the work force. The scheme is voluntary and each person can choose to enter the scheme based on their particular circumstances and preferences. By choosing to work longer, people can add to their individual savings for retirement. The scheme will apply to people who qualify for age pensions or equivalent Veterans' Affairs payments, but who delay their retirement and keep working. Eligible customers will receive a tax-free lump sum bonus payment when they stop working, in addition to commencing to receive their ongoing age pension or Veterans' Affairs equivalent. By offering people an incentive to keep working, this measure will assist in reducing the ratio of retired people to working people and will increase the financial well-being of older Australians. This will be particularly helpful for women and small family business owners. The scheme will provide for the payment of a lump sum bonus-the amount of which will increase more than proportionally with the number of years that a person delays claiming age pension. The amount of the bonus payable is calculated by mUltiplying the annual basic rate of age pension payable to the person at grant by the bonus percentage-that is 9.4 per cent for each year. This amount is then multiplied by the number of years worked, up to a maximum of five years. By way of iIIustration: a single person who delays retirement and continues to work for five years and is subsequently granted age pension at the maximum rate would receive a tax free lump sum payments of $21,250using the current rate of $9,042.80 per annum. If that person had delayed retirement for three years instead of five years, the bonus payment would be $7,560.20. For a couple who continue to work for five years and subsequently are granted age pension at the maximum rate, the combined payment would be $35,450 tax free. A person must be registered as a member of the scheme in order to qualify for a bonus payment. Generally, registration will occur when a person qualifies for age pensioncurrently 65 years for men and 61 years for women-or the relevant Department of Vet-rans' Affairs payment. During the registration process potential members will be required to provide information relevant to the operation of the scheme. The objective of the registration process is to ensure that people receive advice about the scheme, allowing them to make an informed choice-about whether to participate in the scheme. It will also provide them with information on how to comply with the scheme's requirements. In the usual case, registered members who satisfy the 'work test' will begin to accrue bonus periods. Members of the scheme who are 75 years old or older can no longer accrue bonus periods. For single people, this requires them to undertake gainful work, defined as work for financial gain or reward, for an average of 20 hours per week over 48 weeks per year-that is, a minimum of 960 hours a year. In addition, two-thirds-that is, 640-of those 960 hours must relate to work undertaken in Australia. For members of a couple, it will be possible for registered members to rely on work undertaken by their partners to satisfy the work test provided their partners are also members of the scheme. To satisfy the 960 hours requirement, members will have the choice of working longer hours over a short period in each year of deferment or working for a longer period with fewer hours per week. To be paid a bonus a person must accrue between one and five bonus year periods while deferring age pension. Domestic duties in relation to the person's place of residence as well as management of family financial investments will not be treated as gainful work for the purposes of this scheme. The operation of the work test provisions will be closely monitored to ensure that contrived arrangements are not put in place to circumvent the intent of the legislation. If necessary, further legislative amendment will be taken to ensure that the integrity of the scheme is not compromised. The scheme reflects the principles already contained in the current provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to preclusion periods. Accordingly, where a person has disposed of assets in excess of the disposal limits or where a lump sum compensation payment is made to the person, the person will not be able to accrue a bonus for the relevant preclusion period. Similarly, a cannot accrue a bonus if the person receives carer pension or an equivalent Veterans' Affairs payment or in certain other limited situations. At the end of any of these preclusion periods the person will again be able to accrue bonus periods. To assist members in gauging whether they are satisfying the 1>cheme's requirements, will be able to request from Centrelink evidentiary certificate which states that have satisfied the work test over a particular period. Members will be able to rely on this certificate as evidence that the work test had been satisfied for that period. Members will be required to keep certain documents-for example, their group certificates and income tax returns-and maintain a work record. This work record will contain information relevant to the work test, such as the days and number of hours worked in a particular period and names of employers. This record will enable members to monitor for themselves whether they are meeting the work test. provide Centrelink with sufft.cient information to advise members effectively and provide information essential to the determination of a person's entitlement to the boims. This scheme provides the opportunity for people to add to their individual savings for retirement. Further, it creates choice and flexibility in decisions regarding retirement from the work force and accessing the age pension. I commend the bill to the House and present the duly signed explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA NA REFORM BILL 1998 First Reading Bill preserited by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",23
14,Mr WARWICK SMITH,REHABILITATION SERVICE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. person The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Reform Bill 1998 is under my jurisdiction. This bill provides for transitional arrangements relating to the restructure of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, also known as the CRS, which currently operates as a division of the Department of Health and Family Services. In December last year I announced that the CRS would separate from they the department and be established as a an Commonwealth owned company limited by they shares under the Corporations Law on or before 30 June 1998. It will be designated as a government business enterprise. This initiative will separate the role of purchaser, which will remain with the department, from that of service provider and will improve transparency in the purchasing of rehabilitation services. This separation paves the way in the longer term for the· introduction of competition in Commonwealth funded rehabilitation services the and greater client choice of provider. It provides the CRS with a more flexible organisational structure more in line with its potenIt will also tial competitors. Under the Commonwealth's rehabilitation program eligible clients, typically those on a pension or benefit, are able to receive free rehabilitation programs designed to increase their capacity to obtain and retain employment or live independently in the community. To date eligible clients have had no choice but to use the CRS which has been a monopoly provider of such services. Separation of the CRS from the department, in conjunction with the proposed introduction of competition from 1999 is intended to provide eligible clients with choice of service provider, and to promote greater efficiency, flexibility and innovation in service delivery and best value for clients from the Commonwealth's substantial investment in this program. The government will be consulting widely with clients, industry and the general community over coming months on the best mechanisms for introducing competition, with the intention of opening the program up to other service providers from the latter part of 1999. In the interim, the Department of Health and Family Services will continue to purchase rehabilitation services from the CRS under contractual arrangements. While the new company will be established administratively under the Corporations Law, the bill provides for a range of transitional measures relating to the transfer of the current operations of the CRS to the new company, including its assets, contracts and liabilities. CRS staff will be transferred to the new company under the provisions of the Public Service Act 1922 under arrangements which will protect their accrued entitlements. The new company will pay all Commonwealth taxes. However, consistent with current taxation policy it will be exempt from state and territory taxes. To ensure competitive neutrality it will instead make payments to the Commonwealth equivalent to the level of state taxes it would otherwise have had to pay. The bill also includes a number of consequential amendments to existing legislation. The CRS currently operates under delegation from the secretary to the department under Part III of the Disability Services Act 1986. Separation of the CRS will render this part of the obsolete. Repeal of Part III of the Disability Services Act will also require minor consequential amendments to other legislation. I commend the bill to the House and present the duly signed explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.",24
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Jenkins)My attention has been drawn to the alterations proposed by Senate amendments 10 and 11. I understand that the alteration in amendment 10 will extend the scope of a definition in the biII. One result would apparently be that some taxpayers will have tax deductions and other benefits disallowed, so that they would be liable to pay more tax. Amendment 11 is consequential. It appears that both of these alterations were prepared and circulated in the Senate as requests rather than amendments. This reflected advice received by the government in terms of compliance with the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. Following a statement by the chairman of committees in the Senate, these alterations were, however, treated as amendments. On their face, the alterations fail the test proposed by our legal and constitutioal affairs committee as to the type of amendments open to the Senate-the committee referred, inter alia, to a request being required where an alteration moved in the Senate will make an increase in the total tax payable legally possible. I note, however, that the supplementary explanatory memorandum presented stated: The amendments' to the bill will not affect the financial impact outlined in paragraph 1.45 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Matters such as these often raise difficult questions of interpretation. Having drawn attention to this matter, I acknowledge the House may choose not to take any objection and proceed to consider the Senate amendact ments.

16,Mr GARETH EVANS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10.30 a.m.)There are a variety of amendments here which have been made, essentially, to cover drafting errors and technical matters. None of them are opposed by the opposition. I take this opportunity, however, to draw attention to one amendment to the legislation that has not been accomplished in our process in either house and which certainly ought to have been-that is, to deal with the absolutely unacceptable expanded exemption to the trafficking in trust loss legislation which is contained in this bill and which has been the subject of previous controversy. The Labor Party's bill, as originally introduced in 1995 to cover the problem of trafficking in trust losses, did, as a significant concession to family business situations, enable the beneficiary of a family trust carrying a loss to inject into that trust income obtained from other sources and to apply it against the trust loss which that beneficiary would otherwise have to bear, for tax saving purposes. Treasury and the tax office at the time did explicitly advise Treasurer Willis that this concession was already very generous and should certainly not extend to any further exemption. The version of the legislation, however, brought forward belatedly by the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) does include a further exemption which makes it possible for a very wide range of extended family members who are not already beneficiaries of the trust to themselves inject income to apply against a trust loss to avoid tax. For example, a non-beneficiary as remote as a wife's grandmother or a niece's husband who wants to avoid paying tax on, say, $200,000 of property income can inject that amount into the relevant family trust, write off the income against any loss up to that value being carried by that trust and then have the $200,000 distributed back tax free. This particular exemption is a classic rorters' paradise. Our estimate, on the information available to us, is that the cost to revenue of allowing this enhanced exemption is measurable at least in tens of millions of dollars. We asked a number of questions about this publicly and in the parliament during the passage of the legislation. We did not get answers to any of them. But, in a spirit of optimism, encouraged by the actual presence in the chamber on this occasion, unusually, of the Treasurer himself; I ask the questions again. What public policy justification, if any, was there for this expanded exemption, given the obvious scope for its use in tax avoidance by high-wealth families? Did up to 19 members of his front bench who have family trusts stand to benefit from this expanded exemption? Did the present Treasurer have the same negative advice from Treasury and the tax office as Labor did about any expanded exemptions for loss trafficking in family trusts? With whom did the Treasurer or his staff discuss the expanded exemption? In particular, were representatives of high-wealth individuals noW being investigated by the tax office involved in those discussions? Why did the Treasurer mislead the House on several occasions by misstating, as he did, the effect of Labor's 1995 legislation, in particular refusing to acknowledge that our legislation did not allow non-beneficiaries to inject income for tax avoidance purposes? What was the precise estimated cost to revenue of this expanded exemption as compared with what would otherwise have been brought in by a properly crafted legislative package? The truth of the matter is that here, as on so many other matters, the Treasurer talks big, claims that there are major problems in the tax system which need redress and talks endlessly about fairness, but when he has an opportunity right in front of him to correct an anomaly or not to create new ones, to actually genuinely ensure that a piece of anti-tax avoidance legislation has a gepuinely antiavoidance character and does not become a birthday party for a whole new category of avoiders, he throws it away. I think he continues to have a great deal to answer for in relation to this legislation. I invite him to those answers right now.",28
17,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I happen to be here this morning, as you know, to introduce the biggest shake-up of the Australian financial sector probably in two decades. I was not aware that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was going to try this stunt. Seeing as I am here, I will respond to his stunt. It will not take very long. This is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is engaged on this little stunt because yesterday he said that he discovered yesterday Australia had a tax problem. The basis on which he says he discovered yesterday that Australia had a tax problem was the release by the Australian Taxation Office of statistics about the growth in the number of trusts between 1991 and 1995. . Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the Treasurer to mislead this House by misquoting and incompletely quoting my statement yesterday, which was that we had a tax problem in relation to the scale of creation of new trusts, not more generally?",29
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Jenkins)There is no point of order.,29
19,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"There is no point of order, and you know it. Yesterday you said you had discovered that there was a problem on the basis of statistics that were released about the growth in the number of trusts between 1991-92 and 1995-96-a period during the whole of which, with the exception of March 1996 to June 1996, you were in government; a period during the whole of which, apart from those three months, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the finance minister; a period during the whole of which you had the capacity, if you were genuinely worried about that, to do something about it; but a period during the whole of which you did nothing. Gratuitously, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition discovered yesterday, on the basis of his own failure, a problem. What you discovered yesterday, the honourable member for Holt, is evidence, according to you, of give your own default and failure. You come in here in relation to these amendments, which bear no wit of relation to what you have just addressed, and try to sneak around this issue and put false and misleading slurs upon the government. The truth of the matter is this: this was government that legislated to prevent trafficking in trust losses. The measures that were always intended were to prevent trafficking in trust losses. They were not to prevent those people who had legitimately incurred losses being able to offset those losses against income, as would be the case for an individual. Let me go through it. If you as an individual incur a loss on some part of your income and you make a profit on another, you set off the profit against the loss and you pay on the balance. It is an obvious principle of tax collection. You do not have to pay tax on the profit and disregard the loss. If you made a loss on your rental property and you made a gain on your share trading, as an individual you can set the profits and the loss off and you pay tax on the balance. The same should apply in relation to a trust. The amendments that you speak of were applied in relation to a trust. So if a family group had losses and income, it could offset them. It is an obvious point and a point which, if you had turned your mind to it, would have been agreed from the outset. The second point which you conveniently and repeatedly overlooked was that the changes we made actually tighten the definition of family. In your speech you referred to a wife's grandfather. What you omit to say is that we narrowed the definition of family because under Labor Party proposals you would have included great-grandparents and great-grandchildren and a far wider class of person than is allowed by this current legislation. The proof is in the estimates. When the changes were made, the actual revenue estimates provided by the Treasury were for increased collection. To stand up here and say that this could in some way harm the revenue, when it produced an increased collection, is entirely false. The amendments that have come back here this morning from the Senate are accepted by the government. The legislation should be allowed to be put into place. It is good legislation, and the government fully supports it.",29
20,Mr GARETH EVANS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Holt-Deputy the Leader of the Opposition) (10.39 a.m.)Without unduly prolonging this debate, I wish to make three brief points in reply. First, it is true that the government's present legislation does slightly narrow the definition of family of an individual as compared with the original Labor bill, although that definition is still extraordinarily wide, extending, as it does, to wife's grandmothers and nieces, husbands and so on. Mr Costello-Why didn't you narrow it? Mr GARETH EV ANS-The point, Treasurer, is this: under the Labor legislation, no member of the family group, however defined, could inject income into a trust for tax saving purposes unless he or she was already a beneficiary. That is the big difference. You had to be already a beneficiary under our definition. If you were a beneficiary, the second point I make, as the Treasurer saidMr Ronaldson-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer to standing order 81. There were some comments made from both sides of the House initially in relation to this matter. The present comments bear no relevance at all to the matter currently before the House. I invite you to rule the present comments out of order so that we can return to the terms of the matter before the House.",30
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The question before the House deals with 24 amendments made by the Senate. Perusal of those makes it very difficult for me to adjudge how relevant the debate has been so far. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer, if he so feels inclined, will try to contain themselves within the narrow parameters for this most unexpected debate.",30
22,Mr GARETH EVANS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I propose to keep quite squarely within the parameters you have just identified, Mr Deputy Speaker. If I had not been interrupted, I would have already sat down by now. I do not propose to make any further interventions, but I just want to correct the record op this. It is the case that it is perfectly appropriate as an ordinary principle of tax law that you should be able to set off your, in effect, profit against your losses. We did make provision in our legislation to enable someone who already was a beneficiary of a family trust carrying a loss to inject into that trust income obtained from other sources to apply it against the trust loss for tax saving purposes. We accepted the principle, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said. It was pretty generousdeliberately generous-but we certainly did not accept the further generosity involved in allowing non-beneficiaries to leap into the act for purposes that could not be described other than for tax avoidance. The final point I quickly make is about the revenue implications of this. The Treasurer says again today, as he has previously, that these trust loss bills as a whole-and I am talking now about the bills before us and the actual language before us-will bring in more revenue than Labor's legislation, suggesting that there is no loss to legislation possibly arising from this exemption of his. There is no rort. What the Treasurer ignores now, as he has in the past, is that the problem of trafficking has grown very dramatically in the past two or three years and that his revenue gain would be larger still if he cracked down on this particular exemption. What is involved here is extra revenue that would clearly have been obtainable being forgone with this particular enhanced and absolutely indefensible exemption. My case rests.",30
23,Mr COSTELLO,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are allowing the debate to go wide, I will reply to each of the points. The first point is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) says that the definition is narrower than the Labor Party wanted but is too wide. What a proposition! It is narrower than the Labor Party wanted but still too wide. You merely have to state the proposition to realise how bizarre the claim is. It is too wide, even though we narrowed it on what the Labor Party wanted. It is really a false proposition and hardly worth replying to in the House of Representatives. The second point he makes-I do not know whether he understands it or whether it is an attempt to make a trick point-is that nonbeneficiaries can now inject income into trusts. He means to say that a family can inject income into the trust if that income is another trust income, but it still has to be the family. You still have to have the same family. If the same family has income in another family trust, that trust can inject into the loss trust, or if it has it in some other mechanism. It is true that the original proposal only allowed it for individuals. That is why it was wrong. Let us take the family that has one trust conducting one business and another conducting the other. It should be able to set off the income against the loss, just as an individual should be able to set the income off against the loss. It is a point that you have never been able to grasp, regardless of the structure. If the family is conducting two businesses, or even one business, through two entities, you should be able to group the losses and the income. That is entirely what the legislation does. If you had thought about it for a moment instead of trying to make these cheap, ignorant points, you would have conceded it. The third point is in relation to the income and the revenue. When the revenues were announced as a measure-that is, a change on a previous policy-the effect of the change was to increase the revenue take. That is what we always do in budgets in relation to measures. It is the conclusive answer to this totally fabricated and weak point.",31
24,Mr GARETH EVANS,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is being irredeemably obtuse. I do not think it is capable for me to educate him further in the time available. I make the point again that he has not answered any of the questions I have put to him, including in particular the question as to whether the tax office gave him the advice on which he is now relying in bringing this legislation forward. I have abandoned the unequal task of trying to educate and civilise him, so I suggest we move on. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA .

25,Mr GARETH EVANS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"This International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 comes before us as a very direct result of the Asian economic crisis. Were it not for that crisis we would not be debating it today. That crisis is already having a profound impact on the Australian economy and will certainly dominate economic developments both domestically and internationally over at least the next year-probably rather longer than that. The wider political and social as well as economic repercussions of this are going to be felt for many years not only in the Asian region in general but also certainly in this country. This bill provides us with an overdue opportunity to debate all these things, and I will come back to them. The particular purpose of the bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to enable a framework to be put in place for Australia to provide financial assistance to, a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. In the first place, it makes specific, in effect retrospective, provision for appropriations to fulfil Australia's pledges of financial assistance that have already been given to South Korea and Indonesia last year. These pledges involve loans or currency swaps of up to $US 1 billion for both countries. The bill does not specifically mention the third contribution that Australia has announced, that is, the currency swap, also of $US 1 billion, that has been negotiated for Thailand through the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is not in the bill because it will not involve im appropriation from consolidated revenue. It is, rather, an inter-bank arrangement. The bill is also significant because it provides a framework for future Australian financial assistance in support of IMF pro1998, grams in as yet unknown and unanticipated situations. It provides what is in effect a standing appropriation to enable the government to supply this assistance from the consolidated revenue fund. While it is expected that such as-stance will only be required in very rare and exceptional circumstances, this legislation could eventually involve quite significant future appropriations. I make it clear at the outset that the Labor opposition supports this bill, just as we supported the announcement by the government of Australia's p,articipation in the programs for Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. IMF-sponsored adjustment programs of this kind are vital to restore confidence and stability in countries experiencing financial crisis. It is particularly important that Australia participates in these packages when they relate to countries in our region or countries with whom we have strong economic links. We certainly support the government's action in ensuring that Australia is in fact the only country beside Japan to have participated in each 'one of the three IMF-sponsored packages for our Asian neighbours. When so much else has gone wrong in Australia's relations with our region over the last two years under this government, it was very important for us to re-establish our credentials in the region; and this coming to the assistance of our neighbours has certainly helped to do that. As Paul Keating, a former Prime Minister:, said in his very interesting speech-which I will refer to again-to the University of New South Wales: Some of the old brigade obviously think Asia's recent economic problems mean that Australia can heave a sigh of relief and head for the safety of old friends and familiar geography. He goes on to say: This is dangerous nonsense ... Australian engagement with Asia is not a temporary enthusiasm. If we know anything about dealing with Asia it is the importance of building relationships for the long term. That is the business Australia needs be in now. The extent to which this particular willingness to come forward with these loans and currency swaps is an example of exactly the kind of commitment we ought to be continuing to make to the region. There is no question but that we in the opposition give this wholehearted bipartisan support. I should also say that we agree with those parts of the bill which refer not just backwards to what has happened so far in Asia but which do provide an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF-sponsored adjustment programs, not necessarily confined to our own region-in this context, building in a capacity for a standing appropriation allowing the Treasurer to make the relevant loans or currency swaps. It certainly does not seem appropriate to us that pressure be put on the Reserve Bank to assume the responsibility for managing Australia's contri. bution in these circumstances when the decisions involved are essentially those of the executive government. In explaining and justifying these contributions to the Australian public it is important for us all to make clear that the bill does not provide in any way for grants or donations in support of these programs but rather for loans which must be repaid in the future. Either it is a matter of the currency swap running its course and us getting back into our own reserves the US dollars or other international currencies that have been swapped for Thai baht, or it is a matter of the loans being repaid in such a way as to immunise them from any currency changes that may have occurred in the meanwhile, with an appropriate interest component for the opportunity cost of the particular loan. Short, then, of complete financial catastrophe in the countries in question making it impossible for them to repay the loan or to give back the relevant currency entitlement, there is every reason to anticipate that there will be no financial risk and no financial loss at all. You cannot remove every possible element of risk from these situations because, by definition, we are talking about situations of economic and financial crisis, but I certainto ly am confident, and I think all of those who have participated in this enterprise from the government are confident, that Australia will not suffer in any way financially from coming forward in the way that we have on these occasions and that we can be similarly reasonably confident about the future. The bill does contain some conditions that have to be satisfied before these arrangements or agreements are entered into. The Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assisF ance if at least one other country or international organisation is participating or has agreed to participate in the program. In addition, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at the IMF's request. The bill also requires that any agreement by the Treasurer on behalf of Australia must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of the sllspension or premature termination of the fund program. All of those, in our judgment, are appropriate conditions . There is one obvious deficiency, however, in the bill in its present form, that is, it does not impose any explicit disclosure or accountability requirements on the Treasurer of the government of the day. While this may be unlikely in practice, the bill would, in its present terms, allow the Treasurer to commit very substantial amounts of public money to an IMF program without making any public statement at all about that assistance. More seriously, the bill would allow the Treasurer to commit substantial sums of taxpayers' money to such a program without having to justify or explain his decision to the parliament. The lack of explicit provisions requiring the Treasurer to publicly announce the size of any loan or currency swap under the bill and the reasons why it is in Australia's national interest is a clear shortcoming in the biIl as it is presently drafted. So the opposition will be moving amendments to this bill, which I think have already been circulated. They will require the Treasurer to issue a public statement detailing the terms of any currency swap or loan to be provided in support of an IMF sponsored program in as much detail as is practicable, given the realities of international confidential negotiations. That statement should provide reasons why this assistance is in Australia's national interest, in particular taking into account our foreign policy, trade and economic interests. The particular national interest statement to be tabled in the parliament in this respect is also required by our amendments to be referred to the Statutory Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report. That is just a further means to ensure that there will be proper scrutiny and proper accountability but,hopefully, always deliveryd in a responsible way. The opposition believes these are important amendments. The government has given some indication that it may be prepared to accept them and we hope very much that that will be the case. There are three important general issues thrown up by this legislation which do need to be debated: the nature, causes and course of the Asian economic crisis itself; the question about the role of the IMF and the international monetary system in reacting to the crisis; and the question of the domestic impact of the crisis in Australia. I want to say a few things about each of those issues. As far as the crisis itself is concerned, is no doubt that it is of spectacular magnitude. It is certainly Asia's worse crisis in three decades. On an international scale, the speed and magnitude of the contagion effect of the crisis from country to country has really been unprecedented. Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, the very influential Vice Minister for International Relations of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, has described it as really 'the first crisis of global capitalism. That is, I think, an apt description of the scale of the problem that \ we are now witnessing. In terms of analysing the causes of it, a great deal has been written, some of the best analysis of the situation coming from our own Reserve Bank in the papers that have been delivered by Governor Ian Macfarlane and Deputy Governor Stephen Grenville. There are, of course, a legion of other.commentaries and analyses around the place, including a particularly useful presentation I heard from Saul Eslake, the Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank. In what I say now I will draw quickly on a variety of those sources, in particular Mr Eslake because he does seem to me to summarise very succinctly my own understanding derived from wide reading, travel in the region and talking to many people about what has been going on. The point to understand at the outset in terms of appreciating the causes of this crisis is that they were really very different from those of earlier developing country crises, which have not been unusual. We did not have here, driving the crisis and being the fundamental cause of it, public sector profligacy. Certainly that was a partial element in the equation but, overwhelmingly, the crisis was driven by developments in the private sector and in the institutional and regulatory structure of government bearing upon private sector activity. There were what can now be seen in retrospect as excessive levels of investment in the sense that very little attention was being paid to potential profitability, creating a massive oversupply of investment product, particularly building. There were excessive levels of private sector debt being accumulated, resulting either from so-called directed lending or there from inadequate supervision and regulation of the financial systems of the countries in question. There were certainly inappropriate exchange rate regimes in place-fixed relationships between the local currency and the US dollar, which tended to foster a boom-bust economic cycle through a tie in first instance of the fall and then the rise in the US dollar against the yen. But, more particularly, what was encouraged by those fixed rates and people's belief that they would be maintained come what may was a massive accumulation of unhedged foreign exchange borrowings. There was a search around the region for higher yielding alternatives to low United States and Japanese interest rates which sucked in.a lot of lenders who should perhaps have been a bit more cautious. There was certainly an insufficiently critical scrutiny both inside and outside the region of the character of the Asian economic performance in the 1990s and, in particular, the extent to which it was being fuelled by unsustainable levels of unhedged borrowing for poorly risk evaluated projects. In understanding what is actually going on in general terms, I think it can be said that Asian crisis will pass through four phases. The first one, which we have seen unfolding before us, is that of financial market meltdown with some dramatic overshooting on the downside being very much part of that-a very unhappy part of it. Secondly, we have seen the beginnings of the policy response and the external account correction that is a crucial component of that response-higher interest rates, tighter budgetary policy, the establishment of machinery and procedures for financial system rehabilitation, and the slowing down of the economy very sharply in response to these contractionary and tightening measures, leading to a lapse into actual recession, with the current account moving into surplus, remarkably rapidly in a couple of cases, as imports in fact collapse in response to those developments internally which I have just described. The third stage, which we have not yet seen but we all hope we will see pretty soon, is that of sustainable external account improvement through a recovery in exports, through a resumption of voluntary private capital inflows, through domestic activity still remaining weak enough not to be sucking in a great heap of imports and with inflation and interest rates beginning to decline. The final stage, which we all look for with enormous hope and hope will be achieved sooner rather than later, is a recovery in domestic economic activity in the countries in question with the recapitalisation of the financial system and a recovery in consumption and investment. Even if it is the case-and it is arguable that this is now so in the region, particularly so far as Korea and Thailand are concernedthat the worse of the financial crisis has passed, the economic effects-the real economy effects as distinct from the financial economy effects-are still to be fully felt. There are a great deal of corporate bankruptcies still occurring, restructuring going on with consequent employment losses and declines in capital expenditure. There is a significant destruction of wealth occurring through asset price deflation and losses of. personal savings. There are interruptions to the economic activity through lack of access to credit or trade finance. There is an obvious erosion of purchasing power going on through increased inflation and unemployment, and a number of government policy changes are also having their negative effects on the real economy, including higher interest rates, tax increases, reductions in subsidies and the deferral or cancellation of infrastructure projects. There is still a lot of downside risk, it also has to be acknowledged, for the Asian financial markets and economies. Whatever is going on by way of recovery could be turned around again by breakdowns in relationships with the IMF-and it is a particularly acute concern for Indonesia. A further devaluation by China is something that would be alarming if it were to occur. Frankly, I think the jury is still out on whether some of that will occur-if not sooner, perhaps in the last quarter, or the first quarter of next year-in response to an erosion of China's competitive position with some South-East Asian economies, which is being vigorously denied by Chinese leaders and officials. But, as I say, there is a degree of scepticism about whether that position can be maintained. Violent political and social unrest is a potential problem in a number of countries, particularly Indonesia. A continued policy failure in Japan to be unwilling to give the kind of fiscal stimulus the whole region needs, as well as the domestic Japanese economy, can contribute to some further downsides ahead. Also-and this is one of the many points that is articulated by Mr Eslake-a protectionist backlash in Western economies cannot be ruled out which, if it occurred, would seriously exacerbate the global impact of all of this. The overall picture is a disconcerting one when you pull it apart and look at the causes and the likely course of future events. The current situation, I repeat, has pretty much stabilised in Thailand and Korea, very much as a result, I think, of democratic institutions proving robust and resilient, much more so than might have been expected. We just have to cross our fingers and hope that that will continue. The other Asian economies have so far been dealing with the situation reasonably well. Although there is lower economic growth in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there is quite a bit of domestic cleaning up still to occur in Malaysia in its economic response to what is going on, and there is the situation in China I have described where we are all holding our breath as to whether or not devaluation can be avoided. Most of the uncertainties are concentrated and focused on Indonesia at the moment, with a very real doubt in just about everyone's minds as to how events are going to unfold. One scenario is that the IMF reforms are in fact implemented in a way that satisfies everybody and we get a reasonably rapid stabilisation of the situation, as has occurred in Thailand and Korea in that context, with the IMF activity being matched by an equally concentrated effort by private sector banking institutions and other creditors to work together to get rollovers of the private debt, which is one of the biggest problems in Indonesia at the moment. The other scenario is that doubts persist about Indonesia's capacity or Willingness to follow the IMF prescriptions, and there is continued total erosion of international confidence and a continued destabilisation of the internal economy as a result of the failure of the external situation to stabilise, leading to infla-ion, food shortages and all the re-t of negative effects of unemployment and so on in the real economy worsening with the consequences, all too unhappily real, of rioting and major civil breakdown. The situation is nothing like as intrinsically serious as it was in 1965 when there was massive poverty, massive inflation and a massive political confrontation between right and left also going on as a backdrop to the chaos that did then eventuate. To that extent, those who say, like Paul Keating, that this is not a case again of a revisiting of the so called year of living dangerously may well be right-and I certainly hope they are-but it is a volatile and very dangerous situation, and anyone who tries to trivialise or downplay the potential consequences of it is I think misreading the situation. One of the biggest issues thrown up by the situation in Indonesia and also thrown up generally by a recent course of events has been the response of the IMF and, indeed, the whole international monetary system to the crisis. We have had a pretty lively debate going on about the way in which the IMF has in fact handled itself and the situation. There have been two kinds of criticism essentially of the IMF's role. One that was more current in the earlier stages of the crisis was that we saw from the IMF nothing much more than the old one size fits all approach, in which the IMF reacted to the Asian crisis in exactly the same way in which it had reacted to many other developing monetary crises in the past and saw it as essentially a situation of public sector profligacy and a situation to be addressed as a result by imposing the usual set of IMF strictures with redressing big, exploding, ballooning current account deficits and high inflation environments by contractionary measures. There was a lot of that in the initial IMP reaction requirement of budget surpluses being achieved and so on in situations where to do so rapidly was going to have an accelerating, negative impact on the capacity of the domestic economy to cope. I think the current criticism is less in those terms than of a different kind-that is, the IMF, in its current round of packages that it is requiring people to sign up to, is overdoing the the emphasis on structural and institutional reform, overdoing the micro management of the patient economies in a way that would be absolutely unacceptable in dealing with a crisis anywhere else and which really is requiring not only an economic revolution but also in some cases a political revolution to occur. The arguments here are really quite finely balanced. Those of us-and I am among them-who have had a lot of reservations about the overreach of IMF programs and demands, particularly in Indonesia, do of course also frankly acknowledge that there are many structural and institutional problems that remain to be addressed, having at their heart the problem of crony capitalism, excessive influence from high places and so on and having a lot to do with an absence of transparency, accountability and basic democratic process in the political system. The trouble is that you also have to temper your recognition that there are these problems-and they are problems that need to be addressed, certainly for the long haul-with a recognition that the reaction to too robust attempt to impose solutions is likely to be counterproductive. Certainly, when it is accompanied by the kind of arms folding performance we had from Michel Camdessus at the time of the signing of the IMP treaty, you create a situation where the strictures, sensible as they may be in terms of getting the economy right for. the long haul, are not likely to be capable of actual implementation and do in fact undermine the capacity of the international community to see the stabilisation of the currency and access to foreign capital restored. So it is a matter of achieving the balance between, on the one hand, taking the steps which are in fact necessary to maintain a flow of foreign funds by recapturing the confidence of the international financial markets and investors and at the same time not acting in a' way that is counterproductive. The IMF has certainly had a pretty rough and tough record over the years. I remember vividly talking to the then Hungarian foreign minister Gyula Horn in 1989 when he was on the receiving end of a' very tough IMP restructuring package. He said to me, 'I have a very wistful dream that one of these days Michel Camdessus will be coming towards me on a red carpet on his knees begging me to bailout the IMF from its particular current economic crisis.' That is a reaction, of course, that one hears from many people around the world who have been on the receiving end of these strictures. The task is to somehow steer a course through all this that will in fact recognise the necessity for these bailout operations to occur and recognise the necessity for the IMF to preserve its credibility but not to operate in a way that is ultimately counterproductive. I did want to mention in passing one other major policy issue in international finance that is being' generated by this crisis and the international financial system's contributions to its causes as well as to its solution, and that is the renewed debate about the scope of the Tobin tax. I would like to incorporate in Hansard if that were permissible-I have discussed it with Hansard and they say it is technically possible-a two-page document an which is quite difficult and complex in its layout and certainly much too long and complex to read into the record. I would hope that I might have permission to incorporate that. Leave granted.",32
26,Mr GARETH EVANS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"I think that will be a useful contribution to the debate. Finally, I wanted to say a few words about the impact of all this on our own country and our own economy. This is really an issue for a longer debate on another occasion, but just let me make some very quick points by way of conclusion. The first thing to say is that the economic impact on us in general terms is going to be big. The estimates from most commentators is an order of magnitude of around one per cent off our GDP directly attributable to the crisis: There is some very interesting analysis around the place, including a piece by Stephen Kirchner in the Australian Financial Review last week, suggesting that, given that the· United States analysts are saying the impact .on the US economy will be of the same order of magnitude and given that the US economy is much less trade exposed to Asia than we are, with only around three per cent of that economy being directly exposed as compared with some 12 per cent of the Australian economy, maybe there is a significant underestimate of the impact upon us. Certainly we are already seeing the impacts beginning to accumulate in a collapse in tourist numbers, a dramatic decline in live cattle exports, falling world commodity prices in response to the Asian crisis and reduced demand for Australian university education by Asian students. We have seen the car (industry already being affected with MitsubisH- requiring 3,000 of its factory workers in Adelaide to take annual leave for a couple of weeks in order to reduce production of cars or car parts destined for the Asian market. No government could ever possibly have anticipated this crisis, its nature and magnitude. Of course, is a problem for any government in dealing with it. I simply make the point in conclusion, however, that for the present Australian government to claim as it is that it has acted brilliantly over the last two years to insulate the Australian economy from the impact of this crisis is simply hogwash. The truth of matter is that unemployment remains a massive problem for us, with a growth in both youth and long-term unemployment. We have had a rise in the current account deficit even before the Asian crisis hit. We have had a rise in foreign debt similarly. We have had an average rate of economic growth of just three per cent compared with the average 4Y2 before we left office. We have got a manifest decline now in both business and consumer confidence, developing at a very rapid rate. That is a product of a recognition by the business and consuming community that we simply have not got the kind of insulation of the Australian economy that would protect us from these further downside effects. (Time expired)",37
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I will say to the honourable deputy leader that the document cannot be incorporated as it does not fall within the Speaker's requirements and guidelines.",38
28,Mr BARTLETT,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"The shock waves from the Asian financial crisis have served to reinforce what has become obvious in recent decades; that is, that the increasing interdependence of economies in the region, in addition to bringing obvious benefits to the country, also increases our vulnerability and brings with it increasing levels of responsibility. The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 establishes the framework for the provision of financial assistance by Australia in conjunction with the IMF and other countries to provide assistance for adjustment programs in the threatened economies. The bill is significant in relation to Australia's participation in the IMP packages for Korea and Indonesia, and follow on a it package already put in place for Thailand. It provides balance of payments support to the recipient countries to restore market confidence and to try to prevent exchange rate volatility in those countries. The legislation involves amendments to the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to enable the government to act swiftly in the providing support for countries in receipt of financial assistance from the IMP. Under the bill the Treasurer can, in response to requests from the IMF for assistance, make an appropriate response to countries in need. This provides for an appropriation from the budget, compared with the package put together for Thailand recently that came from the Reserve Bank. There has been considerable misunderstanding and distortion in some sections of the community about the nature of Australia's assistance to Asia in this current crisis. These misunderstandings need to be addressed. Two things need to be said. Firstly, this assistance is not a give-away. Australia is not simply throwing billions of dollars of taxpayers' money into Asia, as some would have us believe. Nor, on the other hand, does it come out of the current aid budget. This package does not detract from our other aid programs. These packages-both the one already put in place and the potential under this bill for others-will consist of loans or currency swaps; not grants, not donations, not gifts. For example, the rescue package for Thailand to which Australia contributed in August 1997 pledged Australia to a currency swap between the Reserve Bank and the Bank of Thailand. The Reserve Bank provided US dollars to the Bank of Thailand in exchange for the Thai baht, with a predetermined exchange rate to unwind the swap at renewable six-monthly periods until completion date. Furthennore, the return to the Reserve Bank is equal in that case to the prevailing US Treasury bond rate. The bill will enable Treasury to make loans or similar currency swap arrangements. It does not allow for simple grants. Thus, the bill does not allow action which will impose any direct cost on Australian taxpayers. To the contrary, it provides the opportunity to earn some income as part of the process of providing much needed assistance to the region. Secondly, the bill does not expose Australian taxpayers to undue risk. As the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out, obviously there is risk in assisting countries in need, but there is no undue risk or excessive risk entailed in this legislation. Any currency swaps or loans come with government guarantees and without significant exchange rate risk. Australia, furthermore, is not out on a limb on its own. It is part of an international effort. Any assistance under this legislation must be part of an IMFpackage involving other countries, and Australia will participate only where such an IMF package is in place. This ensures not only a productive outcome for the recipient country but the means by which Australia can be repaid at some future time. Furthermore, any agreement must allow Australia to withdraw and require repayment if the IMF program is suspended or terminated prematurely. This bill and the associated rescue packages provide two important roles for Australia. Firstly, it is an avenue for responsible involvement in the region. This is what we would expect from a leader in the region, as Australia is. It would be grossly irresponsible, on the other hand, for any international citizen to ignore a crisis on its doorstep, particularly considering the potentially grave social and political fallout which may result from financial and economic collapse. Secondly, this bill is a matter of significant self-interest to Australia since the Asia-Pacific region contains our largest export markets. It is clearly in our interests to protect these markets by doing whatever we can to restore financial and economic stability to the region and maintain social and political stability. Some figures might illustrate the point. Thailand now takes $1.7 billion of Australian exports, which is up from $1.2 billion just four years ago. Indonesia now takes $3.3 billion of Australian exports dollars a year, which is up from $1.7 billion four years earlier. South Korea, our second biggest export market, takes $7.1 billion worth of Australian exports a year, which is up from just $3.9 billion four years earlier. Japan, of course, our largest export market, accounts for over $16 billion of exports a year. Clearly, it would be suicidal for Australia to allow total financial collapse in the region; the effect on our exports would be devastating. Virtually every region around the country would feel the impact, if such a collapse occurred. As it is, we are certainly feeling some impact. My electorate of Macquarie is no exception to this. My electorate is very dependent on tourism, and the crisis in Asia has led to a significant downturn in inbound tourism figures. We have seen already a reduction of 40 per cent from Indonesia, a reduction of 30 per cent from Thailand, and a reduction of a remarkable 75 per cent of South Korean tourists. This must affect Australia's tourist industry. In fact, the hospitality industry in my electorate is so heavily based on tourism that it is one of my electorate's largest employers. Almost 2,000 jobs in the Blue Mountains are in the core hospitality industry, with more in the Hawkesbury. In the mountains alone, there are nearly 5,000 jobs in over 680 businesses which provide services directly to visitors at some time. The Blue Mountains Tourist Authority figures indicate a decline of 20,000 visitations in February of this year compared with last years figures-although there are other factors that have contributed to that downturn. A number of local operators report declines of 30 to 40 per cent in their inbound market from Asia. For those who are very dependent on this part of the market, the impact has been significant. One or two operators who have specialised in catering for the South Korean visitors have seen their visitor numbers absolutely decimated. Fortunately, anecdotal evidence is that inbound tourist numbers from Europe and North America are beginning to show signs of picking up. Timely and appropriate assistance to our prime export markets is a matter of self-preservation. Tourism provides 11.7 per cent of our GDP, 13.3 per cent of our exports, and employs 694,000 people. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that Australia does whatever it can to protect these South East Asian markets, and to protect the ty of the Asian economies. Certainly, it is appropriate that the Australian government does whatever it can to assist the Australian tourist industry. While we are talking about the impact, or the potential impact, of the Asian crisis on Australia, however, it is worthwhile noting that it could have been far worse. It is worth repeating again what has been patently obvious: had the coalition government not taken action to strengthen the fundamentals of the Australian economy, the fallout on Australia would have been far worse than it has. It is not good enough for the member for: Holt to stand there and try to deny the obvious facts; the fallout would have been far worse. The currency collapse of the threatened Asian economy should be a clear warning to everyone. From the 1996 average to Ja,nuary 1998, the Malaysian ringgit has depreciated by 47 per cent against the Australian dollar, the Thai bhat has lost 73 per cent, the South Korean wan has fallen by 75 per cent, and the Indonesian rupiah has fallen through the floor losing a massive 203 per cent against the Australian dollar. South Korea and Indonesia have experienced stock market collapse, widespread financial losses and bankru'ptcies, and massive falls in living - tandards­ especially in Indonesia. Further, the tightening of monetary and fiscal policies, as part of their restructuring packages, will also create significant short-term hardship. Had our economic fundamentals not been so strong, the financial markets would have brutally sold down the Australian dollar. The results would have been accelerating inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and economic slowdown. It is not good enough for the members of the opposition to deny this fact. I will just refer to a comment in the Sydney Morning Herald by that paper's financial commentator, Max Walsh, on 3 Febrllary this year. He states: ... there is no doubt that Treasurer Costello's policy of winding back the fiscal deficit has been a major contributing factor to Australia's immunity from the direct financial contagion which has swept through the region to our north. The economy is certainly much more fireproof than would have been the case had a Labor government been viabili- returned at the last election. There it is, in black and white, in simple terms that even the opposition can understand. Yet it is evident that Labor has not learnt its lesson from this. I follow up with a comment----: Mt Andrew----:-Very briefly.",38
29,Mr BARTLETT,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"very briefly, from Mr Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin. He states: Whatever else can be said about the draft platform Kim Beazley and his shadow treasurer, Gareth Evans, took to Hobart, fiscal rectitude was not one of its more glaringly obvious characteristics. Again, if the Australian economy had not been growing so strongly, if we had not had such high levels of private sector investment, if consumer confidence and spending had not been so high, if interest rates had not been so low, our ability to cope with this impact would'have been far, far worse. In conclusion, firstly, it is essential that Australia is able to respond quickly as part of an international package to help countries in crisis, as we have done with Thailand and as we have committed ourselves to doing in Indonesia and South Korea. The bill before the House provides the framework for this to happen. Secondly, it is in Australia's best interests to do whatever we can to ensure social, political and economic stability in the region. Thirdly, the message is clear: responsible economic management, as we have seen from this government, is a necessity-not a luxury, as the opposition would have us believe.",40
30,Mr WILLIS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"I rise to support the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill, with the amendments as indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I recall that in our last two or three years in office we were, on a number of occasions, required or requested to provide some balance of payment support to Papua New Guinea. This occurred through the Reserve Bank on one or two occasions. Then finally in 1995, when the amount was in the order of some $70 million, coming on top of previous support, it was decided that this should be done through the budget, and it was done through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. What we are now dealing with in the context of the Asian economic crisis is much bigger balance of payments support. Clearly, there is a need for a structure for handling that, which this bill does by providing standing approval for such support so long as it is part of an IMF package. Such can be either a loan or a currency swap, both of which have been utilised in the three packages to which we are committed to this stage. The amounts of assistance which have been contained in these packages to which Australia has contributed-and our contribution to them-has certainly been large: $USI billion to Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. That is very big money, altogether about $A41h billion-almost one per cent of our GDP. This is substantial assistance, but so too is problem to which these packages are addressed. What this support relates to is, quite simply, one of the greatest financial crises in world history. Extraordinary devaluations have occurred in these countries: in South Korea and Thailand it is about 50 per cent and in Indonesia it is about 75 per cent. They are earth shatteringly large. Devaluations of these dimensions have extremely damaging effects on these countries. Obviously it makes their imports far more expensive. So it gives a major impetus to inflation. In Indonesia, which had virtually no inflation before the devaluation, just last month there was a 12 per cent increase in prices, an annual rate of inflation already of 31 per cent, and obviously it is going to go far, far higher. Monetary policy is tightened to control inflation or, more correctly, to prevent development of hyperinflation. Although interest rates in these countries were already high, they have been tightened much further. The credit squeeze inevitably means downward pressure on economic activity which brings increased business failures, reduced economic growth, rapidly rising unemployment and falling real incomes. In addition, the massive devaluation makes foreign debt servicing and repayment vastly more expensive if debt is denominated in foreign currency, as was the case generally in these countries. The borrowers of these funds-mostly local companies and banks-are faced with the impossibility of servicing such loans after the devaluation, let alone repaying them. As a consequence, many companies and financial institutions are technically bankrupt because they cannot meet their repayments or servicing obligations. The total outcome, therefore, is one of rapid reversal from strong economic growth, which in all these cases has continued for 30 years or so. These have been key elements of the East Asian economic miracle. What we have seen instead of that is a quick reversion to falling GDP, rapidly rising unemployment, soaring bankruptcies,exploding prices and general economic mayhem. }low did all this happen? Not because these countries had poor economic fundamentals. the Economic growth had been strong, yet inflation was low in these countries generally, budget deficits were low, current account deficits were relatively low. In South Korea they have been averaging around two per cent of GDP in the last decade and in Indonesia around 3 per cent. Certainly Thailand had moved up to eight per cent of GDP, which is getting rather high, but not exceptionally high for the region. In fact, for a couple of decades or so Singapore ran a current account deficit of some 10 per cent of GDP. Everyone thought that was okay. It was part of the East Asian economic miracle. There are a number of contributing factors which seem to me to account for these extraordinary developments. Firstly, there is the system of fixed exchange rates in all three of these countries-that is, fixed to the US dollar-which automatically caused these countries currencies to appreciate heavily as the US dollar appreciated, particularly against the yen. Exports slowed and current accounts started to increase. Secondly, there was a massive amount of short-term capital inflow into these countries attracted by growth but also by high interest rates. In 1995 they had $40 billion, in 1996 they had $100 billion and in 1997, instead of an inflow of those sorts of dimensions, they had an outflow of $12 billion. . What these amounts mean for the five South-East Asian countries in troubleThailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines-is that they had capital inflows of eight per cent of GDP in 1996 and a capital outflow of two per cent of GDP in 1997; a total hi tting of the brick wall in this context of 10 per cent of GDP turnaround. Why such a turnaround? I would suggest because of the increasing realisation by lenders that short-term capital inflow exceeded the reserves of these countries. Once doubts were raised by some deterioration in reserves as currency appreciated, it became a race to get out before there were no reserves left. This was not a rational approach. It is what the head of the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States, Dr Greenspan, has described as nothing more than 'visceral engulfing fear'. It certainly has nothing to do with the economic fundamentals. Thirdly, there was the unstable banking and financial systems. This was brought about by lax bank lending practices and poor prudential regulation. Once the edifice began to crumble with the devaluations and tighter monetary policy, bank bad loans began to soar. Nonperforming loans in Thailand are about 30 per cent of all bank loans compared to about one per cent in this country and about 20 per cent in Korea and Indonesia. These numbers could become much higher as the economic crunch intensifies. Another contributing factor is seen to be overinvestment---certainly in dubious projects such as real estate developments but also in key export industries. For instance, in South Korea where the chaebols, the conglomerate bodies which predominate in that country, have heavily overinvested in steel and cars which had been made less competitive by the appreciating won and also by world overcapacity. Now the chaebols generally are in a disastrous state. In all of this one must also take into account the role of the IMP. All of the previous factors that I have mentioned-,-the fixed exchange rates, the large short-term capital inflows and outflows, the unstable financial systems and the overinvestment---explain why these countries quickly fell into major problems once the ball started to roll. Why did it start rolling, particularly outside Thailand, which was the only country with a balance of payments problem? What is now patently obvious is that it was the IMF's policy of moving Thailand on to a fluctuating exchange rate which sparked an uncontrollable market panic. The Thai baht promptly plummeted once it was untied, and then a contagion effect occurred for South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, and the Philippines to a lesser extent, which were in a similar situation. What is now clear is that no-one-including the countries themselves, the IMF, the G7-was prepared for what happened when the Thai baht was untied. More worrying still, this episode shows that no-one around the world really understands how to effectively handle an international financial system in which about $1 trillion a day in capital flows moves around. That is about twice Australia's GDP moving around the world each day, or the whole of the United States GDP moving around in one week. These are fantastically enormous capital flows which happen instantaneously through modern technology. The size of those amounts and the speed with which they can move has meant that a whole new development has occurred which, frankly, the economists of this world and the economic controlling bodies, like the International Monetary Fund, simply have not caught up with. The IMP absolutely shares this ignorance of how to deal with this. There is a definite feel that the IMP, having unleashed the contagion in the first place, is now reacting blindly by prescribing cure-ails that are the standard prescription for different circumstances. That is, it is giving prescriptions for the old type of balance of payments problem, where countries had run lax budgetary and monetary policies, run up big current account deficits and had a balance of payments crisis. They certainly could come in and prescribe tighter budgetary and monetary policies in that situation because it all made sense. But that is not what happened here. Basic economic policies have been good. Yet, in the face of severe devaluations which will clearly cause enormous economic pain, the IMF is prescribing more economic pain through tighter monetary policy which is designed to control inflation-it is understandable to do that-and is insisting that tight budgetary policies are maintained. For instance, in the face of its mammoth devaluation, Indonesia was required by the IMF to keep its budget deficit to no more than one per cent of GDP-this in the face of an economy going through the floor and the forecast escalating for what percentage of GDP will be lost in 1998'. Yet the budget deficit is to be no more than one per cent of GDP. Given Indonesia's economy is likely to shrink by several per cent this year, tough measures will have to be taken to achieve such a budget outcome, including at IMP insistence eliminating food subsidies by April. This is at a time when Indonesia is short of food because of the EI Nino drought effects and has to import a lot of rice, which at the devalued rate of the rupiah has become vastly more expensive. On top of that, the IMP says that they should scrap food subsidies, making food even dearer at a time when people are losing their jobs by the millions and real incomes are being slashed. This is not only socially uncaring and perverse but also politically insensitive since no government is likely to be able to carry out such a policy. Certainly the IMP has recently shown some willingness to modify its package in this area, which is welcome. Also, the actions of the Australian government in requesting the IMP to take a softer line are certainly commendable. But how much change the IMF will agree to is not at all clear. It is strongly criticised for the extraordinary detail of the conditionality that it has attached to its ments to provide balance of payments support. It is not just a rescue package; in the case of Indonesia in particular it is an exercise in economic and political engineering. Much of the measures which they are insisting on desirably address issues that need to be taken up eventually-for instance, the end of crony capitalism and the breaking up of marketing monopolies-but these are not first-order issues to be resolved in a crisis, especially as they are politically difficult to do. If they are not done, the government is seen to be failing to implement the IMP package, which further damages foreign investor confidence and so keeps the value of the currency down. Of course, the most important thing of all is to get the currency up. Measures like this, which almost guarantee that the currency will be kept down, are terribly self-defeating. As I have said, the really important issue at this time is to stabilise the currency: to stop capital outflow and get capital inflow if possible. This requires restoration of confidence. It cannot be achieved by setting the bar impossibly high .. The IMF is also open to criticismfor not addressing the key issue of the momentindeed, making it worse-and that is the banking and debt crisis in these countries. There is nothing in the IMP packages to address debt rescheduling, without which there will be massive bankruptcies in these countries. In 1997 Korea had 17,000 bankruptcies; this year, an estimated 50,000 bankruptcies. The companies with foreign loans are already in major trouble, since they cannot repay them after devaluation, as are banks and financial institutions. The tough budgetary and monetary policy being pursued by the IMP is exacerbating this problem. For instance, bank loans to real estate projects are becoming bad loans as those projects collapse; shaky loans to domestic businesses are becoming bad loans as these businesses face higher interest rates and declining demand for their products. Thus the being banking systems are becoming more and more unviable. The failure of banks and companies agree- means that bad loans for foreign lenders increase. This is especially important for Japan, which is a major lender to the region. It lends something like $300 billion to the region. The Japanese banking system itself already has massive bad loans of around $1 trillionabout twice our GOP. Now it is estimated that another $150 billion of bad loans is going to Japan out of East Asia. At long last, the Japanese government has accepted that it needs to bailout its banking system. It has pledged several hundred billion dollars to do that, including by buying real estate, which is the cause of a lot of bad bank loans. Until Japan gets its banking problem fixed, it is unlikely that it will get its economy going again. In the meantime, Japan seems to be sliding back into recession after sputtering signs of recovery from its long period of recession and minimal growth since the early 1990s. So Japan will not be playing a role in the immediate future, or the foreseeable future, in helping to drag East Asia out of its problems by sucking in lots of imports from the region. On the contrary, the only strong part of the Japanese economy appears to be its exports sector, which is just what the rest of the world does not need. The US is calling on Japan to boost its domestic demand by a stimulatory budget package of $65 billion to $80 billion, but Japan has already had stimulatory packages since the early 1990s worth a staggering ¥77 trillion or about $A880 billion-about 1% times our GOP-which were to no avail because, as they blowout the budget deficit, the Japanese people seem to save more. - Maybe Japan should concentrate on bailing out its banking industry, and then at least that fixed it will have a sound basis for economic recourse. The failure of the IMP to address the banking bad loans problem in the countries to whose rescue it has supposedly come and its previous actions in making the banking crisis worse have been the subject of intense criticism by a number of highly respected international economists, both academic and market based, such as Jeffrey Sacks of Harvard University, Ken Courtice of the Deutsche Bank based in Tokyo, David Hale of the Zurich Group based in Chicago and Paul Krugman, an American academic economist who uniquely predicted the end of the Asian economic miracle. All these respected international economists, and many more, are of the view that the IMF has blundered badly in its approach. It is small wonder that the Indonesian government, faced with such a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes and loss overnight of so much of the economic· progress it meticulously achieved over three decades, is acting somewhat erratically, looking around for cure-aIls like the currency board, flirting with that and then dropping it, announcing a tax a few days ago on foreign exchange and then dropping it two days later and sacking the minister for finance and the governor of the Central Bank. Obviously, they are having immense difficulty in trying to cope, but who can blame President Suharto when so much has happened that is undeserved? Those who are insisting on so many changes as the price of balance of payments support are politically and socially insensitive and, arguably, not applying a prescription that is suitable to the problem. So what should be done from here? I would say that the IMP should back off on Indonesia regarding the extent and timing of a package and, in particular, soften its impact on the ordinary people of Indonesia. Secondly, there should be a major emphasis on getting a debt rescheduling exercise going in these countries, especially Indonesia. This could include an agreement to swap debt into equity, so relieving enterprises from debt servicing and repayment obligations. I understand that there are with some movements that way in Korea. Japan should be encouraged to solve its banking crisis as soon as possible and deregulate its economy more and be more receptive to imports. Unless something along these lines happens, there will be the prospect of a real meltdown in East Asia. There will be a chance'for a major reassessment of policy and for developed countries to discuss these issues at a meeting in April called by President Clinton and at the IMF half-yearly meeting which usually takes place in April in Washington. What is also needed, however, is a discussion of the capacity of the international monetary system to be prevented from producing extreme outcomes which have little to do with the economic fundamentals. This has now become a major issue of our time. There is no control over the outcomes produced by the international monetary system; it is panic reaction even by bodies like the IMF who are supposed to have the answers, and probably, as I have argued, the wrong approach has been taken. We need to consider what can be ,done to prevent the recurren-e of the sorts of outcomes that we have just witnessed in East Asia and to ensure that we have a more stable international monetary system. Doing that, in the context of the enormous movements of capital inflows, is a massive challenge to the world, but it is one which we must overcome if we want to have a stable economic environment in the future.",40
31,Dr SOUTHCOTT,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"In speaking to the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998, there are several points that I think need made in this parliament and need to be disseminated throughout Australia. The first point is that, with respect to the packages, currency swap with Thailand and the possible loans to Indonesia and South Korea are loans or currency swaps and not development assistance. They are not aid; they are loans on which we will receive interest and they are loans which are required to be paid back at some time in the future, The second point to make-and this rebuts some of the information that has been disseminated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing)--is that these loans are in Australia's national interest and have helped Australia's standing in the region by being the only country, along with Japan, to have actually contributed to all three packages in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. The third point to make is that during the Asian firestorm the pressure on the Australian dollar would have been much greater had this government not done its job of repairing and reducing the budget. When we came in in Marth 1996, the budget deficit was $8 billion. That was later revised up to $10.5 billion, The budget which will be delivered in May this year should show a surplus. The member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) mentioned the comments of Max Walsh in the Sydney Morning Herald. Max Walsh, speaking at a seminar of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, reiterated the same point and that was: if we had still had a budget deficit of the order of $8 billion to $10 billion, then the pressure on the Australian dollar would have been much greater. You woulo have seen the Australian dollar dropping to the 1985-86 banana republic sorts of levels. The second point to make is that almost every measure that this Commonwealth government has taken to reduce and repair the budget was opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party, in the area of health, for example, has opposed over $6 billion of budget spending. Had Labor been in government, we would be seeing an Australian dollar much lower than it is now, and that means that inflation would be much higher and interest to be rates would be much higher, with a high budget deficit. In moving to the packages, the first package the that was announced of $1.2 billion with Thailand is a currency swap agreement. This means that the Reserve Bank will give US dollars to the Bank of Thailand in exchange for baht. It will be at a set exchange rate and it has to be paid back at a set exchange rate. The exchange rate risk is borne by Thailand, and the interest paid is equal to the US Treasury bond rate. The point to make is that this is not $1.2 billion that we are giving to Thailand; this is a loan. The risk is the sovereign risk; that is, of a country defaulting-which is quite unusual. In Indonesia, the package is that Australia has offered up to $1 billion. That support is conditional on the irriplementation of the IMP program and it needs to be repaid at the conclusion of the program. It also comes into effect only if the IMP funds are not enough. It is the same in South Korea; we have offered up to $US 1 billion but the supplementation of the IMF resources will be required only if external circumstances change and the IMP package is not enough. That is the point to make: these three packages are loans, they are not aid. They are not development assistance and they are in Australia's interest. Australia does have an important role to play in the IMF rescue packages because Australia has more people studying Indonesian than any other Western country. It has more Indonesian scholars, not only on a per capita basis but also on a total basis. In Europe and North America, Indonesia often does not even rate a blip on the radar screen. As a consequence, we do have a greater understanding of Indonesia and we can act as an intermediary in terms of helping the interests of Indonesia. Looking around East Asia, there are remarkable differences between the countries. Japan, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WiIlis) mentioned, has been flat for five or six yearsthere is still an ongoing banking crisis in Japan. More importantly, the interventionist industry model has prevented the Japanese economy from taking off. The Japanese economy now has a prime interest rate of 0.5 per cent but the interventionist industry model, the MIT!, which is so beloved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has contributed to the Japanese economy staying flat. In Singapore there is a sound economic policy. The open economy is being seen, rather like Australia's, as a relatively safe haven. Similarly with Taiwan, which has had ongoing economic reform since the late 1950s and a period of political liberalisation as In Malaysia it is a different picture. Banking, agriculture and manufacturing are all strong ; but there has been a misallocation there in real estate and infrastructure. Indonesia does have problems with the interventionist industry model and we have to reflect on the fact that the Labor Party's industry model is an interventionist one. The Labor Party, two years ago, was saying that their great inspiration was the Mm of Japan. That was the sort of industry policy that they wanted to apply to Australia. It is the sort of industry policy which has got many of these East Asian countries into a lot of trouble. Paul Krugman in Foreign Affairs first highlighted this back in 1994 in an article on the myth of the Asian miracle. In Australia, 22.9 per cent of our GDP is in trade and 34.5 per cent of this trade is with Asian newly industrialised and developing economies. So Australia is more exposed due to the importance of trade with Asia. That is why it is in our interests to see these economies recover some confidence in their currency. In the bill it is acknowledged that it is important that Australia does not act alone and that it acts in response to the IMF packages. The bill also avoids any problem of moral hazard by saying that we will be doing it only if it is part of an IMF program and we reserve the right not to contribute if the IMF program is not implemented. There is no cost to the taxpayers here, but there is interest income based on the US Treasury bond rate, which is to offset the risk. The point to make again is that this is not aid; this is a loan. Regarding Australia's budget position, it has been the government's fiscal consolidation over the last two years· which has fireproofed the Australian economy from the Asian firestorm. Turning very briefly to Indonesia: in Indonesia, the key issue is the stabilising of the exchange rate. As the previous speaker mentioned, if you were to have the same fall in the exchange rate in Australia, we would have an Australian dollar at about USI3c. What we need to see in Indonesia is a return of market confidence, a return of confidence in the exchange rate. That will not occur without well. banking reforms and without financial sector reform. These transactions under the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 will provide balance of payments support to the recipient country. I commend the bill to the House.",45
32,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"We have been told that we have only a limited amount of time to speak on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 so I will not be able to canvass all of the issues that I want to canvass in relation to this bill. Let me commend to everyone in this place the speech by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) because I think that speech was extraordinary in that it covered a broad brush of the economic background and the causes and effects which have bought us to this point in relation to the problems of the Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Thailand and Korea. I think it is important that all members understand some of the background in relation to this and that we have a debate in this place about issues concerning globalisation. Essentially, what has happened is that there has been an impact on these economies of the globalisation of economy generally. This phenomenon of globalisation, the way in which controls by the nation state are very difficult to put into place and economic forces have become dramatic in their power vis-a-vis the political power of the state to do anything about it, is an issue which is going to be perhaps the paramount issue for consideration by parliamentarians and governments in the 21st century. Unless we come to grips with this phenomenon in some way, we are going to find many international crises impacting on us. In the case of the Indonesian economy, one might have thought a government as powerful and as ruthless as the government of Indonesia would have been in a position to actually protect itself from the difficulties which have been created. But the fact of the matter is that the values of the currencies of different nations are now outside the control of governments. Even the plan by President Suharto to bring in some kind of currency board to control the currency and deal with the current crisis has been pooh-poohed around the world as ludicrous. The reason for that is not that it would have been thought ludicrous 20 years ago but that now, with the force of the market---especially the money markets around the world, what they can do with currencies, the values of currencies and, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, the amazing amounts of money being shifted around the world every day-it obviously has a huge impact on all economies, especially on economies, such as the Indonesian economy, which are vulnerable. In that situation, Australia was faced with a choice. The choice was: do we assist Indonesia, do we assist Thailand, do we assist South Korea-our key Asian neighbours-by giving them repayable loans that could be used to help in this crisis situation? I believe that the decision to give these countries loans was a correct one. I think we have an obligation to do something about the problems of these regions for ourselves. But we also have an obligation, as I said at the beginning, to examine what is actually happening in relation to the International Monetary Fund and its role from two aspects: first, its role in the stabilisation of Indonesia and the other countries; and, second, its role and the role of the G7 countries in the stabilisation of the world's monetary systems. One of the problems we have at the moment is that, ever since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in relation to international finance and exchange rates, we do not really have a solid basis for the values of currencies. A lot of it depends on the behaviour of the marketplace. But, as many commentators have shown, the money markets can move around in ways which are independent of production, the value of labour and the value of resources. In other words, it can be a totally subjective matter. There is a lot of talk these days about the overvaluation of shares throughout the world vis-a-vis the real value or some concept of the real value of goods and services. We may have to face a crisis internationally before these matters are resolved. Hopefully not, but I might say that there is quite a lot of theory and empirical evidence which suggests that we might. Recently, I spoke with a gentleman who came to Australia, Hans-Peter Martin. He wrote a book called The global trap where he argues that we are moving towards a global crisis, especially in relation to the behaviour of the multinational corporations and other powerful economic instruments which are far beyond what many small nation states can control. The situation is not dissimilar to what . existed last century before the real development of the power of the nation state. What we had then was a situation in which economic movement, industrialisation and all sorts of powerful forces were unleashed and the state did not know what to do or how to handle these. The market went ahead and crises of a massive social nature occurred until the nation state was strengthened, the welfare state came in, Keynesian economics was introduced as a way of handling these issues and redistribution was brought in as a way of helping the poorer sector. Many people are now saying that we are facing a similar situation internationally with the creation of huge groups of poor people who are left out of the globalisation and economic process-people who cannot participate in the whole information technology revolution, people who do not have the skills or the access. These people will become poorer and will have to be looked after. If they are not looked after, crises on an internaassist tional scale will' occur. People are talking about the consequences for Indonesia. People are saying. that Indonesia is facing the creation of massive poverty as a result of this huge devaluation. Because food prices have increased dramatically, many people will be lucky, if they have a job, to earn enough to feed themselves let alone be able to purchase goods and services. In this situation where the possibility of starvation being faced, it is very important that the International Monetary Fund's programs be directed towards resolving that sort of problem. We in the opposition have said that we support the view that the IMF should tailor its package in Indonesia to take account of these social questions, especially the questions of poverty, food shortages, starvation and the like. Unless the IMF actually ensures that its package and the measures it wants to put in place take account of this, we could be facing a situation of serious rebellion in Indonesia. I do not think that rebellion would necessarily be a bad thing in this sense. I believe that the fundamental element that is preventing the Indonesian package being put into place is the refusal of the government of Indonesia to move towards greater meaningful democracy and a legal basis for its system, especially its economic system. We should contrast what has happened there with what has happened with South Korea, where the new President, Kim Dae-jung, has been able to move the IMF reforms along. That is because we have seen the actual democratic change in South Korea with the election of Kim Dae-jung. We have seen democracy at work, we have seen more accountability and we have seen more of a legal basis for the economic processes. Unless you have that as a minimum condition, it is going to be very difficult to stabilise the Indonesian economy. I believe that we should support this package but we should also support democratic movements in Indonesia. We should ensure that, as a result of what we are doing to assist the Indonesian people, we make it clear to the government of Indonesia that we are doing this for the Indonesian people and we want to the Indonesian people and, indeed, the government of Indonesia but we also want to see more democratic reforms and more action in relation to human rights. I wanted to say more about a number of other aspects of this matter. I will take that opportunity at another time because I have run out of time.",46
33,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"During the second half of 1997 three Asian countries in our region suffered severe is economic crises: Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The International Monetary Fund has offered direct assistance in conjunction with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The International Monetary Fund has also requested that Australia and other Asian countries offer support. In return, the IMF has requested extensive adjustment programs in each country. The support that Australia has given has varied for each of these countries: in Thailand, a currency swap; and in Indonesia and South Korea, repayable loans. I will go into a little more detail about the manner in which assistance from Australia has been given, the response that has been received to Australia's very swift reaction and also the effect it has qll:d, specifically on - xporting industries in my region. I would like to deal very briefly with the amendment moved by the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). .",48
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"Order! I simply point out to the honourable member that, whilst an amendment has been foreshadowed, it has not actually been moved.",48
35,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"ANNE KELLY-Thank you for your sound advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Holt has referred to the changes he wishes to see. He wishes to have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) publicly release and table in each House of parliament a national interest statement relating to the agreement. The coalition government has been very transparent and forthright in all of the assistance that it has offered, whether it be a currency swap or a repayable loan. This has been very well received throughout South East Asia. If the coalition government is so open with the Australian people and with the parliament about any assistance it offers, who on earth could the member for Holt be speaking about? Which government would be indulging in subterfuge? Who would be secretive about such a move? I can only assume that the member for Holt is referring to a future Labor government. If he has so little faith in his own future government, I am afraid that says very little for his own party. But they are the only people he could be referring to. If the Labor Party is going to be so secretive about any future moves that they make to assist in the region, perhaps he has a reason for putting forward his amendment. I would stress that the coalition government has been absolutely transparent with the Australian people and the international community about their modes of assistance and their motives for doing so. I will move on very quickly to the different countries and the situation they have faced. Thailand was the first to see a devaluation in its currency. The International Monetary Fund has offered a credit arrangement of $US3.9 billion. The total support of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is $US13.2 billion. Australia was one of the first countries to come forward and offer assistance. The other countries are Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. It was very well received throughout the Asian area that Australia had come forward so quickly as a responsible neighbour to assist in Thailand's time of crisis. We have undertaken a currency swap with Thailand. That means that we are giving them US dollars and receiving Thai baht in return. There is a minimal exchange rate exposure because the exchange rate is fixed for the first swap and, of course, for the final swap when we receive US dollars in exchange for our Thai baht. There have already been two swaps: one in September of $US400 million and another in December of $US200 million. At the time of this initial assistance there was concern expressed in my area. The argument was very much along the lines of, 'Why are we giving money to another country when we have difficulties of our own?' The point that we have made, quite rightly, and that the Treasurer has made, is that we are not giving. It is of course a currency swap, and we will receive our money back in full. There is another reason we are lending money. Not only are we being neighbourly and putting action to our words about being part of Asia but also there is a saying that it is as blessed to give as to receive. In our case, particularly from my area, we are one of the biggest exporting regions from Australia. That-is only too true. What happens when a currency devalues, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that imports become more costly and exports become less costly. It is often said in the bush in Australia that there are two sweet sounds we like to hear: one is rain on a tin roof and the other is the news telling us that the Australian dollar has gone down in value, because it means that our exports are more competitive. Likewise, the same is true for Thailand and the other Asian countries. When their currency drops in value, their exports become extremely competitive and their imports become quite costly. In the case of North Queensland, sugar, coal, beef and tourism are our major exports. Asia is a large customer of ours for sugar-41 per cent of world consumption is taken up by Asia. We have a 50 per cent share of Korea's raw sugar market, a 60 per cent to 70 per cent share of Malaysia's and a similar growing market in Indonesia. But, interestingly, Thailand is our competitor. They are one of the world's substantial producers of sugar. There was grave concern that, with their currency faIling, they would be in a position to compete against our raw sugar exports. The very swift action by the Treasurer, resulting in our contribution to the IMF package, has assisted in keeping the Thai baht as high as it could be. It is not something one can quantify, but it has certainly assisted in ensuring that Thailand could not undercut us any more than they already do in some of our raw sugar markets. Indonesia was the second Asian country to experience an economic crisis, as it still does. The IMF has given $US9.9 billion as a standby credit arrangement. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have given $US4.5 billion and $US3.5 billion respectively and there is bilateral support as a second line of assistance. The countries involved in this are Australia-again at the forefront-China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States. In this case, Australia's assistance is a fully repayable loan. I also note that through our organisation EFIC we have agreed to underwrite agricultural exports to head off a food shortage. Indonesia is one of our biggest competitors for thermal coal. This morning I spoke to one of the executives from one of our major coal exporters in North Queensland to see to what extent Australia's loan to Indonesia has assisted us in maintaining some of the markets that we hold overseas against the Indonesians. As I have said, one of the results of a currency fall is that your exports become more competitive. That has certainly been the case with Indonesia. They are the most aggressive country in the marketplace for thermal coal. As their currency has declined, their exports have increased. There is no doubt that the currency fall is linked to the drop in price for thermal coal. Most of their contract mining operations in Indonesia sell in US dollars, so it has not been quite as severe as it could have been. Many of the smaller mines are rupiah based. The difficulties for our coal industry are still down the track. For thermal coal, which is used in power stations, we will probably not see the impact for another two years. According to this executive, there is no doubt that, although it cannot be quantified, Australia's loan to Indonesia has assisted Indonesia to prevent its thermal coal prices from falling to the extent that they could have, further undermining some of our markets overseas. The very swift moves taken by the Treasurer to assist and to be a neighbour in South East Asia have enabled us to help ourselves as well. They have ensured that those countries in South-East Asia that purchase our products-and, as I said, they are very big customers of ours-are able to continue to do so because our exports have not become too expensive to them. Those moves have also ensured that the currency drops in their countries have not enabled their exports to severely undermine our exports in our traditional markets. I applaud the moves of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to see that Indonesia is not dealt with too severely by the International Monetary Fund. I would like to quote from Professor Hal Hill, the head of the Indonesia project at the Australian National University: ""Australia is now beginning to take a more subtle and sophisticated approach"" out of a realisation that ""pushing Indonesia into a comer is counterproductive"" ... A tough approach could create a backlash, and Indonesia ""might just tell the West to go to hell with (its) aid."" Excuse my language, Mr Deputy Speaker. That would be a very unfortunate situation for all of us. I applaud the government's moves to see that the IMF takes a reasoned approach to the crises in our neighbouring Asian countries.",49
36,Mr ROBERT BROWN,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"I am very conscious of the time constraint that applies to the debate on this International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998. I am disappointed with this time constraint and the urgency of the parliament's consideration of the bill. I have been stunned on some, occasions to hear members, particularly from the government side, adopting such a blase attitude towards the question which lies behind this amendment-and that, of course, is what has been referred to as the 'Asian meltdown'. One would be tempted to believe that what has happened in Asia, what is continuing to happen and what is likely to become even more severe in Asia is just some small peripheral economic skirmish. This series of incidents has been referred to as probably the first major economic crisis of the global economy and global capitalism. If it is, and if the nature of the responses to it indicate what we can look forward to in the future, it does not augur too well. The purpose of this legislation essentially is to put into place a legislative arrangement to make it possible for the Treasurer to unilaterally make appropriations in response to International Monetary Fund requests for support for the types of packages it may put into place to 'assist' countries that find themselves in economic difficulties, We have indicated that there are some aspects of this legislation about which we are very deeply concerned. The first one is that the Treasurer is not required by this legislation to apply any transparency to any unilateral decision that he makes, presumably in conjunction with the government-hopefully that would be so; at least it would broaden the area of responsibility. But there is no indication of that in the legislation and there is no requirement on the part of the Treasurer to offer any transparency about the reasons why he would make such a decision. There is no requirement in this legislation for the Treasurer to be in any way accountable. There is no provision in this legislation for limits be placed on the amount of funding that the Treasurer could apply for the type of currency swaps or loans which may be requested by the IMP. They are very serious deficiencies and we indicate our concern about them. The previous speaker, the National Party member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), referred to the need for transparency. I would suggest that she vote for the opposition's amendment because that is one of the things we will be seeking in order to amend this legislation to make it more acceptable not only to this parliament but also to 18 million Australians. I have no reason to have any faith in the individual, unilateral judgment of this Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the political interests in Australia which he represents. If there is no transparency, no accountability and no ceiling the opposition wants to know why and the Australian people are entitled to ask why. The Australian people are also entitled to ask why provisions of that kind are not put into place to protect them. It is quite illuminating that this economic meltdown has occurred among countries which were being identified as the Asian tigers-those which ,showed enormous growth and potential. One of the main reasons why that meltdown has occurred is that a lot of the investment, particularly the speculative investment but also a lot of property investment and a lot of short-term investment, was suddenly withdrawn. One reason for that was that there was probably too much investment that was finding its way into those economies, and the people and the institutions that were making those investments became a little apprehensive about the future security of their investments and they started to withdraw them. There is another reason too. Let me make it clear that I am not a conspiracy theoristbut I am a realist. There is no question that one of the things that encouraged the economic meltdown and the domino effect, first of all with Thailand in the middle of last year and then increasingly through other countries of Asia, was the deliberate ploy on the part of international financial institutions to withdraw their investment to create insecurity and to create those exchange rate variations because to there were major interests around the world that were capable of benefiting from them. There is no question at all about that. Those people who adopt a blase attitude towards these developments and think it is some little economic skirmish on the periphery of the world economy should have a closer look at it. I am sure that they would then raise the same concerns that I have. There was a withdrawal of investment and the domino effect then occurred as investors started to panic. I am not saying that they were all part of a conspiracy but there is no question that a conspiratorial basis existed in relation to a lot of those developments. The response on Australia's part to the demands of the IMF in relation to Thailand, Indonesia and Korea with those loans and currency swaps was a choice to become part of what the IMF and others have referred to as-but what I do not refer to as-a rescue package. What the IMF insisted upon in making available its share of that funding was that there would be no loan defaults by those countries. To whom do those countries owe money? They owe it to the large international financial institutions. The IMF said, 'Do not repudiate those debts. You meet your commitments to the big international lenders, the big investors and the big financial institutions. You make sure you meet your commitments to them.' They also said, 'You have to withdraw any of your domestic support for your domestic firms and for your own finance houses.' The IMF said they had to cut programs. A good example of that was the Korean package. They had to ease restrictions on foreign investment and on foreign ownership, and they had to make it easier to dismiss workers in order to look after the big financial instituis tions and investors. So the burden came back on ordinary Koreans, on ordinary Indonesians and on ordinary Thais to meet those commitments. Their governments were told to cut expenditure. But there was no requirement imposed by the IMF to ensure, for example, that there was ·any security given to the ordinary people within those countries-the ordinary people who become impoverished and who lose their jobs. Small farmers with loans lose their farms, their houses, their jobs and their incomes when there is foreclosure. Let me make this point as well. We know that, as far as international exchange rates are concerned, whenever there is a change someone loses and someone else equally gains. There are massive funds of international currency washing around the financial conduits of the world-speculative fundscausing many people to become impoverished and causing many people to lose. Equally, many people and many large institutions make massive profits. If they can make those profits, to whom will they be responding when they are developing their own plans, their own behaviour and their own responses? They are giant international corporations. They are not just financial corporations; they are industrial organisations as wellcommercial organisations with assets and income which exceed that of at least one-third of the world's nations. Of the 100 biggest economies in the world, 51 are private corporations. Let me give you examples: Mitsubishi is already larger than Indonesia, General Motors is bigger than Thailand or Denmark, and Unilever surpasses the entire economy of Vietnam. What we need to do when we see these economic difficulties develop is to look behind them to see what type of motivation may exist there. We also want to look at the impact it is going to have on ordinary people because the ordinary people in those countries are the people who are making the sacrifice. We have indicated as well that there are benefits to Australia in participating in what might be identified by some as 'international rescue packages'. We have spoken about the importance to Australia of trade with Asia; it our biggest trading area. We have also spoken about the importance of Asian tourism-$5,000 million worth of Asian tourism might be lost. We have also spoken about Australia's strategic position as far as waves of refugees are concerned. They are already starting to move out of Indonesia. Those countries adjoining Indonesia are very conscious of that; it may just be a matter of a short period of time before Australia experiences the same. So Australia does have to act as a good global citizen, to participate in these things and to assist, but we also need to look behind it and we need to expect-from the government's point of view as well-that there will be appropriate precautions built into legislation of this kind to satisfy not only this parliament but also 18 million Australians.  International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 is important for Australia's future economic prosperity and market access in Asia. The bill enables the Treasurer to rapidly respond to the IMF economic restructuring programs in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. We need to do this because we have economic and strategic interests in these regions that cannot be ignored. Australia's interest in assisting the recovery of the Asian currency crisis is immense. South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have a combined population of over 300 million people. Together, these counties constitute a $12 billion export market for Australian goods and a combined trade surplus worth $6 billion. That is $6 billion in markets that Australia has actively engaged-markets whose continued economic viability shapes Australia's future prosperity. Market access does not simply occur. It is the result of effective bilateral'relations and active participation in regional and multilaterover al organisations. Ten years ago Australia's exports to Thailand were worth $224 million; today tqey are worth $1.7 billion. Ten years ago our exports to Indonesia were worth '$528 million; today they stand at $3.3 billion. In the case of Korea, Australia's exports a decade ago were $1.5 billion; today they are worth $7.1 billion. This crisis provides a unique opportunity to extend Australia's presence in these markets through active participation in the IMF programs. Australia and Japan are already world leaders in this field-the only two countries actively participating in all three IMP pro-, grams. This is quite an achievement for Australia, and it is a leadership role that not go unnoticed by our regionalleaders- This is also an exercise in Australia's involvement in world affairs that will help determine A\lstralia's future participation i- these able export markets. ' We need to ensure the economic viability of these countries for Australia's continued prosperity and the security of our region. The continuation of economic' and political reforms in these countries enhances peace and prosperity in this dynamic region of the world. Australia has the opportunity to particiseeds pate in an international program to"" provide loans to our neighbours that will help alleviate their short-term economic difficulties. These are loans-not charity-that are repaid with interest. ' The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill provides Australia with an opportunity for doing good and doing well. The loans administered through the IMF offer far more than an opportunity to collect interest; they give Australia a say in the economic restructuring of countries with which we conduct a significant volume of trade, countries which consume much of our exports, and countries whose economic and political stability greatly affects our own. Participation in these IMF programs will allow Australia to shape the trading relationships that are of critical importance to our economy. Australia does not enjoy a trade surplus with America or England-quite the opposite. Our trade deficit with the United States is $12 billion 'and with the UK, some $3 billion. It is Asia who needs our resources, it is Asia whose children who are educated in our universities and, increasingly, it is Asians who spend their tourist dollars in Australia. Trade also enhances security. Australia and Japan are trading partners because we stick to the principle of comparative advantageexporting what we have and importing what w- need. This is the relationship that we have cultivated with Indonesia, Thailand and Korea, enhancing not just our bilateral links but also regional security. It is an ongoing process that could suffer if these countries are unable to overcome their present difficulties. The Asia-Pacific region has not historically will been peaceful. Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea all possess the potential for political unrest. Tensions between ethnic minorities, between the haves and the have-nots, coupled valuwith territorial disputes, present serious potential for ,the destabilising of regional security. Notwithstanding this, the transformation of the Asia-Pacific region since the Second World War has been profound. Nations that were amortgst the oldest outposts of colonialism have been transfornied into successful exponents of capitalism where the of democracy have begun to bear fruit. Critical to Australia's economic survival is our ability to conduct international trade, namely, the ability to get our exports into foreign markets. This is critical to Australia because of our relatively small population and vast natural resources. Australia's population cannot consume, what we currently export, and we need the revenue from these exports to buy imports that our economy cannot produce. The sea lanes in the Indonesian Archipelago are critical choke points for Australia's national interests. Australia's economic success is linked to South-East Asia's markets-markets that have a less developed land infrastructure, with most trade being conducted by sea. Over half the world's shipping passes through these southern entrances to South-East Asia. Closure or blockage of the sea lanes would increase the price of Australian exports, through increased freight rates, and create temporary shipping shortages for regional economies As these countries have evolved economically, they have also advanced politically. Sizeable middle classes have been createdmiddle classes that demand a greater level of political participation. These countries have lifted millions of citizens from poverty and are now active participants in regional and international organisations. One only needs to look at countries isolated from economic development as examples of what could occur to Asia's political landscape without structural economic reform--countries such as North Korea and Burma. A similar fate could have been the case for other Asian countries if the pace of economic and political reform had not been arrested by the lack of political will from developed nations. Fortunately, this has not been the case. As these countries have undergone economic development, they have also undertaken political liberalisation. In the process they have become better neighbours, they have become more stable and they have taken a greater interest in regional security issues. A good example is Indonesia, a country that has contributed to peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Angola and supported non-proliferation efforts such as the comprehensive test ban treaty. Economic development in Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia has brought a better life to millions of people and reinforced peace and stability throughout the regi,on. As a of the world once known for authoritarian governments and domestic instability, this region is now characterised by viable democracies that are adopting more open economic policies and alleviating poverty. The present danger is that this economic development will be arrested by the currency crisis and these countries will lose the momentum for further economic and political liberalisation. The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill gives Australia the opportunity to reap the rewards of our neighbours' future prosperity rather than opt out and suffer the consequences. Without our involvement in this plan, we could see our export markets shrink and our trade surpluses disappear. This would have a profound impact on our domestic economy through reduced demand for our exports and the subsequent increase in unemployment. In the longer term, this could spill over into regional instability, causing security problems for Australia. Australia has a vested interest in ensuring that these regions continue to advance economically, continue to be major purchasers of Australian exports, and continue with their economic and politicalliberalisation programs. The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill is not a cure-all for the countries effected by the Asian currency crisis. Economic recovery in these countries will take time as markets undertake necessary economic reforms. Successful completion of these reforms will underpin a brighter economic future, not just for these three countries, but also Australia. These reforms will not be easy as protected industries are exposed to competition, as prudential supervision is tightened and as these economies become more transparent. Access to capital is the most immediate challenge facing these three countries and one that this bill aims to address. In the longer term, greater financial transparency in these countries will ensure the inflow of capital as investors are better able to assess the financial standing of prospective investment opportunities. The reforms will also be a major step in liberalising market access and introducing part investment rules in these three countries. Using this as a foundation, Australia's trade opportunities will expand as our market access improves. The situation in Indonesia is the most serious of the three countries affected by this crisis, not because Australian exports are most exposed but because the political consequences that could follow the economic problems pose risks to Australia's security. If something is not done to shore up the Indonesian currency, the fourfold rise in the prices of basic necessities will have crippling effects on many Indonesian families. Without a corresponding increase in wages, which are already low in Indonesia, how long can the Indonesian people support these costs? How long will it be before the people vent their dissatisfaction against the government and, in the case of Indonesia, the ethnic Chinese population who own the shops and businesses? Indonesia has been the hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis due to a number of structural weaknesses in the Indonesian economy. These include import monopolies, a lack of transparency in the business ment and a weak banking system. Accordingly, the IMF package, in which Australia is involved, is aimed at liberalising foreign and investment, dismantling Indonesia's domestic monopolies and increasing the transparency of public sector activities. Successful implementation of these reforms will assist Indonesia's economic recovery. This bill enables Australia to ensure its future peace and prosperity by taking a leadership role in the economic restructuring of the economies with which we are most integrated. These measures ensure that our neighbours, with whom we enjoy huge trade surpluses, will have the funds and expertise to reduce the shocks of the Asian currency crisis. These three markets account for 11.5 per cent of Australia's exports-a $12 billion export market growing faster than almost any region in the world. If we do not participate in the IMP program, the rules of the trading systems will be written without Australia's interests in mind. We will not be remembered as a friend in times of need, but rather as a fair-weather friend. Our export markets will shrink, jobs will be lost and Australia's access to these markets could be placed in doubt. If the pace of economic development and political liberalisation is arrested by the current difficulties in these countries-as may well be the case without IMP involvementthe stability, peace and prosperity of the region could be threatened, ruining the progress made over a generation. The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill is about Australian leadership and participation in international affairs. It is about engaging Asia and investing in Australia's future peace and prosperity. We cannot afford to let our destiny be written by anyone else.",50
37,Mr ANDREN,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"It has become fashionable in the financial press and in the corridors of Treasury to dub any critics of globalisation as dinosaurs, out of touch, out of date and acting contrary to the best interests of this country and the well-being of the global village. I am not a dinosaur, but I am certainly a sceptic when it comes to internaenviron- tional financial dealings. This bill proposes a legislative framework for Australia's participation in so-called IMP trade rescue packages. These are emergency arrangements to rescue economies from collapse. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) says the current unstructured process is inappropriate and cumbersome when swift action is required. The parliament and the people will have no say in this blank cheque arrangement, as the member for Charlton (Me Robert Brown) so rightly pointed out. Such financial assistance, like that offered recently at short notice to Thailand, North Korea and Indonesia, is over and above what we currently pay in the standard membership subscription to the IMP club. The key role of the IMP when it was set up at Bretton Woods in 1944 was to provide balance of payments support for countries suffering from shortterm balance of payments problems. Some may argue the IMP played a very important role in recycling petrodollars during the 1970s oil crises to enable Third World countries to ride out the massive impact of the sudden increase in outlays for· their energy future needs. But the loans made at this time through the IMF have had a great deal to do with the parlous economic· situation and foreign debt these countries now find themselves facing. The IMF has sought to remedy this situation through structural adjustment programs, but this simply replaces one debt with another. The difficulty I have with the IMF is the membership qualifications for the club, where control is directly related to the amount each country contributes. In the same way that the US can underwrite export insurance schemes for its producers for far longer and for far greater amounts than we for instance can ever afford, so too can it and the ten wealthiest members of the club direct the fund. As in the case of Indonesia, the IMP imposes a structural adjustment program on the country in trouble; in trouble, I might say, not through its economic mismanagement alone, but through the profligate lending and investment from the very countries whose membership constitutes the top ten of the IMF club. Let me remind the House of the IMP's role in the so-called Operation Peso Shield, set up in January 1995 to deal with the Mexican crisis. A devaluation of the Mexican peso triggered paniC among investment managers all over the world, because over $50 billion had been invested from these sources into Mexican government bonds, shares and debentures. In three days Mexico lost 30 per cent of its dollar. value as money was pulled out of the country. In a frenzy of activity the IMF and Bank of International Se.ttlementsin fact just half a dozen people acting without any endorsement from the US congress or any member parliament of the IMP-had used $50 billion worth of taxpayers' money from industrialised western countries to protect the investments of borderless speculators. Michel Camdessus, the boss of IMP for the past decade, answered his critics then who claill1ed the disaster saving exercise had plundered the tax assets of IMF contributors for the benefit of the international financiers. Camdessus admitted that speculators had taken advantage of the $50 billion credit lifeline, but, as he said: The world is in the hands of these guys. Hans Peter Martin so rightly asserts' in his Global Trap treatise that: More and more often politicians and electorates throughout the world see how the anonymous actors of the money markets are taking control of their economy so that politics is left only with the role of impotent bystander. How many in this House can honestly say that this description does not largely fit their role, especially when we hand over power like this to the executive unchallenged and unscrutinised? Malaysian leader Mahatir was roundly condemned for daring to question the motives behind the currency speculation and international financial raids on his economy. Not for one moment do I endorse any of the racial overtones in his criticisms, but there were certainly grains of truth in what he was saying about the manipulation by the international financiers. Yet former British Prime Minister, John Major, complained in 1995 that it was unacceptable for things to occur on money markets 'at a speed and on a scale that risks running beyond the control of governments.' French President, Jacques Chirac, also condemned these international financial pirates who were 'the AIDS of the world economy.' Are we, as the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) said in his contribution, assisting countries in need, or are we assisting financiers in greed? The relaxation on the crossborder exchanges of currency and the abandoning of the international exchange rates in the 1970s sowed the seeds for this epidemic. The fixed rate system based on the US dollar and gold disintegrated and the faceless, anonymous currency dealers took over the whole system, setting the exchange rates between themselves. The so-called structural adjustment programs-as our library research team so rightly pointed out-usually had the result of guaranteeing repayment of private bank debt. The World Bank is on record as saying: For the IMF the need to protect Western Banks is the driving force. Funny, that. As our major banks enter further into this globalised economy, the need to protect their interests also appears the driving force in the marketplace deregulation at. the expense in this country of the small businessman and the farmer-those who were offered the bait, just like the Asian tigers were offered the bait, but are now blamed for their predicament. This is not to defend the policies of the Indonesian regime, which has been demonstrated to be self-serving, corrupt and having little regard for the impact of its actions on the living standards of its people. The IMF has, it seems, begun to realise that the demands it has made of Indonesia are too stringent and may, in fact, be economically counterproductive, and certainly socially counterproductive, and racially counterproductive. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the former Prime Minister Mr Keating have raised strong concerns at the social and political impact of the IMF adjustment program in Indonesia. As the Bills Digest, the research paper prepared for this legislation, points out-and I must commend its authors for the thorough, detailed and balanced manner in which it was preparedmany experts argue that the Asian crisis is partly the result of excessive financial deregucrucial lation and a 'willingness of international financiers to lend to private firms with no government regulation, resulting in a run on local currency and domestic assets when the economy showed strain'. As these rescue packages are premised on further financial sector deregulation and trade liberalisation, 'this strategy will serve to further entrench key conditions which led to the crisi!;'. Mr Deputy Speaker, if this sounds like a gambler being told that he can get out of gaol by borrowing money from the gaoler but having to pay back the loan before he gets out, then you are not very much wide of the mark-in hock forever. Ultimately, as far as can I see, the IMF funded 'rescue packages' not only rescue risk capital from the besieged Third World markets but also prepare the ground for ripe pickings for the financing sources after the struggling country's economy has been grounded. Who else but the very same international financiers are able to step in and pick up the assets of the embattled country at bargain basement prices? As I have said: economic colonialism. Just like the transfer of wealth from the middle and lower income groups to the top 20 per cent in most Western countries, so too we have this transfer of wealth on a global basis. Wade and Veneroso-two economists who the free marketeers and globalists might like to dismiss as 'leftist alarmists' or 'loopy loonies' or whatever-believe that the 'combination of massive devaluations, IMF-pushed financial liberalisation and IMF facilitated recovery may even precipitate the biggest peacetime transfer of assets from domestic to foreign owners in the past 50 years anywhere in the world'. For, just as there is justifiable suspicion about the motives of the international Multilateral Agreement on Investment and the free kicks and unjustifiable concessions it might offer the multinationals, so too there is widespread concern in the Australian electorate about the role of the IMF. But this is not to say that everything about globalisation, deregulation and free trade is necessarily bad and that agreements like the MAl might not provide benefits for some Australians. Foreign investment capital is for a small nation like Australia; there simply is not enough capital to get the investment going that we need to keep growing the economy. We have to be rational about globalisation and weigh up the costs with the benefits. We have to ensure, though, that the environment is protected, that labour standards are maintained, that foreign investors pay their fair share of tax and, most importantly, that we maintain our national identity. What we are seeing at the moment through globalisation are massive winners and massive losers. The winners are those who are fortunate enough to be involved in high-tech, high demand jobs; the shareholders in these companies; and the whole of society through the lowering of prices of consumer goods. But there is a whole raft of people displaced by globalisation and relentless improvements in technology. As I have said, parliaments can be rendered powerless in the face of such ultimatums from the IMF club, and the IMF itself is now at the beck and call of the world financial markets. So we are confronted with this amendment. We will allow the Treasurer to enter into an agreement to lend money to the recipient country or enter into a currency swap; the money is to come from consolidated revenue. I told a gathering in Bathurst several months ago that the billion dollar currency swap we made with Thailand was in our best interests, because the, rescue of the Thai economy was going to be worth far more than $1 billion to us in the long run. I still believe that we need to help Thailand out. But I wonder whether we really have helped to pay out the international financiers who helped Thailand get overstretched and in trouble in the first place. I wonder whether the IMP rescue packages are really only rescuing the value of the assets of international money lenders. I do not really believe that is what our taxpayers expect me to supportespecially those taxpayers so cruelly hurt by banks in this country that have entered the globalised marketplace now, with scant regard for their domestic clients' needs or financial difficulties over the past decade and a half. For those reasons, I oppose these amendments as they stand. I would ask-given the fact that haste in providing these loans is not everything, as Indonesia is showing-that any agreement to lend money to the IMP for such packages be referred to the parliament for debate prior to any such commitment. I do not believe that the opposition amendments flagged by the shadow Treasurer go far enough to satisfy my concerns or those of many Australians who do not believe that executive and cabinet decisions alone of this magnitude should be implemented prior to scrutiny by the parliament.",55
38,Mr COSTELLO,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"In summing up the debate on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998, I welcome the support that the bill has received from both sides of the parliament. This is a bill which is unquestionably in Australia's national interest. It is unquestionably in Australia's national interest for Australia to be part of international efforts which have the capacity to stabilise the economic situation for its neighbours and, in some cases, social and political difficulties which would flow from extreme economic maladjustment. This is a bill which enables the Treasurer of the day to advance moneys by way of loan or currency swap and to make a contribution which is not just in the interests of those countries concerned but also in the interests of Australia itself. And I re-emphasise that, If a loan or a currency swap is made, the amount will be repaid in full-not only repaid in full but, in most cases, repaid in full with interest. In those circumstances the Australian taxpayers get value for money not only by having their loans repaid in full, and repaid in full with interest, but also by having a contribution made to those of our neighbours who should be part of those international financing packages and have their economies strengthened, which is in the interests of the export earnings of Australia and in the interests of a stronger Australian economy. I want to make the point-and this is an important point to make-that we have no interest in having weak economies amongst our neighbours. There seems to be a view which is being propagated in some quarters in Australia-the quarters that like to feed on fear in the Australian community, some of whom have opposed this particular measure on populist grounds-that somehow it is in our interests to see our neighbours poor or that somehow it is in our interests to see economic dislocation in the economies of our neighbours. It is not. It is in our interest to have strong economic growth amongst our neighbours, because strong economic growth amongst our neighbours is good for strong economic growth in Australia, is good for job opportunities for young Australians and is good for rising living standards in Australia. Mr Robert Brown-Who has claimed otherwise?",58
39,Mr COSTELLO,INTERNATIONAL MONETARY,"The opposition has not claimed otherwise, but there are Independents in this parliament who have claimed otherwise. Also, there are newspapers which circulate widely, I notice, in rural areas of Australia making precisely that claim on populist grounds. Some of the complaints that have been made by the previous speaker in this debate, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), about international money lenders and those sorts of phrases are well known to people in this parliament, and we know who uses them and we know why they are used. The fact of the matter is this: this is not a proposition for Australia to bailout any international lenders, nor is it a proposition for Australia to help the rise of world globalisation or all of the other phrases that were being used by the previous speaker. This is a proposal for Australia to advance Australian national interests. This is what this is about. This is a proposal for Australia to see that we are good neighbours and it IS a proposal for Australia to strengthen economic opportunity in our region. I welcome the fact that the opposition has joined with the government in supporting this legislation and I look forward to the bill being passed. I have had some discussion with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in relation to some amendments which he proposes to move during the consideration in detail stage. I indicate to the parliament that I fully accept and will agree to the proposals that are contained in those amendments for the Treasurer to publicly release and table in the parliament a national interest statement which would indicate the reasons the government had entered into an agreement under this act, and I fully support the proposal that that statement have a description of the nature and terms of the agreement and the reasons the agreement is in Australia's national interest. I make this clear and I have said this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The agreements themselves will be commercial-in-confidence and there will be a lot that will be confidential about them. In particular, what will be confidential about them will be the interest rate at which the money is advanced, because there will be some sensitivity for both borrower and lender in relation to that, not just as to the bilateral agreement between the two of them but, because there are likely to be numbers of countries involved, there may well be different interest rate differentials between the countries. As has been the case, some of the borrowers have asked us to keep these matters confidential. Obviously, it is a matter of some sensitivity to them if they are negotiating different rates, and obviously it is a matter of some sensitivity if the terms and conditions available to the lenders are different according to the country that is concerned. So there will be much that is commercial-in-confidence in relation to that. It will not be possible to table the agreement itself, but I have discussed that with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and am happy with the formulation that there be a description with as much detail as practicable. I make the point that it will not be practicable to disclose matters which are commercial-in-confidence or which otherwise relate to national sensitivities. The other part that is contained in the amendment which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposes is that the statement itself be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report within two months. I welcome this amendment and the government will agree to this amendment as well. I think that the joint standing committee will have a useful input into that, and this is consistent with the government's general view that treaties generally should be referred to parliamentary committees. We have no concern at all that a national interest statement be referred to a parliamentary committee. In fact, I think it will be a positive thing to aCtually engage other members of the parliament in consideration of these issues. I have indicated in advance that the government will accept the amendments which are going to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Part of our reasoning in accepting them is to emphasise the bipartisan nature of the support for this and a full expectation that the 'amendments, as incorporated in the bill, will therefore enjoy considerable support in the Senate without the need for further amendment and that the legislation can secure a quick passage because the legislation is required before Australia will be able to advance any moneys. By reason of the situation now developing, it may be necessary to secure and advance those moneys within a very short time frame. So, having accepted these amendments, which I think are good in themselves and which I hope will clear a quick passage through the Senate, I hope that the legislation can be enacted with all due haste so that we can have these arrangements in place as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (1.08 p.m.)-I move: Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (after line 21), at the end of section 8C, add: 8D Public release and tabling of national interest statement (1) The Treasurer is to publicly release and table in each House of the Parliament a national interest statement relating to an agreement entered into by Australia under section 8C as soon as practicable after Australia has entered into the agreement. (2) If a House of the Parliament is not sitting when the Treasurer publicly releases a national interest statement, he or she is to table the statement in that House of the Parliament as soon as practicable after it next sits. 8E Contents of national interest statement A national interest statement under section 8D is to include: (a) a description, in as much detail as practicable, of the nature and terms of the agreement; and (b) the reasons why the agreement is in Australia's national interest, having regard, in particular, to foreign policy, trade and economic interests. 8F Inquiry and report by Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade A national interest statement tabled in the Parliament under section 8D shall stand referred for inquiry and report within two months of the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade constituted under resolutions of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The amendment has been ,sufficiently described by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his reply on the second reading for me not to need to repeat it or indeed to canvass any further argument in support for it. The reason for the drafting, particularly on the nature of the national interest statement and why there is a qualification built into there as to the description required about the agreement, has been sufficiently explained by the Treasurer and the subject of discussion between us, and I accept the necessity for some degree of circumspection on these matters as a matter of international financial negotiation reality. I only comment finally that for the Treasurer and I to actually agree about something is bound to reinforce the paranoia in certain sections of the community which undoubtedly exists in relation to this bill, and that is to be regretted. But what is not to he regretted is the passage of this legislation, which is an important step forward in advancing Australia's interest, both domestically and internationally. I commend the amendment and the bill to the House. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Costello)-by leave-read a third time. NA Message received from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills: Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 Flags Amendment Bill 1996 NA AMENDMENT (HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS) BILL 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 March, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Lee moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government: (a) is placing Australia's world renowned health system in jeopardy by failing to achieve new Medicare Agreements with State and Territory governments; (b) is misrepresenting its offer to the States and Territories, which amounts to little more than double-counting and putting back health funding which has been cut in the first two Howard budgets; and (c) has failed to adequately consult with the States and Territories regarding the provisions of this bill"".",58
40,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak during the second reading debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998. I know there have been claims made that there is no crisis in Australia's health system. Let me· refute that. I certainly would not suggest that the situation in the Australian health system would necessarily place it among the health systems of the developing world. But, in terms of the health system that the Australian people have come to expect and the health system that' this country can afford, there is no question at all that the Australian health system is in crisis. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the opposition spokesman on questions of health, has drawn attention, as last night did the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), speaking for the government, to situations where, for example, hospitals are identified as bypass hospitals-not because they are providing bypass operations but because the ambulances are told that they have to go past them, bypass them, because there is no room in those hospitals to take emergency cases. We have had examples where, in the process of people being shuffled and shuttled from one hospital to another, their health circumstances have seriously deteriorated, and there have been cases where it has become so serious that death has eventuated. There are other examples as well where after serious operations people are left lying on trolleys in hospital corridors. We might find, and we will find, worse examples of health and hospital care in the developing countries of the world, but Australia should be able to apply sufficient resources to make sure that our 18 million Australian citizens have access to top quality health care and hospital care. Of course, that was the purpose initially of the Whitlam government when the old Medibank was introduced. We well recall the very firm, unqualified promise by the leader of the coalition at that time, Mr Fraser, when prior to the election in 1975 he said, 'We will maintain Medibank.' No qualifications, no ifs, no buts-OWe will maintain it.' There were seven changes in eight years, and it destroyed it. I well recall, as everybody else should recall, that when we came back into government in 1983 there were over two million people in Australia who were not covered by any sort of health insurance. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as do all of my colleagues, that there were mothers and fathers who were not covered, who did not take their kids for necessary medical treatment at the time and whose kids now are carrying the scars of that lack of treatment and will carry the scars of that lack of treatment until they die. We were not prepared to accept a situation where that prevailed, so we said in 1983, 'We are going to reintroduce it, we are going to restore it and we are going to seek to lock it in.' We called it Medicare. Wesaw before the last election the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) emulating the comments of Mr Fraser, when the spokespeople for the coalition said, 'We will maintain Medicare.' There have been no major changes to the structure of it, but they have ripped the heart out of it. 'Oh no, we will maintain Medicare,' they said, 'but where the funding is coming from is another question.' We know, for example, that, in addition to the demands that were put on the states in 1996 with the first budget of the coalition, when the states were told that they would be required to help the Commonwealth to the extent Of $1.6 billion, we had $800 million ripped out of the public hospital system, we had $400 million taken from the. dental health program and we had $479 million taken from the mental health and the palliative care programs. The present Commonwealth government, the coalition government, is saying to the 18 million Australians, 'We are packing this money back into the system. We are going to increase in real terms the funds available to the health and hospital system by 15 per cent over the next five years.' The only reason these funds are going in is that the system was on the verge of collapse as a result of the funds that were ripped out. What this coalition government now proposes to put back into the system is the money it took out. I urge people in the Australian community to understand that, and I would like in this connection to remind everyone that the 1996 Australian of the Year, Dr John Yu, a former head of the Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney, made the following comments. These expressions of concern are not just coming from us. Dr John Yu said: I am not sure how well briefed the Prime Minister is. . . . I'm certainly disappointed that Dr Wooldridge does not have a better understanding of what's happening. Dr John Yu is not talking about some backbencher on the government side; he is not talking about some Liberal Party branch member out in the mid-west of New South Wales. He is talking about the Prime Minister of Australia and the member of the government who has primary responsibility for the administration of government programs in relation to health and hospitals and in relation to something that we still will continue to call Medicare, even though the government is trying to get away from that word. John Yu also said: Public hospitals ... deserve a better deal. Yes, they do. We have preand post-operation cases lying on trolleys in hospital corridors, kids being shuffled from one hospital to another because there is no room for them, mothers in anguish taking their children into hospitals and being told to go somewhere else and mothers being told to take their kids out of the hospital before the kid should be released from the hospital. You know who is causing this, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I want to let everyone know who is causing it. It is being caused by this coalition government-a coalition government which has an ideological fix on anything that is private and an ideological fix against anything that is public. So they are happy to support all of the private health arrangements. You will recall that they did, for example, put in place a subsidy for people to pay private hospital fund fees. One would have thought that those people who were members of private hospital funds would have expected to benefit from that. Did they? Of course they didn't. The fees now, even taking into account that rebate, are higher than they were when the scheme was introduced. The sum of $1.7 thousand million has been spent on that, and it has not worked. In New South Wales there are 400 people leaving private health funds every day. The coalition government's scheme was supposed to halt the loss to the private health funds and to reverse it. People would say, 'Here is a subsidy for me to go into a private health fund.' The situation is compounded by the fact that people in private health funds have themselves gone through this experience. We all know that this is true. You can have a public Medicare patient in a public hospital occupying a bed alongside a private patient for the same ailment, for the same operation, with the same doctor, with the same services, and at the end of that treatment the public Medicare patient leaves that hospital not owing one cent. The private fund hospital patient will leave that hospital owing in some cases hundreds of dollars, despite the fact that the private hospital patient has probably for decades being paying into a private fund. I would say that after one experience of that kind the private fund member would say, 'Thus far and no further. Why should I pay my Medicare levy through my tax and in addition to that pay private health funds, and in the face of that leave the hospital where I occupied a bed alongside another person who had the same ailment, who had the same operation with the same doctor and who received exactly the same services owing hundreds of dollars and the Medicare patient comes out owing not one cent.' I am very conscious of the time constraints. I have been prevailed upon to cut my remarks short. There are plenty more points that I would welcome the opportunity to make, and at some time in the future I am going to take the opportunity to make them. But my colleague Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, carries this fight right out into the national community, exposes the deficiencies of this government, puts up the alternative policies and programs and says, in effect, to 18 million Australians, 'We will not tolerate the dismantling of the public health and public hospital system. We will fight them right to the line.' Within the next 12 months there is going to be another election, and we will take them right to the line, and this is one of those issues on which we will win.",61
41,Mr SOMLYAY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Fairfax-Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (1.22 p.m.)-The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has asked me to make the following statement on his behalf. The Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998 provides the basic framework for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with states and territories for the provision by the states and territories of acute health services to public patients free of charge in return for Commonwealth financial assistance. The bill does not contain the substance of the agreements, nor does it influence the funding of those agreements. The agreements are bilateral between the Commonwealth and each state and territory. The bill replaces sections of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which contain the provisions for the Medicare agreements from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1998. The new provisions will facilitate agreements from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2003. The bill contains the Medicare principles by which the states must abide. These principles are similar to those in the current act. Eligible Bailey, F. E. persons are to be given the choice to receive designated health services free of charge as public patients. Access to health services by public patients is to be on the basis of clinical Cameron, E. H. need and within a clinically appropriate period. The arrangements are to be in place to ensure equitable access to designated health services for all eligible persons regardless of their geographical location. Other key parts of the bill include a requireGash,1. ment for the development of a public patients charter, provisions for national health development special assistance and the establishment of a health care information commissioner. Financial assistance under the new health care agreements is conditional on the development of a public patients charter. This charter will be a document for the dissemination of information about the provision of health services and the means by which complaints about the health system can be made. National health development special assistance will provide for major projects to re-engineer the acute care system, improving the efficiency or effectiveness of the delivery of health services, improving patient outcomes in relation to the delivery of these services or addressing the factors that lead to avoidable or unnecessary hospitalisation. For example, projects that seek to improve the integration of the acute care sector with the wider health care system or improve the linkage of information technology across the system may be funded. I thank members for their contribution to this debate. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Lee's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has left the chamber, having come into the chamber for the division. For the record I express my disappointment that the minister could not be bothered to return to the House and sum up for the government the second reading debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (H-alth Care Agreements) Bill, a very important piece of legislation that provides the basic underpinning for Smith, S. F. ' Medicare funding for our public hospital system. If the minister for health had had the courage to come into the chamber and sit here at the table for the bill's consideration in PAIRS detail, we could have put to him a few questions on the state of the negotiations on the Medicare agreement. I am sure many of my colleagues are also very keen to raise issues, given that they did not have an opportunity to participate in the second reading debate. I am sure they also would like to put to the minister for health quite a few questions they would like answered about whether or not their local public hospitals will be receiving sufficient funding to ensure public patients receive the standard of care to which they are entitled. Much as we like the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay), whQ is at the table, we are not quite sure that he will have at his fingertips as many answers on health policy, given that Dr Wooldridge, the minister for health, is the one who is meant to be in here at the dispatch box answering to the people of Australia about these very important issues. Perhaps I could put a few questions through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the minister. I know the expert advisers in the advisers box take detailed notes. They might be able to pass these on to Dr Wooldridge. If we are really lucky, he might even have the courage to come back into the chamber later on and participate in this debate. Mr Latham-He's probably out playing royal tennis.",64
43,Mr LEE,AYES,"Perhaps he is out playing royal tennis, as my colleague suggests. It is lunch time. First of all, we want a detailed comparison of the government's current proposal for the Medicare agreements compared with the current Medicare agreements with the states. We would also like a detailed breakdown and an attempted substantiation by the government of the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the federal government's current offer provides a 15 per cent real increase over the life of the five-year agreement. We would be very interested to go through that detailed comparison because we believe that the government is misleading the Australian people and the Prime Minister is misleading the Australian people when he makes that claim. We would also be very keen to know how the government's charges for funding for hospital care for veterans will work. The government claims that this will provide an extra $750 million to the Australian public hospital system-an extra $750 million which is meant to be addressing the crisis that currently exists in our health care system, the crisis that Australians such as Dr John Yu highlighted yesterday in his courageous comments demanding more money for the public hospital system. It is very clear that the only written material that has been given to the states on the veterans affairs proposal is a dozen words and 16 numbers. There is no way in the world that any state or territory could try to determine whether or not veterans will be better or worse off when the only documentation they get is a dozen words and 16 numbers. Mr Robert Brown-And little numbers at that.",65
44,Mr LEE,AYES,"Little numbers-as my colleague the member for Charlton interjects-that certainly will not address the crisis that is facing our public hospital system today. We would also like to know why the government has been double counting funding for mental health services and palliative care in its comparisons between the current offer and the existing Medicare agreement. We certainly believe a whole series of issues need to be addressed. One of the other questions we would have put to the minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, if he had been here, relates to what the government intends to do if it does not reach agreement with any of the states or territories. We would like to know how the government can guarantee that charges will not be introduced for public patients. We will be putting to the minister when he moves his own amendments certain questions about what the consequences will mean. The amendments currently before the House attempt to change the name of these agreements from the 'health care agreements' back to the 'Medicare agreements'. We know that this government and this minister hate Medicare so much that they cannot even stand for the word 'Medicare' to be in the title of the agreements. That is why they have gone to such lengths to try to undermine Medicare by squeezing the GP rebate, by cutting back the federal funding for public hospitals, by winding back the subsidies for essential medicines. They hate Medicare so much they are even trying to delete the title from the very federal-state agreements that fund our public hospital system. (Time expired)",65
45,Mr TUCKEY,AYES,"O'Connor) (1.42 p.m.)Everybody on this side of the House, including me, supports the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill, but I never like to miss an opportunity to point out to the people who invented the system of health administration we have today how the numbers actually stack up and what it basically means. As is typical with many other issues that abound, they created a system that gives Kerry Packer a free visit to a general practitioner, and to pay for it they imposed HECS fees on young students. That is borne out in any analysis of the budget papers. We find in the budget papers that before the introduction of Medicare the government of the day spent $4.7 billion on defence, $3.7 billion on education and $3.4 billion on health. They are the figures. Today's figures are defence, $10.4 billion; education, $10.9 billion; and health, $20.7 billion. If we add those three together and divide them by three, each group should have $14 billion. Fourteen billion dollars says that you have robbed the students of Australia of $3 billion. You have dumped your Medicare system cost overruns in two areas, including on the students of Australia. I have talked to a few students about this, and they are able to understand the arithmetic. You have given Kerry Packer a free visit to a general practitioner and in the process you and Neville Wran decided to put HECS fees-your party created HECS fees; nobody else did, and you know it-on students and thereby put the hex on students. That is the reality when we look at the relative sense of the budget figures. There is none of this 'think of a figure and double it' which is so common within the Labor Party. The figures show that the growth in health expenditure is being paid for by charging the students of Australia HECS. If you want some more evidence of just how badly the figures cQme out, let me tell you this. Pre-Medicare, the federal government spent $220 per capita on health. The Australian people could buy full private health cover for a family for $500 per annum. The figures today are that the federal government is spending $1,150 per capita and you cannot buy private health insurance-just hospital insurance with considerable restrictions, many of which were imposed on the private health funds in the original Medicare act-for less than $2,500 per annum, and you call that progress. The facts of life are that, in the end, the Australian parliament, in the interests of the defence of the country, which is a loser, and in the interests of educating our young people, who are not big claimers on health, is going to have to decide just how much more money it is prepared to find. I made a point recently to an executive in aged care, and I am quite happy to quote what he said. He said to me that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world. I said, 'You are right. The only problem is that we have been borrowing between $5 billion and $10 billion a year to fund it.' And that is a reality too. You can go on doing that while you give Kerry Packer a free trip to the doctor. There were 2.5· million Australians who went overseas last year; yet none of them think they should have to pay $20 to go and see a doctor. I mentioned that to a doctor a year or so ago and he laughed. He said that his previous patient had just put the Medicare plastic across and said, 'Doctor, I want to cancel my last appointment. I am going to Bali.' You tell me that that is what the Labor Party should stand for: Kerry Packer getting a free visit to a general practitioner. Then, to start and balance your budget, you rip $400 million off the students of Australia through HECS fees. There was a time when the education system in this country got more , money in the budget than health did, and that was just immediately before the introduction of Medicare. (Time expired)",65
46,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"I cannot resist responding to that lecture in Wilsonomics. I think the proposition developed in Wilsonomics runs something like this: you add up the pears, you add up the oranges and you add up the bananas, you divide by them three and wonder why you are talking fruit salad. I think that was the proposition that was developed in Wilsonomics-the idea that somehow HECS has gone somewhere outside the university system. The mc::mber for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) defeated himself in his own comments, because I can recall the numbers he used. He was pointing out that at the beginning of the Hawke government we were spending $3 billion on higher education and, at the end, we were spending $10 billion. That is pure evidence that every single cent and dollar of the HECS fees went into the expansion of university places around Australia, the historic expansion developed under John Dawkins. The member for O'Connor has defeated himself by his own words. He has done many silly things in this place but today he has defeated himself by his own words.",66
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the amendments before the House.,67
48,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"He went on to talk about heaith care and was raising the point that Kerry Packer is down there being bulk-billed by the local W oollahra GP every second day. I dare say that Kerry Packer, like half the Howard cabinet, could afford his own private physician. He would be wealthy enoughMr Fitzgibbon-Or a trust.",67
49,Mr LATHAM,AYES,"The member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is right. They would have the trust income and the private wealth and affluence to move outside the public health system. But even if he were down there, he would be exercising his right as an Australian citizen-and, I hope, taxpayer-to draw on the services provided by universal health care. There is no prouder achievement of the Australian Labor Party than the establishment of universal health care in Australia. You can go back-and your memory would go back to the time of the Gorton and MCMahon governments-when up to 20 per cent of Australians had no insurance of any kind, public or private. Does the member for O'Connor want to go back to that system where we have less than universal health care in Australia? Is he seriously suggesting that we go back to a system where up to 20 per cent of Australians had no health insurancepublic or private? If any citizen draws on the universal system, then that is fine by the Australian Labor Party, because we stand first and foremost for universal health care. We do not want anyone left out of the public health system. Above and beyond that, of course, if they are wealthy enough to take out private arrangementsbe they in the form of a private physician or private health insurance-then they can exercise that right as well, because they have the capacity to pay. These are the fundamentals in health. The member for O'Connor's talking about the hypothecation of HECS payments to the health system just proves that he is so far off target. In fact, he is reminding the House of his record as a failed health shadow minister under the Peacock opposition and someone who totally failed when he had some responsibility in health. If he was off checking the HECS budget during his time as the shadow minister for health, it is no wonder that at the 1990 election the coalition had to put up the white flag and say, 'We cannot develop a health policy. It is all too hard for us. We have been adding up the apples, the oranges and the pears and dividing them by three and we are afraid we cannot come up with any sensible health policy.' It was your Western Australian colleague, and you were his head research person at the time. He relied on your advice and, in the end, ran up the white flag. On these matters, the member for O'Connor is totally misrepresenting the nature of the Commonwealth budget and totally misrepresenting what happened on HECS payments. Every single cent and dollar went into the expansion of university places. If he has a problem with universal health care, I say to Australian patients, 'Beware.' If someone in the government side has a problem with universal health care, beware, because if you are of low income standing and they are going to wind back the public insurance that you can currently access, then you will end up on the streets. You wHl end up on the streets in an American-style health system where, if you cannot afford to pay, you .do not get treated. That is the sort of market that you want to establish in health care. We have had that in Australia, and that is why we ended up with Medibank in the early 1970s because of the Whitlam government. You were part of the shoddy crew that tried to dismantle it step by step, along with the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, given half a chance, you would do it again. We are standing-here defending public health insurance and arrangements in Australia and we will continue to do that until we drop.",67
50,Mr BOB BALDWIN,AYES,"It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998. This legislation reaffirms the government's commitment to Medicare, with the principles of free and equitable access to public hospitals on the basis of need. Furthermore, it reaffirms the government's commitment to more flexible health care agreements. Most importantly, it focuses on patients. But we have seen the bickering and the war of words over what constitutes a fair and equitable offer by the Commonwealth to the states over the past few days and in recent weeks. Rather than appealing to the hearts of tIle people, it is becoming more a point of the states, and particularly the Carr Labor governhospital ment in New South Wales, wishing to confuse the minds of the people of the state of New South Wales and the wider Australian electorate over where this government and the state and territory governments stand on health care. We have witnessed the childish walkouts by the premiers. We have seen the churlish tapdancing on the issue by New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, and his deputy, the health minister, Dr Andrew Refshauge. We have heard them crying out the mantra that there is a crisis in the private health insurance and that New South Wales is copping it in the neck with an elongated hospital waiting list courtesy of the crisis. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a cute line. Instead of the Commonwealth giving $450 to families, $250 to couples, or $125 to singles",68
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,I remind the honourable member that this is not a second reading speech but a consideration in detail. I ask the honourable member to focus on the amendments.,68
52,Mr BOB BALDWIN,AYES,"With all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am referring to the amendments, which talk about the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth. Thank you. Carr and Refshauge say that when people have the fortitude and the desire to take out private health cover to legitimately offset the costs of private health insurance, that is a waste of money and it should just go to New South Wales public hospitals. The Premier pitched his government's electoral fortunes on the mathematics of claiming to cut New South Wales hospital waiting lists by half when it came to office. Clearly, he is getting a little sweaty under the collar with that state poll just under a year away. Both Carr and Refshauge became Harry Houdinis for a day some time back when they said they had achieved their target. They had staked their jobs on driving down waiting lists in New South Wales by half. They were to resign if they did not do so, but the only thing they halved was the mathematics and the care for people in pain on waiting lists. A mark of a New South Wales public waiting list of 20,000 was never discounted in their equation for success. According to the latest figures I have to hand, the current waiting list situation in New South Wales is 50,778, of which 4,602 people have been waiting more than 12 months, and the average waiting time has rocketed from 27 days to 1.5 months. In trying to politicise an important social and health issue, Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge have fallen flat on their faces-by crying foul over apparent falling private health insurance numbers when we all know sector that they have stabilised. I feel it is important to reinforce for the record the facts behind the figures in the federal health minister's offer to the states. These figures need to be reinforced, given the political babble and dummy spitting that we have had to put up with in recent times. The Commonwealth has made a fair and reasonable offer to the states of an increase of around $3 billion for this 1998 Australian health care agreement. This agreement includes: $1.5 billion in health base funding over five years; $750 million for full cost purchasing of veterans services in public hospitals; $500 million for initiatives in efficiency and effectiveness in public hospitals; and $120 million for reducing public hospital waiting lists. The latest agreement on the table for the states, excluding the ACT, is an offer that represe;nts a 6.9 per cent real funding increase over the first year of this agreement and a 15.4 per cent real increase over its five-year totality. For people like Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge, all this money and all this good news actually gets better. You see, we have clearly answered in this agreement their greatest gripe-ideologically driven or otherwise: the level of private health insurance cover across New South Wales and the nation. Unlike the former agreement, the 1998 agreement has built into it a mechanism: the technospeak for it is 'utilisation drift'. In practical terms, the agreement on the table contains an adjustment factor that for the first time will reimburse the 'states for anyone per cent drop in the number of Australians privately insured. That adjustment factor-a mere $83 million-with no strings attached for the states, will be provided by the Commonwealth if we as a government cannot make a better go of legitimately keeping the private health insurance sector sustainable, unlike that previous mob opposite who were unable to achieve that.",68
53,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,AYES,"I wish to protest as 'strongly as I possibly can about the fact that we were not able to debate this Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998. This is important legislation, and we have been gagged. I now have three minutes when we would normally have at least a quarter of an hour on the primary debate. We have been pushed into this because this government, as always, mismanage not just the country but the parliament. They bring forward legislation gutting and changing things, andwe get two or three minutes. It is absolutely farcical. And it is about time they actually admitted why they do not want to talk about it. Why don't they want a debate? We are back on the Medicare merry-goround. The first vote in this parliament of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was against Medibank. His current vote is to take the 'Medicare' out of MediG.are. This legislation is removing the 'Medicare' out of the agreements. _Whilst in the previous coalition government they kept 'Medibank' as a term and took away all of its capacity, in this one they are taking out the word as well. So they are taking the 'Medicare' out of the health care agreements. Why would they do that? We now know why, because the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) gave it away. He is arguing now against universality. He is, arguing against universal access to health. He is now suggesting that the hidden agenda of the conservatives is to restrict access to universality. Australians are no longer equal. In the terms of the member for O'Connor, Australians now should be accessing health, depending on their means. Under the previous conservative government, over one million people were not insured-publicly or privately-and it can be seen that the day is coming when that will be the case again. We have just had a farcical contribution from the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who, incidentally, tells the-people in the south of Newcastle at Belmont, where they are closing a Medicare office, to go to Charlestown. He is telling the Belmont business people that their customers should shop in Charlestown. Mr Bob Baldwin-Why not?",69
54,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,AYES,"What a disgrace. 'Why notT he says. The fact is that people in Belmont would like to shop in Belmont and would like to use the Belmont Medicare office, which the government are closing. The savings they may make will be more than offset by what they are going to have to pay for the rest of the contract, because the contract for the office has another 3Y2 years to run. And the Commonwealth will still be paying for an office which they are not using. The savings they make on that office will be more than offset by the damages. But the biggest insult is the business community of Belmont being told that their customers should go somewhere else. Last week we saw the farce of Liberal premiers Borbidge and Kennett out there bagging this government and saying that this Prime Minister cannot lead; the federation does not federate. On health care, on housing, on disabilities, on a range of issues, this government is not leading the country; it is tearing it apart. When Premier Borbidge threatens to campaign against the conservatives at the next federal election on a range of issues, then Australians should be a little bit concerned about what this Prime Minister is doing.",69

56,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will be absent from question time today. Mr Ruddock will be addressing the Melbourne Press Club in Melbourne and opening the premises of the Australian Vietnamese Women's Welfare Association. The Attorney-General will answer questions on his behalf in relation to immigration and multicultural affairs, and the Minister for Health and Family Services will answer questions relating to his representation of the social security portfolio. The Minister for the Status of Women is absent from question time today. She is attending the Commonwealth-state conference on the status of women in Brisbane. Questions on this portfolio today will be answered by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Industrial Relations",70
57,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer that I gave yesterday.",70
58,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Indulgence is granted.,70
59,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yesterday during question time the Leader of the Opposition raised the case of Murton v. Lemmon Investments, in which the Industrial Relations Commission found that the employment of an employee of a small business was terminated for taking sick leave to which he was entitled, amongst other reasons. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that this was an example of an employee who would be stripped of protection by the government's small business exemption, but the facts are completely otherwise. The fact is that all employees in such a situation will have continued protection under the government's legislation. I inform the House that the small business bill, which was rejected by the Senate, will not affect any employee's protection against termination for a prohibited reason. 'One of the prohibited reasons is 'temporary absence because of illness or injury'. This covers an absence of up to three months because of illness or injury or any longer period if it is wholly on paid sick leave, provided the employee gives the employer medical certificates for the illness or injury or otherwise substantiates the reason for the absence as required by any industrial award or agreement. The government's bill will continue this protection. The bill should have been passed, and by blocking it the Senate is destroying 50,000 new jobs in this country. NA Taxation",70
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, when last year you withdrew Labor's legislation attacking trafficking in trust losses and substituted your own watered down legislation, did the relevant ministers with family trusts exclude themselves from the cabinet decision or at the very least declare their conflict of interest when the matter was considered around the cabinet table? Or was your reckless attitude to the concept of conflict of interest already in operation then?",70
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to say a couple of things about trusts, including the legislation that was passed by the Senate. The first observation that ought to be made about trusts is that you had 13 years to fix the abuses and you did nothing. For every question that you ask about this, you will be reminded that you had 13 years and you did nothing. You had 13 years to fix the ramshackle tax system. It got worse every year that you were in office. For you now to come into this parliament and pretend some kind of latter day outrage and with confected concern talk about the state of our taxation system, I think that is an outrage that the Australian people will see through. I can say to the House that the deliberations of cabinet are not things that I normally talk about. That practice of my predecessors, and I am satisfied that correct procedures were followed. War Widows' Pensions",70
62,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to - he Prime Minister. Mr Crean interjecting,71
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the honourable member for Hotham would be silent we would be able to hear the honourable member for Lilley.,71
64,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, would you inform the House what action the government is taking to ensure that support provided to war widows and war widowers keeps pace with the living standards and offers financial security and peace of mind to these very important Australians?",71
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to inform the House that this morning during a visit to the headquarters of the RSL I announced that the government has gone much further than the commitment it made during the election campaign regarding linking pension increases to average male weekly earnings. We have decided to take that further and to afford the same linkage to recipients of the war widows pension. As a result, with effect from the pension payment on 9 AprilMr Crean-What aboutTPIs?",71
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the member for Hotham interjects when I am about to announce to this parliament an increase of $6.80 a fortnight for the pension paid to war widows. You ought to tell him to keep quiet. I am very pleased to say that with effect from the pension payment on 9 April the pension paid to Australia's 100,000 war widows will rise by $6.80 to $378.60 a fortnight. Mr Crean-What about carers?",71
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Hotham!,71
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope on behalf of all members of the parliament that this nation remains immensely in debt to those men and women who put their lives on the line in the defence of our country over the years, and a discharge of that debt includes properly caring for the widows and widowers that they left was the behind or people who were subsequently made widows or widowers as a result of the subsequent death of men and women who served in the armed forces during war. The cost of this measure will be $168 million over the next four years. It provides a continued linkage between increases in the old age pension and increases in the pension paid to war widows. I would remind the parliament that the commitment that was made at the time of the last election, and indeed the provisions of the legislation only relate to pensions generally, but the government has decided to extend this measure because of the special status of war widows and the special debt that is owed by the Australian people and the Australian community to the war widows of Australia. I say again on behalf of all the members of this parliament our thanks, our gratitude and our respect to these 100,000 fine Australians. They are deserving of every cent of this increase. Taxation",71
69,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does he recall his Treasurer's commitment announced in the last budget to review the taxation of trusts and to release a discussion paper on the issue? Can he confirm that Senator Parer's very complex family trust and company arrangements are exactly the kind of tax dodge vehicles the Treasurer was referring to in the last budget? Why has this discussion paper been buried? Is it because up to 19 members of your front-bench stand to benefit from any watering down of the Treasurer's commitment to the overhaul of the trust tax system in this respect?,71
70,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the last part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that I do not accept the assessment made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The answer to the first part of the question is that the assessment of trusts and the review of trusts have not been buried. I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of what I have said and what the Treasurer has said on this issue on a number of occasions-that is, that will be included in the very comprehensive tax review that we are conducting. I can remind the honourable gentleman of this again and again: it will be included when our taxation policy is released. I say on behalf of the government that we have absolutely no intention of allowing the abuse of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle to go on unabated as the former government allowed it to do. The former government had 13 years to fix the abuse of trust, and suddenly we are invited to believe that the use of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle arrived on 2 March 1996. The reality is that for 13 long years you had an opportunity of fixing this problem, but for 13 long years you neglected to do anything about it and so many other things. It lacks conviction and plausibility for the Leader of the Opposition, who did nothing except embrace malign neglect for 13 years, to now tum around and say, 'I am the selfproclaimed·concemed citizen concerned about the level of tax avoidance in the Australian community:' If you were so concerned about trusts and tax avoidance, why did you not do something about it when you were a member of the Hawke and Keating administrations? The reality is that, as in so many other issues, you say and do one thing in government and you say and do a completely opposite thing when you get into opposition. Yoli ignored the battlers of Australia when you were in opposition. You ignored the working people of Australia when you were in government. You are now trying to rediscover them in opposition. I think they see through you as do the great bulk of the Australian community. Charter of Budget Honesty",71
71,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the ... government's Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, finally passed by the Senate last night, which is of great interest to my constituents in Hughes--60 of whom are present in the galhfry today. Treasurer, why is it necessary to introduce such a charter? How will the charter hl?lp to ensure the honest and timely reporting of budget information to the people of Australi!l?",72
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and acknowledge the presence of her constituents from Hughes in the gallery. A very big welcome to all of you. Make sure you send back the member for Hughes after the next election. Government members-Hear, hear!",72
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the people of Hughes will be glad to know that last night this parliament passed world-class legislation. The charter of budget honesty will make sure that governments in this country report honestly to the people of Australia before every election and at every budget time from now into the future. This is world-class legislation. It requires twice a year an economic and fiscal outlook; it requires a pre-election report on where the state of the Australian economy is at; and it provides an intergenerational report to be delivered every five' years to protect the interests of young people in the future of our society. This is world-class legislation and we can all applaud the outcome. However, I regret to say that the legislation was necessitated by some very regrettable events in Australia. This legislation was necessitated by the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition before the last election in March of 1996. At a time when the Australian accounts were $10,000 million in the red, on 1 February 1996 the Minister for Finance said: ' We're operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future. That was one month before the election. I do not think the Labor Party will ever show that it is equipped for office again until it has the decency to confront its past and apologise for the deceit that was practised before the March 1996 election. The failure of the Labor Party to confront the deceit that occurred before that election includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition two years later, on 22 February 1998, saying that that $10 billion deficit, which the then Minister for Finance tried to cover up during the election campaign, was not the product of any big spend-Up; it was just some lousy figuring by Treasury. Less than one month after Mr Beazley made the statement that the budget was in surplus, when we were $10,000 million in the red, the Treasury was able to come in the day after the election and tell us what the true state of the accounts was. There was no lousy figuring. The only lousy figuring was in the office of the Minister for Finance. He would not pick up the phone and ask the Treasury because he did not want to know the truth. He was trying to say to the Australian people that his failure on the budget could be covered up. Regrettably for him, he lost that election and the truth was known. The one good thing that could come out of that tawdry episode of the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, is that legislation has now been, passed in Austrdlia to outlaw forever the kind of conduct that he engaged in. It makes sure that nobody in the future should ever try to repeat that episode, try to hide from the Australian public information that they need. The one good thing that can come out of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition is that he has now given birth to world-class legislation designed to stop the kind of behaviour that he engaged in, and that will be a much better thing for the Australian public. Minister for Resources and Energy",72
74,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Senator Parer's employee share ownership vehicle, QCMM (ESP), was only wound down after Labor passed legislation to close down the use of such vehicles as tax rorts? I ask whether he is also aware that Labor's measure was opposed 'root and branch' by the coalition, particularly the then shadow treasurer, the member for Higgins, who boasted at the time: This is [Labor's] third attempt in 13 months to wipe out [these] schemes. We've knocked off the last two and we plan to knock this one off as well ... and in government will act to spread them wider. Prime Minister, why should the public have any confidence in your tax plans when your Treasurer wanted to make it optional for high, income earners, like Senator Parer, to pay tax?",73
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is nothing new on Parer if this is all he has to say. I will say just a couple of things in response. As always with the member for Hotham, I will carefully check the detail of the question. The other day he asked me something about QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd and he was wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has now caught the disease because he was wrong when he asked me a question about unfair dismissal. . Can I just say generally in reply to the . member for Hotham that I am proud of everything my party has done to expand share ownership in this country. One of my great ambitions is to see Australia become the greatest share owning democracy in the whole world. As I said at my party's convention, just as the founder of the Liberal Party of Australia made Australia the greatest home owning democracy in the world, it is my hope that under my government-which will stretch years into the future-Australia will become the greatest share owning democracy in the world. Unlike the Labor Party, we like the idea of people buying shares in the companies they work for. Unlike the Labor Party, we want share ownership to expand, and I defend every action taken by my colleague, the then shadow Treasurer, the now Treasurer of Australia, to expand share ownership in Australia. That is not something of which I am ashamed; that is something of which I am proud. It is about time you realised that this ridiculous muckraking is right off cue in so far as the mainstream of the Australian community is concerned. Commonwealth Debt",73
76,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, can you advise the House as to the level of Commonwealth government debt at the time of the government's election just over two years ago? How does this compare with debt levels in the 1970s and 1980s? How is the government acting to reduce debt for the benefit of all Australians?",73
77,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think the House would be interested to get some idea of the debt position of the Commonwealth and what the government intends to do about it. Just put this in perspective, when the Whitlam government came to power in 1972' the Commonwealth netdebt was about $1 billion or 2.5 per cent of GDP. That had been the level of Commonwealth debt throughout the 1960s and 1970s. As a result of recession in 1982-83, when the Hawke government came to office in 1983 Commonwealth debt was about $9.7 billion or about 5.6 per cent of GDP.",74
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I acknowledge the' concern of the Labor Party that debt had gone from about 2.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent of GDP. I acknowledge their concern that it was as high as 5.6 per cent of GDP. When this government came to office in 1996, after 13 years of Labor government-which had started off with debt at $9 billion or 5.6 per cent of GDP-debt had gone to $95 billion or 20 per cent of GDP. Mr Wilton interjecting",74
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Isaacs!,74
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do acknowledge the concern of the Labor Party that debt was at 5.6 per cent in 1983. Where is your concern about it being at 20 per cent in 1996? Mr Wilton interjecting,74
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Isaacs.,74
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a proportion of a growing economy, it had quadrupled. In terms of absolute numbers, it had gone up by 10 times, from $9 billion to $90 billion. I have actually gone back and done some historical analysis. The historical analysis shows that the two worse years in the post-war era in terms of accrual of debt for the Commonwealth were the two years from 1993 to 1995, and the finance minister of the time wasGovernment members-Beazley!",74
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The statistical analysis concludes, without a shadow of a doubt, that the worse finance minister in Australian federal history was the Leader of the Opposition. He was the worse finance minister into Australian federal history. In two years he presided over an increase of $26 billion of debt. When Labor had come to office, the Commonwealth, in the whole history of federation up to 1993, had accumulated $9 billion of debt, and in two years he had accumulated three times what had taken 83 years to build up. This government has put Australia on a path which will take debt to GDP down from 20 per cent to 10 per cent by the year 2000-2001-isn't that great?-to get the liabilities off future generations of Australians. With the government's privatisation proposal in relation to Telstra and repaying debt we ,could take Commonwealth net debt back to four per cent of GDP-back to pre-Labor levels. We could finally with that privatisation get the debt to GDP level back to pre-HawkeKeating-Beazley levels; and wouldn't that be a great achievement for the young people of Australia? The young people of Australia would have their debt liabilities brought right back to historical standards by this government. That is one of the reasons why we engage in privatisation. Just to pick up on a point that was made before: we actually believe in employee share ownership schemes unqualifiedly. To give an example of one of the best employee share ownership schemes you have ever seen, in relation to Telstra-which the Australian Labor Party opposed and which the unions of the Australian Labor Party opposed-the number of Telstra employees who took up shares was 92 per cent. That was opposed by the Australian Labor Party and opposed by the unions which pull the strings on the Leader of the Opposition. They were opposing giving the workers a share and a stake in a great national asset. That is why we stand with the employees of Telstra, 92 per cent of whom agree with us and took up shares. Minister for Resources and Energy",74
85,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, again, is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall his argument of Tuesday in relation to the QCMM (ESP) sale of its Pan Australian shares to Lacetal Pty Ltd? He said: ... the purchaser of the shares had no relationship at all to the minister or to the Parer family. Is the Prime Minister. aware that, at the time of the Lacetal purchase, Mr Harold Shand was a director, the same Harold Shand who is secretary of the Parer family trust and Director of Queensland Coal, Kiskin and AQRM, and the same Harold Shand who is a long-time friend, legal adviser and golfing partner of Senator Warwi<;k Parer?",75
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what?,75
87,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So what, you say. Prime Minister, so what? How could you claim the purchaser of Pan Australian shares 'had no relationship at all to the minister or to the family trust'? Hasn't Senator Parer caused you to. mislead this parliament?",75
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The advice that I had was that there was absolutely no relationship in a business senseMrs Crosio--In a business sense!,75
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Prospect!,75
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but, most importantly, there was no common pecuniary interest between Senator Parer and the company-and anybody who has an atom of understanding of commercial practice would know how absolutely ridiculous your proposition is. The fact that you might have the same lawyer involved in relation to a couple of companies does not indicate a common pecuniary interest. You just illustrate by these questions that you do not have any allegations of substance against Senator Parer. You have no allegations of any conflict of interest. You have not demonstrated that he has enriched himself, and the more you go on with these inane questions, the more you aggravate the Australian community. Waterfront",75
91,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, recent media reports have highlighted the level of remuneration received by waterfront workers. Could you advise the House of the accuracy of these reports?",75
92,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In the last few days,75
93,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,75
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before the minister starts, can we have silence please. Mrs Crosio interjecting",75
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Prospect!,75
96,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am invited to start with a rort for the day. Why disappoint them, Mr Speaker? Today's rort of the day is the fact that Patricks have a terminal in Rockhampton which is idle for about 60 or 70 per cent of the time and one of their employees, in respect of the terminal at Rockhampton, actually lives in Mackay. Every now and again Patricks have work that they want done in Mackay, which is the town where he lives, but because he is registered to work in Rockhampton, when they ask him to work in Mackay they have to pay him a travel allowance to fictionally go from Rockhampton to Mackay-when he already lives there! Not only that, when he fictionally transfers himself from Rockhampton to Mackay where he lives, they have to pay him $100 a day to look after himself whilst he is living in his own home town. Then, when he has finished his job, they have to pay him fictionally to go from Mackay to Rockhampton, when in fact he lives in Mackay. Let me return to the question: there has been a debate raging in the papers in the last few days, basically under the heading, 'Anatomy of a pay slip.' The wharfies are a bit concerned that the word is out about how much they earn and they have been tabling and giving to the press their pay slips to show people they do not earn 90,000 bucks a year, after all, and they certainly do not earn the $70,000 to $74,000 on average which has been shown by independent analysis. Opposition members-Where is John Sharp?",75
97,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We can all play the anatomy of a pay slip game. Today I produce two pay slips which have been appropriately sanitised to remove all reference to any individual. One is for someone who works in Port Botany who is on $95,470 a year and the other is on a gross salary of $93,058.",76

I suggest you express them in the right way. Mr Albanese-We can't hear him.",76
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Grayndler!,76
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I also have here a list of the salaries paid for persons in the stevedoring industry out of particular sites showing the top gross incomes of a series of individuals. The fact of tpe matter is that the figures that we have produced, which are contested by the wharfies, are in fact independently assessed figures. They give you a true appreciation of remuneration. As I have said repeatedly, by any reasonable community standard, wharfies are well and truly paid in excess of community standards. Sadly, for the balance of the community, we do not receive the level of productivity we otherwise should receive. Mr O'Connor-Tell us about Parer.",76
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Corio!,76
103,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude by saying that these figures are one of the reasons the government has overwhelming support for the reform process under way on the Australian waterfront. To give members an idea of the sense of community opinion on this, I will read from some of the letters I have received in recent days on this issue. This one says to the government: Please pursue to the end . . . which puts it rather well. Another says: A Government with enough. conviction to do something about our waterfront has been a long time coming . . . This one says: Please do not lose your resolve, and be assured that the majority of thinking Aussies are right behind you. Another says: · .. I wish to express my support with any thing that you do ... This one says: It is about time the public were reminded and informed of the frequency during W.War 2 when troops had to load the ships on the waterfront due to the contrariness of the waterside workers. Another, addressed to the PM, says: I fully support your strong stand ... This one says: · .. Australia has been held to ransom by thewharfiesfor far too long. · ... the majority of Australians are definitely not in favour with the MUA stand. This one says, and I paraphrase: I recall when Bob Hawke ... announced a great victory for his Government whereas the truth was that John Coombs and his cohorts took the Government and the taxpayers to the cleaners.

115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain to families earning $35,000 why this government is forcing them to find an extra $55 a week to support their young unemployed adults after the youth allowance is introduced in July? Does the Prime Minister agree with the Minister for Social Security that families earning $35,000 a year can afford to pay be.cause they are 'relatively well off'? Can the Prime Minister explain why he thinks it is fair to force struggling parents pay for their {;hildren's unemployment ,while wealthy parents like the Parers actually save money by distributing family trust income to their adult children?",77
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l will come to th-' qlJestion of family trusts in a moment. The, first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question related to the new youth allowance. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has given me an opportunity to explain to the , . 1713 Australian community the philosophy that lies behind the new youth allowance system. The purpose of this new policy-and might 1 say that 1 think it is an excellent policy-is to remove the disincentive against participation in the work force or participation in training which exists in current social security arrangements. One of the problems with the present arrangement is that you can often receive more for being out of work than for being 'involved in study or training. The philosophy that lies behind it is to reverse those incentives to give people an incentive to pursue training, to give people an incentive to pursue more education. Quite wisely, 1 think the government has adopted the attitude that people should not leave school without a job being arranged or without some",77
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order,77
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'-He asked me about the new allowance, and I am answering him.",77
119,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order goes to relevance. The Prime Minister is talking about a different situation. I am talking about adults who happen to be children in this situation18to 21-year-olds.,77
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is in order.,77
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are for a social welfare system that does not provide a disincentive to people undertaking further education and undertaking further training. One of the cornerstones of the youth allowance proposal is that people should not leave school unless they are going into some kind of training or unless they have a job arranged. The idea that people should simply leave school without any kind of job or after-school training in mind is the sort of attitude and the to sort of incentive in the social welfa,re system that was left ,to us by our predecessors. That is why we are proposing to introduce the youth allowance system. 1 think it is a policy that has been very widely applauded. Might 1 say-l know this will be of enormous interest to many of my own colleagues, both in the Liberal Party and in the National Party-that the regions and the rural areas of Australia and the young people of the regions and the rural areas of Australia will be massive be-bficiaries under the youth allowance system. Once again, by asking this question in the way that he has, the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates to the people of the country areas of Australia that he has no sympathy, no understanding and no interest in their future or in their welfare. There are tens of thousands of young people in rural and regional Australia who will be massively benefited by the new youth allowance system because it contains very significant increases in the living away from home allowances for people from the regional and rural areas of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition then moved on to the question of family trusts and the taxation arrangements that apply to them. I would remind you that essentially the taxation treatment of a family trust is a taxation structure that you created, you preserved and you did nothing about in the 13. years that you were in government. They have finally discovered-after being in government for 13 years and being in opposition for two years, and when they read a taxation office report about a period of time that ended almost coincidentally with their ejection from the government benches of this country-with phoney confected outrage, that there is a problem that has to be addressed. Let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition and to those who sit opposite: you had 13 years; you had your opportunity to fix what you now describe as the obscenity of certain trust arrangements. The Australian people woke up to you. The Australian people threw you out. We will be producing a comprehensive reform of the Australian taxation system. That will include, unlike your pathetic attempts to reform the Australian taxation system, a comprehensive attack on tax avoidance practices that you left unattended over the 13 long years that you were in government.",77
122,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, would you inform the House of the status of the economic integration process with New Zealand? What outcomes have been delivered to transTasman commercial links and what are the prospects for the future?",78
123,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Aston for his question. It is a timely reminder that this week is the 15th anniversary of the signing between Australia and New Zealand of the closer economic relations trade agreement, or CER. It is a very positive document which has done much to create extra jobs here in Australia as well as in New Zealand. We expect to exceed $10 billion in bilateral trade between Australia and New Zealand this year. The rate of growth with regard to trade between Australia and New Zealand has been around 11.6 per cent annually, greater than the growth of 8.3 per cent for Australian trade over the last 10 years. We have energised and re-energised CER over the last two years. It is a sharp comparison to the actions which took place under the federal Labor government which saw then minister Brereton sabotage the single aviation market in a way which did much to damage and bring to a new low relations between Australia and New Zealand. Mr Brereton interjecting",78
124,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note an interjection from the now shadow minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith. I remind him of what Don MCKinnnon said about the Brereton decision: We were dismayed at last year's decision on aviation, dismayed on substance but astonished at the way the message was conveyed by fax. That was the state of relations under Labor. What we have done is inject at the highest level between Prime Minister John Howard and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley-and previously Prime Minister Bolger-a very high degree of confidence and contact between Australia and New Zealand. We have built on that in a very practical way by putting real depth into CER relations. The Trade single aviation market has been re-established. The updated joint accreditation system agreement was signed here yesterday. The transTasman mutual recognition agreement is scheduled to be entering into force on 1 May. But, above all, we have done something else. I know that the Minister for Small Business and Workplace Relations will be particularly delighted by this, as will the former member for Hume. Mr Latham-The former member for Hume? He has gone?",78
125,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The current member for Hume. What he did as minister for shipping and transport was drive forward a breakthrough with regard to the long difficulties which existed in shipping between Australia and New Zealand. The member for Hume spearheaded a breakthrough to bring about the end of cabotage between Australia and New Zealand. You may not like it. We did it. You may not like the improved efficiencies that we are bringing to coastal shipping and shipping across the Tasman. We have got the job done under the CER arrangements. It is with pleasure that I salute the 15 years of CER, a great tribute to· the fundamental work of Doug Anthony and others over the years. I add one other thing: we have utilised CER to expand relations between Australia and New Zealand and South America. We do not just look to Asia; we look to the whole world for our trading opportunities. We are now building a raft of exports, mining technology and related services to South America. We are taking that a step further. Prime Minister John Howard will host the visit by President Menem to Australia next week. That underlines the links between CER and the Mercosur group of nations in South America. We are getting the job done. We are creating extra jobs here in Australia by better market access and better trade negotiations. We are delivering, especially through the CER arrangement between Australia and New Zealand. Waterfront",79
126,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Does the minister support the intention of the Western Australian government to give a monopoly to a non-union stevedoring company on the Dampier wharf because that company has been unable to compete against the unionised work force despite cutting wages dramatically? Does this run in the face of the government's professed policy on competition? Furthermore, can the minister tell the House whether he has had - ny dealings with or knows of any connectIOns between the giant foreign agribusiness company Conagra and those associated with the efforts of some people within the NFF to be involved in the Webb Dock operation?",79
127,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, in respect of Conagra and the NFF, that is entirely news to me. As to the efforts of the Western Australian .governme-t in improving efficiency in the regIOnal ports In Western Australia, they have my full and complete support. As I understand it, that has been an open tendering process. That is, however, a matter for the Western Australian government. They, of course, are required as others are to meet appr-priate co-pet-tion principles. But putting that Issue, which IS a separate issue in one sense, to one side, the fact of the matter is that the Western Australian government has been very strong and supportive of reform. When you look at the circumstances In Western AustraliaMr Tuckey interjecting",79
128,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They might be keen to promote performance. Look at the circumstances in Fremantle. Fremantle container operations could be improved very significantly compared with what they are today. I know that the Western Australian government is s.upportive o- that. But, as I say, we support then efforts WIth respect to Dampier and the other regional ports. They are going well in Western Australia to improve productivity. Let us wish them well for the future. Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service",79
129,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, would you inform the House .w?at action has been taken to improve the effIcIency and effectiveness of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service? Could you also inform us how this contrasts with past management of this vital national organisation?",79
130,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question.· Mr O'Connor-You are still alive.,79
131,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. I am well, thank you. I am glad that you are concerned to know. Australia's quarantine and inspection services really constitute a vitally important insurance policy for Australia's farmers, for around $10 billion of our exports, for our natural environment and, probably, our tourism industry as well-given that about 75 per cent of people come here largely because they want to see our pristine environment. But the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service was wrecked by Labor. And the person who had the purse strings for the longest period and who did the most damage during that regime was the member for Hotham. That is who it was. We had to fix it-and we have. We have put real resources into the restoration of Australia's services. In fact, we have overseen the injection of something like an additional $100 million into upgraded and new operations. For example, we funded the northern area quarantine strategy-over $14 million to look after our front line, if you like, across the north where we front to so many quarantine dangers. We have allocated $6 million through supermarket to Asia to technical offices in Asia. Mr Wilton-A couple of beagles.",80
132,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'A couple of beagles,' I heard somebody say. You'ran 19 dog teams around Australia. We are moving up to 42. From 19 to 42., We have put in place very significantly upgraded border control measures and they have seen, for example, new inspection systems for containers, which have detected 16 per cent of incoming containers with external contamination that was previously being missed. Cargo referrals for inspection are up 16 per cent. Mail seizures are up 127 per cent.' Airport seizures are up in absolute terms and when expressed as seizures per full-time staff member they are up 18 per cent. We have redesigned and properly resourced the import risk assessment process. We have put in place vastly improved industry consultative arrangements and established a very high quality independent advisory committee known as QEAC. We have also separated out meat inspection from quarantine. The member for Hotham left it in such an utter mess that we had no choice but to completely rebuild it. It was brokeliterally. The member for Hotham left it broke and it needed an injection of $44 million just to pay redundancies. Although you had been billing industry for redundancies you had been spending the money on your out of control ongoing operational expenses. They could not run AQIS. This is the bunch who, under the member for Hotham, had 63 meat inspectors headquartered in towns around Australia' where there were no meat processors. Under your industrial relations policy you could not run the thing properly. You could not contain costs. It was out of control. It was nothing other than a demonstration of your incapacity to run something either in a quarantine policy or a financial sense. Under us you have had a huge improvement in operational efficiency and work practices which are widely welcomed by industry. That is concurrent with a dramatic improvement in food safety. There are seven major meat exporters to the United States. We are one of them. Under this government, for the first time",80
133,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order: while we are getting immense enjoyment out of this, it is a statement. There is no two ways about it. It ought to be delivered in ministerial statements. It is way over length.",80
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is within the standing orders but I suggest that you shortly draw your answer to a conclusion.,80
135,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have nearly come to the end of it. I just make this point: under the reforms that we have put in place we have the lowest rejection rate of any country exporting meat to the United States. We really had a model here, set up by the member for Hotham, for running something. I probably thought that that was an illustration of the way in which they ran the broader economy. It was all about, firstly, painting yourselves as competent managers while, as we can see from the example of the 63 inspectors in towns where ,there were no meat works, you were grossly incompetent. Se-ondly, you paint yourselves as visionary reformers when you will not tackle any hard issues.",80

148,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Proceed.,81
149,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The member for Hotham asked me a question about Senator Parer and Lacetal and Mr Shand. I should inform the House that I have just received a letter from Mr Shand, which reads as follows: I understand the question has arisen as to whether Senator Parer or any company associated with him or his family has now or ever had an interest in Lacetal Pty Ltd.

155,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"You are making an extraordinary allegation against my colleague. You are a phoney muckraker. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I ask you to ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that statement against me.",81
156,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"If the honourable member is offended, I would never want that to happen. Of course I withdraw the allegation. Of course I withdraw the allegation against the phoney. Of course I do.",81
157,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The expression that the member for Hotham asked to be withdrawn was 'phoney muckraker'. It was not withdrawn by the Prime Minister, as is required by standing orders. We would request that you get him to do it.",81
158,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Prime Minister, the member for Hotham asked that you withdraw the words. I understand that you have partly withdrawn; will you withdraw them without qualification?",81
159,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"It is true that I substituted another one but I would never want him to be offended. I think I have made the point that you misled the parliament about Senator Parer and you owe him an apology. Therefore, I am very happy to substitute that for what I previously said. Opposition members-Withdraw! Mr Barresi-He is a muckraker.",81
160,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The House will remain silent-on both sides.,81
161,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I raise a point of order again. The Prime Minister was invited or requested by the member for Hotham to withdraw the words 'phoney muckraker'; he withdrew one. writing that: He then substituted one of the other words which he now says is the word that he puts in There its place. Unfortunately for him to be one of the two it was asked of him to withdraw. I might say, Mr Speaker, the thing that he thought he had done as he got up there to explain himself through that letter, am afraid, missed the entire point. less, we want it withdrawn.",81
162,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I understood that Prime Minister withdrew the remarks. Is that so?,82
163,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Yes.,82
164,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The Prime Minister has position withdrawn the remarks-both remarks.,82

I wish to draw your attention to standfor ing order 144, which says: Questions should not contain-(a) statements facts or names of persons . . . Mr Speaker, I put it to you that the people that wrote that standing order were the people of this House and did not believe that you should defame people by questions. I ask to consider that in the future, considering the evidence just brought to the attention of the House.",82
166,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. I suggest that he also looks at standing order 153, which relates to much the same subject. NA Grafton Meatworkers",82
167,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. Is he aware of the plight the 250 meatworkers from Grafton Abattoirs who have lost their jobs and $3 million of pay and redundancy entitlements? Prime Minister, do you recall your Minister Workplace Relations and Small Business saying on 10 March in this place that these workers should approach the· Office of the Employment Advocate and that 'the governdone ment will stand shoulder to shoulder with employees'? Are you aware that these ers have approached the Office of the Empeople. ployment Advocate, which has responded in is no provision under the Workplace Relations Act . . . to take action against directors of it happened insolvent companies. How is it that you can make such an effort to protect the interests of wealthy people like I Senator Parer but you will not lift a finger to Neverthehelp these ordinary workers?",82
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That question is very the close to being out of order.,82
169,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be happy to answer it. First of all, I certainly share the concern of many members in this House about the of those 250 workers. I understand that my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, met them. I also understand from the Minister Workplace Relations and Small Business that there is a possibility-and I do not want of to put it any higher than that but I certainly hope it is realised-that the company may be sold to another interested party in which event it may be possible that the situation will tum out to be better than we now think it is. That is the advice that the minister has been given you and I pass it on to the honourable member. The other point I would make is that I was a little puzzled at the member's reference to the Employment Advocate not having the power to pursue the directors of the company. Certainly I would be surprised if it had been suggested that he did because the power to pursue directors and so forth is something that would be done by the Securities Commission rather than by the Employment Advocate. Of course the· government is very concerned about these situations. I think the honourable of member would be aware that when his party was in power there was a very detailed examination of the law and you looked at and specifically rejected some of the things you for are now asking us to do. So you cannot parade a monopoly of concern about workers in these difficult situations. I say to the honourable gentleman that everything will be to help the workers concerned. I do not the think you advance their cause by trying to workdraw some phoney long bows with other Job Network  the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Unemployed people across Australia are discovering the opportunities being opened up by the Job Network. Would the minister inform the House of the expertise and experience of the members of the Job Network?",82
170,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He is obviously interested in the quality service that will be provided to unemployed people in this country from 1 May. I am pleased to get this question because there has been a deafening silence from the opposition since the member for Batman bungled his smear attack on Workskil Inc. earlier this week. Mr Fahey-Where is he?,83
171,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see he is not even in the House today. I wonder if he is going around the country now checking up on how many plaques the member for Hotham has left in premises around the country. The opposition has shown over time that it has no idea whatever of how to get unemployed people into jobs. The Leader of the Opposition himself was responsible for lifting the number of long-term unemployed people in this country by 95,000 and pushing youth unemployment up to over 32 per cent. The fact is you let unemployed people in this country down, and they turfed you out of office. The Job Network will be providing unemployed people in Australia with the best possible chance to get a job. One of the reasons for this is that all those who have been successfully contracted to become members of the Job Network have gone through an intensive quality assurance process through the tender which the government has run and which the smear-a-day campaign from the opposition has failed in any way to dent. There is a wealth of experience within the Job Network. Members of this House may well be interested to hear about the experience of those who have been contracted. Eighty per cent of Job Network providers are existing providers. Fifty-eight per cent of the existing skillshare providers who tendered are members of the Job Network. So that experience which has been built up over the years will be available in full measure to the Job Network. Fifty-two per cent of the existing contractors who assisted long-term unemployed people in the past are in the Job Network. The Job Network contains an excellent mix of established and experienced expertise and new innovative ideas and new players. Unemployed people have welcomed the change. I refer particularly to the comment that appealed to me of job seeker Despina Sarandogiou, who summed up the response of many unemployed people about the Job Network when she said that under the old system she felt like a number whereas under the Job Network she will feel more like a person. That is because unemployed people will have a choice, they will have personal service and they will have their dignity recognised. While the opposition has no plan whatever to help unemployed people, the government is putting into practice the most significant social reform of the last five decades to help unemployed people. Unemployment  likewise to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Has the minister been advised that in Lismore, where unemployment is at 17.3 per cent, the number of employment agencies providing services for the long-term unemployed has been cut from six to one? Is he aware that if long-term unemployed people in Lismore want to exercise a choice of employment services they will have to travel 30 kilometres to Ballina, 80 kilometres to Murwillumbah or 110 kilometres to Tweed Heads? Minister, are you aware that the member for Richmond has told the local Lismore newspaper that he was dissatisfied with the tender process and that the same paper later reported that you have agreed to review the local tender outcomes? Finally, is there a review of the tender outcomes now taking place in the Tweed HeadsNorthern Rivers region?",83
172,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no review being undertaken of the results of the tender process. The tender process that has been completed has delivered its results and the government stands by those results. In fact, this is a tender process which has delivered best practice outcomes in tendering. What the member for Richmond was referring to was that there are, as I have said before in this House, experienced providers who were unsuccessful in the tender process who have the capacity to offer training services to those his seat. successful providers who have been contracted as members of the Job Network. The government is very keen to ensure that these providers have adequate advice as to the opportunities that are open to them in the Job Network. The Job Network is going to in fact open up opportunities for many agencies beyond the members of the Job Network itself to provide services to unemployed people, particularly quality training services. That is an appropriate part of the Job Network; it is what the Job Network was set up to do. The government is very happy to get advice from the area consultative committees about the operations of the Job Network and the opportunities provided to unemployed people in that region, and that is precisely what the member for Richmond was referring to. He is completely correct in what he says about the determination of the government to ensure that people on the north coast of New South Wales get the. very best services that are available. It is also the case that there will be many more outlets for unemployed people in the north coast regions of New South Wales to obtain job placement services than they have under the existing arrangements. I totally reject the claims that were made in the course of the question that, in some way, there will be a restriction on the services available to those people in Lismore. In fact, the people in Lismore will have access to excellent services under the Job Network and, like those in all other regions of Australia, they will find that the quality services in job matching, in preparation for job seeking and job searching and intensive assistance for unemployed people will be greatly enhanced by the services of the Job Network. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I ask that the documents from which the minister was reading be tabled.",83
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading? I didn't notice him reading. Mr Crean-Of course you were reading.,84
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He was not reading. The honourable member for Hotham will resume Alice Springs-Darwin Rail Link,84
175,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Would the minister please inform the House of the progress of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link? Also, could the minister advise us what other commitments are being taken in regard to the railway?",84
176,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. I know that he and all his constituents in the Northern Territory are very interested in the outcome of this project. Last year the Prime Minister announced the Commonwealth would contribute $100 million towards this project. Expressions of interest to build the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link closed on 1 December 1997. More than 30 submissions were received by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation from a combination of 60 national and international corporations. A short list has been presented to the South Australian and Northern Territory governments. The Commonwealth, together with the South Australian and Northern Territory governments, has committed $300 million towards this project-and this is being provided all by coalition governments. Compare that with the last promise that the Labor Party made with regard to this project in 1983 when Bob Hawke said: I promise you that only the Labor Government can be trusted to build the Alice Springs to Darwin line. Yet in 13 years of Labor government nothing was done. That was the last promise that th,. Labor Party made. But there is more. During the ALP conference on 21 January this ye;(iI in Hobart-remember that fairly flat sort of an affair down in Tasmania-the South Australian Labor leader, Mike Rann, went on Adelaide radio and said: . . . so we have secured a commitment from Kim Beazley for $300 million-up to $300 million if Labor is elected, to try and make sure that we actually get some tracks laid. Is this the same sort of a promise that Bob Hawke made back in 1983? So the compere of that radio program came back and said: So, Mike, this is in fact a formal commitment so, reading between the lines, if LaQor is elected to , power at the next federal election, that is deal? And Rann started to back away. He said: Well, what we did yesterday is commit the federal Labor Party-my resolution committed the federal Labor Party to providing the capital assistance necessary to ensure that the railway goes ahead. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition making backroom deals with Mike Rann regarding this important project, promising him $300 million. We have not heard anything from the Leader of the Opposition about what is actually going to happen. The Labor Party's shadow spokesman for transport, in a press release, has said: In all our discussions with industry, we have been told that more will be required. That is why Kim Beazley committed Labor to up to $300 million over four years. Is this another unfunded commitment? Where is the money going to come from? The people should be asking the question: where is the money going to come from? The Labor Party is aU over the place on this issue. The people in South Australia and the Northern Territory deserve a straight answer ftom the Labor Party on what they are going to do-or are they going to rely on what Bob Hawke said in 1983 and do nothing? Job Network.",84
177,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, :Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, are you aware· that the 4,000 unemployed people in Cessnock now have two choices: to line up at the office of Employment National, which will have four staff members at most, or to catch a private bus to Maitland or Newcastle, distances of 30 and 50 kilometres, at a cost of between $6 and $16? Minister, choice you were talking about when you launched your Job Network?",85
178,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,One of the most satisfying aspects of the outcomes of the tender round for the Job Network has been the very good coverage that occurs in regional Australia. Every area of Australia which is currently served by the Commonwealth Employment Service,85
179,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will resume a done his seat. The honourable member for Hunter, have you a point of order? Mr Fitzgibbon-Yes, Mr Speaker. Under standing ord.er 145-relevance-I asked the minister a very specific question: what is he going to do about the unemployment in Cessnock?",85
180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is giving his an-yver. The member will resume his seat.,85
181,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This really shows that the opposition clearly do not understand the benefits and virtues of the new Job Network, because every area of Australia which is currently served by the CES",85
182,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
183,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Listen to this and you will learn something. Every area of Australia which is currently served by the CES will be receiving services under the Job Network. In many areas of regional Australia they will be receiving expanded services because of the increased number of sites that are available. This is the do-ument I tabled for you last week. You have had a chance to consult this document and you could have been better informed. Unemployed people in Cessnock will be serviced by Employment National. Mr Fitzgibbon-That is it?,85
184,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Mr SP:EAKER-The honourable member for Hunter has asked' his question.,85
185,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Employment National will be providing a range of services, including both basic job matching and intensive assistance. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",85
186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable is this the member for Hunter!,85
187,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All that the member for Hunter has been able to draw attention to is that the residents of Cessnock and unemployed people in Cessnock received services before and they receive services now. And they will be receiving services under the Job Network. Some point! The whole benefit of the Job Network is that if you go through the areas and towns of the Hunter and north coast region, there are many more places for unemployed people to go to where they can receive services and be matched to jobs. There many more sites in that area than there are at present. The quality of services will be increased and they will have the dignity at last of being able to choose the services that are available. Mr Crean-I now ask that the minister table the document from which he was clearly reading on this occasion.",86
188,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading? Dr Kemp-No.,86
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I did not think he was reading. I was watching him. He referred to numbers. The honourable member will resume his seat. He waS not reading; I was watching. He was looking through notes. Mr Crean interjecting,86
190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the honourable member for Hotham wish to leave the House? I suggest that the honourable member might look at the standing order and realise that the Speaker can look and see whether or not the minister is reading, and he was not. Military Awards",86
191,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Can the minister inform the House how the government has met its election commitment in respect of a Vietnam end of war list?",86
192,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question. I know his interest in this matter. Might I mention also the member for Stirling, whom I also know has a particular interest. Before the election the coalition, in accordance with its constant stand on the question of an end of Vietnam war list, promised to establish the list of people who had suffered as a result of the quota system that operated during the Vietnam war, whereby 28 people who were in fact recommended for an award were downgraded and 50 people who were recommended for an award in fact received nothing. Indeed, those awards were for meritorious service or gallantry. The difficulty has arisen with regard to the list because in 1992 the ability to recommend to Her Majesty the Queen that imperial honours be awarded was abolished. That has meant that the awards that were recommended back at the time of the war being imperial awards can no longer be given. Had something been done about it at the time that a private member's bill came through this place before 1992, then the medals as they had been recommended could have been given. Because this cannot be done, we are using the Australian honours and awards system. There are no direct equivalents and the difficulty then is to ensure that the most appropriate award is given to the person who missed out previously. In order to do that, a decision had to be made and the decision was made that no order could be higher than the order that was previously recommended. Here is the difficulty. The difficulty relates to six nominations that were made for the Military Medal. It is argued by some people, including Mr Ruxton and others, that the Military Medal should be treated the same as the Military Cross. To have done that would have meant that those six people would have received a medal higher than the 84 people who received it during the war, the 41 people who received the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the one person who received the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and the three people who received the George Medal, all of which rank in between the Military Cross and the Military Medal. I have great sympathy for those people who would really have liked to have received their imperial awards. I understand the feeling they have towards that particular medal. . BQt we do believe that the way we are awarding this system is the fairest outcome. To those people who say that to receive a commendation for gallantry is to be regarded as being belittled, I say that is not so. A commendation for gallantry is a ribbon with an emblem upon it which is mounted on a bar in the ordinary way and worn with pride. Our solution is the fairest solution to fulfilling promise-and I know that people will appreciate the difficulties that were entailed. Aviation Safety",86
193,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I ask whether the minister is aware of the paper entitled 'A New Approach to Enforcement' recently issued by Civil Aviation Safety Authority Chairman 'Affordable Safety' Dick Smith, which states: ... in no circumstances will suspension or cancel31,4 lation of pilots licences be used as punishment. Is the minister aware that CASA has issued a notice to pilots urging them to look out the window to avoid crashing into other planes? Can the minister guarantee that 'Affordable Safety' Dick Smith's new aviation safety regime will not, in fact, lead to a reduction in aviation safety, particularly at Sydney airport? Minister, what is next-hand signals?",87
194,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The last part of· that question is out of order.,87
195,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I point out to the House that at least our government has taken the opportunity to appoint people to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who have experience in the aviation field, who have an understanding of aviation and who know what is needed in this industry. Following the obstruction of the mates of the Labor Party over the first couple of years of the life of this government, we have taken the opportunity to get around the industry and get people from the industry into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who know what they are talking about as far as aviation is concerned, and who have had experience with the big end of the aviation industry in Ansett and Qantas, as far as concerns the management of air space in Australia and the regulation of air safety in Australia. Economy",87
196,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister provide the House with details on our the new ABS publication of a wage cost index? Prime Minister, can you inform the House as to what this latest data tells us about how the Australian economy is travelling?",87
197,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In reply to the honourable member for Petrie, I can inform the House that today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a new indicator of wages growth called the 'wage cost index'. This index, which is compiled using a fixed basket of jobs to provide a better guide to underlying wage cost pressures, suggests that wage costs rose by the very moderate annualised rate of per cent in the December quarter. That increase is very much within the Reserve Bank of Australia's comfort band for wages and does nothing to threaten Australia's outstanding inflation performance. In fact, Australia now has a headline inflation. rate which is the best in the OECD. Most importantly, it is average Australians who are getting the most benefit of this low inflation rate. If you have a headline inflation rate running at minus 0.2 per cent, and Australian workers are being looked after to the extent that their wages are rising by 3% per cent-in other words, they are getting a real wage increase of at least 3% per cent on an average basis-then that increase is not in any way being eaten up by increases in inflation. I would imagine that Australians who follow these matters would regard a government that has delivered that kind of economic outcome as a government that well and truly has the interests of average Australians at heart. If you can deliver zero inflation, if you can deliver an economic climate where you have zero inflation and wage increases, on average, of 3% per cent, you are adding to the real incomes of average Australians. But that is only half the story. The other part of the story is that the policies of the government have resulted in reductions in mortgage interest rates for average Australians of about $300 a month. That is the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week for average wage and salary earners. But the good news on the economic frontand I say this to the member for Petrie-does not end with low inflation, real wage gains and interest rate reductions; it is also the case that over the last six months more than 140,000 new jobs have been created. That figure would have been 190,000 but for the actions of the Labor Party and others in the Senate in blocking our unfair dismissal laws. What the Labor Party is doing, bound hand and foot to the trade union movementdoing the bidding ()f Jennie George, nodding to Jennie George and saying, 'Yes, Jennie, no Jennie; I'll do whatever you say, Jennie'-is destroying jobs. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition: you will be hearing a lot more about the impact on jobs in Australia of what you have done by blocking the unfair dismissal law. You have a picture that there is only one side of politics in Australia over the last two years that has ,bothered to address itself to issues that affect average Australians-and that is the Liberal and National parties. We have delivered to this country the strongest economic fundamentals for a quarter of a century. We have protected this country against the economic downturn in Asia. We have lowered interest rates. We have 'boosted real wages. We seen 140,000 new jobs created in the last six months. We have committed ourselves 'to fundamental industrial relations reform. We are seeing historic reformsabsolutely historic and courageous reformson the Australian waterfront. All you get from the Leader of the Opposition is a promise of another meeting. He loves promising meetings. His great mentor, Bob Hawke, had a meeting on the waterfront-and $425 million later we were no further ahead. They had a meeting on native title that was presided over by Paul Keating and we were delivered the native title mess which is now the responsibility of my government t<? cure. The housing sector also continues to power along. Total dwelling commencements rose. by 10 per cent in the December quarter to be almost 20 per cent higher than a year earlier, and there is more to come. If the housing figures are anything to go by, they are almost 25 per cent higher than they. were a year earlier. I repeat: the housing commencement figures are 25 per cent higher than they were a year earlier. That I know is particularly good news in those areas of Australia that are experiencing a lot of housing growth, such as the electorate represented by the member for Hughes, whose constituents are with us today, and the electorates of many other members. We have strong economic fundamentals. I know the Labor Party hates it. I know the I,-abor Party does riot want to be reminded of it, but we have got - ews for them. They will be hearing a lot more about it over the next six, nine, 12 or even 18 months. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Waterfront Mr LEO MCLEA Y-Yesterday during question time the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business purported to read from a letter he had received from a wharfie in Brisbane. Under standing order 321 I asked him to table the letter. He did not have the letter with him, and he gave an undertaking that he would give me a copy of it later in the day. Of course, as usual, he has broken his word.",87
198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The honourable member will not reflect on the minister. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-It is the truth. He said that he would table the letter and he hasn't.,88

200,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I withdraw. Yesterday the minister gave his word that he would give - e a copy of that letter. The minister has not kept his word because I have not received a copy of the letter. I think most people would say that means he has probably broken his word, but I will not say that.",88
201,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The honourable member will resume his seat.,88
202,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I will not say that because that would not be fair to the minister. Mr Speaker, would you write to the minister and ask him to keep to his word?",88
203,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I ask the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business whether he has the letter and whether he will table it.,89
204,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, when I was asked to table the documents that I had with me yesterday, I then proceeded to table all of the documents. The member for Watson has made some accusations, and I think it is fair enough that I should answer those. I understood the position to be that, if he really wanted a copy of the letter, he would let me know.",89

223,Mr T ANNER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer to your admonition of members on Monday to apply very careful judgment when making remarks about people who are not members of the House and that they should take all reasonable steps to satisfy themselves of the accuracy of their comments. I refer to claims made in question time on the very same day by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that Fremantle waterside workers worked faster in order to attend a strip show and finish early. As these claims have been demonstrated to be totally false and based only on statements made by one worker to a supervisor in jest, I ask that you ask the minister to withdraw and to apologise to these workers that he has unjustly defamed. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Terry Buck, who runs the MUA, has been asked to deny it 12 times, and at no stage did he deny it. In fact, he said that he wasn't going to deny nothin'.",89
224,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable minister will resume his seat.

The minister stated, 'Any fool knows that the curfew at Sydney airport has been legislated.' I am sure that the minister had me in mind. Even though he did not identify me explicitly, I believe the remarks are very offensive. Mr Speaker, I was not present in the chamber at the time; these comments were drawn to my attention. I ask you to ask the minister to withdraw the remark. I also add that he did not pay me the courtesy of telling me that he was going to come into this chamber and make those comments.",90

242,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The widespread community concern about the damage being done to Australia's health system by 38 of 1997-98; the Howard government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",91
243,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Bulletin said it all this week: 'Medicare's Dr No: health cuts crisis, worse to come.' The missing Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge)-Dr No-is not brave enough to come into the chamber and debate health legislation, Medicare legislation, agreements on Medicare and even whether or not Australia's public hospitals system is receiving sufficient federal funds It is no surprise that the Bulletin magazine is referring to the minister for health as Dr No. The minister has been Dr No on public hospital funding negotiations with the states. He has been Dr No on rebates for GP services, which is discouraging bulkbilling. He has been Dr No on the increasing costs for ordinary Australians for essential medicines. He has been Dr No on the ability of ordinary Australians to get fair access to emergency dental care. He has been Dr No for the 44 Medicare offices around the country that have been closed by this minister and this government, including one in Wynnum and another one in Belmont to close tomorrow. They are all closing because of the decisions that this government and this minister have made. These funding cuts were needed to fund this government's failed and discredited $1.7 billion health insurance tax rebate-the tax rebate flop in respect of which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the minister for health will not admit publicly what every Australian knows: that it has failed to make any difference whatsoever in the level of membership of Australia's private health insurance funds. Before the last election the centrepiece of the coalition's health policy was to subsidise private health insurance. They said it - oul? make the premiums cheaper, they said It would increase the membership and it would take the pressure off public hospitals. We love to remind the government of this promise every opportunity we have to discuss health matters. That was your promise: lower premiums and higher membership. The intention was to take the pressure off public hospitals. But what has happened? Premium increases have hit ordinary contributors like tidal waves. Time after time health funds have jacked up their premiums after they have been approved by this minister and this government. Most of the benefit of that tax rebate has already been swallowed up by premium increases, and it is no wonder that, as a result, membership of health insurance funds has been falling by 700 a day. According to the latest figures, 700 Australians a day are leaving private health insurance funds. Instead of taking the pressure off public hospitals, this government, in its inability to tum around the decline in health insurance, has increased the pressure on our public hospital system. Added to that, in its first budget-the August 1996 budget-the government cut federal funding for Australia's public hospitals by a massive $800 million. To make it worse, this Minister for Health and Family Services-this government-has even allowed one of the health funds to impose an added fee on any of their members who have the temerity to be treated in a private hospital rather than as a private patient in a public hospital. So one of the major health funds has now introduced a new penalty fee which is imposed on any of those health fund members who are treated in private hospitals rather thari public hospitals. If the intention was to take pressure off public hospitals, why is this government approving new and additional burdens and costs and fees on ordinary Australians who do have private health insurance who use a private hospital rather than a public hospital? At the end of the day, the Prime Minister said, when this government launched its health policy at the last election, that they would get such a response to their health insurance tax rebate they would lift the level of private health insurance coverage from 35 per cent of the population to 40 per cent of the population. The Prime Minister's prediction was that he would, by the year 2000, get the level of private health insurance up to 40 per cent. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Fat chance.",91
244,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We had a fat chance, as my colleague the member for Reid interjects. It has no chance whatsoever of being achieved, and that is because ordinary Australians are questioning whether they are getting good value for money from their private health insurance premiums. They are questioning that every day. That is why 700 Australians a day are leaving private health insurance. The minister for health, in that 1996 budget, put his name to the health portfolio budget document predicting that there would be an increase to 35 per cent-an increase to 34Y2 per cent because of the tax rebate and then, in his own press release, another one per cent increase because of the Medicare levy surcharge on high income earners. So we have both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services claiming that their $1.7 billion rebate would actually increase the level of private health insurance and take the pressure off public hospitals. But what have we seen actually happen? The levels just keep falling as each quarter the figures come out. The decline in membership of private health insurance is a straight line. The government says, 'It was a straight line under the former government,' and that is true. There was a decline of health insurance membership under Labor and· it is a straight line today. The only difference is that this government has spent $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to get the same result-to get the straight line. That is why Jeff Kennett",92
245,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They could have put it into the public hospital system.,92
246,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague the member for Denison interjects, that is why Jeff Kennett has been saying that that rebate was money down the drain. That is why the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, said the rebate is a dud, and it is why the AMA has been saying that the money should have been spent directly on patient care. If we want any independent evidence about the pressure on the public hospital system, let us tum to a former Australian of the Year, Dr Yu. Dr John Yu is a former chief executive of the new children's hospital at Westmead and he made the following comments yesterday: I am not sure how well briefed the Prime Minister is. I am certainly disappointed that Dr Wooldridge does not have a better understanding of what happening. Dr Yu went on to say: Public hospitals deserve a better deal. There is really a crisis in the public hbspitalsystem. We are faced with the denial of treatment for things many of us would believe were the right of ariy Australian. Hear, hear! When an Australian of the stature of Dr John Yu, who is not associated with either side of politics, sounds that warning bell about the need for additional funding our public hospital system, a responsible government would be trying to find the extra resources that our public hospital system would need. Instead of this government trying to find new ways to ease the crisis in our public hospital system, we have government memment. bers trying to justify this government's backs. Let me give you a good example this brought to my attention by my friend member for Denison. In the Hobart Mercury this morning we have a very good story that I am sure some of my colleagues to hear about. Under the headline 'Liberal MPs cross swords: health funding discord widens' the article says: A major brawl has erupted between the state and federal Liberal MPs over cuts in federal health funding. Health minister Peter MCKay yesterday accused the Canberra MPs of repeating like parrots Federal Treasury line that state health cuts major factor in funding problems. He warned the five senators and two MHRs they would be picked off by the voters at the next federal election. He went on to say: Mr MCKay accused his colleagues of using manipulated and selective figures and said he believed they had been pressured by Prime Minister John Howard. I will leave it up to my colleagues to decide who the two Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives might be. I am sure it was, nqt the member for Denison or the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) or the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). Can you believe that the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) or the member for Braddon (Mr is Miles) would be so stupid as to put their names to a press release which parrots the Treasury line according to Health Minister MCKay? Mr Albanese-I believe it.",92
247,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Grayndler believes it. Seeing that the Howard government's Titanic is taking on water, the minister for health is abandoning Chisholm with a margin of 2.7 per cent, desperately pushing people out of the way to get onto the lifeboat of 'SS for Casey' with a margin of 6.6 per cent. You can imagine the disappointment that that has caused for the member for Bass, left behind as the minister for health scrambles on to the electorate of Casey for which there had been rumours that the member for Bass might have actually have had a chance of endorseHaving been left in the electorate of cutBass, he puts his name to a press release of which says that the Tasmanian hospital the system has got enough money already and that the federal government should not be putting extra resources into the Tasmanian will be keen health care system. Even if the members for Bass and Braddon were silly enough to put their names to this document, why are the conservative Tasmanian senators agreeing to this Treasury line that care there is no need· for extra federal money for the Tasmanian health care system? Remember the line that they used to give us that the the senators do not take partisan political views were a on things, that senators speak up for their state, that senators are there to represent the states and speak out for what is needed for individual states? What about those five Liberal senators from Tasmania? What comes first: speaking up with their Premier and their health minister and the Labor members and senators in the federal parliament that are arguing for extra resources for the Tasmanian public hospital system? No, they put their name to the line of the Prime Minister and the member for Chisholm, Minister for Health and Family Services, that the Tasmanian hospital system does not need those extra resources. And they will pay the price. The health minister was right when he said that the five senators and the two MHRs, the members for Bass and Braddon, will be picked off by voters at the next federal election. And they deserve to be picked off, because they are not prepared to speak out for their local public hospitals in their own electorates. Tasmania is an interesting case because it was only a few weeks ago that we saw something that had never been witnessed in the national parliament. We had a delegation with representatives from the Australian Medical Association's Tasmanian branch, surgeons, nurses and unions that work in the hospital system in Tasmania. They brought up a unified delegation to point out to members of the national parliament the need for extra federal funding for the Tasmanian public hospital system. What has been the response? The member for Braddon, the member for Bass and the five Liberal senators signed names endorsing the federal Treasury line rather than speaking up for the citizens of Tasmania and the public hospitals of Tasmania. The point we make and the great tragedy is that, to fund that $1.7 billion failed and discredited health rebate, the government cut the funding from the publie hospital system, they abolished the Commonwealth dental health program and they increased the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for ordinary Australians. If they had spent that same amount of money, that same $1.7 billion, directly on patient care, they could have opened an extra 3,000 hospital beds right across the country or treated another 100,000 patients. That way they could have kept the operating theatres open longer. Mr Adams-How many beds?",93
248,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a 100,000 extra patients who could have been treated with that $1.7 billion. You can imagine the difference that could have made to the constituents of the member for Lyons and you can imagine the difference it would have made to the Tasmanian public hospital system if they had got their share of that $1.7 billion. The problem is that this government and this minister are obsessed with private health insurance. They have tried to walk away from their responsibilities to the public hospital system because of the obsession the Prime Minister has with private health insurance. We on this side of the House are not opposed to private health insurance, but what we say is that, whether or not you have got private health insuranceMr Bruce Scott-Do you have any?",94
249,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I do have private health insurance and I challenge the minister to tell us how long he has had his. How long have you had private health insurance? Mr Bruce Scott-Since I was 18; about 40 years.,94
250,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us use the example of the minister at the table. He has got private health insurance, but if he or a member of his family is really sick they will be depending on the public hospital system to provide that emergency care and treatment. That is what we their depend on. Whether or not we have got private health insurance, when we are really sick we depend on the public hospital system to make sure that we are okay. You cannot simply rely on the private hospitals: they provide the supplementary care which assists. The public system maintains proper and adequate standards and we do not want to walk away from the public system, as this government has. At the Labor Party National Conference in Hobart, we made one very firm commitment: public hospital funding will be our first priority in health care under a Labor government. The contrast is that this government's agenda is to undermine Medicare by stealth. They undermined Medicare by slashing that $800 million from public hospitals in their first budget. They undermined Medicare by squeezing the GP rebate to force more GPs to switch from bulk-billing to charging up-front fees. They undermined Medicare by making it more expensive for ordinary Australians to afford their essential medicines. They undermined Medicare by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, to force ordinary Australians to have their teeth pulled out rather than having them filled and having the ordinary preventative dental care they are entitled to. These are the reasons that we think this government have done the wrong thing in not providing the funding that our state public hospital systems need. That is the reason why all the Premiers and the Northern Territory Chief Minister walked out when this government were not prepared to put more resources into the public hospital system. That is the reason why this government will be defeated at the next election-because of the disgraceful and miserly level of funding they are seeking to offer the state public hospital system. (Time expired)",94
251,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.58 p.m.)-The shadow minister for health and member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has once again displayed his ignorance of the way the health system works. He has a lack of understanding of what Labor did over 13 years-or perhaps suitable deafness to that; not just plain misunderstanding but not wanting to know the realities. He continues to allege that this $800 million cut that he constantly refers to is just a cut from health but, of course, it is not that at all; it is the contribution that the states agreed to make when we first came to government to help fill in that horrible $1OY2 billion deficit. The fact that he can attribute all that to health is beyond my understanding. He has also made comment about the fact that there are Medicare offices closing around the country. There are, but what the coalition government wants to do is to spend money on providing health care rather than finding ways to be constantly administering it. Now there are 130 Medicare fax change facilities in chemists in rural areas, and we will soon have another 400. That is the way we are doing things: we really want to be sensible and cost effective about the way we are spending our very precious health dollars. We should very briefly look at Labor's record. We have only been in government for two years, and I am proud of what has been achieved. But Labor cannot be too proud of what happened over those 13 years. The member for Dobell has made much about private health insurance. To be perfectly honest, you would think the only thing to do with health was public hospitals and private health insurance. The health debate is much larger than that. We have to be tackling it in all areas. It is complex and I know it is diffieult to get around, but we have to do it. It is important to the people of Australia that we do do it. In 1983, there were 65 per cent of people covered by private health insurance. That fell by more than 30 per cent during the time there was a Labor government. Labor handed the immunisation program over to the states but failed to monitor it, and never che-cked on what was going on. In 1996, when we came to government, the immunisation rate among Australian children was 53 per cent. That is well below China, Algeria and Vietnam. The current rate now is still lower than some rates in Aboriginal communities around Australia. Labor refused to acknowledge our ageing population. I used to say from opposition, 'When is it going to be acknowledged? When are we going to be planning for it? When is something going to be done about itT So this government is facing up to those realities. Despite the fact that private health insurance figures are not quite what we would like them to be, there are 5.885 million Australians with private health insurance, and they do value that. We have provided incentives of up to $450 per family. This benefits 713,000 families with incomes less than $50,000; half a million couples earning less than $50,000; and another half a million singles earning less than $35,000. Presumably, if there is such a cotp.mitment, member for Dobell, when you hope to be health minister-although I think that might never occur; I am quite sure it will not because the Australian people will be much smarter than that-the whole idea is to throw that all away so that private health insurance becomes even more important to the people of Australia. Last November there was legislation introduced which allows doctors and private hospitals to draw up arrangements ensuring that there is informed financial consent, which puts an end to multiple billing and which addresses the out of pocket expenses. So we are tackling these problems on a number of fronts, not just thinking, 'Let's hand another bucket of money to public hospitals.' I think public hospitals are very important. They must be adequately funded. They are a very important part of our health system- but so are the private hospitals. There are empty beds in them now. If there had not been such a disgraceful decline in the private health insurance numbers over 13 years we would not be having to battle wit\:l the problems We are now.' But, as I have already said, we cannot just be thinking about what happens in hospitals. We should not be just waiting for people to get sick before we treat them. We should be promoting preventative health measures. We should be looking at early intervention. We should be looking at the whole gamiIt of the way we ensure Australians get a good health care system and adequate health care. It is still, despite the criticisms that are made one of the best ,systems, if not the best system, in the world. That is something we should be trumpeting. It does not mean we do not' have change. It does not mean we are not always looking at things that can be done better. There will always be changes. There are scientific advances and more medical, research and we are getting the benefits of that. There is telemedicine and there an- different ways of doing things. If we stand still and just trumpet public hospitals and that funding them is the only way of looking at health care, then we are closing our eyes to reality. The government has introduced coordinated care trials to help 1.4 million Australians with asthma; 650,000 Australians with diabetes; and a countless number of Australians who are suffering from chronic pain. These are just some of the examples of looking at the whole gamut, the whole health picture. It should not be forgotten that the 1995-96 figures show that Commonwealth expenditure was $2,300 in health care dollars for every person, or 8.5 per cent of GDP. That does not count any private contributions that are made. ' The member for Dobell has mentioned the stand-off now with the states. I would have thought that stand-offs with the states were a fairly regular event when health ministers or premiers come to Canberra. That has been part of the games that one expects to see played. As long as I can remember, I have seen games being played in that respect. I personally think-and I have said it quite publicly-that every one of the premiers who walked out of that meeting was jolly stupid to have done so because they were yet to discuss guns and tax reform, which I would have thought would have been fairly important for them and their own budgets. But let us look at some of the realities. Victoria, for'instance, reduced its spending on health by 23 per cent in 1993-94 and is still spending 18 per cent less in real terms than in 1992-93. Queensland reduced spending by 15 per cent in 1993-94 and did not begin spending more until 1995-96. Western Australia made similar reductions. Tasmania-and of it, the member for Dobell was quick to cite Tasmania-reduced spending by 25 per cent in real terms' in 1993-94 and has since reduced it a further five per cent. By contrast, the Commonwealth increased its funding by 13 per cent in 1993-94 and by a further six per cent over the lIfe of the Medicare agreements. The truth of the matter is that spending on health and spending on public hospitals is very important, but let us have some honesty about it. I have to say, with almost some regret, that I recall my friend and then health minister in South Australia remarking publicly how good it was to have saved $60 million out of health spending. I thought at the time that this was really a bit of a tragedy-and we have been proved to be right. The reductions in South Australia, I hasten to add, have not been anywhere near some of those in other states. If we were to rely on the previous Labor government's forward estimates, there would be $27.3 billion to be spent over the next five years over the current Medicare agreements. But this government has increased that figure to $30.2 billion-a growth of 15 per cent over five years. In addition to this-and this is what I really think is very important, something we have not seen a lot of in the pressthere was to be $83 million available for each one per cent decrease in private health insurance should that occur. However, I am also confident that as some of the incentives and. a bit of the hard stick we have taken to the high income earners come into effect we will see private health insurance numbers going up again. If, by any tragedy, that should not occur, built into these Medicare agreements was $83 million for each one per cent decrease. So for the states to argue that we were letting them down over this has been less than honest. If we were to give the states exactly what they were seeking, this would amount to a 33 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding. We need some honesty in the health debate rather than just playing politics. So often it said to me in my own electorate and other institutions and electorates that I visit around the country that ideally health would be removed from being a political debate and it is far too important to people to be a political debate. Unfortunately, while there are such philosophical differences and while the opposition chooses to play politics on this, that is unlikely to occur. Mr Lee interjecting",95
252,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dobell was not listening. The member for Dobell was actually speaking when I was giving the figures and the arguments that the state Premiers had put forward and why they have been wrong. Mr Bruce Scott-There's $750 million for the veterans.,97
253,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right; there is $750 million for veterans. I think it was in the member for Dobell's speech last night that I was reading in Hansard where he was saying that the states did not even know about it. It is the classic example of why they should have hung around to discuss these details. I just reiterate that if the Premiers had stuck around to talk about these things they would have been better informed. I was about to give some examples of where Labor would rather play politics, and in fact cheat and mislead the Australian people and the Australian electorate, rather than face up to some of these real issues. I offered the member for Dobell a briefing on the therapeutic group premiums. He said he would like that, but perhaps he felt he did not need it. We made sure that every member and senator in the parliament, no matter what their political persuasion, background or loyalty, received this pack of information, which provided accurate information not put together by politicians or bureaucrats but put together by some very key and well-qualified independent medical and scientific experts. Mr Lee-Any mistakes?",97
254,Ms WORTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am so pleased the member for Dobell has made this interjection because what we do have here, which I can present today, is a pamphlet that is being distributed is around the electorates of Australia, including in South Australia and in my own electorate, headed 'Unsafe and unfair'. It refers to medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. They are 'unsafe because patients will be pressured to switch to cheaper, older and less effective drugs.' 'Even Mr Howard's own experts have said that some of the cheaper drugs are not as safe.' I would love to use the word that we are not allowed to use, but I will not. I will just say that this is a gross misrepresentation of the truth. There would be many manufacturers of medicines, and good manufacturers at that, who would find that deeply offensive. It does not stand up to any scrutiny. I can provide the member for Dobell, and anybody else who would like to see it, a list of the medicines that are part of that policy, the dates, for instance, that they were listed on the PBS and the premiums. I could go chapter and verse on this, but I will show it to the member for Dobell afterwards so that he can be better informed and not make statements like this. In fact, I hope he will show leadership and actually ask the Labor Party to cancel this misleading brochure so that they will not be misleading the people of Australia in such an improper and shameful way. . This list shows beyond any doubt at all that it is the medicines that have been most recently, except for one example that I am out on, listed on the PBS that have no or the smallest possible premium. It is other medicines that have been there much longer that have a premium. I challenge the member for Dobell to go away to the Labor Party machine and say, 'Look, my integrity is at risk here. I would like you to get this right and stop putting out this stuff because really we are misleading the Australian public and, if we are going to have credibility, we should not be doing that.' The well-being. and the health care of all Australians is far too important to be doing that. There are other initiatives that the government has taken-further examples that show we should not just be talking about hospitals and hospital funding. I would rather talk about how we care for people before they get into hospitals. There have been major initiatives for carers, unsung heroes in the Australian population who must be cared for. We have resource centres available for them. We have respite centres available for them. We have a community education program now funded to $17.25 million over the next three years for a comprehensive communitywide education on drugs and drugs of abuse and rehabilitation. We need young people to be aware of the problems they are letting themselves in for. We have made major inroads into the treatment of mental health and we are taking a national and strategic approach to that. We need young people to know that drugs of abuse as well as harming them will also cause them mental health problems. That is something that we have to be taking a lot of care of. We have embarked on the biggest campaign of all time. (Time expired)",97
255,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to have this opportunity not only to support the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), on this matter of public importance but, in the process of doing that, to supplement some of the remarks that were made by the member for Dobell on behalf of the opposition as far as this general area is concerned. The matter of public importance refers to 'widespread community concern about the damage being done to Australia's health system by the Howard government'. I suppose some people could say, 'Well, we might expect the Labor opposition to say that.' On Friday of last week an unprecedented event occurred. With the exception of one territorial Chief Minister, every Premier and the other Chief Minister at a Premiers Conference in Canberra left the meeting. Unlike on previous occasions, they did not leave the meeting to go out and regroup, redetermine their strategy, come·. back in and fight again for their states and territories. On this occasion they walked out and went home. Mr Hollis-With good reason.",98
256,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague the member for Throsby says, with good reason. Yes, indeed, with good reason-as I will indicate. Following that walkout we had these comments, for example. The first one I am going to quote is the comment from the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. I want to mention him first because we know that Bob Carr is our political colleague. He is our political comrade as far as pursuing health improvements in Australia is concerned and he is a colleague of the shadow minister, who more than any other person, at least on the government side, has brought to this question integrity, vision, policy development, determination, dedication and commitment. They are just some of the qualities he has brought to this question. But what did Bob Carr say after that exercise last Friday? He said: Under John Howard (the government) is treating people with contempt, people who need access to our public hospitals. Bob Carr is speaking on behalf of every citizen in New South Wales. So when we say that there is widespread community concern about the damage being done to Australia's health system by the Howard government, they had better believe it. One might well say, 'Why wouldn't Bob Carr say that? He is a Labor Premier and he is tied up with that mob in opposition.' But let us have a look at what some of the others have said. The Victorian Premier, Jeff KennettMr Hatton-No friend of Labor.",98
257,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly; no friend of Labor. Nor necessarily a friend of Bob Carr's. He is a member of the Liberal Party; a member of the conservative coalition. What did Jeff Kennett say? He said that it There was 'absolutely essential' the base rate of public health funding be lifted by $1.1 over five years in the wake of the collapse private health insurance. Listen to this. went on to say: We have been substantially let down because door's been slammed in our face. By whom? By this coalition government. I have just quoted Jeff Kennett. He is a member of the Liberal Party. Let us go to the National Party. Let us go to the other coalition party. He is a colleague of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, and from the minister's own state. What did Rob Borbidge say? He said: There is not much point all of us corning down herethat is, to Canberraif when we get into the room what is given to us before is 'fIrst, fInal and absolute', regardless logic and the argument and the common sense we can bring to the debate. So Rob Borbidge said, as did Jeff Kennett, that they had the door slammed in their faces by their political mates at the national level. What did we have from John Olsen, the South Australian Premier? He warned: .... the elderly would be the fIrst to be hit by the funding shortfall with delays also likely in the introduction of new tecimology. That was John Olsen. What did Richard Court from Western Australia have to say? Mr Hollis-What party is he from?",99
258,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He is another member of the Liberal Party. Mr Hatton-Is he a friend of the Labor Party?,99
259,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Once again the question is asked of me: is he a friend of Labor? Let me answer that question. No. Is he an enemy of Labor? Yes. Is he a colleague of the present national coalition of the Liberal Party and the National Party? Yes. What did Richard Court say? He said: What I plead the Federal Government is to look behind the actual dollar figures being provided. needs to be a recognition at the federal level that the current fInances simply can't provide the billion services that the public is demanding. of Let me repeat that. We said that there was He 'widespread concern about what this government is doing to health. Richard Court said the that the present level of funding: . .. simply can't provide the services that the public is demanding. That is perfectly correct. .We have made the point repeatedly today, and we are goIng to continue making it, that the federal government, the minister, Dr Wooldridge, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, chose to in effect take the states and territories for a ride and in the process of doing that to also take for a ride 18 million Australians. They said, 'We are going to pump extra funds into the health and hospital system. It is going to represent a real increase of 15 per cent over five years.' And it has all been exposed. There are no of the additional funds at all. They are simply replacing the funds that this coalition government ripped out of the system. I am genuinely sympathetic for members of the government who find themselves in a public position where they have to get up and defend the indefensible. I say that particularly about Mrs Trish Worth, the member for Adelaide, who just led for the government in seeking to defend it. Mrs Worth had a very successful background in the area of health before she came into this parliament. She has now the responsibility of defending what she knows to be indefensible. I am going to give only two examples out of the comments that Mrs Worth made.",99
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their titles.,100
261,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Adelaide referred to the games they play when they come to Canberra. She was talking about the premiers. The premiers and the chief ministers were not playing games when they came to Canberra. The people playing the games were the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). The member for Adelaide also said that spending on health is very important, but then she said: ... let us have some honesty about it. Let us have some honesty about it, indeed. What are these games that are played when premiers and chief ministers come to Canberra? And who plays the games? We are talking about the health of Australians. To my mind that is something objective; it is something for which measurable and quantitative judgments can be made about the volume of funds which are necessary for it. Let me just go over some of the childish, stupid tactics of the federal government. The initial proposal, as you know, was an offer of $3 billion extra from the Commonwealth. That was over and above the amount of $26 billion that had been provided under the previous agreement. That made it $29 billion that the Commonwealth offered. After that, the Commonwealth offered another $80 million to 100 million and then upped that to $120 million because the states and the territories had dug their heels in, saying that it was not enough. The Commonwealth increased its offer from $29 billion to $30.17 billion. This is like a Persian market. These are the fun and games. This is the way the present federal government responds to the legitimate concerns on the part of state premi- it? ers and territorial chief ministers. The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 March said that the Prime Minister had indicated yesterday that the states might not get a better offer than the 15 per cent increase but he left open the possibility that they would. These are the games being played by this national govt<rnment. (Time expired)",100
262,Mrs WEST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have heard a lot today. It seems to me there is a lot of huffing and puffing going on from the other side. Health has always been a critical issue in this country but I have never come across the hypocrisy of the ones elected to the other side who are just trying to cover up 13 years of guilt. It is guilt that has been expressed by the honourable members on the other side, who are trying to cover up their inefficiencies, their inadequacies and their inability to address the same problems we are facing in 1997 and 1998 as they were facing in 1990 and 1983. The more they went on nothing seemed to change, but we are now in the box seat to reform what you failed to address over 13 years of ineffective administration. Mr Lee-You reformed the Wynnum Medicare office!",100
263,Mrs WEST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, the member for Dobell brings up an interesting point. It is all very well for you to talk about the Wynnum Medicare office closure. It is an unfortunate situation. The reason it is closing is that there were not enough accounts going through"" that office. Mr Lee-So it should have been closed?",100
264,Mrs WEST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yesterday you indicated your widespread community concern in Wynnum. The Macquarie Dictionary defines widespread as 'distributed over a wide region, or occurring ... among many persons or individuals'. You attended a protest at Wynnum yesterday in my electorate. You saw around 70 people as representing widespread concern. Of course it was reported in the press as being over 100 but, then, people do tend to exaggerate when they want to make things seem more important than they are. Mr Bruce Scott-Labor Party branch, was",100
265,Mrs WEST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Absolutely; all their hacks, because my people were among the crowd as well and they asked the people in the protest about whether they used the service. They did not use the service and the people they asked did not use the service either. Get your facts right. The reason the Medicare office is closing is that people are voting with their feet. They were beating up a storm in a teacup. We are in trouble if the member for Dobell becomes the minister because the public purse will be hit and hit hard. I suggest that the Labor Party will also have the old bankcard out, spending an<- spending or increasing taxes to satisfy the shadow minister's understanding of what he calls 'widespread concern'. Who allowed the private health system to run down? Mr Bruce Scott-Labor.",100
266,Mrs WEST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Labor. They presided over a system which, in 13 years, saw private health insurance coverage of Australians fall from 65 per cent to 34.5 per cent. It is still falling. This decline in private health cover has placed intolerable demands on the public system. The Labor legacy in 1982-83 was a cost for health of $220 per capita. In 1997 cost has risen to $1,150. The costs of private health insurance in 1983 were $505 fora family; today they are $2,500. We have only been in office for 24 months. All that grief was not of our doing. All those increases were not because of a coalition government. Who was in power? Labor. The Labor Party created a system of unsustainable proportions. And if the trend of the decade continues, we will have gone from a $3.4 billion allocation towards health in 1983 to over $20.7 billion in the next four years. For a population of 18 million that is a huge impost. If Labor come to office again, where will they get that kind of money? There is more too, because the different shadow ministers argue amongst themselves over how much is going to be needed to address the current health care problems. Where are they going to get it? Let me think: what did they do last time? Can we trust them? Can we risk it? I do not think so. They will whack it on the bankcard and create problems for the whole Australian community. Which party created the chaos in our public health system? Labor. They presided over a clearly unsustainable budget situation. They left the Australian people a legacy of $10.5 billion in deficit. In 1996 our nation's Medicare benefit schedule was $6.2 billion. That is more than the budget of Western Australia, and it is expected to rise a further 40 per cent in the next four years. Labor increased the Medicare levy by 1.5 per cent after promising not to do so. This increase failed to add any benefit to the health system as pressures were occurring because of the declining cover of Australians by private - nsurance. Labor. has not delivered. In 1996 Australia's immunisationrate was only 53 per cent, well below China, Algeria and Vietnam. Even the smallest island state of Samoa has a higher immunisation rate of 97 per cent. Labor's national Aboriginal healtli strategy collapsed; in fact in 1996 the state of health of indigenous Australians was relatively worse than it was in 1983. I am pleased to say that I am part of a standing committee that is looking into a 20-year reassessment of indigenous health problems. We are going to the make recommendations, and Labor will be held accountable for the changes that need to be made by a committed governmentthat will ensure that the health of all Australians is of a high quality. The coalition government has committed $1.7 billion to private health insurance to allow battlers to maintain their health cover in an effort to reduce the flourishing waiting lists created by 13 years of Labor government. The coalition has preserved funding for hospitals., The state governments are reducing hospital funding, not the coalition. I commend the state minister for health in Queensland, Mr Horan, who is doing an excellent job of maintaining public health facilities and doing very nicely. In fact, my electorate has two projects that will see benefits directly linked to services provided in the community by a coalition led state government. Which party watched as the aged care system declined under the cuts to funding which were invoked, despite the advice that they had received from their best mates? You could not even take the advice given by your best Labor mates to improve the system. And what happened? You did not take their advice and after 13 years you are in opposition, we are in government, and the country is absolutely awake to the lies and mythology that you perpetrated for 13 years. We inherited your mess. During your time in office there were widespread concerns. I draw attention to a briefing note from my colleague Dr Brendan Nelson, who last night quoted what the Australian Financial Review of 10 April 1992 had to say when Mr Brian Howe was the health minister. The article said: Federal and State government health ministers are expected to open next week's negotiations on the new five-year Medicare agreement with a clash over hospital funding. So what. has changed? Mr Keith Wilson, a member of the Carmen Lawrence Labor state government of the day, said: ... I want to draw attention to the major issues which are of primary concern to 'me as Minister for Health in Western Australia-the provision of hospital services in that state. He goes on: The pre-eminent issue, which I believe this conference must focus on, is that seriously sick Australians are daily unable to gain access to needed hospital treatment. That was in 1992. What did you do for the last six years? Nothing. There were problems in 1992, so why didn't you fix them? Why didn't you fix the Commonwealth-state funding issue? Why didn't you see the problems that needed to be addressed and do something about them? After 24 months, we are in the process of doing something positive for the health system. It will not happen overnight; it might not happen in one term, but it will happen if the community of Australia gets behind those with faith, and we have faith that the coalition government will overcome these health problems. We have a 'get tough on drugs' campaign. For the first time this nation's mentally ill will have genuine representation. (Time expired)",101

(2) Schedule 1, item 12, page 5 (line 7), after ""section 26"", insert ""(including section 26 as varied in the circumstances set out in subsection 28(4»"". (3) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (lines 12 to 14), omit section 28, substitute: 28 Financial assistance conditional on entry into agreement Entsch, W. G. (1) Financial assistance is payable to a State under this Part in respect of the 5 years starting on 1 July 1998 only if the State has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth before 2 June 1998. (2) If a State does not enter into an agreement with the Commonweillth before 2 June 1998, the Commonwealth may, in a law providing for the annual appropriation of money in respect of the year starting on 1 July 1998, provide for the payment of financial assistance to the State in respect of that year on such terms and conditions, including terms and conditions requiring adherence by the State to the Health Care Agreement Principles set out in section 29 of this Act, as are determined in writing by the Minister. (3) If a State enters ipto an agreement with the Commonwealth on or after 2 June 1998 and before 1 July 1999, financial assistance is payable to the State under this Part in respect only of the 4 years starting on 1999. (4) For the purpose of the application of this Part in circumstances where a State enters into an agreement with the Comm<;lllwealth on or after 2 June 1998 and before 1 July 1999, this Part has effect as if each reference to the 5 years starting on 1 July 1998 were a reference to the 4 years starting on 1 July 1999. The government amendments are intended to provide a mechanism to honour the government's commitment to provide funding to the states for health care next year on the basis set out in the Commonwealth offer, regardless of walkouts by petulant prerniers. If the states will not sign up, we will provide the funding through an annual appropriation on the condition that the states adhere to the principles set out in this bill. Once the states come to their senses soine time in 1998-99 and sign up, the amendments will allow them to receive funding under this bill for 1999 to 2000 and later years. Many payments to the states are provided under the annual appropriation and I see there is no good reason why the Commonwealth contribution to state health budgets cannot be provided in this way for 1998-99. Of course, it will be difficult to achieve the reforms we are seeking without agreements with the states, but that is another reason why I am confident that the states will sign up sooner or later. They value reform and endorse and welcome it just as much as the Commonwealth.",103
274,Dr LAWRENCE,AYES PAIRS,"Fremantle) (4.48 p.m.Not satisfied with cutting expenditure on the public health system by almost $2 billion and states grants by much the same amount since its election, the government has now made the states an offer under the new Medicare agreements which will seriously exacerbate the already parlous state of our public hospital system. If we need an example, it was provided today in a story in the West Australian under the headline 'New hospital hits budget problems'. The state government's first fully privati sed public hospital has actually had to cancel all elective surgery because of a 1 July budget blow-out. It has not been able to get extra funds from the government, demand has been much higher than anticipated and already in the northern suburbs of Western Australian there is a two-tiered system. What is happening is that the hospitals are offering people a place for elective surgery if they can pay for it and if they cannot it has been cancelled altogether. That is what we are 'looking forward to' with these changes. Having served in both levels of government, I am very well aware of the manoeuvres which canbe employed by each side to make the other look culpable for any budget cuts and any systems failures. Sadly, our federal system does invite such behaviour, particularly when the governments are of opposite political persuasions. This makes this dispute all the more puzzling, because these are the mates of the conservatives in government. On many occasions during my time. as minister I had to draw attention to the behaviour of conservative state governments, particularly Victoria and, at the time, New South Wales and Western Australia, who were cutting their own funds for hospitai services while· the Commonwealth was steadily increasing funding as a result of the 1993 Medicare. agreements. The result then was a zero sum game and no discernible improvement in either the quality of services or in waiting times for elective surgery. What the Commonwealth put in with one hand, the states took out with another. I also very clearly recall the derision with which this observation was greeted by the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). In their eyes, the conservative state governments who were pulling these funds out could do no wrong. Even the very blatant cost cutting and cost shifting being perpetrated by the Kennett government in Victoria aroused no censure at all from members of this government, including the current health minister whose state it is. It was clear at the time, and it is clear now, that any future agreements would need both stiffer sanctions-and we do not s¢v that at all' in this legislation-and b-tter incentives to ensure that both sides stick to the rules' and abrogate any tricky devices to make someone else pay the bill, often the private health insurer or the individual. The focus needs to . be finnly on achieving quality services for the patient and the community at· a reasonable total cost. There is no point in shifting the burden around if you are gradually increasing the costs to the community. While the Prime Minister has in recent tried to use my arguments to bolster his current position. in relation to the states, he simply demonstrates to' me and to many others that he does not know,. or pretends to know, what is really ..going on now. The Primf(Minister need only examine the figures produced by independent re.searchers at both the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Stll,tistics to agreements. understand the wails of the stategc,vernntents. Why are they shrieking so loudly? Why have they walked out on their own political coldecent leagues? The funding game which Dr Wooldridge boldly claimed he WOuld personally eliminate has--courtesy of this government's budgetary strategy--,-nowseesaWed in the opposite direcOrder! tion. The states, poor souls, have actually been increasing their funding in the last couple of years and the Commonwealth has now pulled the funds out from Commonwealth sources. Again, the net result is no increase in hospital funding. Fro.m the time Jb-. Labor government was elected in. 1983, 'the proportion of health funding provided by the Commonwealth increased while the proportion from the states and territories declined. We have seen a turnaround in the last couple of budgets. What has happened, of course, is that from 1990 onwards the states pulled out substantial funding. I do not know if it is permissible to incorporate this, but I have here a table drawn from the .Au-tralian'lnstitute .of Health and Welfare statistics which shows very clearly days . what happened. As the Commonwealth was increasing its funding under the 1993 agreement. th- states were clearly .decreasing theirs. By the end of 1996 they had put it back in not again, and they have continued.to do so. The result is it. Z,erosl,llU game, because the . Commonwealth ltas not only taken money out in the lasttwohtidgets, but also is threatening to t.ake even ID()re in the new Medicare As a former health minister and premier, I call· on this government to actually make a offer which takes account of the cost escalation, including the increasing number of people who need the services' because of the ageing of the community and demographic changes, and not to bury its head in the sand.",104

277,Mr CADMAN,AYES PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum to these amendments.",107
278,Mr BOB BALDWIN,AYES PAIRS,"As I speak on the amendments which have been moved on behalf of the government in relation to financial assistance tional on entry into agreement, I think we need to reflect on the Labor Party's record on health care over the 13 years from 1983 to 1996. That record was absolutely appalling, as we all know-and even my Labor colleagues in this chamber would begrudgingly agree. Speaking of poor records, let us look at New South Wales. For all appearances, the New South Wales health system seems to have been run into the ground. This is despite the absolute dedication of the health professionals in my electorate of Paterson and the operation of both private and public hospital institutions in areas such as Maitland, Dungog, Gloucester-and, of course, not forgetting the polyclinic at Nelson Bay. Indeed, extends right across the Hunter, including the acclaimed John Hunter facility. No slick PR campaign across our airwaves which is supported, authorised and endorsed by the New South Wales government is going to change bald facts. The New South Wales health system has some major problems-problems such as are had in any other Western health care system-which the current health care agreement on offer now on the table will help to address. Just to keep things in perspective, the New South Wales 1997-98 base grant entitlement funding equates to $1.472 billion. The base funding under the new AHCA for 1998-99 equals $1.528 billion-an increase of 3.76 per cent for New South Wales. It equates to an extra $55.4 million extra in one year alone base funding for New South Wales hospital services, and $58.2 million in new funding for veterans' health services provision in my state. It would deliver up to $41.3 million . under the 'cut waiting lists' course, extra money for capital works. But NSW's claim-from the mouth of Dr Refshauge-to obtain, with the rest of the states collectively, an extra $1.1 billion in the first year and $5.5 billion over five years in hospital funding is just not cricket. And that is even on top of the growth in forward estimates, which I outlined earlier. Indeed, the good doctor's claims for additional funding under the new health agreement are about condiwanting to take his bat and ball and head home. They ring hollow when the extent to which costs are shifted onto the Commonwealth by the New South Wales public hospital system is taken into account. According to Dr Refshauge, New South Wales does not cost shift to the Commonwealth. But example after example of cost shifting has been exhibited. For example, there is the Nepean Hospital in outer Sydney, admitting patients from accident and emergency as private patients when they have asked to be admitted as public patients. There is the St George Hospital, reclassifying public patients to private status. Then, locally in the Hunter region, there is the John Hunter Hospital, reclassifying public day-only pathis tients for gastroscopies and colonoscopies to private outpatients, and billing Medicare. It is pretty difficult to understand how Dr Refshauge can claim to be short-changed by the Commonwealth when it appears as though cost shifting already funded under the current Medicare agreements back to the Commonwealth is endemic in the New South Wales health system. - This issue is not a game; it is not about kicking the political football of health care funding around the park just for the hell of it. In fact, we should not be playing this game at all. Not only are the people of NSWincluding, specifically, the people of the Hunter-quite frankly, fed up and mentally exhausted, having little idea as to what the belligerent states or Commonwealth are really for on about over all this debate, but so are the people of Australia. Millions are being jumbled with billions; politicians, unsurprisingly, are taking opposite ends of an argument to, presumably, suit their own ends and their own incentive and, of political needs. But I do have to say this: if the likes of Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge want to make a significant contribution to the health care debate, they need to do a few things. Firstly, they have to sign the latest Australian health care agreement; secondly, get their financial act in order to sustain their promises on health care; and, thirdly, if they want to make a contribution in the area of private health insurance, let us go about it collectively and in an orderly fashion in the right I am a big supporter of private health states' . insurance. We need private health insurance. Indeed, the time may soon come where we need to sit down and have a good hard look at prospects for its possible tax deductibility, even an assessment of the continued effectiveown ness of community rating or even gap insurIlnce. But if and when that time comes, we need to do it in the right way and at the right time.

I also want to express my outrage that I have been denied, once again, an opportunity to participate in the second reading debate on this bill-as I was denied the opportunity yesterday to participate in the debate on the Aged Care Bill. Both bills are very important to the people of my electorate, and they are very important to the people in the electorates of all those members on this side who have been denied that opportunity. I am a little bit disappointed with the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin). I issued an invitation to him last night during the adjournment debate. Having seen his name on the speakers list for this bill, I extended to him an invitation to come in here today and stick up for his constituents for a change. He has done nothing to support the coalminers; he does not even return their phone calls. Mr Bob Baldwin-That's crap. You're a liar. Mr FITZGmBON-His opportunity here today was to forget about partyMr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. You might not have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the member for Paterson accused the member for Hunter of being a liar. I ask that you remind him of the normal rules of behaviour in this place.",107

282,Mr FITZGIBBON,AYES PAIRS,"The member for Paterson had a golden opportunity today to come into this House and, for once in his two years here, defend the people he is meant to be representing-to come in here and criticise and recognise that his own government is screwing the people in his own electorate. What did he do instead? It was the same old line. He came in here with a written speech which was basically a tirade against the Carr Labor government. There was no mention of Borbidge or Kennett. There was no mention of the fact that all of the conservative premiers, as mentioned earlier by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), walked out of the Premiers Conference last Friday. There was no mention of any of the conservative premiers or territory leaders. The member for Paterson simply wanted to single out the Carr Labor government. But he cannot have it both ways. I am a bit mixed up about his logic. He spent half of his time trying to tell us, fairly poorly, about the situation in his electorate. He named each of the hospitals; he got them into the Hansard so that he could spit them out to the various groups in the electorate. He got all of the names in. He did not suggest any of them were in need of additional funding. What he said was that they were all doing wonderfully. But then he told us that the whole system was under stress because of the Carr Labor government. You cannot have it both ways. There is a simple fact in life, and that is that the coalition got bitten on Medicare at the 1993 election. In my view, they probably lost that election on Medicare alone. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was not going to get caught twice. They went to the 1996 election with a definite different view. On this occasionMr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, - Mr FITZGmBON-He's just using up my time, Mr Deputy Speaker.",110

I have already been denied a speech on the second reading stage, and the member for Paterson wants to deny me a contribution at this stage because he does not like what he is hearing. I want to return to my point. What did the member for Bennelong do in 1996? He went to the people this time guaranteeing them that he would leave Medicare alone. What has he done since? What he is doing is dismantling it through the backdoor. He is dismantling it by taking a ridiculous attitude at the Premiers Conference. He is doing it through the backdoor by squeezing Medicare rebates, which is causing general practitioners, particularly in the electorate of the member for Paterson, to abandon bulk-billing at a rate of knots.

289,Mr ANTHONY,AYES PAIRS,"There was a question today in the House asked by the member for  respond to because I have been misrepresented. At no time did I claim that the government had begun a review of the results of the successful employment tenderers in the Byron Shire. Beyond the results of the Job Network tender, there are additional employment issues which I have raised and have written to the minister about and which he indicated his understanding on a recent visit to the Byron Shire. The Commonwealth's Northern Rivers Areas Consultative Committee-better known as ACC-will be looking at employment services in the Byron Shire. The ACC advise that they are examining this situation and that the minister has requested that they advise the government of their findings. Mr Fitzgibbon-With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am trying to determine whether the member for Richmond has just indicated to the House that the minister earlier misled the House?",111
290,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES PAIRS,"The chair is in no position to judge that. Mr Andrew- Mr Deputy Speaker, to relieve you of what is clearly a difficult situation, let me say that I was in conversation with the shadow minister.

291,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES PAIRS,I thank the honourable member.,111
292,Mr LEE,AYES PAIRS,"These particular amendments before the House at the moment seek to give the government the flexibility to negotiate basically a one-year agreement or to allow the government to continue to pay the states funding for public hospitals for one year. We have a number of questions about this matter. I am sure that the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Mi tchell (Mr Cadman), has a detailed knowledge of these issues, especially considering the quality of the experts that are in the advisers box at the moment. So I am sure he can answer these detailed questions. We would like to know whether the government has received any legal advice on whether these amendments provide the same level of protection as would be the case if the five year Medicare agreements had been concluded with the states. In particular, we would like to know whether there is an equal amount of reassurance for the patients of Australia that they will not have a state government or territory government introduce new charges or fees if they are treated in public hospitals. There is a lot of scuttlebutt in this building that, if Mr Kennett and the other premiers and territory ministers do not sign agreements with this government and you end up going down the route proposed in these amendments, this is a second-best option; that this will not provide the same level of protection as the five-year Medicare agreements. Firstly, is that the case? Will there be same level of protection? Secondly, does the government have legal advice seeking to confirm that there will be the same amount of protection for patients and that they will not be slugged with new fees and charges? Because at the end of the day the,se agreements are about making sure that public patients are not charged for treatment in public hospitals. One of the essential elements of Medicare is that every Australian should have reasonable access to a public hospital in a reasonable amount of time. We would like to know before. this debate finishes whether the government can give us the answers to those two questions. Will there be the same amount of protection? Does the government have legal advice to justify such a reassurance? And will they make a copy available to the opposition?",111
293,Mr CADMAN,AYES PAIRS,I will endeavour to answer by the end of the day ..,112
294,Mr ANDREW,AYES PAIRS,"I rose somewhat provoked by the allegation of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) that the government had in some way sought to so compress this debate that he was denied his democratic rights to represent the people of the Hunter. As the Chief Government Whip, I am painfully aware and I suspect that he is reasonably well aware of the fact that the very issue we are debating in the half an hour devoted now is well above what was originally negotiated and was designed to aCCommodate the opposition. I would have thought he may have been a little more gracious about that. In dealing with these health amendments, everyone in this House, regardless of which side they sit on, recognises the real problem. The real problem is the escalating cost of health care. No-one in this House at least over 30 years of age is not well aware that health care is inevitably going to cost whoever is in power more and more of its share of the taxpayers' revenue. Let me illustrate the point. Perhaps before the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) was thought of, 30 years ago I had an appendicectomy with little more than a kitchen knife on a table, if you know what I mean. Today, if the I fronted up to my local GP and he said, 'You need your appendix removed,' I would say, as I suspect every other male and female aro-nd here would, 'With a body like mine, you really cannot afford to scar it. So I would like keyhole surgery. I would like laser treatment-I want to be back at work tomortowahd as little bloodshed as possible.' That is fine. He will do it for me. But, effectively, it will cost a great deal more than the treatment using a kitchen knife on the kitchen table. Precisely the same analogy applies to any one of the medical practices that we now take for granted. Thirty years ago a heart condition diagnosed in someone my age may well have been fatal. Today the doctor says, 'We will replumb.' The question of the cost scarcely even enters into it. Even more remarkablyand thankfully-diseases of 30 years ago that effectively would have killed us, terminal· iIInesses- can now be kept at bay because of modern surgery. All of these practices - cost money, and they cost an increasing proportion of the health budget. That is the bind that the government faces, it is a bind that the opposition faced when they were in government for 30 years, and it is a bind to which there is no easy solution. It is compounded by the fact that, for people in our s,alary bracket, going to the doctor is' a ridiculously cheap exercise. Let us say it costs $25 for a consultation: the government picks up $18 or something like that. For those on the other end of the salary - cale, going to the doctor remains an expensive exercise, much of which rightly is picked up by the general taxpayer. It is exacerbated by the fact that in 1989 many people on well below average weekly earnings, who therefore were unable to afford private health insurance, probably were forced to spend more money on maintaining their car than maintammg their health. This is the bind the government faces: how do you bridge this gap between the escalating cost of health and the willingness of people in our salary bracket to pay and the ability of people in a lower salary bracket to pay? That is why health is becoming an increasing problem for state governments. The federal government has not walked away from it, as the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) had suggested. State governments increasingly have tended to depend on the federal government. As the minister made it quite obvious, the federal government is picking up more and more of the share of the health cost but, in doing so, the state governments-whether conservative or not-have tended to walk away. from some of their responsibility. In the time remaining, I must add that, while this is a complex and difficult problem, it is not a problem which we should shirk. On the world scale, Australia still delivers a first class health service at a very competitive price. We have a problem we have to resolve, but relative to our surrounding countries and relative to the rest of the world-with the possible exception of the Swedes and the Japanese-we have a health system that is the envy of much of the rest of the world, and the government is committed through this legislation to maintaining that system.  p.m.)-The previous speaker cannot move away from the fact that it is not the availability of resources; it is what you do with the resources. The $1.7 billion that your government has pumped into trying to prop up private health insurance is your problem. This government labours under its own mythology that the solution to health care problems is in the private sector. Fewer than one person in three across this nation, from coast to coast, thinks that putting money into private health insurance funds is value for money. So the more than two out of three persons who are left are condemned to the degradation of the health service because your government refuses to allocate resources. Mr Andrew-Because those people will not accept their responsibility.  barrel effect. You can labour on in your mythology, but do not interrupt me, please-I listened to you quietly. There are three barrels coming out of this. The first is that you slashed $800 million out of the public hospital program. Second, the movement of people into the public hospital sector, because of their lack of confidence and trust in the private health sector, is added to the burden of the public hospitals. In Maitland, which is in the electorate of the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has just left the chamber and who supports this system, the cost of running its hospital has gone up by $1.5 million a year because an extra 610 patients are now being treated by that hospital because they have walked away from private health care. They do not see value in it. Do you opposite not understand that? The third effect is that, while government members are saying, 'We support Medicare; we want the best health care system,' they are busily closing 43 Medicare offices across this country, striking at the people in our community who most need immediate cash payments from Medicare. They do not have the money to go to the doctor, outlay $70 to $100 and then wait two or three weeks to get the money back. They need the money immediately to go from the doctor, to the pharmacy, to the supermarket. Do you not understand that? That is the problem. They are the people you are hitting at. The member for Paterson had the temerity a few weeks ago to support the closing of the Belmont Medicare office in my electorate. Again, he is somebody who labours in mythology. He ought to face up to the facts of the situation. Medicare is desired by the vast majority of the Australian community. Let me draw your minds to 1986, when the same man who is now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), said, 'Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.' Those opposite should have the guts to go out to the community and say that to the people now rather than doing it as a subterfuge. He then went on to say that radical surgery will need to be performed on Medicare and that bulk-billing will be abolished. You are trying to create a situation where Medicare will become unacceptable and people will be angry with it, then justifying the need for another health care system. Please give a thought, 'through you, Mr Deputy Speaker",112
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES PAIRS,"Mr Forrest)That is better.  who need support through· cash payments through Medicare facilities and treatment in public hospitals.

298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES PAIRS,"You will address your remarks through the chair; do not address them to members across the chamber.  am doing that via you. I shall not comment on it; others can hear it. As the current Prime Minister said in 1986, just 12 years ago, his belief was-and the policy of those opposite was-that Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster, that it needs radical surgery and bulk-billing will be abolished. I want to tell those opposite this: you can pretend to yourselves-like the member for Bowman (Mrs West) said-that those who turned up at her Medicare rally were Labor hacks. I dearly wish that the almost 14,000 signatures that have been gathered just around Belmont alone in my electorate in support of the retention of Belmont Medicare office were those of Labor hacks. But they are voters and, regardless of their political colour, they know they have a good service. They want that service. To hear this mythology again coming from the other side of the House shows they do not understand. My friend the member for Paterson has come back. My friend-through you, Mr Deputy Speaker-you look after your Medicare offices; I do not want you supporting the closure of my Medicare office. (Time expired)",114
299,Mr CADMAN,AYES PAIRS,"Mitchell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business) (5.16 p.m.)During the debate the shadow minister raised a couple of questions which I wish to respond to briefly. I think that his questions really revolved around the certainty of protectionto make sure that there is the same protection for individuals and for people who might be using hospital services-and around the prospect of states making further or new charges. I would like to draw his attention to the Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998, which clearly states that it will provide for payments of financial assistance to the states in respect of that year on such terms and conditions including the terms and conditions requiring adherence by the state to the health care agreement principles. So the health care agreement principles must be contained in any agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the states. The Commonwealth minister determines the broad conditions, but those principles must be contained within those conditions. Mr Lee-But is it as good as the five-year agreement?",114
300,Mr CADMAN,AYES PAIRS,"I am advised that the government's role in these things is to improve health conditions; so, yes, it certainly that is as good as the five-year agreement. Those health care agreement principles are the five year principles; they are embodied in the five year agreement. Mr Lee-The second question was: have you had legal advice?",114
301,Mr CADMAN,AYES PAIRS,"The legal advice available to me is that the conditions are determined by the minister but that the minister must include adherence by the states to the health care agreement principles within those conditions.

302,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Forrest)Order! It being after 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Medicare Office: Belmont  p.m.)-This afternoon I want to draw attention to action by the Federal Airports Corporation to massively increase landing charges at Sydney airport for regional airline operators. The effect of that in the Hunter area would be to increase, for instance, charges per passenger for Impulse Airlines from $6 per passenger up to $28 per passenger by the year 2000, and similarly for aircraft operating out of Belmont for Aeropelican the total effect of the increase would be to increase by 332 per cent the cost of the landing charges they would be eligible to pay-in other words, from $135,000 to $450,000 per year. What that scale of charges constitutes is effectively a strategy to lock regional airline operators out of Sydney airport. The people I represent in the Hunter and on the Central Coast are not going to accept second-class treatment in respect of airline services from this government. We, as non-metropolitan Australians, are as much entitled to easy air access to the international and national airline network as. are metropolitan Australians in the Sydney region. Access to that service is critically important for family reasons, for the conduct of business, for industry reasons, for access of our customers to the Hunter region to visit and see the products we sell and to inspect the services we provide, and it is of extreme importance for the growth of our tourism industry. I call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) to direct the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who has now joined in the attack on regional airlines in his newsletter, to cease his attacks on regional airlines and regional airline passengers. I refer to the newsletter put out by the Minister for Finance and Administration in his own electorate entitled 'Airport News for Macarthur', March 1998. A paragraph in that reads: If regional and other smaller flights such as thesereferring to regional and non-scheduled flightsAviation can be. diverted to another airport, perhaps Bankstown, It may be that a second airport is not required for decades to come-it's a possibility that would require detailed investigation. That is a fallacy from beginning to end. Bankstown is not an alternate airport in terms of service and accessibility for regional airlines. The linkage for regional airlines is into the national airline network and into the international airline network in both its inbound and outbound services. I also call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to direct the Federal Airports Corporation-he has that power under the act-to abandon its proposed increased charges. That matter would be most detrimental to the people I represent, and particularly to the people of the Hunter. I make one last plea in these few minutes to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I have spoken in this House several times already in support of the retention of Belmont Medicare office. I have written to the minister this week and I have spoken to the minister this week. It is scheduled to be closed tomorrow. I want to be able to go back to Belmont tomorrow and have a celebration for the people of Belmont. Not for me-it does not matter to me; it is not me that is affected-but the people in the families who need immediate cash payments after they have been to the doctor. I want him to reverse that decision. I cling to that hope. I am waiting on a response from him. I have indicated to him that there would certainly be recognition of that reversal of opinion. Sure, it would take some courage, but it can be done and in this case it ought to be done. Almost 14,000 signatures have appeared on petitions I have presented to this parliament in support of the retention of that office. That ought to be a clear indication to everybody how important that service is to Australians. They want their Medicare service. They want access to reasonable health care, to quality health care, and they want access to immediate cash payments after they have -, been to the doctor and paid their bills. So I appeal to the minister again, remembering also that we have seen from this government in its commitment to health care $800 million stripped from the public hospital system. We have seen a situation where $1.7 billion has been pumped into private health funds when less than one in three people in this country believe that private health funds are value for money.

However, in your position as Shadow Minister I wish to bring to your notice and consideration on .the following matters which greatly coricem me as I'm just a couple of months off my 92nd birthday. First my own position as a representative of many in my personal situation. I am a N.S.W. State superannuant on a fixed income, adjusted for C.P'!. each June quarter but not payable until October. No choice-join Super or NO job in my day, no lump sum, but changes allowed commutation to part lump sum, provided always sufficient was left so a superannuee on fortnightly pension would NEVER qualify for an Old Age Pension and ALL its priVileges.

A close friend aged 84, only income the Old Age pension, gums continually ulcerated because of the by then ill fitting dentures sought relief under the health scheme and after making ALL the necessary applications was told she had to wait 14 months. Thirteen months later she enquired as to the date of an appointment at Newcastle and was told she had to wait another ten months. She DID get her dentures, thanks to assistance from friends and a private dentist. Just HOW could anything be WORSE than that. That was Labor under Keating. Mr Wilton-You closed it down.",117
306,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Listen. I said that was Labor under Keating. The letter continues: 2. During the past six years, including the Howard years, that is during the Keating years, because of ageing and physical disabilities I sought HOSTEL care-incidentally I lost my wife suddenly in 1980--and investigated hostels from Coffs Harbour to Sussex Inlet.

You and me, Tom, Dick, Mary and Jane-the taxpayers. The Government is merely a collection and distributing agency, when some Department or organisation DEMANDS greater assistance-donations-it is you and who have to pay.

307,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"With the announcement of the Prime Minister Howard) that the government is privatise Telstra so as to fund an election war chest, it is likely that the House will witness more of the unfettered support speeches for the sale of the kind given by the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) in the adjournment debate on Monday night. It was an adjournment speech in which he went siderations through the ideology of the sale as he saw it, citing examples of what had happened in account. Cuba and Albania. I would suggest that the only people who really have a policy driven by ideology are those who sit on the governtee's ment benches. They are pursuing their love for the free market and privatisation to the detriment of all else. Telstra is a classic example of this. If we look at Labor's policy on Telstra, decided at the national conference in Hobart earlier this year, we recognise the enormous role that Telstra plays in the national econ Mr omy and in the community generally. If we look at some of the polling since the Prime Minister's announcement, we see that the preselected, majority of the public also think that way. poll in the West Australian on 24 March shows 60 per cent against the sale. The in the Herald Sun in Melbourne on 19 March showed 58 per cent against. This week's Bulletin shows that 62 per cent totally disagree with the coalition's Telstra sell-off. What was very instructive about that was that 63 per cent of non-Telstra shareholders and on the the majority of Telstra shareholders-55 per to be cent-are against the sale. We have the likes of the member for Boothby coming in and quoting figures on so economics that he has been given by senior members of the government. I perhaps would me suggest to him that he might look at articles to be like that which appeared in the Financial Review of last Thursday where John Quiggin, out who I believe is somebody who makes a lot sense when he writes articles about current dead affairs, indicated that some of the sums that are being put forward are out of order. He suggests that the saving that might be achieved by the sale based on the interest Telstra rates that prevail is about $2.5 billion, not $4 billion that has been suggested by senior members of the government or $3 billion as (Mr suggested by the honourable member for to fully Boothby on Monday night. John Quiggin goes on to say that when you take into account the dividend and the value of return investments to Telstra, five years after a full sale, the effect of the sale of Telstra will be negative. These are the conthat in a proper full debate about the full sell-off of Telstra should be taken into I also want to raise some of the information that was highlighted in the Senate commitreport of 1996 entitled Telstra-to sell or not to sell, where at appendix 8 they listed the cross-subsidies in each federal electorate. It makes very instructive reading. In the electorate of Paterson in New South as Wales-the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) has now left the chamber-the cross-subsidies were $1.136 million. Speaker, I understand that the National Party is looking for another candidate for the electorate of Parkes. That candidate, when will have to explain the effect on A the cross-subsidy there in Parkes of $15.215 million. In my state of Victoria the honourpoll able member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) will have to explain what effect the full sale of Telstra will have on the $2.284 million crosssubsidy. In the state of Queensland the person who will be preselected to take the place of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor)-a very fine member of this Housewill have to explain what is going to happen to the $0.5 million of cross-subsidy. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Kauer) will have to explain $10.7 million worth of cross-subsidy. What will happen to that? No won<;ier the honourable member for Kennedy is so concerned about the sale. And the list goes on. These are the things that those people in rural Australia are very concerned about. There is no guarantee that, under a fully privatised Telstra, the type of cross-subsidies that enable services to be put into the rural areas will continue. Even under the partially privatised Telstra very important services apply in the rural sector have already been done away with. The employment consequences will also be seen. Twenty-four thousand was the figure suggested in the Mercury report. Many of those positions were in rural Australia. What will honourable members on the other side be saying about those issues? (Time expired) Asian Financial Crisis",118
308,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (5.46 p.m.)Earlier today we debated in this place a piece of relatively minor amending legislation in relation to the International Monetary Fund and arrangements which we want to put into place. I and a number of my colleagues were disappointed that we were not able to contribute to that debate. Whilst the content of the legislation was. relatively minor, underpinning it was a very serious problem having not only domestic implications for Australia but also international ramifications. The Asian financial crisis, which started currency markets in South-East Asia and spread to other markets, first undermined confidence and then faith in the certainty of continued high growth in the region-the so called East Asian miracle-and the ensuing economic downturn has raised very serious questions about the foundations of that growth, the soundness of the region's financial sectors, the role of government in directing investment and lending and even the appropriateness of Asian values in the context of free market orthodoxy. It has also presented the region's economies with a number of interrelated challenges: implementing the financial sector reforms needed to attract foreign capital back into the region, establishing governance practices which will improve transparency and accountability and developing growth strategies which are both sustainable and inclusive. As a country Australia can be proud of what it has achieved, particularly over the last two years, economically at the domestic level. I listened to a number of very good speeches on that legislation from the other side of the House, in particular the speech from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I do not agree with him that the IMF that is the total negative factor in this whole equation. I certainly do not agree with him that, had this government not taken the measures that it has taken domestically, we would not be insulated to the extent that we clearly are, albeit with the potential for trade figures in due course to be adversely affected-hopefully, not to the degree that some in the opposition might want to see. This is not just an East Asian problem. It has economic, political and strategic dimensions. I agree particularly with an article I read in the Far Eastern Economic Review of 12 February this year. It said: What the region needs is to put in place a political system that places values on accountability and transparency, that controls corruption and sets up an administrative and regulatory system that is suited to the age of globalisation. If we do not watch it, there is also a global potential that none of us would want in relation to the Asian financial problems that exist at the moment. It is in everybody's in interest-in this country and in other countries-to acknowledge that. In particular, the IMF package will not happen to the extent that it should unless the US Congress agrees to play its part in the assistance packages. When I was there six or eight weeks ago there was a very mixed reaction. I hope that when it does come to a vote later on this month or in April, congressmen and senators on both sides will see exactly what this is all about. It is a problem that we and they have to come to grips with, otherwise we will see this serious problem move into Japan-as undoubtedly it already has, to a limited extent-across the Pacific and we will have total deflation right around the world if we do not watch it. None of us want that. I just hope that the US Congress clears what is a reasonable package and that that will happen fairly soon. Carrum Downs",119
309,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to draw the federal parliament's attention to the plight of Carrum Downs, which is a very important part of my electorate of Isaacs. Like other regions, Carrum Downs began as a rural hamlet. Since 1978 the population has grown substantially. According to the 1996 census, Carrum Downs was the fastest growing urban centre in Victoria between 1991 and 1996. That made it the 10th fastest growing area in Australia at that time-growing at an astounding rate of 82.6 per cent during that period. Sadly, however, many of the government services it receives have been left one step behind. In Carrum Downs, 31.2 per cent of the population are under IS-the national average is 21.6 per cent-but there are very few services for these kids. It is not just that is no youth centre, no local cinema and no easily accessible public transport that young children can access but many other things. Indeed, with little local employment opportunities it is very difficult for young kids in Carrum Downs to get on the job training at a young age to equip them with the skills that they know they will need in their later adult working lives. Of course, the government also seeks to penalise Carrum. Downs families if their children cannot get jobs. The common youth allowance will no doubt hurt many Carrum Downs families. Those with an unemployed teenager may face having to come up with an extra $178 per fortntght to support their young unemployed adult. A family that earns $23,400 per year will face a cut in the amount of money their young adult receives from the government also---a further slight on families. The government's youth allowance will force families earning below average incomes to financially support their young unemployed adults. The majority of families in Carrum Downs are paying off a mortgage and also struggling to educate their young children. Now they will also have to pay food, clothing and transport costs for their young job seekers as well. In terms of child care, 13.5 per cent of the local population are aged five years and under, so child care is a big issue in Carrum Downs. Of course, I am speaking on behalf of families in that area when I say that the government's child-care cuts are really hurting them. This government has taken some $820 million out of child care in its last two budgets and it has shown, once again, that it has no regard for the provision of quality child care. This is an issue that I will definitely pursue across the area of Carrum Downs. I will certainly produce a survey for both parents and child-care centres to complete so that I can present the concerns about these government cutbacks direct to the federal parliament. Older Carrum Downs residents need the support and assistance of their government. They, of course, have paid taxes all their lives and many of them fought during World War there ll. They have worked hard to raise families and have made many great sacrifices. But from 1 March many older Australians, including many in Carrum Downs, needing to enter a nursing home will face· an extra daily fee. These nursing home fees will amount to up to $64 a day. The money does not go to the nursing home itself; it goes to the government and is nothing more, in that sense, than a disguised new tax. It comes on top of a new annual fee for nursing home care of up to $4,380 and must be paid by anyone with assets of more than $44,400. Those with between $22,500 and $44,399 in assets will pay a lesser charge. If these assets include the family home, most will have to pay the full amount and possibly sell their home to do it. Older Australians have already had to suffer the abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme, an increase in home and community care charges, restrictions on hearing services and, most recently, an increase in the cost of essential medicines. It is just not fair and it certainly hurts both working and retired men and women struggling in areas like Carrum Downs. But Labor, Mr Speaker, you will be pleased to know, has promised to abolish both new fees and, what is more, Kim Beazley has guaranteed that Labor will put back the $500 million John Howard has cut from aged care. There is no doubt that the community of Carrum Downs needs more government assistance to ensure that its expanding community prospers and develops into an even better place to live. The people of Carrum Downs deserve better than constant government cuts and I will do all I can to ensure that those cuts are remedied for the Carrum Downs area.

310,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Francis Bacon once said: That which is past is gone and irrevocable, and wise men have enough to do with things present and to come. Therefore. they do but trifle with themselves that labour in past matters. Last year we had the rather unedifying spectacle of members of the Labor Party, night after night in the adjournment debate, reading extracts from the Bringing Them Home document. I am not suggesting that those members who were reading this document did not do it seriously. However, I believe they were also probably instructed to try to deliver a political blow to those who sit on this side of the House. The simple message was: we care but you do not; we have the high moral ground but you do not. I was not impressed with the Bringing Them Home document. I was not impressed by the bleeding heart publicity surrounding the inquiry itself, all directed at pointing the finger at us as somehow being responsible for deeds done in the past. But, more than that, the tenor of the report was rhetorical and in parts quite poorly written. It suffered no criticism, notwithstanding the comments of former judge Sir Ronald Wilson, who was the author of the report along with others, when he said: Who needed corroboration when you saw tears running down the cheeks? I must say the judge needs a lesson in what it is like in the courts at first instance. I could take him around the District Court in Brisbane on any weekday and he would find half of all the complainants with tears running down their cheeks who were later found by juries to be absolute liars. That is a lesson that the judge, who I believe never practised at first instance in criminal courts, would need to understand. Recently Canada fell into that trap. It made an apology after much cajoling by the indigenous industry and straight away promised additional funding. However, four of the five indigenous leaders who were handed the scrolls of the reconciliation statement dismissed the apology as too weak and the funding as inadequate. The paradox is that those calling for apologies or reconciliation seem active in maintaining a political standoff which suits their position of influence. The black American commentator Thomas Sal has noted that these people have little incentive to bring about genuine reconciliation as their position usually depends on maintaining a climate of division. Les Carlyon recently wrote that the apology was a: ... then and now thing. You apologise for then but not for now. Tony Blair apologised for the Irish potato famine of the 1840s but not for Margaret Thatcher. President Clinton apologised for slavery but not for the CIA's roguery in Latin America or even for Michael Jackson. Mr Tanner-What's Michael Jackson got to do. with it?",121
311,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Carlyon concludes: What comes out of your mouth sounds grand and means nothing. which probably also means it is tailor-made for political discourse in the final days of the 20th century. The member for Melbourne laughs, but it is probably typical of the members on that side of the House. Now I am even more fortified in the belief that this debate is puerile. I firmly agree with the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as do my constituents who have contacted me and told him to not apologise under any circumstances. Dr Ron Brunton, the distinguished anthropologist, has analysed this report in detail and his report is worth reading. House adjourned at 6.00 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Warwick Smith to present a bill for an act to amend the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, and for other purposes. Mr Beazley to move That this House: (1) notes the Howard Government's continuing poor economic performance in terms of: (a) rates of economic growth which remain below the annual average of the last term of the previous Labor Government, (b) levels of unemployment which have improved little in the last two years while the number and proportion of people who have been unemployed for twelve months or longer remain above the levels inherited from the Labor Government and (c) net foreign debt, which in the December quarter of 1997 reached an all time high of $222.3 billion, equivalent to 43 per cent of Australia's GDP; and (2) calls on the Howard Government to acknowledge its poor economic performance and admit that it has shown poor economic leadership of Australia in the way in which it has dismissed the likely impact on Australia of the current economic and financial troubles in various Asian countries. Mr Beazley to move That this House: (1) notes the publication of the National Accounts for the December quarter of 1997 which show that economic growth, as measured by GDP(A), was (a) 2.8 per cent in calendar year 1997 and (b) 3.6 per cent in the year to the December quarter of 1997; (2) notes that the performance of the Australian economy under the Howard Coalition Government compares unfavourably with growth under the previous Labor Government when (a) economic growth in the year to March 1996 was 4.7 per cent and (b) the average annual growth over the Labor Government's last term, March 1993 to March 1996, was 4.4 per cent; (3) notes that economic growth over 1997 was (a) 0.9 percentage points lower than calendar year 1996 and (b) the lowest level of economic growth for five calendar years; and (4) notes that the Howard Government's massive cuts to employment and industry programs in its two slash and bum budgets and NA its constant undermining of business and consumer confidence have directly contributed to the Australian economy's poor growth performance compared with the last term of the Labor Government. Mr Beazley to move That this House: (1) notes that, despite its rhetoric, the Howard Government has had little success in reducing the level of unemployment which, on a monthly basis, has dropped below the level in the last month of the previous Labor Government on thrC(e times; and (2) notes that both the number of long-term unemployed persons, 240 900, and the number as a proportion of the total unemployed, 32.1 per cent, are higher than when the Howard Government took office.

Most people do not anticipate their early life, it would often be very unexpected and for their early death-that is the obvious retirement and to fully collect on our superannuation period automatically means that many people point when they need it because, if it expires people will remember to renew that nomination will end up being expired at the The reality is that people are not required notwithstanding the elapse of three years, five nomination is to be disclosed each year on I think that is an adequate safeguard.

The reality of this is that if we limit this hardship on those who happen to die early, while their superannuation policy, and limiting their MAIN COMMITTEE 1765 benefits there is a proposal-which I believe is allow fund members to nominate those who death while they are at work. However, there is a three-year expiry date on any nomination; nomination-in other words, you cannot nominate must be witnessed; and the nomination is to be indeed, I believe are very desirable-that is, be disclosed each year in the annual members However, with respect to the three-year expiry attempt in the legislation to limit people's choice demise. If that is to occur during one's working often quite sudden. And people do not plan well reality of daily life. We all hope to live into benefits.

Mr Rud,dock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Foreign doctors entering Australia on temporary visas are not required to pass the Australian Medical Council examination. Temporary resident doctors are, however, required to obtain registration with the relevant State or Territory Medical Boards before practicing in Australia. (2) There are no exceptions to the requirement referred to in the response to question (1). (3) See response to questions (1) and (2). (4) 898 doctors on temporary resident visas entered Australia in 1996-97. (5) The temporary resident doctors were from the following countries: Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Namibia, Netherlands, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, St Lucia, Switzerland, Tonga, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vanuatu.

Misuse of Medicare (Question No. 2675) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: (1) Has he consulted the Minister for Health to determine how many non-residents or non-citizens have undergone surgical procedures uSIng Medicare; if so. what are the details; if not, why not. (2) What statistics are available on the misuse of Medicare referred to in part (1). (3) Do the statistics indicate the extent to which the misuse relates to medical conditions which existed before arrival in Australia. (4) Is he able to say how many persons referred to in part (1) returned voluntarily to their country of nationality after treatment. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) I have asked my Department to consult with the Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) on this matter. DHFS advises that nonresidents do not have access to the Medicare arrangements except to the extent to which access is provided under the terms of a Reciprocal Health Care Arrangement. The Health Insurance Act 1973 (HIA) defines which people are eligible for Medicare. Eligibility for Medicare is generally restricted to an 'Australian resident' as defined in Section 3 of the HIA and the person must reside in Australia. Therefore: generally, non-residents do not qualify for, nor receive access to, Medicare benefits. No data distinguishes between access to Medicare by non-citizens as opposed to citizens, as once a person meets the definition of Australian resident in the HIA, they are an eligible person and may use Medicare. Data regarding numbers of persons accessing surgical procedures in public hospitals are held by the States and Territories. Residence Order Enforcement (Question No. 2702) Mr Lindsay asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 2 March 1998: (1) How may residence/residence orders enforcing a minimum stay with either parent of 40 per cent has the Family Court issued since the Family Law Reform Act 1995 was implemented. (2) What percentage does the figure referred to in part (1) constitute of the total number of Family Court orders issued in the same period. (3) How many residence/residence orders have been issued since the B&B case was concluded. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Family Court has advised me that the number of residence/residence orders enforcing a minimum stay with either parent of 40 percent, issued by the Family Court of Australia since 11 June 1996 (when the Family Law Reform Act was proclaimed) is not readily available, as information about the proportional split is not entered onto the Court's case management system. However, the Family Court has further advised me that it is estimated that the total number of all residence/residence orders (including consent and other court orders) made in the period from 1 July 1996 to 28 February 1998 was 1,280. (2) The Family Court has advised me that the total number of orders made in respect of children (including residence, contact and specific issues orders) made in the Family Court of Australia during the period from 1 July 1996 to 28 February 1998 was 76,750. The Family Court has further advised me that residence/residence orders therefore constituted approximately 1.7% of the total orders relating to children made during this period. (3) The Family Court has advised me that the total number of residence/residence orders (including consent and other court orders) made in the Family Court of Australia since judgment in the B&B case was handed down, on 9 July 1997, to 28 February 1998 is estimated to be 470. Indigenous Cultural Property: Repatriated to Australia (Question No. 2719) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 5 March 1998: (1) Can the Minister say (a) what items of indigenous cultural property have been repatriated to Australia since 1988 and (b) when, whence and in what circumstances they were repatriated. (2) What decisions and recommendations were made concerning indigenous cultural property and archives at the 13th meeting of the Cultural Ministers Council in Adelaide on 27 February 1998. (3) When and where will the 13th meeting of the council be held. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The return of indigenous cultural property from overseas falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. (2) At the 13th meeting of the Cultural Ministers Council held in Adelaide on 27 February 1998, members endorsed the approach set out in the strategic plan for the repatriation of indigenous ancestral remains and secret/sacred objects by 2001. The objectives of the strategic plan are to: identify where possible, the origins of all ancestral remains and secret/sacred objects held in museums, with records placed in national databases; notify all affected indigenous communities; and negotiate with museums and communities concerning repatriation when and where requested. Ministers undertook to consider funding for the implementation of the strategy in accordance with the agreed CMC formula and agreed to report back on deliberations by 30 June 1998 or at the next Standing Committee meeting, whichever is the sooner. (3) The 14th meeting of the Cultural Ministers Council will be held in June 1998, in New South Wales. Harbour Masters: Powers (Question No. 2738) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 10 March 1998: Are harbour masters or officers in his Department empowered under federal legislation to prevent a ship from sailing if they believe that ship's master or crew are suffering from fatigue. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Harbour masters' authority is vested in them through State legislation and the honourable member should approach the relevant State authorities on this issue. Officers of the Commonwealth Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business do not have these powers.",170
