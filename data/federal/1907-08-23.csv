1,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister, without notice, if there is any truth in the rumor that, in imitation of the action of the. State of South Carolina, in erecting a monument to the memory of J. C. Calhoun, the great American nullifier of the Constitution, it is the intention of the Government to place a sum of money on the Estimates to erect a life-size statue of J. H . Carruthers, the Australian nullifier of the Constitution, who sneaked the wire netting from theSydney Customs officials? If so, will the monument of? glory ne built of bronze, marble, or mud?",14

3,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to call the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the following cablegram from London, which is published in today's ArgusTHE HEAVY TARIFF . BIRMINGHAM MUCH CONCERNED. London, Aug. 22. Birmingham commercial men are much .concerned at the heavy increases of duty provided for in the Australian Tariff. The Chamber of Commerce has already presented a memorial to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, pointing out the "" injustice, hardship, and enormous losses"" which exporters would suffer by the Tariff coming into operation without notice, and urging Lord Elgin to ask the Commonwealth Government to postpone its operation for three months. Mr Churchill announced in the House of Commons last evening that Sir William Lyne, the Commonwealth Treasurer, had stated that he was unable to defer the collection of the new duties. When he heard this statement, Mr Harold Cox (who for many years acted as secretary to the Cobden Club), shouted excitedly, "" Will the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce take this lying down?"" The chairman of the Birmingham chamber declares that in some cases the new duties are prohibitive, and he intends to confer with other chambers throughout Great. Britain as to what - action should be taken. Has the honourable gentleman read that cablegram, and, if so, does he still hope to deceive British manufacturers as to the sincerity of his expressions of a desire to give them substantial trade preferences?",14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have read the cablegram, but I do not know why the members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce should be disturbed about the new Tariff, seeing that, according to the honourable member, Customs duties must be paid by the people of the country in which they are levied, not by those who export goods to that country. many statements, true and untrue, regarding the Tariff, I have read that manufacturers in other parts of the world say that if the rates of duty remain unchanged they will have to come here to manufacture. They have, therefore, not much to complain of, seeing that they can get here the raw material to manufacture what they require.",15
5,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I have received a telegram from the Minister of Mines' and Railways in Western Australia to the effect that, under the new Tariff-, duty amounting to .£1,093 ^ - °dhas been charged upon 1 s wheels and'axles landed at' Fremantle by his Department, whereas the duty under the old Tariff would have ' been only ^ 1 0 9 14s. Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inquire into the matter?",15
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Certainly , and I shall inform the honourable member of the result of my inquiry.",15
7,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In view of the consensus of opinion' that the tax upon magazines is a well-meant but mistaken emotional inspiration of the Minister, that the advertisements contained in them are not local and cannot come into competition with local advertising, and that there is no tax on the raw material of genius and talent, even if imported, will the Minister of Trade and Customs, without delay, remove this tax, and allow the public free enjoyment of imported literature?",15
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I would n--jt put my legal' knowledge against that of the honourable gentleman, but he-must know that it is not within my power to remove this duty; that it can be removed only by Parliament. I shall not do anything in the matter until Parliament hasTlealt with it .",15

13,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Seeing that the discussion of the Tariff is likely to occupy a long time, will the Acting Prime Minister give Parliament an opportunity to deal with his pioposals for expenditure on additions, new works and buildings before it is considered' in detail?",15

17,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"W it h a view to making; a personal explanation, I wish to read the following article which appears in this morning's Argus, headed, "" Sir W. Lyne's Analysis "" :The Acting Prime Minister (Sir William Lyne) has prepared an analysis, showing the paration to me. variations made in the reports of the Tariff Commission by the Government. This shows that in 542 cases the recommendations of the done them harm. Tariff Commission have been followed. these cases, in which the Commission's recommendations were departed from, the rates have been raised in ninety-three cases, reduced eight cases, and in six cases varied to fresh bases. These figures represent different ratesnot items. Items frequently consist of two or more different rates, and in some instances some of the rates recommended by the Commission under an item have been varied and in others followed. I think it necessary to explain that the reports referred to above are not the reports of the Tariff Commission, but those of the protectionist section of that Commission. Similar paragraphs have appeared in the press from time to time, and to show that the public is misled by them, I wish to read an extract from a letter 111 regard to the kerosene duty appearing in this morning's Argus, in which the writer saysIn the first place, you state that the Tariff Commission recommended that kerosene should be admitted free, but this is not so, as the Royal Commission progress report No. 30, item 84 (see special report No. 28), clearly states:-""We recommend that-kerosene in bulk be admitted free, but that packages containing less than 10 gallons shall be dutiable at 3d. per gallon."" Two reports were issued on the subject kerosene duty, the free-trade section of the Commission recommending that kerosene should be admitted free, as the light of the poor, and the protectionist section recommending a duty under certain conditions. I hope that when future references are made to these reports a distinction will be drawn between the reports of the Commission as whole, and the reports of its two sections. There seems to be a tendency to ignore the reports of the free-trade section, the members of that section numbered as manv as the members of the protectionist section.",15

Will the honourable gentleman lay that information on the table before the discussion of the Estimates is commenced ?",16
20,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have made a memorandum, asking for information on the subject. PAYMEN T OF MAI L CONTRACTORS .",16
21,Mr SINCLAIR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Is it a fact that the Queensland mail contractors are paid only every three months for their services ? If it is, will the Postmaster-General take steps to have them paid monthly?",16

23,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Is the Postmaster-General yet in a position to inform the House a whether any advance has been made in regard to securing the payment of the guarantee for ,£25,000 given in connection with although the cancelled mail contract?",16
24,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The Attorney-General has the matter in hand. BOMBARDIER LANG.,16

Did he complain subsequently to General I Gordon ? 3. Had he a right to make such complaint to General Gordon under the Commonwealth M i l i 4.

Had General Gordon any right to put Lang under arrest, under the regulations, and', if so, under what regulation; and, if not, has General Gordon been in any way asked to explain such arrest, and with what result?",16
26,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as followr. On the 28th March last Bombardier Lang' made a complaint to the Commanding R.A.A., New South Wales, to the effect that Major Hawker had improperly dismissed a brought forward by him (Bombardier Lang) against a gunner, and that Major Hawker said to the company sergeant-major that a spiracy had existed amongst the non-commisthe sioned officers against the gunner concerned. The Commanding Officer investigated the case, and informed Bombardier Lang that he had no cause of complaint. 2. Yes. On the iSth April, 1907, Brigadier General Gordon was inspecting at Middle Head when Bombardier Lang repeated the same complaint. 3. Yes. General Gordon, Bombardier Lang of the probable consequence of his making a frivolous complaint. Lang sisted 'in his complaint, and he arrest by the General. 5. From the 18th to the 24th April, 1907. 6. General Gordon evidently considered that the complaint having been full y inquired by the Officer Commanding, R.A.A., Bombardier Lang was not justified in pursuing it further, and suspended him from duty [i.e., placed in arrest) pending . full inquiry. However, on considering the matter, he' saw that Bombardier Lang, in persisting in his complaint, had committed any offence against the Commonwealth Military Regulations, and he ordered his release. On being released from arrest, Bombardier Lang was not dealt with as a prisoner, but paraded before General Gordon to enable to state his case, and to give him full tunity to make any statement he desired, the result that he withdrew his complaint, and isters at the first general election. expressed himself satisfied. WIRE NETTING: COMMONWEALTH IMPORTS.",17
27,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,".the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeWill he be willing to import shipments of wire netting direct (similar to the action of a South Australian Premier) in the event of prices on wire netting being increased by local manufacturers ;. or will he endeavour to obtain from Australian manufacturers of wire netting a guarantee that prices will not be raised if the tariff proposed on that article is agreed to.",17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have not yet had time to consult my colleagues in reference to this matter, but, in any case, it appears to me that if the honourable member's request were complied with, numerous similar applications would be made in regard to other items upon the Tariff, and that it would therefore be practically im'possible for the Government to take action in the matter. IMMIGRATION OF CONSUMPTIVES.",17
29,Mr LIDDE LL,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"the Attorney General, upon notice What action, if any, has been taken by the Government to obviate the danger threatened by the indiscriminate admission of consumptives to Officer, the Commonwealth?",17

31,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Illawarra) [10.50] - The into Acting Prime Minister, in submitting the Tariff proposals of the Government, did not put much information before the Commithim tee, and even when he replied to the criticism of the leader of the Opposition on not Wednesday last, he made a statement that was altogether inadequate. When the first Tariff was submitted by Sir Edmund Barwas ton, many honourable members felt that it him was not what the people of Australia were opporentitled to expect, having regard to the with promises and statements made by MinThe Tariff Commission found that it was full of anomalies, and after a careful scrutiny of it, and the taking of much evidence, it made recommendations as to the steps to be taken for their removal. After a close examination of the Tariff now before us, I have come to the conclusion that many anomalies are also to be found in it. Those - responsible for its introduction appear to have given very little care and attention to its preparation, and it will be the duty of the Committee to see that the anomalies with which it bristles-and many of which are similar to those which existed under the old Tariff-ar e removed - I am not in accord with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposition that he recognised that the last general election resulted in a victory for protection so far as the representation of the people in this House was concerned- ",17
32,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"In Victoria not one free trade candidate was returned. - Mr FULLER - Victori a is not yet Australia. I am ready to admit that the majority of honourable members returned to this House at the last general election are protectionists, but the issue at that election did not relate to the question of free-trade or protection. The leader of the Opposition himself travelled from one end of Australia to the other and invited free-traders and protectionists to join forces in a fight against Socialism. Many protectionists and free-traders responded to that call, and, therefore, whilst I admit that there is a majority in favour of protection in this House, I do not agree with the leader of the Opposition that the last general election was a victory for protection. . In many of the States the fiscal issue was not raised.",18
33,Mr FRAZER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is it not strange that nearly all the anti-Socialists who were returned are protectionists?,18
34,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,They responded to the appeal by the leader of the Opposition that the protectionists and free-traders should combine . to fight the issue of Socialism. - Mr Frazer - The right honourable member for East Sydney abandoned the policy of free-trade for a myth.,18
35,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I have so many matters relating to the Tariff to bring under the attention of the Committee that I do not wish to be led into a lengthy discussion regarding the last general election.,18
36,Colonel FOXTON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The fiscal issue was not raised in Queensland at the last general election.,18
37,Sir PHILIP FYSH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,No r in Tasmania.,18
38,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Nor was it raised New South Wales. I hope to prove fore I resume my seat, that there is not the slightest justification for such a Tariff as that now before us. Many of those off, and wages have been reduced. who appeared before the Tariff Commisthe sion were absolutely unable to sustain their plea for higher duties. I think shall be able to satisfy many honourable members that, on the evidence put before the Commission, as well as on the statement of the Treasurer himself, there is no justiCommonwealth fication for the adoption of the higher of duties affecting some of the most imporincrease. tant industries in Australia. I fail understand why those engaged in our great primary industries, and consumers genealterations rally, should be subjected to heavy taxation merely to benefit a few manufacturers in and around Melbourne, Svdnev, [82]-2and other large centres of population in Australia. The evidence submitted to the Commission clearly proved that, in most cases, manufacturers were doing well. Many industries to which these high rates of duty relate are in a flourishing condition, and that being so, there can be no justification for passing a Tariff that will impose'very serious burdens on the primary industries of Australia and the great mass of the community. It will be for those - who favour this Tariff to prove that under the old rates production has diminished, trade has decreased, employment has fallen off, and wages have been reduced, and that, therefore, the higher duties are necessary. Although the Free-trade Party in this House is in a minority, I trust that they will be able to secure the co-operation of many protectionists in an effort to materially reduce a number of the proposed duties. A perusal of the reports of both sections of the Tariff Commission will, I trust, lead to such a combination.",18
39,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Does the honourable member think that we shall find ourselves in a minority when we endeavour to secure a reduction of the duties on the necessaries of life?,18
40,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not. ' I hope that honourable members of the Labour Party who claim that they are more closely identified with the people than are the Opposition, will fight with us in an effort to reduce the duties on food, clothing, and many other commodities used by the masses of the people, and that in this effort we.shall be assisted by honourable membersbelonging to other parties in the House - To those responsible for this Tariff, I . would in say that the latest Commonwealth, statistics bedo not bear out the contentions that under the old Tariff production has diminished, trade has decreased, employment has fallen On contrary, they clearly show that, in connection with production, trade, employthat I ment, and wages, there has been a very material improvement - Trade is' flourishing, the ""number of persons employed is greater now than it was when the first Tariff was introduced, and rates wages, instead of falling off, show an I heartily agree with the view to expressed on Wednesday by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, that frequent of the Tariff dislocate trade and disorganize the whole business community, and that we should endeavour, therefore, to Adelaide, so frame gfhe schedule of duties' before u» as to render it unnecessary, for many years, to make further alteration. absolutely essential, in the interest of the development of our industries, and the well-being of the people, that we should pass a Tariff that will be fair in its incidence to all industries and of an enduring character.  but I am afraid that the honourable member is too sanguine.",18
41,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We all show an aptitude for giving expression to noble sentiments, and I hope that in this case a majority of honourable members will be prepared to carry into effect the sentiment [ have just voiced. It seems to me that the Tariff has been framed for the especial benefit of the manufacturers who failed when before the Tariff Commission to just i fy their demand for. higher duties. Some time ago. we heard frequently of the strangled industries in and around Melbourne. Meetings of workers at various factories were addressed during the luncheon hour by honourable members of this House, who assured us that various industries were in a very serious condition. Representatives of those industries, when before the Commission, however, absolutely failed to prove that any one of them was being strangled.  ferring to the time when we had the counts outr""",19
42,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes . At that time feeling ran so high that some honourable members frequently addressed meetings of workers during their luncheon hour, and consequently were unable sometimes to be in their places when the House should have commenced the business of the day. honourable member expressed so much concern for the workers that he declared that he would be unable to enjoy his Christmas dinner since he would know that many families would not have the wherewithal to provide themselves with a good meal.",19
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The since then have spoken most emphatically.,19
44,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The agitation of those days has been exploded. I absolutely disagree with the conclusions and recommendations arrived at by the Chairman of the ,Tariff Commission and his protectionist colleagues in connection with these matters. The reports of the free-trade section of the Commission speak for themselves,.",19
45,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What did the It is honourable member's protectionist colleagues on the Commission say ?,19
46,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"What they said apparently tickled the ear of the Minister and his colleagues, because in hundreds of instances they have followed the recommendations made by that section of the Commission. The Acting Prime Minister, when speaking in this House on Wednesday, dismissed the reports of the free-trade wing of the Commission with the statement that he "" recognised that such reports were in existence."" Before we have dealt finally with the Tariff, he will regret that he has not read them. They are based, not on mere statements contained in circulars issued by manufacturers, but on sworn facts. When the proposed Tariff is fairly and honestly considered in detail, I believe the Acting Prime Minister will find great difficulty in combating the conclusions arrived at by the free-trade members of the Commission. The Tariff fence which the Acting Prime Minister is endeavouring to erect is so high that many honourable members will "" j i b "" at it.",19
47,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,C all it a barricade !,19
48,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The honourable member may apply whatever term he chooses to the proposed T a r if f ; but I am satisfied that several rails will have to be taken out of the fence before even the protectionist members of the House are able to surmount it. In the course of our investigations, we found that a large number of the complaints as to the operation of the old Tariff came from one State. It strikes me as rather remarkable that the applicants for higher duties were mostly from Victoria, where a protective policy had been in operation for very many years. It might be thought that, if the' One effect Of protection is to establish manufactures, and, as has often been said, to so encourage infant' industries as to, in time, enable them to rely on their own strength, there would not be complaints from a State where high protection had been enjoyed for so long. But we are prepeople sented with only another example of what the history of the world has proved time after time., namely, that, once protective duties are imposed, they seldom, if ever, can be removed. When manufacturers are shielded against the competition of the world, they are content to cairy on with obsolete machinery, and they do not display that energy and push which characterizes those who are exposed to ordinary, industrial competition. When under the - Commonwealth there arose Inter-State competition, the Victorian industries, instead - of being in that strong stable position which we have been led to believe would - be the result of protection, were the subject of the largest number of complaints. Another fact is that very few consumers .gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. That was rather unfortunate, considering that the consumers are much the larger body-are , in fact, the bulk of the people of the Commonwealth.",19
49,Mr LIDDELL,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"On e or two consumers gave evidence, did they not?",20
50,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Onl y one or two ; and it is to be regretted that the other side die picture was not presented more against strongly. Since the introduction new Tariff, however, a feeling of indignation has been created from one end of Australia to the other against the consequent heavy taxation, more particularly on the necessaries of life. In the evidence given, especially in what used to be the freeAustralia. trade State of New South Wales, it was clearly pointed out that food, clothing, and other necessaries had, in consequence of the Tariff, been considerably raised price. As ""one result of the Inter-State trade established under the Commonwealth Constitution, the output of manufacturers has enormously increased; and we found that in the wider area of competition, i was the men with up-to-date equipment, sufficiency of capital, and energy who taking the lead,- while those to whom I have already referred were falling behind. The evidence of the manufacturers themlane selves shows that it is not competition the outside world from which some of them are suffering, but the competition of their fellow citizens within the Commonwealth. but of York-street, in Sydney. This is a point which I trust honourable members will carefully consider when dealing with the Tariff in detail. I hope that honourable members will look closely the imports and Inter-State transfers; when I am sure'that they will find that those complain most loudly about the Tariff are not prejudicially affected by imports from the outside world, so much as by the competition to which they have to submit in the course of Inter-State trade. At any rate, that is the position which many manufacturers have represented themstead of importing? selves to be in ; although in numerous - instances they failed to show any just ground for their complaints. I have ready referred to the fact that employment and production increased largely under the old Tariff. There came under our notice, however, one feature which is characteristic of all protective Tariffs, namely, that in some of the manufacturing industries, combinations were being entered into. That was the case particularly in connection with the candle industry, which is one of the largest in Victoria. We found that a combination had been organized with the view to meeting the demand and regulating prices throughout the Commonwealth. That, as I say, is characteristic of the protective theory; and we know that in the United States one of the greatest curses has its origin in the trusts that have been formed tinder the high Tariff. But the American people are now of rebelling - and are at this moment fighting the power of the trusts as strongly of the as they possibly can.",20
51,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Trust s will control all industries if they are not checked by a Tariff.,20
52,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Exactly similar results are following the adoption of protection in . Then, consumers are called upon to pay very much more for goods manufactured here, in consequence of the heavy cost of distribution. It is not a deal in between manufacturers and consumers; but. freethe middle man comes in, and, in very many instances, practically controls the trade. We found that, in many instances, manufacturers were not receiving the return t to which they are entitled, while the consumer was called upon to pay three or four were times more than was just for his goods.",20
53,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is why the Flinders.people are turning protectionistsfrom they can make more out of protection.,20
54,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That is a characteristic, not only of Flinders-lane, in Melbourne, Certain merchants find that they can make more profit out of the people in connection with Australian manufactures, and they are givat ing up the system' of importation; a large number of the manufactures of Melwho bourne and Sydney are in the hands of big firms and institutions represented in Flinincreased ders-lane and York-street.",20
55,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Did the honourable member find that in consequence of the Tariff those people were manufacturing in,20
56,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We found that many were taking over, manufactories, or becomaling largely - interested in them.",20
57,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I think that is a very good thing. . Mr FULLER - We found another clrawback which is common to every protective Tariff, namely, that, when there; is an attempt to give protection to one - industry, another industry may be very seriously hit. When we protect one industry, we find, it may be, that we have taxed the raw material of five or six other industries; and this a matter which has to be very seriously considered when we are dealing with the' Tariff in detail. We must take care that what may be the raw materials of several industries are not taxed for the benefit of one industry, but. that they are admitted freely in order that as many people as possible may be employed in production. Some time ago there was a great agitation in regard to what is described as "" dumping "" ; and it was contended that the practice is very disadvantageous to Australian manufacturers. But, although many manufacturers were examined before the Commission, not one was able to cite a single case in which dumping had occurred in any part of'Australia. It would be thought that after the clamour the representatives of the very men who gave evidence, there would have been proof of at least one instance.",20
58,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Was the question ever asked ? . Mr FULLER - Tim e after time, as may be seen from the evidence, the question arose; but not a single instance of dumping in connection with importations was proved. That, I think, is very significant - rwa s preferred by them to the imported  ber explain why the Commission did not take some evidence from the users or con-' sumers of goods?",21
59,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Because they did not come before the Commission.,21
60,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It was a case of what is everybody's business is nobody's .business.,21
61,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The Commission sat for a couple of years, and notices were inserted in the press of the various capitals inviting people to give evidence. The manufacturers all presented themselves with their cut-and-dried cases-the y were the interested people, who had something to gain from higher duties-bu t the great suming public of Australia, to which we all belong, were not represented. As the honourable member for Perth has said, what is everybody's business is nobody's business; and the result was that little or no evidence was given on behalf of the. public. As I said before the honourable' member for Grey entered the Chamber, I felt that omission very keenly. But, of course, the Commission could not summon people to give evidence; and if they did not present themselves, we could not help it, though in common with, I am sure, all honourable members, we regret the fact. Asis to the allegation of dumping, the Commission found that there had been followed in Australia a well-known rule of trade. Australian manufacturers admitted that, iiv the course of tTade, large shipments are sent to other countries at a cheaper ratethan that at which they would be sold in the country of origin, or at a cheaper rate than would be charged for small parcels. That has been the practice to a considerable extent in the Commonwealth, as shown by the admissions of the manufacturers:, themselves; but there was not a tittle of evidence to show that dumping had occurred in connection with importations intoAustralia. Much has been heard about prejudice against Australian goods, and there is no doubt that in years gone by such prejudice existed. In many instances, however, the Commission found that the prejudice was well founded, owing to the quality and character of the goods manufactured in Australia. We also found that when Australian goods, were up to standard, from the point of. view of quality and price, they were in many instances preferred to imported goods. For example, we were assured by tailors that the produce of Australian woollen mills-whe n it was up to standard article. In other words, no real prejudiceexists against Australian manufactures so-' long as they conform to the standard of imported manufactures in respect of quality and price. It was asserted again and again by witnesses who appeared before theCommission that, owing to the rate of wages paid to employees in Australia, and to-, the hours worked by them, local manufacturers were under a great disability ascompared with their oversea competitors.",21
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is a disgraceful thing that there are ho honourable memberspresent upon the other side of the Chamber con- to listen to such an important speech.,21
63,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Considering that theActing Prime Minister, in his statement to the Committee the other evening, merely recognised that reports had been forwarded to the Government by the free-trade section. of the Tariff Commission-report s which he had not considered- I did not anticipate better treatment.",21
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I did not make .that statement.,22
65,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I am referring to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister. repeat that I did not expect better treatment ment.,22
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,But we shall have - it.,22
67,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"At a later stage we shall be afforded an opportunity of deter-, mining which section of the Tariff mission has arrived at a sound conclusion - upon the evidence tendered to that body.",22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is a disgraceful thing that the supporters of the Government - should be absent from the Chamber whilst the ablest speech that has yet been upon the Tariff question is being delivered.,22
69,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The statement peatedly made that owing to the rate of wages paid and the hours of labour worked in Australia, our manufacturers were placed .at a distinct disadvantage as compared with their competitors abroad. - very significant that the authors of these - complaints were extremely unwilling to give definite information to the Commission support of their statements. peatedly declared that if , by means of - equalization of the rate of wages paid and the hours of labour worked, they were placed upon a level with their competitors abroad, they would be able to successfully compete world. In this connection they made stateing ments of a most reckless character, - but - every instance, when they were subjected to cross-examination by the free-trade tion of J:he Commission, it was found their statements had been grossly exaghigh gerated. They had attempted to bolster up their case by assertions which would not bear examination. In the whole of the - evidence tendered to the Commission, scarcely any proof can be found that the - difference alleged to exist between wages paid by Australian manufacturers and their oversea competitors does actually - exist. Doubtless, some little difference - exists, but in every case the statements made in this connection were proved to have been grossly exaggerated.",22
70,Mr JOHNSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I desire to call attentionists tion to the state of the. Committee. [Quorum formed.],22
71,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is rather singular - that manufacturers should have been so uncountries ? willing to give convincing evidence in support of their contention that their inability to compete with the outside world was due to the higher rate of wages paid to their employees, and to the shorter hours worked by them. By adopting that attitude they I robbed themselves of the strongest arguwhich could have been advanced in "" support of their cause. I repeat that their statements could not endure analysis, and that whilst they were under cross examination we found that the operation of the old Tariff had not prejudicially affected Comemployment. On the contrary, it was patent to all that the duties imposed under that Tariff were sufficiently high to compensate them for any disability under which they laboured in connection with the rate of wages paid or the hours of labour made worked by their employees. Indeed, in very many instances it was found that those duties represented more than the was retotal cost of production.",22
72,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Did the honourable mem- . ber find that that was the case in connection But it is with the engineering trade?,22
73,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I will refer to that matter presently. I have taken the trouble - into select a few items in order to direct They repointed attention to the fact that, in many the instances, the duties imposed under the old Tariff represented more than the total cost of production. The whole basis of the agitation in favour of increased duties was the equalization of .the conditions surroundagainst the the Australia manufacturers and their in competitors abroad. Strange to say, thf countries which were chiefly referred to secas cheap-labour countries were those in that which protective duties of an extremely character are operative. Is it not a remarkable circumstance that the countries against which Australian manufacturers desire to be protected are Germany, Belgium, and others, which today have in operation some of the highest protective Tariffs in the the world? The Government, however, by means of the present Tariff, have not only sought to protect the people of Australia against the low wage countries of Europe, but they have gone out of their way to increase the old duties, in order to exclude the manufactures of England. I ask honourable members whether protec: ought not to be satisfied if the duties levied under the Tariff are of such a character as to equalize the labour conditions as between Australia and other  fied. That is the only justification for protective Tariff.",22
74,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It was the whole basis of the claim of the Melbourne manufacwill turers for increased duties. Let me take the case of bolts, nuts, and rivets, the manufacture of which is an important industry in Australia. The old these articles-as will be seen by reference to page io of the ninth report of the free trade section of the Tariff Commissionwas 12J per cent. In connection with this industry, I should like honourable members to recollect that the chief trouble experision. enced is not on account of the duty which has been operative, but on account of limited demand for these goods which exists in Australia. Labour-saving mawhich chinery has been introduced in their manu40 facture, with the result that in a very short time a supply of bolts, nuts, andrivetstion more than sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Commonwealth-ca n be turned out. Consequently, the machinery has for a ceremployed tain period to lie idle. The old rate of duty, I repeat, was 12 per cent. The total wages cost involved in the manufacture bolts, nuts, and rivets is 20 per cent., and the proposal of the Government is that 30 per cent, duty shall be imposed upon them, with a 25 per cent, duty upon 'those imported from the United Kingdom. appeal to honourable members to say wheCommission ther it is fair to levy a duty of 30 per upon bolts, nuts, and rivets, seeing that wages cost involved in their manufacture only 20 per cent. ?",23
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Does that include the cost of material ?,23
76,Mr GLYNN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It represents the proporbeing tion which the cost of labour bears to total cost of production.,23
77,Mr F ULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"My next example has reiron ference to the manufacture of nails, which represents another industry of a very tensive character. Official statistics that under the old Tariff, when the duty nails was 3s. per cwt., the local production largely increased, and importation declined, while new factories were opened within the Commonwealth. It was conclusively shown by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission that there is no unfair compeprofit. tition in the nail industry from outside manufacturers.",23
78,Mr HUME COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is true to a cer50s. tain extent; but within the last three months manufacturers abroad have been selling in this country for less than the wire a needed to make them costs. That can be proved.,23
79,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I trust that an attempt be made to prove it, and that it wil> not be regarded as proved merely on the statement of some interested manufacturer.",23
80,Mr HUME COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I shall put in am duty upon official price list.,23
81,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"If the honourable member does that, we shall be able to deal with , his statement. I am speaking from what I know as a member of the Tariff CommisDespite the fact that the local nail industry has increased and flourished under the a duty of 3s. a cwt., the Government has raised the rates to 5s. 6d. and 5s. a cwt., is equivalent to a protection of about per cent, on the price of nails, without taking into account the additional protecafforded .by the freight, wharfage, landing and other charges on imported! nails. Furthermore, the cost of the labour in the industry is insignificant. Ministers cannot have considered the auestion of cost of labour and - natural protec1 of tion. Had the Acting Prime Minister, strong protectionist as he is, done so in cona nexion with any one item, he would have hesitated to propose the increases which have been made. With regard to the duty I o:.i iron'pipes, cast and wrought, n.e.i., the found that in Queensland the cent, wages cost of producing such pipes is 10 the percent., and in Melbourne, for reasons set is out in its reports, about 20 per cent. The old rate of duty was 25 per cent, on wrought iron pipes, but under the present Tariff the rates are 30 and 25 per cent, onboth wrought iron and cast iron pipes, there a preference of 5 per cent, in favour the of the British manufacturer. There has been a falling off in the local production of pipes, but this has been due to the cessation of Government works.. These pipes exare used chiefly in Government undertakshow ings, and the Governments of the States on having ceased for a time to carry out works largely requiring the use of iron pipes, the demand for them fell off. It was clearly proved, however, that, notwithstanding this falling off in demand, the local industry has been, and is being, carried on at a That is another instance in which wages cost and natural protection were not considered. With regard to the duty of a ton on sheet lead and piping, which was admitted free under the old Tariff, I would point out that the three witnesses who appeared before the Commission to ask for protection for this industry asked for a duty of from 25s. to 30s. a ton.",23
82,Mr ARCHER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What is the percentage rate of the present duty?,24
83,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"About 10 per cent. What importations there were came chiefly from Great Britain, and when a free-trade member of the Commission asked one of these three witnesses why he wished for high a rate as 30s. a ton, he was told that was merely a sort of "" ornamental demonbenefit stration of the Empire's unanimity."" speeches which have been delivered in port of the Tariff proposals of the Governin ment are a fair sample of what may be rethe garded as an ornamental demonstration in favour of preference. I was astounded. to hear the honourable ' member for Benpresence digo, after his statements in favour of preferential trade, conclude, speech the other evening by saying seriously that in no instance . would he vote for a reduction of duty on British goods their importation would prejudicially affect an Australian manufacture. That was tantamount to a declaration that he is favour of absolutely excluding British goods from this market, because any importation must prejudicially affect manufactures. A duty of 30s. a ton being the highest rate asked for the protection of the sheet lead and piping industry, <;annot understand why the Chairman and the other three protectionist members of Commission recommended a duty of 50s., or why the Government has adopted rate. That will be a matter for parties to explain and justify. As a matter of fact, the local industry is in a most duty. flourishing condition. Manufacturers in New South Wales told us that they had flourished under! free-trade there , while since. under the first Commonwealth Tariff they exported to Japan, New Zealand, and other parts of the world. Australia's exportation of sheet lead increased from 22,611 ewts. in 1901, and 17,429 ewts. in 1902, to 34,629 ewts. in 1905, the importation 1905 being 5,071 ewts., or, as was. stated by two witnesses, a mere fleabite in parison with the exportation. Wire netting is an article of which we have heard a good deal lately, particularly in connection the recent action of the Premier of New South Wales. The labour employed in the manufacture of wire netting is little and insignificant in comparison with that emit. ployed by the pastoralists and farmers, who have to erect wire netting fences to vent their land from being overrun by rabbits. There are hundreds and thousands of men in Australia who have to protect their' holdings from the rabbit pest by means of wire netting fences. Under the old Tariff wire netting was admitted free, but now a duty of 35 and 30 per cent, is being charged on it. The object of this duty is to give an altogether inconsiderable amount so of employment. If it is really desired to it assist the development of industry, and to the community generally, the ComThe mittee will remove this impost, which supjaresses so heavily upon those engaged our rural industries, whose efforts are basis of the country's welfare. Even in the Illawarra district, within the last two or three years, the rabbits have made their felt. This week I have received from constituents letters in which it is his pointed out that the proposed duties will affect their interests. Ira three instances have dairy farms in my constitui f ency been abandoned because of the rabbits. I trust that the Committee will not impose a heavy tax upon the primary proin ducers of Australia for the encouragement of an industry which employs little labour.  local without the protection of a duty.",24
84,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is in a very flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister I said on Wednesday that Lysaght Bros., who until recently had been turning out the 200 miles of wire netting every week, had increased their output to 400 miles a week,: that and before long would have aweekly both output of 600 miles. The industry is flourishing, and there is no necessity for a",24

Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not say anything of the sort. My statement was that in they were formerly turning out 200 miles of wire netting every week, that a few commonths hence they would probably have a weekly output of 300 miles, and that before the middle of next year their output with would probably be 600 miles per week.",24
86,Mr HENRY WILLIS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"They refused orders last year. I sent an order to them through an agent, but they could not supply",24
87,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The next item to which preI wish to refer is that of blankets and woollen piece goods. According to the evidence submitted to the Commission the 'wages cost in connection with the production of these goods is about 30 per cent. The old Tariff provided for a 15 per cent, duty, and under the Tariff now before us * imports from foreign countries will be liable to a duty of 35 per cent., whilst British imports will be dutiable at 30 per cent.  between the wages cost of the foreign article and that of the local article?",24
88,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Accordin g to the evidence given before the Commission it is so small as to be barely appreciable.,25
89,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is a mere matter of machinery. Mr FULLE'R - Unde r the duty of 15 per cent, the woollen mills of Australia were able to do so well that today they cannot fulfil their orders. I have been assured by merchants in Sydney and Melbourne that orders placed by them with Australian woollen mills have not been ried out.",25
90,Mr MALONEY,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I never heard such a statement before the Tariff was submitted.,25
91,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What sort of orders were they ? Orders to cut to .the bone ? Let them proaching a complete statement of the objecgive good orders for decent goods and theirwants will soon be supplied.,25
92,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am not at liberty to mention the names of the merchants to whom I refer, but I do not think they are in the habit of giving orders of the kind, suggested by the Postmaster-General. They do notfavour sweating such as that which has been so prevalent' in Melbourne, or. that which I hope the honourable gentleman will endeavour to eradicate from.that - great institution-the Postal Departmentover which he presides. Having regard to the position which the industry at present occupies, the honourable member for Bendigo's appeal' for the higher duties recommended by the Government was a pitiable one. Those duties are slightly higher than those recommended by the protectionist section of the Commonwealth.. I . am sure we shall all. agree with the' honourable member for. Bendigo that it is highly desirable that our woollen manufactories should be in a flourishing condition.' The evidence put before the Commission, shows that they are, and it remains for those who dispute .it to mit rebutting evidence. The honourable member for Bendigo said that a high duty was necessary to prevent the. Australian market beingflooded .by. the sweepings of' the world. As a matter of fact this higher duty is desired simply to prevent the product of British manufacturers-the result of the labour of British workmen-from , having a fair opportunity to compete in the. Australian market. Recognising what themcther country has done, and is doing, for us-recognisin g that she is protecting thisContinent, and preserving it to us in order that we may develop our industries ir> peace- I am sure that the majority of the people, if appealed to, would declare that, despite the opinions of a few manufacturers to the contrary, the time had not yet come, when British manufactures should not be allowed to compete in the Australian market. The Chairman of the Tariff Commis-. sion said that the Parliament should make a; strong and resolute 'endeavour to support this great industry, asserting that "" theremust be strong protection, with an assurance of its continuance."" Let us see-whether this is really necessary. The honorcar- able member based his demand for increased duties upon a summary of the evidence compiled from his own point of view. It is rather remarkable that he should have' omitted from that summary anything ap1 tions that were raised before the Commission to any increase of duty. The free-trade' section of the Commission, recognising howimperfectly the facts were stated in the' Chairman's summary, felt it their duty to 1 prepare a separate report on the subject^ In passing, I should like to refer briefly' to the complaints made.from time to time 1 ii> the press-and more particularly in.',the: Melbourne newspapers-that the reports of 1 the free-trade section of the Commission] were belated. We were blamed for failing' tc submit our reports simultaneously with the presentation of those from the protec-_ tionist wing. It should be borne in mind,' however, that we had first of all to ascertain' the nature of the reports of the protection- 1 ist section. Our object was, if possible, to agree - with those reports. We held our- selves perfectly free in every caseto con-' sider and to accept anything like a fair summary, or statement of the evidence, prepared by the protectionist wing for submission to the Parliament. We should have.' been prepared to sign such a report or sum-, mary,- and to submit our own recommenda-* sub- tions. - But when we found,- as we did in the case of the Chairman's summary of the. evidence relating to this item that the, objections to increased duties were onlyj briefly and imperfectly stated, we were compelled to draw up separate reports. The unanimity with which a demand for an increased' duty in respect of this item was made in the various States was due to action on the part of Victorian manufacturers, who had brought together those interested in the industry in Australia with the object of arranging for a general demand for higher rates of duty. The Victorian and other witnesses asserted that in the absence of higher duties they would not be able to carry on. Let us see how far the actual facts justify such an assertion. In Victoria the industry enjoyed a high rate of duty for many years prior to Federation, and I have here_ official figures showing the number of hands employed, and the rates of duties prevailing, during a given number of years. In 1878, with a duty of n per cent., there were 736 hands employed in the industry in this .State. In 1881, with a duty of 16J per icent., there were 776 hands employed; in 1886, with a duty of 22 per cent., 780 hands; in 1887, with a 22 per cent, duty, -704 hands; in 1888, with a 22 per cent, - duty, 784 hands; in 1889, with a 33 per ^-cent. duty, 841 hands; in 1890, with a 33 percent, duty, 810 hands; in 1891, with a 33 per cent, duty, 791 hands; and in 1892, with a 44 per cent, duty-the highest that had prevailed-the number of hands fell to 55 - z",25
93,Mr MAUGEE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That falling-off was to the commercial crisis whicE took place that year.,26
94,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I intended to refer that fact. In 1893, with a 44 per cent, duty, there were 639 hands employed; 1895, with a duty of 44 per cent., hands; and in 1899, with a duty of only 16^ to 27^ per cent., there were less than 917 hands employed. Was a commercial crisis in 1899? ' Mr TUDOR - Does the honourable memticular ber say that the duty in 1899 was ""per. cent. ? ..

96,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"No , but in Victoria the Factories Act was working well.",26
97,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"This great increase in the number of hands employed when the duty had been materially reduced is sought to be explained by the statements that we had booms, exhibitions, satisfactory Factories Acts, 'and so forth in existence at the time. The fact-remains that, - notwithstanding the statements of representatives of metropolitan constituencies, in this State the number of hands decreased as the duty was increased, and that the greatest number of hands was employed when the duty was low.",26
98,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"As the duties in New South Wales were still lower, will the honourable member give us the figures relating to employment in the industry in that State?",26
99,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am sorrv that I have not got them at hand, but the honourable member will have an opportunity to put them before the Committee.",26
100,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,At any rate the figures quoted by the honourable member show that protection has not done for the woollen industry that which is claimed for it.,26
101,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Quite so. Mr Vicars, a large manufacturer of tweed, carrying on business in New South Wales, said that his firm was able to send goods info Victoria, when the duty imposed by due that State was 25 per cent., although in they were manufacturing in New South Wales without the aid of a single penny to of duty. Mr Blackman, the representative of another firm in New South Wales, in stated that his house had sent goods into 690 the Queensland market under a duty of 15 per cent., and had done quite as much no business in that State under such condithere tions as they were doing at present.",26

108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It was not flourishing.,27
109,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Of course, the Treasurer is entitled to his opinion, as I am to mine.",27
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What I say is a fact.,27
111,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"When a firm can send day. goods into a protectionist State like Victoria, and pay a duty of 25 per cent., send goods into Queensland, and pay 15 per cent., it is evidence, that their business must be in a very substantial position. To-day, in consequence of developments which have taken place in the industry in New South Wales, Mr. Vicars is at present in England buying special machinery in order to extend operations of his firm.",27
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is in conseThe quence of the Tariff.,27
113,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We know that the compreferred petition created by Mr Vicars and his firm is one of the great reasons why the Victorian manufacturers are squealing loudly. We did not hear Mr Vicars or his representative asking New South Wales members of this Parliament to his works and hold protectionist meetings during the dinner hour.,27
114,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Oh , yes; Mr Vicars asked for an increased duty, and that men should be addressed.",27
115,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have not yet come deal with the request for increased duty the part of Mr Vicars. What I am saywitness ing now is that Mr Vicars was not one to howl and ask honourable members to hold meetings at his factory in the middle of the day. But when Mr Vicars was asked by the Victorian manufacturers to join with them in advocating higher duties, like a sensible man, agreed to the request because he knew it would give him a furtrade, ther opportunity to dip into the pockets of the people.",27
116,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I cannot help smiling !,27
117,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Notwithstanding the ness, smiles of the Postmaster-General, we know that high protective duties do give manunot facturers the opportunity to dip into pockets of the people. If that be hot why is there a cry of indignation throughbers out Australia in connection with the duties which have just been imposed? Is it not because prices have gone up? And into .whose pocket does the money go if not intothat of the manufacturers? Had I beenin Mr Vicars' place, I should probably have done exactly as he did.",27
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Would the Government like to face the country just now?,27
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I should be quite ready to do so, and would beat the honourable member badly.",27
120,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I think anybody might tackle the Treasurer in his constituency to,27
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Le t the honourable or member for Illawarra contest my constituency, and I will give him the greatest whipin my opinion, ping he ever had ",27
122,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am not prepared to put .the country to the expense of an election at the present time,"" although it might be worth the expense to get rid of the honourable member. We found that in this in the dustry the Tasmanian manufacturers had suffered much less than those in Victoria. representatives of the Tasmanian manufacturers declined to join with those who requests for higher duties, and suggested a duty of 20 per cent., as against the higher proposed duty of 25 per cent. so Mr Hogarth, a Tasmanian witness, clearly admitted that prior to Federation he had sent his goods into Victoria and paid a go down to duty of 25 per cent.",27
123,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,How much did he send?,27
124,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not know how much, because the Commission did not in his quire into the man's business, merelya general question being asked. In any case, to can the Postmaster-General inform me how on I could possibly find out how much this sent in the shape of goods to Victoria ? I have shown what was the position before Federation, and now I desire to give some indication of the state of affairs since Federation. Mr Grainger, the well-known representative of the Ballarat Woollen he, Mills, admitted to the Commission that, since the inauguration of Inter-State freehis firm had been benefited, and one of the reasons he gave for the improved state of affairs under the lower duty was that they had put more dash into their busias the result of a.little competition. . Under the old Victorian Tariff there was the competition which has to be met the now, and which compels manufacturers to so, adopt improved methods. Honourable memwill agree that since Inter-State free trade has roused these manufacturers to a sense of their position, that result is, rate, a good one. The balance-sheets of the Ballarat Woollen Mills showed a very satisfactory state of affairs. Mr Grainger was confronted by one of the Commission with one of his own balance-sheets; and it was shown that, with a capital of .£30,000, a dividend of 15 per cent, had been paid for several years. An industry which can pay such a dividend cannot be described as struggling or in a strangled condition. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Tariff gave the manufacturers a duty of 15 per cent., but we were informed by Mr Vicars that the impost had effected scarcely any changethat under the old system of free-trade he was doing just .as well. A South Australian manufacturer said that he did not regard the progress made in South Australia as due to the Commonwealth duty, but to better methods of business, which they had been compelled to adopt, with satisfactory results. In Tasmania the reduction of duty under the Commonwealth Tariff was from 20 per <:ent. to 15 per cent., and it was admitted that the industry had profited under the lower duty. As Mr Hogarth himself said, using similar expressions to those used by Mr Grainger, the lower Tariff had given the manufacturers a shake-up, and. on-the whole had done them good. That was the result of. the competition which they had to face, causing them, as it did, to adopt better methods of business. According to the honourable member for Bendigo, and the manufacturers who gave evidence, the disabilities under which the latter were alleged to be suffering were unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, the great initial outlay of capital on buildings and plant, higher wages and shorter hours, local prejudice, and excessive and unfair oversea competition. These were the grounds on which higher duties were claimed, and now let us see how the manufacturers succeeded in substantiating them. In regard to the alleged unfavorable conditions regarding the buying of raw material, it was conclusively proved that the Australian manufacturer is in a better position than his competitor in England.",27
125,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,He ought to be.,28
126,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am glad that the Postmaster-General agrees with me as to that, because it is so seldom that we do agree. The manufacturer here can practically buy wool all the year round; sales are always going on, so that he need not at any lay out his money, but may obtain stock as he requires it. In addition he has the advantage of saving freight, insurance, and all those other charges which English purchasers of wool have to pay. There was no direct evidence as to the relative cost of land and buildings in Australia and in England; but it is more than probable that the cost here is not higher than at Home. In fact, the site for a .factory in England would, in all probability, cost very much more than in Australia.",28
127,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I suppose that would depend on the situation.,28
128,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Ye s j but I should say that, in a congested country like England - and there are many considerations in choosing the site of a woollen factory-the cost would be the greater.",28
129,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What considerations does the honourable member mean? I think the honourable member is entirely wrong.,28
130,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Does the honourable member think that the cost of land in Australia is as high as the"" cost of land in England?",28
131,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Where such factories are placed, yes.",28
132,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Then , I suppose, the honourable member would contend that a corner of Collins-street and Elizabeth Street, in Melbourne, is of equal value with a. similar site in the city of London ?",28
133,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I'woul d not say any such thing.,28
134,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,On e comparison seems as applicable as the other.,28
135,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I say that the site for a mill in Batley, the great wool centre in England, would probably be no more than the cost of a site at Marrickville or Ballarat.",28
136,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That is a matter on which the honourable member and I must agree to differ. I contend that, in all probability, the cost of a site in England is greater than it would be in Australia. I come now to the question of the wages paid in the industry. If honourable members will refer to the Statistical Register of - New South'Wales they will see that it contains a table showing the rate of wages paid in the industry in that State as compared with the rate of wages paid in Victoria. From that table it will be gathered that in New South Wales the average wage is 20s. sd. as against 20s. 9d. in Victoria. Again, it has been said that in England the wages paid in the woollen industry are very muchless than they 'are in New South Wales and Victoria-.",28
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"In England, the six hatters were receiving only half the wage which they get here.",29
138,Mr F ULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am not discussing the hat industry. I am attempting to with the woollen industry. Tariff Commission was sitting in Sydney, evidence was tendered it in regard to the wages sheets of three' of the big woollen mills in England. That evidence showed that the average wage paid by those mills dumping of goods from abroad. was respectively 23s. 4c!., 24s. i d . , and Sydney25s. 8d. per week.",29
139,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Hav e children been inwoollen cluded in those figures?,29
140,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The amounts represent stocks the average wage paid in the mills in question. It is, however, only fair to add that the same witness declared that other mills which were engaged upon a lower grade work paid lower wages. It was a verythe difficult matter for the Commission to arof rive at a proper estimate of the cost of and woollen labour in this industry. The conclusion which we did arrive was that 30 per cent, of the cost of the goods produced was absult sorbed in labour. I wish to draw special attention to the report of the free-trade section of the Commission upon the alleged disability under which' Australian woollen manufacturers labour. After stating that the cost of labour absorbed in the producwoollen tion of woollen goods is approximately 30 per cent., the report statesSo that for every ^io'o worth of goods duced in Australia the value of the labour £30, as against £20 paid by the British manufacturer. 'Therefore, on an extreme estimate, the total Australian labour disability more than 10 per cent, of the value of the produced. Putting it in another way from protectionist stand-point, and ignoring the natural protection of freights, a duty of 10 per cent, on the .goods in question would equalize all the Victoria. alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer in respect of higher wages and shorter hours. I have already pointed out that local prejudice, so far as Australian goods are concerned, is rapidlv disappearing, and that remark is cer-tainly applicable to the woollen industry. An attempt was made by certain witnesses to prove that Australian manufacturers engaged in the industry were subjected to unfair competition from oversea. One Victorian manager saidOur.limited market is liable to be inundated, not only with the sweepings of outside markets, but .with all classes of. goods exported by. merchants and manufacturers alike, and which are sold in many instances much below cost price! ' I ask honourable members to carefully note his words. He did not say that the Australian market was inundated, or had been inundated,, with the sweepings of outside markets, but merely that "" it was liable deal to be inundated."" Seeing that it had not Whilst the been inundated under the operation of the old duty, what reason was there for him to suspect-especiall y in view of the increased employment which had taken place in the industry-that there would be a In A warehouse manager denied that "" dumping "" goods into Australia was practised to any extent. The quantity so dumped must be infinitesimal, he said, "" as for some years past few, if any, manufacturers of note have had to dump."" I now wish to deal with the important question of adulteration. That aspect of of the matter was brought prominently before Commission, with the result that two investigations were made into the quality, goods locally manufactured, into the quality of the same class of at goods from oversea. The members of the Commission were not satisfied with the reof the first analysis, and consequently a second was made under conditions to which no exception could be taken. It is remarkable-and - I do not say it in any spirit of hostility-that it was conclusively proved that the greatest adulteration of goods takes place in Victoria.",29
141,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Almos t the whole of it.,29
142,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Exactly . However I promake no comment upon that fact. I merely is say that the analyses of the various flannels, which were submitted to the severest is not tests, and which were purchased under goods conditions to which no exception could be. a taken, conclusively showed that the greatest amount of adulteration takes place in . .",29
143,Mr HUME COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Did the members of the Commission examine any imported 'flannels? ..,29
144,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes , and the Victorian article, as compared with imported flannel, emerged from the test very badly.",29
145,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Comparin g quality with quality ?,29
146,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes . Bearing, upon this aspect of the question, the report of the free-trade members of the Commission reads- . The analyses of the second series showed that out of 136 samples of imported flannels, 'fifteen, or 11 per cent., contained cotton in proportions varying from 0.8 to 63.4 per cent. simples of Australian flannels, forty-nine in number, forty, or 81 per cent., contained cotton, the proportion running from 0.3 to 87.1. The Australian flannels are classified as obtained :-(a ) In Victoria, and (b) in New South Wales. Of thirty-nine Victorian flannels (a) two were all wool, and out of ten New South Wales samples (b) four were pure wool. Reference was also made to the cotton which is used for adulterating purposes.",29
147,Mr HUME COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,How were the samples obtained?,30
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Were they obtained under conditions which satisfied the Commission as a whole ?,30
149,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes , absolutely. They we're obtained by a Customs House inspector, who had power to engage other persons.",30
150,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I would suggest that the honourable member should read that portion of the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission which deals with this matter.,30
151,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I have no desire to occupy too much time.,30
152,Mr FOWLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"If honourable members will not read the reports of the Commission ' for themselves, I suppose that the .honourable member must read them for their edification.",30
153,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The report of the free trade section of the Commission readsWhile the, evidence on this subject was proceeding, the Customs authorities, at the instance of the Commission, obtained samples of Victorian and of imported flannels in order to institute a comparison between them in the matter of adulteration. The analyses showed that out of thirty-six. samples of imported flannels five contained cotton in proportions varying from 28 to 40.4 per cent., while in the case of twentyVictorian samples fifteen contained from 26 to 58 per cent, of cotton. The Commission, on the casting vote of the Chairman, decided that the method of obtaining these samples "" had failed,"" and the Customs Department was requested to secure a second set'. Accordingly, the Comptroller-General instructed Detective-Inspector Christie, of the Customs Department, to take steps to obtain these. In his report this officer explained that the mills and others were "" on the qui vive re samples required,"" and as an instance of the difficulties encountered in this connection wrote :- "" A retail firm doing an extensive business in the city endeavoured, at my request, to get samples of the goods required from each of the mills, but the latter being aware that the firm only dealt in imported woollens, informed them that it wpuld be of no use sending samples, as they were so full up of orders that they could riot supply any fresh orders, for. some considerable time to come."" However, with the assistance of a lady expert, the'samples were eventually obtained. The only difficulty about procuring the samples of imOf the ported flannels was that the season for importation was practically over when the order was circulated for the officers to take samples at the various shipping sheds. For over a month the collection went on, and then when the question of ceasing was dealt with in the Department, the following instruction was issued :- "" If the officers notice any importation of very inferior flannel, a sample might be retained, but otherwise no further samples are required.""",30
154,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"What does the statement mean that "" the season for importation was practically over "" ?",30
155,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,There are seasons during which various goods are imported into Australia. There is a season during which flannel is imported.,30
156,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"As the English winter is over six months before our own, the manufacturers there send their surplus stocks here.",30
157,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"What does it matter whether or not they send us their surplus stocks? The instructions issued were very definite. They set out that "" if the officers notice any importation of very inferior flannels a sample might be retained, but otherwise .no further samples are required."" Those instructions conclusively showed that no endeavour was made to select the best samples of imported flannels: It was pointed out by' Mr Vicars and Mr. Blackm'an that a large quantity of very inferior flannel was being sent from Victoria into New South Wales. To use Mr. Blackman's own words, "" It had no virtue as flannel.""",30
158,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"When we attempted to prevent the adulteration of articles whilst the Commerce Act was under consideration, we were blocked by honourable members upon the other side of the. Chamber.",30
159,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I do not know that that is so.,30
160,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"They "" stone-walled "" and blocked 'the Commerce Bill all night long ",30
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Rubbish .,30
162,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The report of the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission is .thatIn 1903 the total importation .into the Commonwealth of raw cotton was 464,964 lbs. Of this quantity there came direct to Victoria 417,609 lbs. In addition, there ""was transferred from other States 176,453 lbs. Those figures prove the adulteration of Victorian flannels.",30
163,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Loca l manufacturers or importers who sell cotton goods as flannel' should be put into gaol.,30
164,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes , and one of the re-»mmendations of the free^trade section of the Tariff Commission isCompulsory indelible marking on every article OT yard of so-called woollen fabric, whether imported or manufactured locally, its proportion of purity or adulteration. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Did the Chairman of the Commission and the remaining pro' tectionist members make the same recommendation ?",31
165,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Surel v he will support it.,31
166,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"He supported so few of the recommendations of the free-trade section that I am doubtful on the point. According to the Victorian Year-Book of 1903, the Victorian woollen mills used154,388 lbs. cotton in 1899, 78.332 lbs. cotton in 1900, 250,184 lbs. cotton in 1901, 273,335 lbs. cotton in 1902, 368,749 lbs. cotton in 1903. Those figures are an evidence that adulteration has been largely practised in Victoria, by the use of cotton in the manufacture of so-called woollen goods. trust, therefore, that the Government will endeavour to procure the adoption of the recommendation which I have just read, and honourable members seem to endorse, and that all three of our recommendation's in regard to woollen manufactures will be adopted. A very important part of the woollen industry is the blanket trade. We have been told by writers in the press and by public speakers that the blanket-making industry is being ruined because of the immense importation of blankets, but that statement is not borne out by the following statistics, showing the importations of blankets and blanketing into Australia. These importations, in 1899, were valued at ,£111,624; in 1900, at .£134-233; in 1901, at .£122,399 ; in 1902, at .£114,503 ; in 1903, £70,946 ; in 1904, at £57,720; in 1905, at ^57>899; and in 1906,- at £,53»5°&- As a matter of fact, there has been a great decrease in importations. When I stated some time ago that the woollen mills were not able to fulfil their orders, that statement was received with incredulity; but this is what the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission have to say on the subjectThe difference between the imports of woollens in 1899 and 1905-tw o fairly typical years - is equal to an increase of 34 per cent., and this, in view of the increased prosperity of recent years, cannot be regarded as in any way abnormal. That the Australian woollen manufacturer has enjoyed a large share of this prosperity is notorious. In addition to the evidence of witnesses, we learn, from official and. other reliable sources, that for some time back the majority of the woollen mills has been fully employed, many of them running overtime, while their customers are unable to obtain delivery of their orders. In substantiation of that statement, the evidence of Mr Hogarth, a Tasmanian manufacturer, of Mr Ripley, an importer, who gave evidence in Sydney, of Mr. Vicars, a Sydney manufacturer, of Mr. Thomson, and of Mr Max Hirsch is cited. 1",31
167,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What does Mr Max Hirsch know about the matter?,31
168,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Mr Max Hirsch is not fersona grata to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and if the Committee will not attach importance to his 1 statements, I ask it to consider the statements of manufacturers like Mr Hogarth and Mr Vicars. - Mr Mauger - Mr Vicars asked for a higher duty, and said that he would extend his premises if he got it. I' Mr FULLER - I understand that hie will extend his premises. I hope that in view of what I have said, honourable members will agree with the free-trade members of the CommissionThat Australian manufacturers are not in an unfavorable position in connection with the buying of their raw materials. On the contrary,* they are in a much better position in utilizing Australian wool than their oversea competitors can possibly be. That the outlay of capital on factory buildings and site is not greater in Australia tban in Great Britain, but the expense of equipping with machinery is possibly 30 per cent, greater, equal, approximately, to about 2 per cent, on the value of the annual output. In"" my opinion, the value of the site is greater in Great Britain than in Australia. The greater expense of equipment here is largely due to the high protective duties on machinery, another evidence that in trying to protect one industry we cannot avoid handicapping another. Another conclusion which I hope will be accepted isThat the disability in respect 'of shorter hours of labour and higher wages works out on an extreme estimate at not more than 10 per cent, on the value of the product. In my opinion, the estimate might very well be put at less than 10 per cent.; but to be on the safe side, we have given an extreme estimate. The general experience of honourable members should lead them to agree with the findingThat while a prejudice may exist in the minds of some individual purchasers against Australian woollens, others again have a prejudice in their favour. In the case of those in the trade, warehousemen, tailors, & c , the only consideration is one of value, and where this is at all equal'Australian goods are preferred.",31
169,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The prejudice against locally-made goods has not entirely disit appeared.,32
170,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is fast disappearas ing, and I think that when our manufacout in our reports. turers can make goods equal in quality to the best imported goods, and sell them at reasonable prices, the prejudice solutely disappear. The free-trade members of the Commission foundThat the general trade in Australia in sea goods is not in any commercial sense cessive"" or. "" u n fair . "" Nearly all woollen fabrics imported into the Commonwealth are else, is 36 per cent. selected and indented in the ordinary business. No dumping was proved, and no inof stance was given of unfair competition, 30 per cent. although many manufacturerscame before us. Unfortunately, we found that terated and inferior goods are imported into and manufactured in Australia, and in that connection I ask consideration for the recommendation which I have already read. We also found that- . The total disability of the Australian woollen manufacturer compared with. his British comwages petitor is, therefore, on these findings, not more than 2 per cent, on ""equipment, and 10 per cent, on labour, or a total of 12 per cent, on the value of the product. As against this, the be rather high. British manufacturer who competes pays 15 per cent, duty, and from 7^ to 12^ per cent, charges, or a minimum total of 22J per cent, on his goods, and this, without taking into consideration an average increase in the cost of Australian wool, delivered at the mill in England, of i 6 | per cent. The conditions under which we believe that the woollen manufacture would progress rapidly towards that importance which it ought to occupy, were summarized in three recommendations, the first of which I have read, and the second and third beingSpecialization by the manufacturers in respect to such goods as their local conditions and raw materials are best adapted for. A settled fiscal policy which would leave this industry untrammelled by duties supposed to benefit it or others. The free-trade members of the Commission are satisfied, after the fullest investigation of the subject, that what is required to make the woollen industry prosperous and progressive is not higher duties. Unfortunately, it is only too common a thing in Australia, when an industry is not making headway, to immediately appeal to the Government to assist it by means of a bounty or a protective duty, the hundred-and-one reasons for which the industry is at a standstill being lost sight of, or put on one side. I trust that when the Tariff comes to be dealt with in detail, honourable members will bear in mind that is not duties that make for the success of industries, but attention to points such those which we have endeavoured to set",32
171,Sir PHILIP FYSH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Will - the honourable gentleman, before sitting down, make some will abstatement in regard to hats?",32
172,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The manufacture of felt hats is a considerable industry in Ausovertralia, in connection with which the cost, "" exincluding wages, salaries, and everything On felt hats the way of Government have imposed a protective duty of 30 and 35 per cent. The rates duty under the old Tariff were 20 and",32
173,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The 20 per cent, duty adulprincipally, affected straw hats.",32
174,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am dealing now with felt hats. The natural protection enjoyed by the felt hat-making industry in Australia is equal to at least 20 per cent., so that the total protection which the industry will secure is 55 per cent., although the and salaries cost is only 36 per cent.",32
175,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The honourable member's estimate of the. natural protection seems to There is no trouble in in Australia packing hats for shipment.,32
176,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is ridiculous.,32
177,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The honourable member for South Sydney states his objection in a reasonable way, but the honourable member for Maribyrnong does not hesitate to say that my statement is ridiculous. What does he know about imported hats ?",32
178,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The honourable member admitted just now that I know a lot about the industry.,32
179,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,If the honourable gentleman is true to his protectionist principles he will not have an imported hat exposed for sale in his shop. If he does not deal in imported hats what can he know about the freight charges connected with them ?,32
180,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have been in the trade for thirty-five years; I was engaged in it when imported hats were exclusively dealt with. - Mr FULLER - That was many years ago. The sworn testimony of witnesses examined by the Commission was that the freight and general import charges on f e lt hats amounted to 20 per cent. have under this Tariff a total protection of 55 per cent, against foreign importations, and of 50 per cent, in the case of British imports.",32
181,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The duty on felt hats has not been altered except that in order to grant a preference to British imports an additional 5 per cent, has been imposed on those coming from foreign countries.",33
182,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The Denton Hat Mills, which has been carrying on operations under the old Tariff, has issued a statement showing that the net profit earned for the year ended 30th June was .£3,684 2s. rod., equal to about 12J per cent, on its paid-up capital. The dividend for the year was the usual 10 per cent., and .£500 was added to insurance reserve, raising it to £5,000; besides provision being made for depreciation of plant, &c. It is further stated thatThe directors report a satisfactory trade a promising prospect. Land has been purchased for extension of premises,' and plant acquired, while a further increase machinery to cope with the expanding business product. is foreshadowed. The company is in almost a unique position in being able to say that no provision has been made for doubtful debts, as none is necessary.",33
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is that one of the strangled industries?,33
184,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is one of the industries for which higher duties were asked. Colonel FoxTON - And the company is unable to supply orders when given.,33
185,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,How does the honourable member know that? I am told that it is not. the case:,33
186,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am afraid that the Postmaster-General will find himself in difficulties if he does not refrain from making these statements. The statement that the Denton Hat Mills Company is unable to fulfil orders has been directly challenged by him, and I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane will prove his assertion. I propose now to refer to the item of varnishes. The wages cost in the manufacture of varnishes-and we have to remember that nine-tenths of our imports of varnish . come from Great Britain-is less than 20 per cent., while the proposed duty is 2s. per gallon, or 30 per cent.,, whichever will return the higher duty. It is well known that not much-labour is employed in this industry. The degree of labour involved is, probably, smaller than is that associated with any industry' of Thus we corresponding dimensions. Employment in the trade increased under the old Tariff,, so that there is no necessity for raising the duty. Protectionists may well fall into line with free-traders who declare that a duty so far in excess of the actual wages cost might well be lowered. I think it ought to be reduced at least to the wages cost. Then we find that an increased duty has been imposed on candles. A very fult report upon the candle-making industry has been submitted by the Tariff Commission. The total labour cost in the finishing; moulding, and packing of candles for market, exclusive of making stearine, amounts; to not more than 8 per cent, of the value of the finished product.",33
187,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The manufacture of The stearine is the principal, item. If we exclude it very little is left.",33
188,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The complete labour cost in the manufacture of candles from with the preparation of the tallow until the new goods are ready for sale does not exceed in 16 per cent, of the market value of the 1",33
189,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is an appreciable difference.,33
190,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The industry enjoys a high direct protection in the shape of freights and landing charges. The Government propose that a duty of i j d . per lb. shall be imposed on candles coming from foreign countries, and of i d . per lb. on candles from the United Kingdom. Taking the value of stearine candles at 4d per lb - and that is a fair average factory' value-the proposed duty in the case or foreign imports is equal to 37J per cent.,' or, in the case of imports from Great Britain, to 25 per cent. This industry is con-, trolled by a combination, which regulates, prices in all the States, and it is in a flourishng condition. Mr Upton, a well-! known manufacturer in Sydney, told theCommission that he did not want a duty.. Under these circumstances, ""can there be,, any justification for the proposed increase?:",33
191,Mr WEBSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Does Mr Upton,, at the present time, enjoy a monopoly?",33
192,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,He is in only a. smaltway of business.,33
193,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Nearl y 2,000,000 lbs. of' candles were imported last year.",33
194,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have quoted these 1 figures in order to emphasize the point that this_ item as well as many other items of a similar character, require the closest scrutiny. The honourable member for Bendigo-drew a beautiful picture of the timber industry in Australia, and spoke of his experience in Western Australia, where he saw forests of jarrah and other timbers. ,1 think, however, that he should not have .lost sight of the fact that various industries are prejudicially affected by the new duties. I am sure we all hope that our great timber forests will be developed, but - we have to remember that the timber in many of the forests of New South Wales and Queensland is almost inaccessible, - while in some cases our forests do not comprise the timber that is necessary for certain industries ",33
195,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The present Tariff has caused Queensland maple to be substituted for other timbers. - Mr FULLER - That .is an excellent timber. It has been said that Queensland pine is unsuitable for butter-boxes. It is perfectly true that its appearance is not ""so pleasing as is that of the New Zealand - pine, and that it is somewhat heavier; but I do not think it is unsuitable. I was present when, before a number of experts - and I claim to know something about butter myself- a Queensland pine butterbox was opened, and it was found that butter which had been packed in it for six months was in a condition equal to that .of butter packed in New Zealand pine boxes.",34
196,Mr LIDDELL,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Queensland cannot supply the demand for pine for butter boxes. . Mr FULLER - I was about to refer to that point. The dairying industry today is exporting millions of pounds weight of butter, and its successdepends upon its export trade. The result of the new Tariff on New Zealand pine has been to increase by 2id. the cost of every butterhox made of that timber. A butter-box will hold 56J lbs - of butter, and, since tens of thousands of boxes are annually used, the additional cost to the dairy farmer must be a very big-item. - Mr WATSON - It is nothing compared with what the mail steam-ship companies have been trying to take from them. . Mr FULLER - Whils t the Government on the one hand have imposed a duty 'which will take thousands of pounds out of the pockets of our farmers, they are en deavouring, on the other hand; to arrange a mail contract that will enable, their.dairy 'produce to be carried cheaply and quickly to the old. land. On the-one hand, they are trying to assist the dairy farmers; and, on the other, they are seriously handicapping them. .",34
197,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The mail steam-ship companies sought to take another ,£60,000 per annum out of their pockets.",34
198,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is obvious that at the present time timber merchants in Queensland could not possibly supply the demand for timber for butter-boxes.,34
199,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Shal l we not soon overcome that difficulty?,34
200,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not think so. From inquiries which I made when in Queensland, I am satisfied that some time must elapse before that State will be-capable of supplying the demand for pine for butter-box making. We have to remember that the dairying industry is by no means stagnant. No industry in Australia has gone ahead so rapidly as has the dairying industry in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. It is the most progressive in the Commonwealth, and we should be careful not to handicap it. Australia's remoteness from the markets of the old world, as compared with the position of other countries now sending butter to England, places our dairy farmers at a serious disadvantage. But instead of facilitating them in every way, we are imposing increased duties on the timber required for their butter-boxes, on the wire-netting necessary to protect their holdings, on the salt used in the manufacture of their butter, on the timber and iron with which they build their homes, and on most of the necessaries .of life. Whilst the Government are subjecting our dairy farmers to all these disadvantages, . they are absolutely unable by means of a duty to increase by the smallest fraction the price which they obtain for their produce.",34

FULLER - The mining industry can receive no assistance from those engaged in it are severely handicapped by the increased price of all the cessaries of life.

Inrayown constiof tuency there is one of the largest coalthey mining centres in Australia, and the men are formed into an industrial union conmission sisting of over 2,000 members.

215,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"No , once the manufacturers get a duty they stick to it like s is shown by the history protection, the more they get the more want. It was freely alleged by many witnesses who came before the Tariff Comthat the Tariff was responsible for falling off in the Australian manufacture of mining machinery; but the great majority, at any rate, of those witnesses absolutely failed, on cross-examination, to assubstantiate their position. It was made clear in the evidence that the falling off in this industry was not' due to the Tariff, l but to the following causes, which will be found set out in Progress Report No. 7 of build their th-2 Commission :(a) Establishment of works prior to Fede- ration in excess of normal requirements ; (i) Large Government works prior to ancT * in the early part of Federation, sinceceased ;(c) Establishment of Government locomotive workshops; (d) Equipment of principal mines prior (o> 190a; (e) General dullness in mining; (/) Unsettled condition of the sugar dustry owing to uncertain effect of legislation; (g) The drought and general depression in some States; (h) Keenness of Inter-State competition. (1) Second-hand mining machinery. The unsettled condition of the sugar industry had a very damaging effect on the large foundries in Queensland; and, in consequence of several mines being closed, machinery was transferred to other mines. As to the first cause of the alleged decline in trade, it may be remembered that in VicHere toria, under the old State Tariff, there was large Government expenditure, several companies were established, which subsequently went into liquidation, or were P In absorbed by other firms. It is proved by the evidence of Victorian witnesses that those works were established prior to FeThe deration in order to meet special demands, brisk, and were in excess of normal requirements. Large Government locomotive, workshops, were also established at Ispwich, Queensbeing land, and on this point we had evidence the from Mr Harrington, the manager of the Walker Proprietary Limited, Maryborough. Mr Harrington stated that the opening the Government workshops had more than anything else a damaging effect on foundry, with which he was connected. A brisk. similar result was experienced in the of a firm at Gawler, South Australia; in reference to the latter Mr Martin gave evidence, in which he said I think the Government, by doing their work, has had more effect on us than anything else. The fourth cause alleged for the decline in trade was the equipment of the prinicpal mines prior to 1902.",35
216,Mr KNOX,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is quite correct.,36
217,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am glad to hear interjection, because I know it comes an honourable member who is largely terested in mining. This prior equipment saidresulted in a falling off in the demand for machinery of the character to which the legislation higher duties will apply.",36
218,Mr KNOX,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,There has been no large development since.,36
219,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"As to the general dulltionness in mining, we had evidence in South Australia to the following effectNot the same mining work as in 1899 . . . . hardly any mining machinery is used in South Australia, where very little mining is being done. in- That was the evidence of two principal manufacturers. In Queensland, engineers said that there was not a large enough outlet in mines and sugar mills to keep them going; they were aware that a lot of mining machinery had been idle for some time, and that the mining industry was very depressed. In the Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories for Victoria, 1904, page 27, relating - to the iron-moulding trade, it is stated- "" Unfortunately, however, owing to the mining, industry being for some time at a very low ebb, trade has been very slack, and I found that a large number of men were unemployed."" we see dullness, in one industry having a corresponding effect oh another inand dustry of a like character. a the same officer's report for the year 1905,, g 5J appear the following remarks by ine spectors at Bendigo and Ballarat respectively : "" In Bendigo, trade generally has been good. iron and engineering trade has been very so much so that some of the shops have been working two shifts to keep up with their orders. Bendigo has to depend on the mining industry for its support. The reason for trade so good this year is not far to seek, as mines throughout this, district have been verysuccessful during 1905, thereby being able to give a lot of labour to various trades."" of This shows that in Bendigo where mininghappened to be brisk, the manufacture of the mining machinery was correspondingly In Queensland, evidence on this case point was given by Mr Harrington, of and Walker Limited, which is the largest establishment in Maryborough, and a credit to the State of Queensland. We were told by Mr Harrington and others engaged in own the industry, that one of the great causes of the decline was the uncertainty and want of confidence in the future of the sugar industry; and there was also the additional reason that all the mills were fully equipped. When the new mills were being erected, engineers had orders which kept them busy, but, once the mills were built that and equipped, the demand suddenly from dropped, .and dullness set in. Mr Harinrington, in the course of his evidence, If it were not for the unsettled state of in connection with the sugar industry our works would be busy today. Ths same witness, after having admitted that mining was dull, summed up the position in the following answer to a quesI said four or five years ago, as the result of much thought and a careful analysis of our books, that one-third of our business was represented by Government contracts, one-third by the requirements of the sugar mills, and one-third by mining and miscellaneous requirements. .We' have since lost the Government workj and the sugar business is uncertain, because of the want of a definite policy. .It will be seen from this extract that in consequence of the loss of Government work, in combination with the uncertainty' in the sugar trade, absolutely two-thirds of the business of this establishment disappeared,",36
220,Mr GROOM,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What duty did Mr. Harrington ask for-2 5 per cent. ?,37
221,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I think that is so. The next cause assigned for the depression is the drought .and general depression in particular States. It - is common knowledge that there was depression in some, of the States in the early period' of the first Commonwealth Tariff. The position stood out in bold contrast to the prosperous years experienced immediately prior to Federation, when there was a succession of good seasons. Immediately after the Commonwealth was instituted, however, there was one of the most disastrous droughts which ever overtook Australia, and that was one of the causes for the great falling off in the demand for mining machinery. Another cause, - the effects of which were felt most keenly, particularly in Victoria, was Inter-State trade, which is specially referred to in another report, so that I need not deal with it a.t the present stage. As to the use of second-hand machinery, I am sure all honourable members connected with mining will bear out the finding of the Commission as followsIn the development of mining properties during some five or ten years prior to Federation, - a very large quantity of machinery was pro.cured, mainly in the Commonwealth, which, while suitable for surface propositions and the treatment of free milling ore, was discarded when other methods had to be employed, or the mines reached greater depths. In. addition, there was a good deal of imported machinery purchased for - working several - Western Australian properties which was' never used. In this way, a large, quantity of good machinery was either ""scrapped"" or sold and removed for working other claims, for which it was suited, and, consequently, met the demand which otherwise would have been supplied by . new machinery from Australian makers. There are, therefore, a variety of factors which account for the depression which exists in the mining machinery industry. I venture to . think that when honourable members carefully consider the position, they will agree with - the free-trade section of the Commission that the depression in the industry is due, not to the operation of the old Tariff, but to the nine different causes enumerated in pur .report - There :is no, comparison between the mining and engineering industries, from the stand-point of their value to Australia. In the case of mining machinery, the duty levied under the old Tariff was higher than the' average of the State Tariffs in operation prior to Federation. That there is a big future before the mining industry 'of Western Australia is conceded by every one.",37
222,Mr EDWARDS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"And before the industry in Queensland, too.",37
223,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes . But I wish to make special reference in this connection to Western Australia. We know that to profitably develop the mines of those States it is essential that up-to-date machinery-shall be employed. A large quantity of this machinery cannot be made in Australia. It is subject to patent rights which render that impossible. If opportunities are to be afforded the mining companies to develop their properties at considerable depths, and with low-grade ore, we must permit them to obtain, as freely as possible, the most up to-date machinery available. Many of them have almost reached the stage when it is - difficult to carry on. operations at a profit, and unless we* allow them to obtain their machinery at the lowest possible price there is no doubt that many of their workmen will be thrown out of employment.",37
224,Mr BAMFORD,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The honourable member does not suggest that the dividends might be a little smaller?,37
225,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It has been clearly proved that the old Tariff did not operate to the injury of the mining machinery trade. As a matter of fact, several Australian engineering works have been fully employed. It has also been demonstrated that since the first Commonwealth Tariff became law, there has been a.great reduction in the imports of mining machinery. Reference to official statistics clearly establishes this fact -'",37
226,Mr LIDDELL,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is it not a fact that certain poor mines can only be made remunerative by the use of up-to-date machinery ?,37
227,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes . It has also been provedThat, owing to the limited, irregular, and special demands of the mining industry, no plants in Australia are capable of producing all of the machinery required for present-day mining. . . The demand in Australia for certain classes of mining machinery is. so limited that it ; would not pay any company to lay down a plant for its manufacture. I submit'that as between these two industries the one which ought to be supported, if regard be had for our national development, is the great mining industry, in which over ^12,000,000 is invested today, and in which over 111,000 men are employed, in preference, to the mining engineering industry, in which only one-seventh of that amount of capital has been invested, and in which only 15,000 men are employed. trust that when the item is under consideration, honourable members will realise the position, and see that the mining industry of Australia is given fair play. In' the course of the investigations of the Tariff Commission its members discovered many anomalies which both sections desired to get rid of. In this connection a very extensive .report has been compiled, and I feel that the members of the Commission are under a deep obligation to that excellent officer, Mr Smart, for the assistance which he and his subordinates rendered us. I venture to say that a number of anomalies will be discovered in connection with the present Tariff. Already one has been brought to light in the newspapers. It has reference to the cap industry. In speaking of the duty levied upon caps, Mr W. Lewis, the proprietor of the well-known Federal Cap Factory in Melbourne, saysIn my opinion the present Tariff, if allowed to stand, will mean the ruination of the cap manufacturing industry in Australia.",37
228,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"He wants to bring in caps under ""apparel,"" which is a fair thing. After all, they are simply tweed made up into a different form.",38
229,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,But the present Tariff will place the manufacturers at a disadvantage of) 5 per cent. ' Mr WATSON - Canno t they use colonial tweed?,38
230,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is that the object of the duty? Is it intended to compel them to purchase the locally-manufactured article ?,38
231,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Why should not they purchase it? Mr FULLE'R - I do not see why they should not purchase it, if it suits them to do so.",38
232,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,They want to obtain the cheapest article no doubt?,38
233,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is a sound principle in connection with all industries that the raw material should be admitted at a lower fate than the manufactured article. Mr. Lewis continuesA brief examination of the new Tariff will, convince - you of this. Under the old scale woollen piece goods, which comprise our jaw material, were dutiable at 15 per cent., while 1 the rate charged on the manufactured article, caps, was 30 per cent. The effect of the new Tariff has been to raise the duty on our raw material, woollen piece goods, to 30 per cent, on the British and 35 per cent, on the foreign article. As against this, the duty on the manufactured article is unchanged, and still remainsat 30 per cent, on British goods, with an extra 5 per cent, on those of foreign manufacture I Now, manufactured caps are almost exclusively imported from Great Britain, but, on the other hand, we are compelled to go to Germany, Belgium, or France for our raw material, which, in consequence, bears the higher rate of 35 per cent. This means, in a nutshell, that whilewe have to pay 35 per cent, on the raw material,, the manufactured article can be imported bjr paying 30 per cent.",38
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Does he say why they have to go to Germany ? He says that they are compelled to go there.,38
235,Mr CHANTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,He can obtain the raw material here..,38
236,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,At any rate I hold that the proposal of the Government violates a sound principle in connection with Tariff legislation ,38
237,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Then let us make caps dutiable at 45 per cent.,38
238,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I am one of those who> believe in reducing duties. I submit that it is a sound principle that. the manuf ac- : tured article should pay a higher duty than the raw material.,38
239,Mr CHANTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is . not the raw material of Mr Lewis' industry the manufactured article of another industry? - 1,38
240,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Hi s raw material is' tweed. The free-trade mejmbers of theCommission recommended - a duty of .10 : per cent, upon the raw material and an impost of 15 per cent, on the manufactured, article, thus giving the proprietor of the cap factory an opportunity to secure his raw material at a 5per cent, lower duty, than is borne by the manufactured article, with which he. has to compete. The Government propose to reverse the position, and to compel the manufacturer to pay 5: per cent, more upon his raw material thanis levied upon the manufactured article.",38
241,Mr TUDOR,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Does Mr Lewis prefer the, proposal of the free-trade members of the. Commission to that of the Government?",38
242,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not know. I am net acquainted with Mr Lewis. I am: merely referring to one anomaly in the present Tariff which has already been noted in the press. I now wish to make"" a few remarks upon the question of prefer-.' ential trade, which, in an indirect way,, en-; gaged the attention of the Commission.. The chairman of that body has submitted a report in which pieced together the various statements made by the witnesses, but has made no recommendation in that connection. The free-trade members of the Tariff Commission, however, pursued a different line of conduct, and pointed out a manner in which a substantial preference could be given to the old country without injuring the manufacturers here, even on a protectionist basis.",38
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,There is no protection in the recommendations of the free trade section of the Tariff Commission.,39
244,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,My ideas and those of the honourable gentleman differ to such a degree that it is hardly worthwhile answering his interjection.,39
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"My ideas are right, and the honourable gentleman's are wrong.",39
246,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That statement proves nothing. If argument alone would carry the day, trie honourable gentleman would have no chance against any one of the free trade members of the Commission - but, of course, he can beat us in the making of rash and injudicious statements which will not bear cross-examination. We found in regard to preferential trade thatIn nearly every instance the witness clearly indicated that no preference should be given by Australia to Great Britain until the duty had' been fixed at such a rate as to secure to Australian manufacturers the Commonwealth market with a substantial margin of security, even against the competition of British manufacturers. A witness examined in connection with the manufacture of springs expressed himself as in favour of preferential duties, but this was His evidence when pressed by one of the Commissioners to indicate precisely the nature of the preference which he desiredDo you want, in the first instance, a duty which will secure to Australian manufacturers the trade in the manufacture of springs-that is, against every one else?-Yes . I presume that when you have achieved that object by means of a duty, you will put on an ornamental coping in the shape of a few per cent, more against the foreigner?-Yes . Is it not the case that most of the so called preferential duties in this Tariff are intended to largely prohibit the importation of British goods, the extra 5 per cent, on foreign importations being merely an ornamental coping? Most of the importations of mining machinery and woollens come from Great Britain, and those interested in the manufacture of such goods in Australia he has emphasized what they regard as their handicap-highe r cost of raw material, shorter hours. of labour, and so forth. After a careful investigation of all the representations made to us, we found that, as a rule, 12 per cent, would cover the alleged disadvantages of the - Australian manufacturer.",39
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"How can the Tariff injure British manufacturers, seeing that the duties are still higher against foreign manufacturers?",39
248,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The duties on British manufactures are so high as to practically prevent their importation into Australia, and the extra 5 per cent, against the foreigner is merely ornamental, and, furthermore, is imposed on many items in regard to which there is no foreign importation. The, duties on mining machinery, textiles, and woollens are so high as to practically prohibit British importations, and it is from Great Britain that in the past such goods have chiefly come. The additional rate of 5 per cent, against the foreigner is a mere make-believe preference to the British manufacturer. I have already pointed out that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission has announced his intention not to vote for any reduction of duty, even on British goods, whose importation is prejudicial to Australian manufacture, and, as I have said, any importation must be prejudicial to some extent to the local manufacturers of goods of the kinds imported. The duties on British goods are such as will prevent them from competing against local manufacturers in this market. But I shall show the position which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer put before the British people when in England in connection with the Imperial Conference. It will be found, by referring to page 249 of the Report of the Proceedings of that Conference, that the Prime Minister made use of these wordsThe imports of wheat and flour into the United Kingdom amount to 41^ millions sterling an-; nually, and of this quantity Australia sends only £4,300,000. Of other grains, principally oats, barley, and maize, the imports of the United Kingdom are valued at 29 million sterling, to which Australia contributes an insignificant ,£9,000. . . . If we secure only one-fifth of this trade, employment would be found for a large number of farming hands, and if our export of wheat only reached the figure of ^'8,500,000, or twice the past year's total, and other.grains £5,000,000, as they might very well be expected to reach under a slight preference, this would mean the additional employment in the Commonwealth of 200,000 persons. All of these would be purchasers of British goods, far larger purchasers than foreigners are, and of the goods you most wish to sell. The Prime Minister spoke of our people being purchasers of British goods. How will that be possible with duties of 30 and 40 per cent, on such goods?",39
249,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Reciprocit y has not yet been obtained.,40
250,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"On pages 257 and 258 of the report, the Prime Minister is made to sayNow, as regards the modes of preference to British goods, it is obvious that the Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain, or to increase these duties to the foreigner. .Not a word about increasing duties against Great Britain, which is what has been done.",40
251,Mr MAUGER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"""Existing "" duties mean those existing when reciprocity was effected.",40
252,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I take it that the Prime Minister referred to the duties in existence at the time he was speaking. The report continuesINCREASE TO FOREIGNERS. .This latter course has been followed in Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and probably in no perceptible degree influences the amount of duties collected. The immediate object of preference in our case would be to exclude foreign goods, and to favour. British goods. . . . It is natural, then, that the extent of ference should be such as to be calculated to accomplish the first of these objects, that is, the cessation of importation of foreign goods, and an increase of present duties, would seem to be the best means to achieve this end. There is not a word there about increasing the duties on British goods. continuesI am assured by an authority that a substantial preference to the goods of Great Britain in our markets would result in an increase of British trade with Australia to the extent of perhaps 50 per cent. This would be the effect of substantial preferences, and substantial preferences are contemplated by the third resolution of the Conference of 1902. We can imagine what a howl would come from those interested in the woollen and other industries who have been clamouring for more protection if the present rates were reduced to give a real preference to British manufacturers, and the result were to increase the importation of British goods by 50 per cent.",40
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What is suggested is that trade which is now done with the foreigner would be transferred to the Britisher.,40
254,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"At page 262, the Prime Minister is reported to have said furtherThe Customs Tariff which we shall submit will be framed on the same principle I have been enunciating here. Our first consideration will be that of the circumstances of Australia and its demands. He would have been nearer the mark if he had said that the only consideration would be the demand, not of Australia, but of Australian manufacturers. This Tariff, is merely a pandering to the demands of the manufacturers of Melbourne, Sydney, and other large centres, in obedience to the dictates of a section of the Victorian press. So long as Parliament meets in Melbourne, the Ministry of the day will be influenced by the press of the capital, and the sooner money is placed on the Estimates to prepare for our removal to the Seat of Government in New South Wales, the better it will be for our legislation. The Prime Minister continued The next (consideration) will be the possibility of giving a preference, and, therefore, entering into closer commercial relations with the mother country and our sister dominions. The Tariff contains .a sham preference to Great Britain, but I see nothing in it providing for our entering into closer commercial relations with our sister dominions.",40
255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We have already the preentered into a preferential arrangement with South Africa, which is not affected by this Tariff.",40
256,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That arrangement was in existence when the Prime Minister-made the remarks which I have quoted. The Treasurer is reported oni page 336 of the The report document from which I am quoting to have stated that it was ridiculous to suppose that a duty of 2s. a quarter on wheat would, raise the price of bread; but Mr. Asquith and Mr Lloyd George, who ought to know something about the position of the people of England, did not agree with him. The English people do not seem to have forgotten the state of affairs which existed when Sir Robert Peel took action to remedy the - starving condition of the masses of that - country. They did not believe the honourable gentleman.",40
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Most of them did.,40
258,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have not read any evidence in support of that statement. He said, furthermore, "" that a duty of 3d. a bushel would encourage the colonies to put 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 acre.? under wheat, and find employment for at least 200,000 more men, Britons, I hope."" I agree with the honourable gentleman that it would be a grand thing for Australia if such a state of affairs could be brought about. I should almost be prepared to submit at once to this Tariff if I thought that"" it would result in 200,000 men coming from the old country.to develop the unoccupied lands of Australia.",40
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We cannot hope for that until we have a land tax.,41
260,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The Acting Prime Minister would first of all tax everything used by the man on the soil, and then, witfi the object of still further encouraging the people to go on the land, he would impose a Federal land tax. In New South Wales, we already have a land tax, and in some parts of it a land tax in addition to .a municipal tax.",41
261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We do not wish a continuation of the 200,000 or 300,000 acre properties.",41
262,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The Acting Prime Minister went on to say at the Conference that these 200,000 menwith their wives and families would consume the manufactured products of Great Britain, and thus increase employment in the old country. It wo.uld be interesting to learn how manufacturers in Melbourne view that statement. The Minister has introduced a Tariff in the interests of the big manufacturers in Australia, and yet, whilst in England, he declared that the thousands of immigrants whom the Government hoped to attract to Australia would consume not local manufactures, but the products of Great Britain, and thus increase employment in the old country. The two do not harmonize. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I said that they would not consume foreign produce.",41
263,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That is an addition to the honourable member's original statement. When he was posing before the public of Great Britain as a man who intended to do something for the old land, it did. not suit his book to say merely that those coming to Australia would not consume foreign produce.",41
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I distinctly referred on more than one occasion to the value of foreign imports entering Australia, and gave the figures. ",41
265,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I intend to make another quotation from the honourable member's speech on the occasion in question. He went on to sayThe same may be said of dairying, meat, and many other industries; preference to the Colonies would mean the employment of millions more Britons in your Colonies and increased markets for British manufactures. Increased markets not for colonial but for British manufactures.",41
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,And not foreign manufactures.,41
267,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"What has the honourable gentleman done to carry out his promise? As soon as he returned to Australia, he submitted a Tariff which will prevent British goods coming into Australia and competing on fair terms with our own products.",41
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,It is a Tariff to prevent the unrestricted importation of foreign goods.,41
269,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The honourable gentleman asked that his remarks should be placed on record. I do not know whether he had not been reported or what caused him to make that request. He said I hope I may be permitted to have what I say placed on record-. It is more necessary now than it was before the statement we have heard today from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to let the Australian people know exactly what we have attempted since we came here.",41
270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Hear , hear.",41
271,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I have endeavoured to let the people of Australia know what the Acting Prime Minister told the Conference he would endeavour to carry out. I hope that British statesmen will note what is occurring at the present time in the Australian Parliament. Those who posed before the people of Great Britain as ardent supporters of preferential trade were prepared to make glib promises in the old land as to the grand markets that would be opened up for (British manufactures in Australia; but as soon as they returned, they changed their tune, and began at once to pander to the desires of Australian manufacturers, and to yield to the dictates of a section of the press. They have shown themselves utterly unable to rise to the true ideals of Imperial unity; they have really no idea of the meaning of Imperialism in this connection. In the old land they talked of uniting the Empire by means of preferential Tariffs, but as soon as they returned to Australia they brought down a Tariff calculated to shut out goods not only from foreign countries, but' from Great Britain herself. I have no hesitation in describing the preferential trade proposals of the Government as a sham, a humbug, and a farce. If they were prepared to grant a substantial measure of preference to Great Britain, why did-they not addpt the suggestion of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, which showed that a preference on a protectionist basis of 1 2 per cent, could be granted 1 without injuring Australian industries? Why did they not pull down instead of raise the duties against the products of the mother land? I wish now to know whether the Tariff, as introduced, is to be carried in its entirety or whether the Government are prepared to compromise?",41
272,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is to be protectionist Tariff, and that is why the honourable member does not like it .",42
273,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Then there is to be no compromise ?,42
274,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We are going to descend to the free-trade proposals.,42
275,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,A r e the Government prepared to accept a compromise? I understand from the Minister of Trade and Customs that they are not. going to fight for a high protectionist Tariff.,42
276,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We are to fight against the proposals of the free trade section of the Commission, which, after asserting that they were satisfied that the country had decided in favour of protection, recommended a revenue Tariff.",42
277,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We do not desire to do anything of the kind suggested by the Minister, and the free-trade section of the Commission never asserted Jhat the country had decided in favour "" of protection. I was led to ask whether the Government would be prepared to compromise, because of two speeches delivered by Ministers on Saturday night last. The Acting Prime Minister spoke in Sydney, whilst on the same night the Minister of Trade and Customs spoke in Melbourne.",42

According to the report before me, the Acting Prime Minister declared, amid a chorus of approval from the manufacturers present, thatHe was pleased to have had an opportunity of giving to Australia a protectionist Tariff, and they might depend on it (slapping the table) they were going to have it. . . . Did they think that this great country would ever stand a wishy-washv, half-and-half Tariff that would do nothing but raise revenue? Chorus of manufacturers-No , no.",42

281,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The Minister who now says ""Hear, hear,"" went on to declare thatHe was as confident as that he was standing in that room that the Tariff would be carried' into law. To use an expression of his own, I suppose, that he intends, with the assistance of the majority at his back, to "" bullockit through."" In striking contrast to that statement was the speech delivered by the a Minister of Trade and Customs.",42

The two parties would have to look at both sides and bring about a happy compromise. Whilst on the one hand the Minister charged with the administration of the Taritf says that we must have a happy compromise, the Acting Prime Minister declares that the Government will not have a wishy-washy Tariff, but an out-and-out protectionist one, likely to please the manufacturers who applauded him while he was speaking.",42
286,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We are not going to have a wishy-washy Tariff such as the honourable member would desire.,42
287,Mr FULLER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I think that we are entitled to have from the Ministry a fair statement of their intentions in - this regard. I apologize to the Committee for having oxupied so much time, and desire to thank honourable members for the hearing they have accorded me.",42
288,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"New England) [3.12]. - I must express the pleasure with which I have listened to the able speech delivered by the honourable member for Illawarra,'who has just resumed his seat, and who has enjoyed the advantage of being a member of the Tariff Commission. While I disagree with many of the statements to which he has given utterance, I may say at once that I am pleased with the attitude of the Opposition, and trust that we shall receive their assistance in our efforts to frame a Tariff that will be a credit to Australia, and will stand for a very long time. Unlike the honourable member, I am here fo fight for a purely protective Tariff. Although I am not an expert, I fail to understand why, having regard to the arduous work performed so well by an able Commission, it should be said that the Tariff has not been properly considered.  mended by the Commission is not that which the Government have introduced.",42
289,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It is based on the report of the protectionist section of the Commission. The Tariff is high in places; but who could expect a perfect Tariff, when so many items have to be considered? I do not suppose that any representative House would accept absolutely the recommendations of a Commission. The members of the Commission undoubtedly did their best; but it is unfair to accuse those who drew up the Tariff now before us of having done so without due consideration. I was much struck by the emphasis which the honourable member for Illawarra laid on the importance of the mining industry. Mining, taken as a whole, seems to me practically a gamble. There is more money put into mining, not only in Australia, but in every other part of the world, than into any other form of gambling.",43
290,Mr HEDGES,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"This Tariff does not affect the gambling element, but it affects the workers.",43
291,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am glad to observe this solicitude' for the worker. It is truly astonishing how careful honourable members opposite appear to be on behalf of the worker; but when there arises any test question as between the worker and the man who desires to sweat him. the sympathy for the worker is all on this side. I have had many years' experience of mining; :ind I should consider any company very weak-kneed that would be afraid to launch out on a speculation because of duties on mining machinery. Furthermore, the mining industry is not confined to gold or precious metals; and the Tariff is an attempt to develop mining generally. Australia can produce almost any mineral, especially iron and tin, and, though the mining companies may feel the effect of the Tariff a little, the duties will assist other branches of mining, by causing the local production of machinery made from raw materials raised in Australia. We have been told that the last general election was not fought on the fiscal question. That, however, could not be said of my own contest, because the gentleman who opposed me went very solidly for free-trade, as he had done as a member of this House. Personally, I stood for protection as well as for labour.",43
292,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Was the honourable member's opponent not an anti-Socialist?,43
293,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,He was a single-taxer; I do not know whether that means an antiSocialist.,43
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,He was one of the straightest men who ever came into this Chamber.,43
295,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I always considered him a straight man, and I am not saying anything against him. During the election I was asked whether I , as a protectionist, imagined for one moment that I would get anylarge support on the mining fields) seeing that protection must injure the miners. I know a great many mining fields in New South Wales; and the one question facing the fathers of families there, - now that the alluvial fields are worked out, is what to do with) their large families in the way of employment. ' Mr HUTCHISON - Some of the miners have passed resolutions in favour of protection.",43
296,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I notice that, even in Western Australia, a resolution endorsing protection has been passed in an important mining centre.",43

302,Mr WATSON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,They liave come round since.,43
303,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am pleased to hear that from the honourable member for South Sydney, because it shows that miners are improving in their knowledge, and becoming less selfish.. In the early days of minim? in Australia, when everybody was rushing pell mell to make_ his fortune, I can well understand that all were free-traders. The prospect then was that Australia would become a great mining camp, and must import all its requisites from outside; and, therefore, a miner was consistent in being a free-trader. But I know thousands of men today who, although ten or twelve years ago they were free-traders, are now voting steadily for protection.",43
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Does the honourable member say that he was returned as a tectionist, pure and simple?",44
305,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,1 was returned as a who protectionist and a Labour man-the best combination in Australia today.,44
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The honourable member"" did not always say that.",44
307,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I did 'not; in my younger and. more callow days I used to vote on theory- I had dreams such as the bers untouched. honourable member seems to have now. Years ago, when I was a student of pure theory, I made the discovery that under one condition only could there be free-trade without injury to the people Australia. That condition was that there must be a system of national co-operation, so that the whole people may own, collecsence tively, the machinery for production and conduct not only ""their own manufacturing, but also their own distribution. If we a system of national co-operation, we would not import unless we wished to, seeing there would be only one importer, and that importer the nation. When I hear honorber; able members opposite advocating free-trade I ask them whether they will go the whole hog, and support national co-operation?",44
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We are always in favour of co-operation.,44
309,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"If honourable members are so fond of the Empire as they would lead us to believe-and I have listened much about preference-wh y do they not ask for an Imperial Zollverein-that is, free-trade within the Empire, and protecseek tion against the outside world?",44
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Is the honourable, member prepared to do that?",44
311,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not say; at preif sent I am here as a protectionist, but I expenses. should like honourable members opposite advocate more than free-trade, if they wish to be taken seriously.",44
312,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Is this the result of honourable member's fifteen years' study of economics ?,44
313,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"If the honourable memeffective ber had studied economics he would seated on this side. There is one important point, which I should like to impress those honourable members who are such staunch free-traders. We have heard great cry during the last few weeks about the enormous prices which people have been called upon to pay on account of the Tariff, but I have not heard one word from the Opposition benches as to how this can be remedied. Those honourable members have pointed to one class of robber-the Austraprolian manufacturer. But not a word have we heard from them about the middleman, is raising the prices of commodities on which no duty has been paid. We have not been told that the middleman, or that the foreign manufacturer, who wants to wipe out our little local manufactures, is a robber. No; the Opposition have discovered one robber, but have left the other two rob",44
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,What would the economics in honourable member do?,44
315,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I tell the honourable member what I should do as a protectionist, of but I throw the onus of proof in regard to free-trade on his shoulders, and those of his colleagues. I regret the lamentable abof argument on the part of the Opposition. I must say, however, that I admire the leader of the Opposition in the stand he had has taken on the Tariff. He has decided not to obstruct, but to accept the inevitable that and expedite the measure. That shows the common sense of the right honourable memand I am glad that we are to have no obstruction. However, the right honourable member put forward a plea on behalf of the consumer. "" He urged that, while much had been said during the last few months about the manufacturers, nothing had been said on behalf of that great body of people who are consumers. The' right honourable gento tleman, however, quite omitted to tell us that nearly the whole of the consumers are producers; and in a protective Tariff we to assist all producers. The farmers and miners, on behalf of whom the plea of the - right honourable member was made, are only too willingto vote for protection, even they have to pay a little more in living It is not pretended for one to moment that they are to have the benefits of protection without paying for it in some way; but what they desire is diversitv of the employment for themselves and children. They desire to see Australia absolutely self-supporting, which is, after all, the first blow to be struck in self defence. be In my opinion, the establishment of a thoroughly protective system in Australia on is the most important step we can take in defence of the ""country. If we do not make a Australia self-supporting, what is the use of worrying about closer settlement, or about putting people on the land, when it is possible that the country may soon pass out of the hands of the British race into the hands of some invading force of^ say, Chinese or Japanese? The farmers and miners, and the people generally, are willing to sacrifice a trifle to avoid such a calamity. The man who says'that protection will cost us nothing-that we are to have absolute cheapness straight off-is , in my opinion, not telling the whole truth. I do not look on protection as a final reform, but merely as a means whereby we may make Australia a country worth living in. I have heard a great deal about dumping today. Of course everybody is aware that in America there is a monstrous and abnormal growth in the form of trusts and combines. I know that members of the Opposition are always ready to assure us that these trusts are the result of protection. I admit that they have utilized protection to their own advantage just as they have utilized the weakness of the people, the poverty of the workers, and all the methods known to bad finance to their own aggrandizement. Those who stand up for free trade today seem to be quite willing to place our industries at the mercy of these trusts. Having read up this question some years ago, I recall the fact that in the early days of American history, Lord Brougham advocated the wholesale dumping of goods into America with a view to crushing its infant industries. As honourable members are aware, these enormous trusts would not hesitate to send millions of pounds worth of goods into this country .for the purpose of killing our industries if they were satisfied that they could subsequently recoup themselves by making larger profits. can find plenty of instances of dumping if we cafe to look for them. No doubt honourable members upon the Opposition side of the House are just as familiar with them as I am.",44
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,We are quite unby considerations of self-defence. aware of any such instances.,45
317,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"It suits the honourable member's purpose very much better to terject that protection is the cause of trusts. I wish to say, especially to the honourable member, that I do not desire to see trusts of any kind established in Australia. do not wish to see the people robbed, even by our local factories. That is why I am an advocate of the "" new protection."" That rely in defending a protective policy. is why I stand for the protection of the employees and of the public from robbery* either by the manufacturer or the middleman. Another objection urged to a protective policy is that if we close pur portsto foreign production, no ships will come here to take away our wool and meat. I have not a very exalted opinion of the Australian who has not a greater faith in the possibilities of his country, especially in' view of the wonderful resources which we possess. I do not think much of the knowledge and foresight of the man who does not believe that in the future Australia will be able to export her products. What is to prevent her doing so if we adopt a reasonable protective Tariff. Its operation will undoubtedly give our manufacturers a larger turn-over, and a better chance to install more efficient machinery. What then is to prevent Australia from becoming an exporting country? It is not my intention to deal at length with any of the details of the Tariff. I do not believe in a revenue Tariff, neither do I believe in tax-, ing such articles as tea and kerosene, which we cannot produce locally. Nor would I impose a heavy tax upon magazines.  tax upon wheat in the old country makes that commodity cheaper there, will not a duty upon kerosene cause that article to be sold cheaper here?",45
318,Mr FOSTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"We may be able to produce kerosene in Australia, but it seems rather hard that we should tax that article straight away. I should prefer to foster the industry by means of a bonus. I.think that we can well afford to forego any special'tax upon kerosene. I am credibly informed that there is a firm in our midst which imports kerosene in bulk, and which tins it , and I do not see why the StandardWe Oil Trust should not do the same thing. J hope that members of the Opposition will not take my replies too severely to heart, ljecause I recognise .that they are just as earnest in their convictions as I am in mine. I have been forced to become a protectionist It is all very well for us to be importing millions of pounds' worth of goods annually, but inwhen we recollect that at any time there may be an outbreak of war, and that we may be called upon to stand to our defences, I think we must recognise the need which, I exists for making some sacrifices with a viewto render the country self-supporting. That is the main line of argument upon which I I agree with others that before Australia can accomplish very much in the nature of closer settlement, she must have diversity of industries, and that the men who have taken up small areas of land must be able - to grow something more than wool and wheat. Hand in hand with a protective system must go the idea of closer settlement in the building up of a prosperous population. The one great factor which - stands to America today is the fact that. she has, a mighty home market. She has So, 000,000 of people to feed. No matter what war may break out, that market will still be available to her. A few weeks ago I was very much amused in reading an .article upon the possibility of an outbreak of war between America and Japan. If those two countries were engaged in an armed conflict, what a magnificent self-supporting position America would occupy. I can quite imagine that, whilst one fleet of vessels was being destroyed, she would be building another fleet. But in what position should we find ourselves in such an emergency ? We are doing next to nothing in the . way of providing an effective means of defence. I recognise that if we are to build up a nation, Australia cannot continue to grow only wool and wheat, and to carry on our minor industries. We must go in for manufacturing, and therebv bring about a dense population"". In conclusion, I must express my pleasure at the attitude of gentlemen who-althoug h they have spoken adversely of the party of which I am proud to be a member, although they have said that Australia was being ruined by Labour legislation, and although they have roundly abused this country-hav e now seen fit to withdraw their calumnies. I hope they will' join hands with those who believe that Australia is going to be one of the greatest nations of the earth. I see no reason why they should hot unite with us-no w that they have ceased to traduce Australia-in advancing her best material interests. They can most effectively 'do that by assisting us to dispose of the Tariff as soon as possible.",45
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I suggest that we might well report progress now.,46
320,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am willing to do so if it is the desire of the honourable member and others, although it is rather early. Progress reported.

Mr. JOSEPH COOK' (Parramatta) [3.46] - Has the Acting Prime Minister yet decided when he will proceed with the Judiciary and Commonwealth Salaries Bills, about which he promised to make a statement today? I hope that he will definitely fix a date for dealing with these measures.",46
321,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Corio) [3.47]--This morning, I asked the Minister of Defence certain questions, upon notice, regarding an action talken in the case of Bombardier Lang, of the Royal Australian Artillery. It is my duty, as a representative of the people, to bring before this House any case of injustice which it is within the province of this Parliament to remedy, and it is the duty .of Ministers and of honourable members to take notice of the cases which I bring before them. In reply to a question asking if Bombardier Lang had made a complaint about the conduct of Major Hawker to the non-commissioned officers under his command, I was told thatOn the 28th March last Bombardier Lang made a complaint to the Commanding Officer, R.A.A., New South Wales, to the effect that Major Hawker had improperly dismissed a case brought forward by him (Br. Langi against a gunner, and that Major Hawker had said to the Company Sergeant-Major that a conspiracy had existed - amongst the Non-Commissioned officers against the gunner concerned. The right to complain to the Commandant of the State is given by the regulations, and when, on a previous occasion, I voiced the grievances of certain men who had been badly treated at Queenscliff, I was told that they should, have complained to their State Commandant. Therefore, I asked if Bombardier Lang subsequently complained to General GorPAPER.. don, and if he had' the right, under the regulations, to make such a complaint. The reply I received was that he had the right, and thatOn the 18th April, 1907, Brigadier-General Gordon was inspecting at Middle Head, when Br. Lang repeated the same complaint. Therefore it is admitted that Bombardier Lang made a complaint, and that it went through the proper channel.",46
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Was there no New South Wales member by whom he could have got his grievances represented?,47
323,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"He was advised by me to make representations to a New South Wales member, but, for reasons which I shall give to the honourable member privately, he did not care to do so.. It appears that, although under the regulations he had a right to complain to General Gordon, he was put under arrest for doing so, and kept under arrest from the 18th to the 24th April last - I asked if General Gordon has been asked to explain the arrest, but I have received no answer to that question. I was informed that the Commanding Officer investigated the case, and informed Bombardier Lang that he had no cause of complaint. I was also told thatBr. Lang was . . . . paraded before General Gordon to enable him to state his case, and to give him full opportunity to make any statement he desired, with the result that he withdrew his complaint, and expressed himself satisfied. In reply to my inquiries Bombardier Lang informs me thatThe statement that I withdrew the complaint is altogether a misapplication of words. When I was before General Gordon, after his return from the Maitland camp, some days after I had been released, he made a long rambling statement, the meaning of which I took to be that if I let the matter drop I could get anything that I chose to go in for, but if I forced the matter I need not expect a bed of roses while I remained in the Artillery.",47
324,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That is an ex - parte statement.,47
325,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes ; and I ask the Minister of Defence to thoroughly inquire into it. It is a matter of mere justice. We have heard a great deal lately about proper military control and discipline, and while I agree that discipline is necessary, we should have as much at the top as at the bottom. The Governor General in Council having issued certain regulations giving the right to the least influential man in the forces to complain to his State Commandant, it was scandalous to keep Bombardier Lang under arrest for seven days for having made such a complaint. ^ I r . KING O'MALLEY - It was an outrage upon justice.",47
326,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Yes ; and I hope that the Minister will cause a thorough investigation to be made into the whole case. The humblest soldier in the forces has a right to receive fair treatment, and if he suffers injustice, the House should interfere.",47
327,Mr BAMFORD,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Herbert) [3.53] Some time ago, I asked the Acting Prime Minister to lay on the table a copy of the agreement entered into between the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and certain . immigrants from Europe, and a paper was laid upon the table which purported to be such a copy;' but, subsequently, the Minister said that a mistake; had been made, and that it was not a correct copy. ' I now ask him when he will carry out his promise, and place a certified copy on the table ?",47
328,Mr CHANTER,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Riverina) [3.54] - It is stated in this morning's papers that the Premier of New South Wales has declared that no force was used in connection with the seizure of wire-netting in Sydney, which has caused such consternation through-, out Australia and probably all over the world, the public having been led to believe that force was used. I ask the Minister whether, if he has any information on the subject, he will give it to the House?",47
329,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [3.55] - I have already told the House and the honourable member for Corio that it is my duty and that of the Government to see that no injustice is done, to any officer or private in the Military Forces. We recognise thai justice is the basis of discipline. But mistakes will at times occur, and a mistake was made in this case.",47
330,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,B y General Gordon?.,47
331,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"In the absence of General Gordon, who remedied the mistake as soon as fie could. I believe that he telegraphed that Bombardier Lang had acted in accordance with the regulations, and, therefore, should be released.",47
332,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The honourable gentleman informed me this morning that General Gordon put Bombardier Lang under arrest.,47
333,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Immediately the Commandant found that a mistake had been made, he remedied it. He informed Bombardier Lang that a mistake had been made, and was told by him that he was perfectly satisfied.",47
334,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Bombardie r Lang denies that.,47
335,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I find that a mistake has been made, and mistakes are at times inevitable in any Department.",47
336,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Surely somereparation will be made to a man who has been kept under arrest for seven days owing to a mistake?,48
337,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am prepared to make any reparation possible; but I am sure that honourable members are willing to concede to military officers the consideration which they extend to other officials. Moreover, members of the House are responsible for the upholding of military discipline, but if every grievance is made public, discipline is impossible. If , instead of bringing matters of this kind before the House, the honourable gentleman would make representations to me, I should be prepared to submit my decision to him, and to any other three members whom he might desire to nominate. We do not desire to make the heads of our Military Department the ""Aunt Sallys"" of Parliament.",48
338,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I accept the Minister's offer, and allow him to nominate any three members he chooses.",48
339,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"My desire is to prevent the continual bringing of grievances before Parliament. I admit that injustice musl be remedied, even though it affects only the humblest man in the ranks. Unless the men feel that they are being treated with absolute fairness, we cannot hope to succeed in establishing a satisfactory citizen soldiery.",48
340,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Bombardie r Lang is a permanent soldier. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for Corio proved his case to the hilt last time. . Mr EWING - He will not prove that any case of injustice has been allowed to continue under my administration.,48
341,Mr CROUCH,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I am content to accept the Minister's offer.,48
342,Mr EWING,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"No member of Parliament should use'his position to do anything detrimental to a Department. Therefore, let the honourable member bring his case before me, and if , when I have dealt with it, he thinks that I have unduly favoured any person, he will have a real ground of complaint. He has already discussed the matter in private-with me, and knows that no definite decision has yet been arrived at. Irstead of exhausting the Minister's authority, he has brought the matter before the House. Had I refused to do what the honourable member thinks I ought to have done, he would then have been justified in taking that step. [83]",48

The honourable gentleman assuted me that he was thinking of sending an officer to Tasmania' to inquire into the working of the Department there; but I learn today that the postal arrangements are still very unsatisfactory. An honourable member who visited Tasmania some time ago had to wait at the Launceston post office for twenty minutes before he could purchase a stamp. This state of affairs has beei; going on for some time, and I should like to know whether the present Postmaster-General will see that improvements are effected as speedily as possible in connection with the Launceston post-office, and indeed in the service generally throughout Tasmania.",48
345,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"Coolgardie) [4-2]The Acting Prime Minister yesterday replied to a question that I put to him with regard to the grant cf ^1,000 made to the executive of the Exhibition of Women's Work. He then stated that, so far as he was aware, only ,£15 had been paid over. Iq view of the fact that this grant was made by the Ministry without the authority of Parliament, and, so far as the papers disclose, nuite spontaneously, I should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister will be prepared to cancel the unexpended balance and place the item on the Estimates in order that the opinion of the Parliament may be obtained. There has never been any urgency in regard to the matter. On the admission of the Acting Prime Minister himself, it appears that the grant was made, not to encourage any special effort on the part of the women of Australia, but to defray the cost of bringing exhibits' from Europe.",48
346,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,To defray the cost of carrying exhibits from the continent to London. They will be carried from London to Australia free of charge.,48
347,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Thos e associated with the exhibition are so influential that they should have had no difficulty in providing for freights without appealing surreptitiously to the Government for'so large a grant It is only due to the Parliament that the Acting Prime Minister should cancel the giant and inform the executive of the exhibition that the item will be placed on the Estimates in order that the opinion of orable members may be taken upon it.,48

I have received this afternoon reports from New South Wales which, but for the fact that the case is now sub judice, I should lay upon the table. In the circumstances I do not think it would be proper for me to do so. I may say, however, that the statement which I first made in regard to this subject is more than borne out by the reports, and that if they true, a most aggravated course of action has, been adopted by Mr Carruthers. to the inquiry made by the honourable ber for Parramatta, I may say intended to ask the House to deal today with the Judiciary Bill and the Commongram wealth Salaries Bill, but, finding that it be expended ? was improbable that we should be able to deal with them finally this afternoon, decided not to do so.",49

352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I do not wish the general debate on the Tariff to be interthe rupted, and unless it be unduly prolonged, I do not think I shall submit those Bills Prime Minister until it has been brought to a close. I shall probably submit, them about the time that I ask the House to deal with the Works and Buildings Estimates.",49
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"At all events, we shall receive two or three days' notice behonfore we a""re asked to proceed with those measures ? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes. I shall try to give honourable members generally the say necessary notice. Coming to the question at put by the honourable member for Coolto gardie, I must confess that I think he is taking a very lively interest in a very small matter. Surely Ministers can be trusted to the spend judiciously a sum of £1,000?",49
354,Mr WILKS,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"The leader of the Opposiin tion, when at the head of a New South Government, was thrown out of office be because of an expenditure of £350 which had not been approved by the Parliament.",49
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"That was an entirely different matter. I gave the honourable member for Coolgardie yesterday an of answer with which I had been supplied by it the Treasury, and explained why .the money for had been sent to London. I pointed out of that it was to be expended only in the defraying expenses in respect of conveying valuable exhibits from the Continent reto London, and that the Peninsular and of Oriental Steam Navigation Company would cany them thence to Australia free of charge. If there is any surplus in connection with the exhibition, the money so spent will be refunded. I have reason to believe that there will be a surplus; everything points to that conclusion. The latest advices obtainable are that only .£15 has to the House yet been expended.",49
356,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Then the honourable membe ber will have control of the balance?,49
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"So far as we As know at the present time, only £ 1 5 has membeen expended; but the balance of the that I had money is in London.",49
358,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Why not send a cabledirecting that no further sum shall,49
359,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I am not going I to place such an indignity upon the Prime Minister, nor my late colleague, the right honourable member for Swan.",49
360,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,I did not suggest anything of the kind.,49
361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,That would be effect of the adoption of the honourable member's suggestion. I understand that the,49
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,Promise d the money.,49
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"I believe that he did. At all events, he is familiar with the details.",49
364,Mr MAHON,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,The papers ought to show that.,50
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WORKS ANDBUILDING S,"They simply show that the Prime Minister had apparently made a promise to some one that a grant would be made for this purpose, and that the secretary of the exhibition wrote to him reminding him of that promise. I hope that the honourable member will not press his objection. I believe that the money paid in this connection will be refunded to us. If the whole _£i,obo is not required for the purpose for which it was granted, it will not be expended. The honourable member for Herbert put a question to me in regard to contract immigrants. There was a mistake in the paper which I laid upon the table some time ago. I think I shall be able to present the true agreement on Tuesday. I do not think that there is any objection to doing so; and I will take care this time that the document is so certified that there cannot.be any mistake, as there was on the last occasion. I regret that an error was made. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.11 p.m.",50
