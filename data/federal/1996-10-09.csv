2,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have received advice from the Chief Government Whip that he has nominated the member for Hughes, Mrs Vale, to be a member of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform in place of Mr Bob Baldwin. I have also received advice from the Government Whip that he has nominated the member for Canning, Mrs Johnston, to be a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in place of Mr Broadbent. NA Motion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That for the sitting on Thursday, 10 October 1996 so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business being as follows, unless otherwise 1.

NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman) proposed: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: CFM Sale Bill 1996; and Statute Law Revision Bill 1996.",13
3,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE,"In relation to the referral of bills to the Main Committee-and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Cadman) has just described the latest list of bills to be referred there-I wish to reflect on yesterday evening's disgraceful sequence of events in here. In the first instance, a motion was moved to effectively refer the private member's bill on euthanasia moved by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) to the Main Committee. In the second instance, a motion was moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in relation to his dissent from the then Deputy Speaker's ruling. Then we had the situation where the substantive motion-a motion of great importance and one on which I would have thought a number of members would have had a particularly strong view, in many cases-was effectively gagged. A number of members in this chamber who wanted to speak to that motion were prevented from doing so. I want to make a couple of observations in relation to the referral of bills to the Main Committee. When the Main Committee was established after an inquiry and report by the Selection Committee it was determined that the Main Committee would discuss matters of ordered: non-controversial circumstances-in other words, bills that would not involve great differences of opinion or involve, for instance, divisions or other motions that may prevent the free flowing of the debate. I was a member of that committee and I recollect making at the time a number of observations to this House about my concerns about the way in which the Main Committee might be used. We have already seen the Main Committee used under this and the previous administration for the debate of the appropriation bills. I would have thought under the circumstances that appropriation bills were of such significance and importance that it would be critical that they be debated in this main chamber of the House of Representatives. Now we have the situation where probably one of the most important bills of this decade, Mr Andrews's private member's bill, has been moved to, effectively, the secondary chamber of the House of Representatives. In most cases this will be the only opportunity for majority of members to speak. I listened with great interest to the shadow minister's contribution yesterday, and I cannon fodder. consider that a number of the points he raised were absolutely right. There is no doubt my mind from the debates that occurred at time about the creation of the Main Commitexpectation tee that it was never designed to be a place where contentious legislation would be debatyour ed, and we never anticipated members being required to have split personalities, to sit two separate chambers to keep themselves abreast of the progress of the debate on bills before the House of Representatives. They may even want to speak on legislation in places. Not only is that illogical and absurd but it goes against the very nature of the purpose of debate in this place. As we know, debate in the House of Representatives has unfortunately evolved over many years into a situation where there is set piece debate. People effectively know at what time they are likely to speak and can therefore prepare a written speech. They walk into the chamber, give their speech and leave the chamber. That is their contribution to debate. At the end of the entire process we then have a division if that is required. most cases, the question is carried on the voices. To my way of thinking, that is precisely the opposite of what most people in the comsibility munity believe we should be doing. They believe that we should be in this chamber a debating the legislation and we should arrive at a point of view on the basis of the material that is presented to members during and before the debate in things like the explanaance, tory memorandum and other papers and from our own reading and then at the conclusion the debate vote accordingly. We all know that yearsin effect this place is the plaything of the executive. I want to make a couple of observations about the backbench of the government. most Having been a former member of the Liberal Party and a former deputy whip I am quite conscious of the processes of that party and I say to the large number of members of the backbench of the government, 'For God's the sake, do not allow yourselves to be used as cannon fodder for the executive.' There is no doubt in my mind that you are being used as On this particular matter you are being in required to toe the line on executive action the which is completely inconsistent with the of your electors. Your electors expect you to debate this matter to the best of ability, to listen to the debate and to come to a conclusion based on your conin science. How the heck can you do that when there are bills being debated in this House which require your attention, your participation and you to make a determination on as both the representative of your constituents. This is what executive domination of the House is all about-the bludgeoning of debate or the bludgeoning of any particular differences of opinion through the force of numbers. When it comes to the question of whetha er the constituents in your electorates are uppermost, the fact is that the executive could not care less about your constituents unless you happen to be in one of the most marginal seats that may be critical to them winning or the losing at the next election. Considering the enormous victory the coalition had at the last In election, chances are, in many cases, those interests have been discarded because of the large majority. At the end of the day, we all have a responto our constituents. We have to think, listen, read, participate and be able to make contribution that reflects their interests. How can this be so when we are required to participate in a debate on a piece of legislation at the same time that legislation of importpart of the government's program of legislation, is being debated in this chamber. of I have been a member for just over six Mr Rocher-A good member.",13
4,Mr FILING,COMMITTEE,"That is very kind of you. During the first six years I was one of the fervent critics of what I considered to be the very oppressive way in which the previous Labor administration ran this chamber. I considered that, for instance, the use of the guillotine, the use of the gag, the way in which the legislation was presented, the fact that we were presented with copious numbers of amendments at the same time as we were having second reading speeches on the same bill-in other words, we were debating a bill which we had just received enormous numbers of amendments to; how on earth can you effectively participate when you are asked to determine your view about amendments that have been put in front of you only five to 10 minutes earlier-was unacceptable. That, in my view, was not only incompetent and oppressive but also struck at the very purpose of this particular chamber. Now we unfortunately see, with the vast majority that the coalition has, the same traits appearing in the strategies being used by the coalition's tactical leadership. Unfortunately, we are seeing the opportunities for members to be able to make an effective contribution to debates being cut off and gagged on such an enormous number of occasions in the first six months that I worry considerably about the next 2V2 years. Some of the new members may not be aware that in the first period of generally there is not that considerable pressure that may exist in the latter stages of the parliamentary term or, for that matter, a parliamentary year. In the first six months we have seen examples of oppression and the cutting off of opportunities for people to be able to participate in debates. I worry about what is going to happen towards the end of this year and, more importantly, what is going to happen as the government starts to get towards the end of its first term and has still got legislation in the pipeline which it needs to get through in order to complete its program. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and I have suggested on a number of occasions that one of the answers is for the House to sit more frequently. The object of the Main Committee was to keep the House's time relatively free by moving non-contentious legislation, often recurrent legislation, to Main Committee so that those members who wish to make a contribution in that debate can do so and they can represent the interests of their constituents while, at the same time, participate in the main chamber in the knowledge that there is no contentious legislation being debated in the Main Committee. Yesterday we were all gagged from contributing to the particular motion by the motion of the Deputy Leader of the House, the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran)-a member whom I have heard on numerous occasions extol the virtues of parliamentary democracy. He has frequently criticised the previous government's incompetence with their legislative program and on many other occasions has pointed out how the way in which the government managed its business was against the rights of individual members to represent their constituents. Unfortunately, the member for Gippsland has moved down the same path as the previous government. That is very disappointing to me, because I know that he is a good member who wishes to represent his constituents well. But, of course, he too is a victim of the oppression of the executive. He must abide by their decisions. He was sent in last evening to gag the rest of the debate and to prevent us from the parliament having our contribution. This government came to office promising to raise the standards of the House of Representatives. It went to the people saying that the standards had declined in recent years, and that the opportunity for the people to be represented properly had been taken away by the Hawke-Keating administrations and by their use of various tactics and instruments of the House to stop debate and to circumscribe those opportunities. Unfortunately, all those sentiments that were expressed during the election campaign and in the first stages of this parliament have started to dissipate. We are now seeing ourselves back to what the situation was before-I should really say back to business. In fact, to a certain extent, it is worse in that, because the Main Committee was a relatively late phenomenon in the term of the last parliament; the Main Committhe tee had not developed sufficiently for the previous government to be able to use it in the same way . We are now seeing similar traits appearing in the government's management of business now. In conclusion, I urge the government to reconsider the way in which it has moved to have debate on the euthanasia bill of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) referred to the Main Committee and return it to this chamber. I know that there are a number of members who are right now considering to boycott the debate because they consider that the matter has been treated in an offhand manner by being moved to the secondary chamber. I hope that does not take place; I hope that it does not come to that. But I can well understand the frustration of members who believe that, because they are not one of the first few speakers on the list, they are required to go and make their contribution in the secondary chamber and not here in the main chamber of the House of Representatives, which is where they ought to be making their contribution.",14
5,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEE,"I would also like to take the opportunity, which is provided by the government's motion to refer two bills to the Main Committee, to make some comments about yesterday's course of events in the parliament, about the way in which it diminished the standing of the parliament and about the way in which it, in my view, destroyed any sensible chance of a decent debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill and also destroyed the basis of the Main Committee. The long-term implications of the conduct of this House yesterday, led by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the House (Mr MCGauran), is that the basis on which the Main Committee operated has been destroyed. It is my view that the Main Committee will no longer effectively operate in the way in which it has in the past. I take the opportunity to make some comments about the referral of the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee by way of suspension of standing orders. Let the House clearly understand the history of this matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actively, publicly and privately, solicited a private member's bill on this matter. He put his arm around the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and said, privately and publicly, that he would ensure an appropriate debate on euthanasia. What do we now see? Yesterday we saw the Prime Minister, who says that he attaches himself to the dignity of the parliament and who says that he attaches himself to the standing of the parliament in the community, conniving with the Leader of the House to gag debate on two separate occasions to send off the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee and overriding the basis upon which the House established the Main Committee; namely, that one member, one voice of conscience, one voice of dissent, could stop a controversial matter going to the Main Committee. The House should also understand that, through this conduct yesterday-led by the Prime Minister's proxy, the Leader of the House-the trust which this House has had in the Main Committee has been destroyed. I was one who, until today, had taken the view that it was actually appropriate at a particular stage of debate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. Once the main debate had occurred in this chamber and the clash of ideas and policy had been seized, I had the view that it was appropriate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. This was a view not shared by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and he put this view to me. I have to say to the House today that, with hindsight and in light of what occurred yesterday, the member for Curtin was right. It is not appropriate for the appropriation bill to be referred to the Main Committee. As a consequence of the conduct of the House yesterday, the basis upon which the Main Committee has operated to date has been destroyed. I am afraid that what we will see is that the Main Committee will effectively cease to operate. So far as euthanasia and the reference to euthanasia is concerned, what do we have? When you look at the proposed list of bills to be debated in the course of the next couple of weeks, we have the Prime Minister saying to the House that he wants the Flags Amendment Bill to be debated in this House. I support that; I am happy to have a debate about the flag and the Flags Amendment Bill. But if it is all right for the Prime Minister to say to the House and to the community that the flag ought to be debated in the House, what is wrong with life and death? If the flag can be debated in this chamber, why can't life and death also be debated? The conduct of the House yesterday led by the Prime Minister and his proxy, the Leader of the House, diminished the standing of this parliament and destroyed any opportunity that this parliament had, as a matter of individual conscience, to debate the euthanasia bill with dignity. That has been destroyed; community expectations have been destroyed; and, in the process, the basis of the Main Committee, which has operated well for three or four years, has now effectively been destroyed. Members of this House should understand the implications of yesterday's debate. I say to members opposite-in particular, I refer to the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House-that I personally will leave no stone unturned as a matter of conscience, both as to substance and as to procedure, to do my best to ensure that the euthanasia bill is returned to this House. I will conclude by making a couple of points about some of the debate yesterday. In the course of the debate, the Leader of the House made the assertion that he had an agreement with this side in respect of the debate about the euthanasia bill. He also referred to a meeting that was held amongst interested parties. I was at that meeting; the Deputy Leader of the House was at that meeting-the Leader of the House was not. Let me tell the House the facts about that meeting. Firstly, there could be no arrangement with both sides of the House in respect of how the euthanasia bill would be processed because that matter was a matter of individual conscience, both as to substance and procedure. No-one spoke to me about those matters prior to the meeting that was held amongst interested members. At that meeting, I put the view strongly and firmly that this was a matter which was not appropriate to be dealt with by the Main Committee. I made it quite clear-the Deputy Leader of the House confirms this by nodding-that I would utilise the provision in the standing orders to refer it back to this chamber. As a direct consequence of that, we saw the Leader of the House table his motion. There was no attempt by the Leader of the House, or the Deputy Leader of the House or anyone else to. try to bring this matter to a full, appropnate or agreeable conclusion. The Leader of the House dropped a notice of motion in the dead of a Thursday night thinking that he could get away with it, and then proceeded to diminish the parliament, destroy the euthanasia bill and destroy the Main Committee by way of suspension. If the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister were serious in any way about trying to raise the standard and the dignity of this parliament, of trying to raise the manner and the appreciation of members of this House, then the Prime Minister ought to have fulfilled his commitment. He touted for the euthanasia bill. He told the member for Menzies that he would sponsor it; that he would make time available. Instead of making time available, what did he do? Through his proxy and agent, the Leader of the House, he gagged debate in this House on two separate occasions, he diminished this parliament, he destroyed any chance of a sensible parliamentary and community debate on euthanasia, and in the process he has destroyed the Main Commi ttee. He has done great damage to the opportunity that this House had in this parliament to raise its standards, to raise its dignity and to conduct itself in a manner which the community regards as appropriate.",16
6,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE,"As a new member of this House, I have to say that yesterday I saw this House spend 4Y2 hours debating procedural bits and pieces and nothing moved forward. None of the business of this country moved on. That probably cost the Australian nation about $50,000 or so for no outcome. I think it is time we realised, as members of this place, that we have to stop delaying important government business. We have to get on with the job.",17
7,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEE,We have. That's why you should get on with the job. This is a direct result of the bullying tactics of the Leader of the House.,17
8,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE,"We have to get on with the job of solving the problems that you guys created. Let us have no more delay this morning. Let us get on with the business of the country, and let us certainly move forward and get the business of this nation back on track.",17
9,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEE,"Like many members of this parliament, I have received countless letters, phone calls and delegations from citizens in my electorate who are urging me to take a position one way or another on this important legislation. I say to my colleague who has just sat down-the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)-that it was the government's decision to bring this debate on. It was the government's decision to raise the question in this parliament for debate and to have a conscience vote. There is a real difference between a normal debate and a debate in this parliament which is broadcast and where each individual member can take his own position, express his view on behalf of his electorate, or express his personal or private view, and then vote. The importance of that is that, if we are going to carry out this process, we owe it to the people of Australia, our constituents, to let them know precisely what we stand for individually in terms of our responsibilities members of this House. I believe the government erred when it decided to refer this to a committee room where the processes that have been adopted unanimously by this parliament say, 'What goes there are non-controversial matters.' That process was established for what purpose? It was established for the very important purpose that, where parliament was agreed, there was a quick, simple process where members could express themselves if they so chose, and we moved items of legislation. It was never designed or conceived as an exercise to debate an issue of conscience which requires and enables each member in this place to express his own views or the views of his electorate and to take his vote on a non-party basis. That is an important process. For those of us who are members of political parties, for the purposes of this debate we say we are free. The Independents in this House also have rights. How many people are going to read the Hansard about what takes place in a room off this chamber? How many journalists are going to sit there to hear individual contributions? I believe this debate is serious and important enough for it to take place in the parliament-and this House is the parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who brought this on, is now saying that he wishes he had never heard of it. If he wants to get rid of it, let him have the guts to come out and say so and take it off the Notice Paper. But if he does not want to get rid of it, let it be dealt with where it ought to be dealt with-in the people's house, and this is the people's house. Let us not go through this shoddy little backroom performance of saying: 'Now the Prime Minister has changed his mind we will shuffle it off so no-one can hear it or get involved in it. Then we will all come back in here and take our vote.' I have made my decision. I want to participate in this debate, and I want to participate in it in the parliament. If that right is not going to be accorded to me, I believe members of this parliament who respect this institution should say to the government: 'We will not participate in this debate. We will not as vote in this debate. We are not going to be party to your sleazy backroom deals. If you do not want it on, have the guts to pull it out.' Do not go through this shoddy procedure, which is a perversity for an institution representing the territorians. I have spent more hours with the Territory governments than probably any ex-minister of this place or most members of this place. They have made up their minds. They know what they want. In the Northern Territory they are entitled to hear the views of members of this House. If the government does not want to do the right thing and have it in this institution, it is the government's problem. They can deal with it in any way they like. I am not going to waste my time mucking around in a backroom chamber which is not available to the people of Australia or to the people of the Northern Territory with an issue in which people feel as morally involved as any member of this House. They are entitled to hear the views of their members. I say to the government: if you want this debate-you chose to have it-then bring it on where it should be. But do not demean this parliament, do not demean those members who are prepared to exercise their conscience vote and do not deprive the people of Australia, who are deeply concerned about this issue, of their right to hear the views of their members speaking on their behalf and the way those members express their conscience in what is one of the most important debates ever contemplated to come before this House.",18
10,Mr TONY SMITH,COMMITTEE,"I will not trouble the House for very long. One of the dilemmas faced in this whole issue is exactly what happened to me last night. I was in the Main Committee speaking on the Budget Papers-and that is another question, as to whether or not that should have been up there-when this debate took place. Therefore, I did not have an opportunity to express my view in this House as to what I felt about the procedural motion. I have expressed that view by voting the way I did last night. But, stripping this whole issue of politics, my constituents wanted me to vote the way I did because they want to hear this debate on radio. They want to be able to come to the chamber to listen to it if they can travel down and they want to be involved in the process. I want to hear the contributions of every member of this House because that is part of the process on arguably the most sensitive matter to come before this House in 20 years. That is why I voted the way I did. I do not for one moment back off from that. I regret the fact that I did not have the opportunity, because I was in the Main Committee last night, to contribute to the motion. Motion (by Mr MCGauran) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",19
11,Mr MELHAM,ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION,"I move: That this House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to the goals and processes of Aboriginal reconciliation and the importance of reconciliation to the future of the nation; (2) consistent with paragraph (e) of the Preamble to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991, calls on all Australian governments to accept an ongoing national commitment to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage and achieving their aspirations and to agree to set down benchmarks by which to measure the performance of all governments in honouring their commitments; (3) welcomes the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's intention to convene an Australian Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997 on the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum to consider the benefit to the Australian community as a whole of a document or documents of reconciliation between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community; and (4) undertakes to support the work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in the fulfilment of its obligations under the Act.",19
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,19
13,Mr KERR,ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION,"I second the motion. Mr MCGauran-I move that the member be not further heard. Mr Latham-On a point of order: the member was not speaking, so how can that motion be in order? If the government, as is its tactic on these things, wishes to gag all forms of debate perhaps the hapless Deputy Leader of the House could get things right.",19
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL RECONCILIATION,Order! We can go through these processes and the outcome will be the same. I will allow that if that is what the House wishes to do. I was in error in calling for the seconder. The member for Banks now has the opportunity to speak to his motion.,19

24,Mr REITH,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like these interjections recorded in Hansard because they demonstrate that, rather than the opposition coming to us in a sensible way to discuss the management of this particular issue, all we have this morning is just an ambush by the opposition, not because-I hate to say this, but it is a fact-they are concerned to have this matter debated but because they wanted to come in here this morning with a cheap political point scoring exercise.",21
25,Mr MELHAM,NOES,A bit of action. Who voted with Pauline Hanson this morning? Not us. You!,21
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Jenkins)Order! The member for Banks.,21
27,Mr REITH,NOES,"The member for Banks is very excited, because the truth of the matter is that we have hit a rather soft point on this issue. If he wanted time allocated for this particular debate, then the sensible thing would have been to raise the matter with the PAIRS minister concerned, to raise the matter with his Manager of Opposition Business and then to discuss the matter with us in a sensible way.",21
28,Mr MELHAM,NOES,Do you agree with reconciliation?,21
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Banks.,21
30,Mr REITH,NOES,"We do not accept the procedural motion because the government has a legislative program to which we are committed. We have a commitment toMr O'Keefe- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",21
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Burke will resume his seat. He is not in his position.,22
32,Mr REITH,NOES,"We have a commitment to a legislative program, of which the opposition has been well aware. This is simply a tactic to try to disrupt proceedings in the House. These are very significant issues. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addressed them yesterday in question time. If the shadow minister wishes this motion to be further considered, what we are doing now in no way pre-empts a further discussion on this particular issue.",22
33,Mr MELHAM,NOES,When?,22
34,Mr REITH,NOES,"I simply say to the shadow minister: rather than embarking on a political point scoring exercise, he ought to do the right thing by the substance of this issue and take the matter up with the minister. He ought to take it up with the Manager of Opposition Business, and there could then be a discussion about it.",22
35,Mr MELHAM,NOES,I learned from you. You taught me.,22
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! That is enough from the honourable member for Banks.,22
37,Mr REITH,NOES,"The government will not have its legislative program disrupted by the opposition. If they were genuine about the issue, quite frankly they would have taken up the matter with us directly rather than simply try to run an ambush in the House this morning. I am afraid that this is typical of the way Anthony, L. 1. in which the House is managed by the oppositionMr MCGauran-Mismanaged.",22
38,Mr REITH,NOES,"Mismanaged is a very generous description of the absolute chaos and confusion on the other side. The Manager of Opposition Business has absolutely no authority over his own side. You have the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) basically running the show, and he cannot keep an agreement. We have already had a series of examples of that. It has become basically impossihle to have any understanding with the OppositIOn about processes in the House, because this ambitious member is unable to control the member for Watson.",22

NA (FAMIL Y TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Cognate bill: FAMILY (TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 October, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that only a limited proportion of family types receive the full benefits of the so-called Family Tax Initiative; (2) expresses its concerns that other Budget measures leave the average Australian family $700 per annum worse off; (3) notes with concem that the Government is only returning to PA YE taxpayers a small NOES proportion of bracket creep/fiscal drag revenue collections via this Bill; and (4) expresses its concern that this and other Budget-related measures have established very high Effective Marginal Tax Rates for nonworking parents returning to the workforce"".",22
40,Mr TONY SMITH,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I support the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill and I oppose the amendment. I listened for some time to the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), on this matter. Although she was speaking to the amendment-the debate is fairly wide ranging-there are a couple of points I should make about her speech.Firstly, in relation to this measure and child-care issues generally what the government is really on about is the question of choice. She may PAIRS not be aware of it, but a lot of women out there would prefer not to work. They would prefer to have quality time with their children and not to have to make arrangements to place those children in child care. I am reminded of my own sister, a highly qualified woman who had been working in an executive position in the education system. She has a young child of two and has had a tremendous amount of anguish about childcare arrangements. It has ended up recently with her taking a year off work without pay so that she can be with her son. That has created a tremendous economic consequence because she is married to a painter in the railways. As you can imagine, he is on a very basic wage. She has exercised that choice, but it has not been an easy choice. The problems she has encountered with child care-her son has been regularly sick because of his exposure to other children-forced her to make that very difficult choice. There are obviously women who exercise the choice the other way. That really is what the issue is about: it is about the exercise of choice. In my submission, government legislation on this matter is providing choice for families and giving them the chance to be brought in from the cold when, for so long, they have been left out in the cold. The bill will provide significant tax relief for approximately two million low and middle income families. This delivers on a promise made during the election campaign. In effect, it will give an eligible parent tax advantages arising out of a lifting of the tax free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child. These measures are important. Very often we hear from the other side that this is not a major measure by any means and that it will really do very little, and then arguments are put about the downside of other measures in order to try to detract from the key measure. But I can tell you, from discussions that I have had with some of my constituents, that this is a very welcome measure. We must always be mindful that assistance to families in these circumstances-the low income family and particularly the family with a child under the age of five years of age-provides real benefits for them. What has really surprised the opposition in this whole debate is that there is a government out there that is interested in the low to middle income families-the families that have been left out in the cold by decision making over a number of years by the previous government. Where a family has one breadwinner and has at least one child under the age of five, there is a further increase in the tax free threshold of $2,500. In effect, for a one income family with two children, one of whom is under five, this will deliver an extra $34 per fortnight. Recently I had a family visit me and I explained this measure to them. They were quite delighted that this small amount of extra money would provide much needed assistance to them in their week to week existence. Those on lower incomes with children really do struggle in today's society to keep that extra advantage for their children, that extra little bit, which may well provide a weekend camping trip away with the kidsjust some little extra thing. This measure will assist their own family budget and will benefit families in that situation. The initiative will be delivered through the PA YE system, the provisional tax system, or a claim can be made on assessment. For low income families, equivalent fortnightly cash assistance, to be called the family tax payment, will be available as an alternative. Eligible families will receive assistance of around $7.70 per fortnight for each eligible child. In addition to this, single income families with young children will receive a further $19.20 per fortnight. For example, a single income family with two children, one under five, can have tax reduced by about $34.60 a fortnight. These are helpful and significant benefits. It is a recognition by the government that people in this situation who have been crying out and who have had their cries unheeded for a considerable period are now being listened to by government. In particular, this government is delivering on a major package which will cost about $1 billion. If the family is also claiming the full rate of the new incentives for private health insurance, available from 1 July 1997, the total assistance in the package will be more than $50 per fortnight-a significant advantage. It is my view that over the previous 13 years the Labor Party increasingly moved away from its own constituency. This measure indicates that the party that really is looking after that constituency much more than the Labor Party ever did is the coalition. The constituency I refer to is frequently the bluecollar constituency and those on low to middle incomes who at the last election voted with their feet because of the way they felt the Paul Keating government had treated them. In my own electorate of Dickson, families felt that the previous government were prepared to nod their heads but pay mere lip-service to their needs. It is all very well, as we heard a lot in the last 12 months or so from the previous government, to say, 'We will be a government that listens,' but it is no good listening if you do not act. It is no good nodding your head and saying, 'Yes, we're listening to you,' and then go off in another direction. This particular measure involved not only listening but also developing a policy and fulfilling that policy in our first budget in difficult economic circumstances--circumstances where difficult decisions had to be taken in the total budgetary context. I am particularly encouraged at the support given to single income families. I emphasise that so much of that group of people has been neglected over the years. That neglect has ultimately led to the other partner of the family going out and seeking to get work. That is done often at a social cost. We have recently heard of the cost that is occasioned in social terms and the anguish that is occasioned to families who have to, as a matter of necessity, go out and earn income in order to put bread on the table, keep the mortgage in shape and also have a reasonable standard of living for their families. I do not think people choose to make those arrangements deliberately because somehow or other there is a greater lure in going out and earning income than being at home and looking after children. It is a matter of necessity in so many cases. The government is trying in this measure-and, in my view, rightly-to recognise that there are families that have to do that, that there are families that would prefer not to do that and that this provides some mechanism for choice. That is what it is all about. Contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga said, the government is not about trying to railroad women back into the home. It is not about trying to railroad people into a single income situation; it is about providing choice and the sorts of circumstances where women-and men, for that matter--<:an avail themselves of full-time and part-time work so that they can balance the responsibilities of children. If the government can facilitate and be a reagent in this process so that the glue of the social structure can be workable in the total context, then in my view it is doing the right thing. Again, contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, it is not a question of some sort of social agenda of trying to force women out of the work force back into the homes in some antediluvian drive to achieve some rather odd social end. As I have said, many people who have been forced to go out and work to keep their families have done so as a result of economic necessity-in fact I would suggest that most people have done it for that reason. I do not think many of them like doing it but they have been forced to. The measures in these bills recognise that there are people out there who are prepared to stay at home and look after their children. It must be recognised that that in itself provides enormous benefits to the community. One of the things you learn a lot about as a new member-and I am grateful for that-is the way the community organisations function. As someone who has always been in full-time work and not terribly in touch with a lot of the community organisations prior to being a candidate and a member I often got the feeling that everything was functioning quite well and there was an army of people out there who were prepared to do those community and sometimes very thankless jobs. In reality, when you get close to the situation, you realise that organisations such as Meals on Wheels and even the local tucks hop are frequently staffed by women who have exercised that choice to stay home and look after their children and at the same time provide a real service to the community. That has to be good in an overall social context. Those who are in work sometimes may have to be reminded that that is happening and that the women-and sometimes men-who are doing this voluntary, community work and exercising a choice to stay at home but also carry the load, as it were, in the local tuckshop, Meals on Wheels, Lifeline centre and so forth are helping the community overall and must not be forgotten. In my view, these measures recognise that these social factors are operating. That is what they are all about really: a much broader view of the social fabric. These measures look at the social fabric far more broadly rather than take the somewhat narrow-minded view that somehow or other the government has an agenda that is directing women to move back into the homes for some ideological reason that is never really spelt out. It is regrettable, in my view, to portray the measures in that fashion. These measures will be of significant benefit, and I am particularly delighted with the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996. It does deliver on the government's promises in this matter. It takes up a promise that was made prior to the election campaign. It fulfils and delivers that promise and it will provide real benefits for families in need. I support these bills.",23
41,Mr FILING,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"In the first instance I commend the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) who has already shown himself to be a person who is prepared to represent his constituents to the limit, that is, he is prepared to take the significant step of crossing the floor and voting on his conscience on a matter that he believes is important to his constituents. If his constituents are going to be represented in that way, then long may he remain their member. They will be getting the best value from our representative system of democracy when their member is prepared to represent their interests ahead of what was last night, for instance, mere party line bludgeoning of the backbench. His comments about government listening are also commendable because, at the end of the day, we know only too well that the government, unfortunately, because it is busy with so much in its day-today routine, tends not to listen and becomes immune to the voices and the noises around it. In many instances it becomes immune to even its own government members of parliament who then find themselves in the difficult position of trying to influence ministers and those responsible for decisions from the somewhat inferior position of being required to support a decision, no matter what they or their constituents might feel about it. These pieces of legislation are commendable and reflect the commitment given by the coalition, by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the pre-election scenario to be family oriented. In other words, this was the profamily component of the coalition's election manifesto. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, and I have debated for a long time how this type of initiative can be delivered. I know that in the past he had some strong views of his own about the way in which one can deliver family assistance-meaning assistance for families to be able to remain together, to perform all of their functions without being put under unnecessary financial pressures. Any family raising children is under financial pressure, even families who are on relatively high incomes. The parliamentary secretary in the past was responsible for proposing a number of initiatives as part of a family payment. I commend him for that because I know that he sincerely views family quite policy as critical to any government's program of legislation. I share his view. I think that those members of the government who view family policy as critical probably were the members responsible for attracting the most support for the government because, at the end of the day, the forgotten people of the Australian electorate were families raising children. When we think about the predicament facing our nation, the fact that we have zero population growth at the moment which will have a long-term effect on our nation's future, then one has to value very highly initiatives that support the very important function of families raising children who will obviously participate fully in our community. At the coalition policy launch it was stated that one of the greatest challenges of modem family life is to balance effectively work commitments and goals with family responsibilities and aspirations, that any credible family policy at a government level must be directed at helping families to achieve that balance, and that a coalition government would have this objective as one of its key priorities. I thought that was one of the most attractive features of the government's election manifesto. It was certainly one of the reasons why I, as an Independent, strongly supported the election of a coalition government. But at the same time. I was conscious of the fact that there were commitments made during the election campaign that had to be kept because they were the commitments that attracted people to vote for the coalition. These were the things that people assumed, once elected, that the government would deliver. I will return to some of these later in my speech. There is no doubt in my mind that any responsible government should have a profamily bias in its policy making. In the coalition ranks is a group known as the Lyons Forum, a group of members who have taken it upon themselves to promote the concept family bias in policy making. In other words, whatever consequences legislation may have on the family unit are used as a determinant of whether or not legislation should be ported. I think that is an important principle. My electorate is a family electorate. The vast majority of my constituents are families with children. I suppose we are the archetypal outer suburban, mortgage belt electorate with families raising children. At the previous census we had the highest concentration of fiveto 15-year-olds; we await with interest the results of the most recent census. Amongst other characteristics, we have very high concentrations of houses numbers of bedrooms. Obviously this reflects the fact that families have larger numbers children. Consequently bills of this sort critical to my constituents. I support the under these circumstances because I am advocate of pro-family policy as part of the government's program. These two bills should provide a boost to almost two million Australian families. These two million families represent a large part the future of this nation. They are an ment. The relief offered under these bills should be seen as an investment in our future. I know that the parliamentary secretary shares my views that these types of initiatives will repay themselves in years to come as we will see a more stable and caring community that has, as one of its core values, a greater interTax est in the future of our children. The family tax initiative has been applauded as the centrepiece of the coalition's approach to families, and I am comforted by the spirit of this initiative as it is consistent coalition's pre-election policies. However, I have a few concerns I wish to raise about the methods of implementation of these initiatives. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to explore those in the remainder of my speech. Both before and during the election camstates: paign, the coalition repeatedly indicated its intention to simplify the Australian taxation system. If there is nothing else this governunderstand ment achieves, that would have to be one of tions. its major objectives. I think every person, even people who do not pay income tax at all, of would agree that the Australian taxation system is one of the most complicated, illogical systems around. It is absolutely mindboggling. Anybody who is a friend or acsupquaintance of a tax accountant would be aware, no doubt from verbatim examples given by their friend or acquaintance, that taxation legislation and consequent decisions, opinions and rulings comprise thousands of pages of text. In fact, in order to accommodate all the material relating to income taxand for that matter all taxes: wholesale, sales tax and the like-you would need several shelves to store them, and they would be groaning under the weight of all those taxwith large ation tomes and rulings. With the family tax initiative, unfortunately of we will see a further complication of the are taxation system. This is something which bills alarms me. Under the circumstances, it is an something I would have thought we should have tried to avoid. I know that the coalition means well in this instance but, unfortunately, as with any changes, we have found that it in fact compounds the complicated nature of our of taxation system. We know that the Tax investPack-which we get to help us with the compilation of our income tax returns, which is supposed to be a simplified guide, not a complicated publication-requires a fair amount of reading. We all know in our busy daily lives that it is difficult to devote a great deal of time to sitting down and reading the Pack, so many people use the services of tax accountants. Again that means further expense. It creates opportunities for taxation accountants but, at the end of the day, it is a further expense or a further burden for families-and also for employers, whom I shall with the mention shortly. The means of determining compliance and eligibility for individual taxpayers will be overly burdensome. For example, the explanatory memorandum for the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill In order to establish their Family Tax Assistance (FT A) entitlement, Taxpayers will be required to additional rules and do new calculaTaxpayers with shared custody of children will have to pro-rating calculations to determine the amount of benefit that they can claim. Many taxpayers will also be required to make agreements with their spouses, which will have to be recorded and preserved according to certain rules. Any member who has had experience in their electorate office with family law and all of the consequent undertakings, decisions, legal moves, et cetera would understand that there are a whole plethora of complicating factors in that explanation. The explanatory memorandum states: Many taxpayers will also be required to make agreements with their spouses, which will have to be recorded and preserved according to certain rules. This is a very interesting concept. It almost smacks of prenuptial agreements. I consider that to be a dangerous area for a government to enter into. I caution the government in matter. That worries me considerably. Backbench members, front-bench members and the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), would know that in the future when this particular aspect of the legislation to be implemented an army of people will be approaching our offices for advice and guidpeople ance as to what this means, how it will be interpreted and how it reflects on their other obligations such as their social security taxation obligations. We are going to require the army of people in the professional serlives-yet vices area to make themselves more familiar with this particular concept. That is something that needs to be explained more by the Treasin urer (Mr Costello) before this legislation implemented. This concerns me because I where have strong pro-family interests. There will be a requirement for additional information to be included in the Tax Pack. Many people already find this difficult digest and understand, let alone read. We asking for additional material to be included in the Tax Pack. That is something am very concerned about. I am concerned that the people who are targeted by these initiatives tives are the lower income earners and PAYE taxpayers. These are the people in our country who can least afford to suffer further complithis cations in our taxation regime and cope with the cost of compliance and employing a tax agent to prepare their annual returns. I think in this country we are coming very quickly to the opposite of what ought to be the casethat is, a situation where just about everybody will require the services of a taxation agent. In my view, we should be working towards making it almost unnecessary to employ the services of a taxation agent. That may make me very unpopular amongst accountant organisations and professional bodies. I believe that, at the end of the day, we should be able to make some significant reforms. I am an advocate of taxation reform, in particular in the sales tax area. I will digress for a moment. Recent discussions on taxation are highly commendable. The more taxation debate there is in our community the better. It has certainly overthis come the legacy of the 1993 election campaign where, unfortunately, thanks to Labor's propensity to attack even the most sensible of taxation reforms, we ended up with a situation in which the vast majority of the community see tax reform as a bogey instead of somecomes thing that will help them. If we could introduce a system where most did not even have to file a tax return, imagine the cost savings for the community. It is extraordinary that philosophically we are and anti-tax-that is, we subscribe to smaller government and less interference in our daily we are introducing measures that complicate taxation even further. All I can say is that this is contrary to the objectives stated the coalition's program and contrary to my is philosophy. If we could have a situation people did not have to file a tax return, the better things would be. We would save costs as a consequence. I believe the coalition has a clear mandate to simplify the Australian to taxation system. It should be held to that are mandate. I take this opportunity to remind them of this obligation, which I am sure the which I Australian people remember. My concerns do not end here. These initiaact to further complicate the operation of small businesses in this country. Small business has waited for the opportunity for government to improve its competitiveness and to relieve it of some of the unnecessary administrative and compliance burdens for its operations. I commend the government for the fine initiatives it has undertaken in support of small business in the recent budget. Unfortunately, I cannot support the implementation of these bills under these circumstances. They will further impose administrative burdens on businesses. Yesterday, for instance, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  difficult to answer a fairly simple question about some changes in government policy that impose more red tape on businesses. The government promised that it would cut red tape for small business by 50 per cent. Within six months we have seen contradictions in the coalition's objectives. The explanatory memorandum states; FfA will impact on employers, by requiring them to adjust their payroll systems to employees who reduce their tax instalment deductions for Ff A. Salary and wage earners will be able to claim by way of reduced tax instalment deductions. This will mean completing new employment declarations before 1 January 1997, and thereafter whenever taxpayer's entitlements change. Additional information will be required to be provided in employment declarations to accommodate the FfA. Employers will handle a greater number of employment declarations, as taxpayers vary their tax instalments, in line with their changing Ff A entitlements. Where is the minister for small business? Why isn'the arguing against this type of change? He is the guy who is responsible for implementing the coalition's promise that it was going to reduce by 50 per cent red tape and compliance on small business, yet here we are exploring legislation that is in fact going to do the reverse. When you ask the minister questions in this place about the prospects for small business, unfortunately, he fails to answer in detail. This is something that has to be remedied. Small business around the country is anticipating changes that will facilitate greater competitiveness and will lift off these burdensome compliance requirements. I am concerned that these requirements placed upon small business by the FfA will be onerous and unnecessary. If you talk to small businesses in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I bet you would encounter people who would tell you over and over again that the paperwork required of a small business operator is almost extortionate in its scope. These days small business operators are required to almost have a degree in business administration to the extent that they would be administering some sort of gigantic corporation when in fact we are talking about mostly single or two people operations. Yet they are being required more and more to add to this burden of completing paperwork, form filling or acting as a subagency of the taxation department, something which they did not choose but something for which they are responsible. They are responsible in such substantial ways that, if they neglect their duties or their responsibilities, they place take account of themselves in jeopardy. This is why, in implementing the family tax initiatives, I am greatly concerned that we are Ff A adding to the burden of the very constituency that will provide employment in this country-precisely the employment for the children of these families that we are trying to help. So, for God's sake, let us try to make this legislation simpler and easier to implement. It is just not good enough to state policies without any understanding of and taking responsibility for their actual effects. I support the family tax initiatives. They are long overdue. But I urge the government to examine the consequences of introducing these further onerous requirements, particularlyon small business and, of course, on the families themselves.",26
42,Mr ZAMMIT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Lowe) (11.17 a.m.)Before I go into the main thrust of what I would like to say in regard to these family tax initiative bills, I would like to draw to the attention of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) the fact that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)-as he has made specific reference to the minister for small business-has repeatedly stated in this chamber and in public and he has issued press releases advising that he has established a high level task force to look at the question of regulation. From what I understand, the regulation review task force will be bringing down its findings some time next month.",29
43,Mr FILING,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Perhaps it ought to look at this piece of legislation first. This is new legislation.,30
44,Mr ZAMMIT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"It will be included as part of the overall structure and the onerous pressures that have been placed on small business. It is this government, the coalition government, that is looking at the whole issue of red tape. I think it is certainly well needed. Few issues in the lead-up to the election on 2 March were as high on the list of concerns of the community in general and of the people in my electorate than the issue of tax relief for families, and especially for families with young children. These cognate bills before the House, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996, deliver on the coalition's promise in each and every aspect effective from 1 January 1997. It will produce a reduction in the tax burden on families with children and will provide additional tax assistance for a parent at home with young children. This important initiative will benefit some two million families to the tune of more than $1 billion in a full year-$l ,000 million. The family tax initiative is broken up into two parts: parts A and B. In part A of the initiative, tax at the rate of 20c in the dollar will be saved by eligible families who, as a result, will receive in their disposable income the equivalent of an increase of $200 per annum for each dependent child. As part of the emphasis on a tough but fair budget, this initiative will be limited to families with a combined taxable income of less than $70,000 per annum, with an increase of $3,000 for each child after the first child. In part B of the initiative, the additional assistance is targeted towards single income families, and lone parents with young children are not forgotten. As with part A, the benefits will be restricted to those with a taxable income of less than $65,000. This initiative will assist eligible families in the vicinity of $7.70 per fortnight for each eligible child, and single income families with young children will receive an additional $19.20 per fortnight. Also effective from 1 July 1997, a family claiming the full rate of the new initiatives for private health insurance will also have a tax reduction in the vicinity of $34.60 per fortnight; that is, those families who are single income families with two children-and one under the age of five-can expect to receive financial assistance of more than $50 a fortnight. In regard to parts A and B, this assistance can be accessed through the provisional tax system or through the pay-as-you-earn tax system. Low income families, through the family tax payment, will also have the alternative of fortnightly cash payments through the Department of Social Security. I commend to my constituents the explanatory booklet issued by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) entitled Income Tax Rates (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996, copies of which will be made available from my electorate office. I conclude my remarks by reiterating my strongest possible support for these bills. These initiatives, which provide at long last some financial assistance to long-suffering families of Australia, are long overdue. The families of Australia are the cornerstone of our society, and recognition of that fact is demonstrated by the government's initiative as contained in these bills-another Labor injustice put right by the Howard coalition government.",30
45,Mrs JOHNSTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Canning) (11.22 a.m.}-I rise today to support the family tax initiative announced in the first Howard government budget. These initiatives will be of particular benefit to lower and middle income families, sole parents and single income families. Overall, almost two million Australian families with children will benefit from significant tax rebates as of 1 January 1997. I especially welcome this budget measure because it not only meets a major election promise made by the coalition prior to the 1996 election but also gives much needed extra disposable income to families. History shows that the family has been the core unit of most stable societies. For most of us, there is no stronger bond than the love we have for our families. Living with our family gives us our first experience of interpersonal relationships. It is from the family, particularly through the interaction we have with parents, siblings and others in our family group, that we are encouraged to communicate. Families teach us about responsibility, about care. The family is a microcosm of society. It is the respect we feel for our parents and grandparents that engenders respect for others, be they friends, neighbours, workmates or people we deal with in day-today life. From families we learn to have respect for those institutions that serve us and our society in general. Despite the known importance of families, under Labor these same families became Australia's forgotten folk. They were burnt by the brunt of Labor's mistakes for the past decade, thus joining the ever swelling ranks of the new poor. Practically every welfare group in Australia is able to relate horror stories about the queues of ordinary families who have been forced to swallow their pride and line up to accept charity thanks to Labor's mismanagement. There are some terrible tales of parents who, due to the mounting rise in the cost of living caused by the hike in interest rates during Labor's term in office, were unable to feed their children. Indeed, it was not unusual to hear of charities running out of food and blankets due to excess demand. Under Labor, families became second-class citizens. While the previous government pandered to every crackpot, yet politically correct fringe group, they forgot about or indeed ignored the plight of everyday men, women and children. We have all heard Labor's greatest lie of all that, 'By 1990 no Australian child will live in poverty.' Yet by March 1996, when the people of Australia decided that enough was enough and voted the Labor Party out of government, many Australian children still lived in poverty. When I speak of poverty, I not only refer to people's lack of access to disposable income but also speak about the poverty of the style of leadership and good common sense displayed by the government of that time. It was a government that was bereft of ideas, that had lost the plot, that had become not only removed from but positively dismissive of the people's needs. History records that earlier this year Australians turned to the coalition in their droves, and we have heard their plea. This government's aim is to raise people out of the poverty traps into which they have fallen due to no fault of their own. It is our duty to give people back their self-respect, to reward the battler who has kept going through the toughest of times and to assist those who have struggled through 13 tough years always toiling to pay their monthly bills to help their families survive. ABS figures show that people are now working longer hours just to make ends meet. May 1983 labour figures show the average person worked 38.9 hours per week. By May 1996 the average person was working 42.4 hours per week. Over the past decade many mothers have been forced to go back to work in order to clothe their kids. Before the election very few families could afford to survive on just one income. As a mother who works, I obviously support a woman's right to enjoy a career should that be her choice. But I do not believe that women who would prefer to stay at home to raise their family should be forced to return to work to take any job no matter what in order to be able to purchase the basic necessities of life. Alan Tapper in his book The Family in the Welfare State argues: Many women who choose to stay at home with their children feel that their choice is belittled and neglected. Underlying this feeling appears to be a major decline in the social status of family life and the work done by parents to sustain families and marriages. How often have we heard women who stay at home providing secure and loving home environments when asked what they do simply reply, 'I am just a housewife'? How wrong this is. The woman who decides to stay at home, if assessed in commercial values for the services provided by her, would probably attract a handsome remuneration. Her role within that context is a very valuable contribution. It is the duty of government to care for the public interest. That pendulum of public interest has now swung back to highlight the plight of families. Our family tax initiative gives something back to mainstream Australia. We are looking after those decent hard working men and women for whom life is a daily struggle. For some, the grind of daily life becomes just too much. As hard earned wages pay for less and less, tensions within marriages and relationships grow and parents separate. A sad outcome of this is that children then suffer the distress of losing regular daily contact with the other non-custodial parent. In addition, our communities inherit the problem brought about by dividing up a wage that was barely enough to support one family grouping into one which now needs to support two quite distinct households. A family that was scratching to survive then breaks down due to the hopelessness of the battle to cope. Such family break-ups very often cause bad feelings and despair. That once cohesive family unit now becomes a social security statistic and a further drain on society as it descends into the pit of poverty. The scenario I have just described is not unusual. The last decade has seen divorce on the increase, with the consequence that families are tom apart. The family tax initiative offers relief to most families, particularly families that have very young children. Most members of this House have children, so we know first-hand just how expensive it can be to clothe rapidly growing kids. Even when you can convince your children that they do not need the latest in vogue fashion accessory-and that is sometimes harder than negotiating a Middle East peace agreement-clothing children still costs a fortune. If necessary, mum and dad will always go without, but we should not have to deprive our children of their needs. Schedule 2 of the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 introduces the new family tax payment, which we announced as a pre-election promise. Part A provides for an increase in the tax free threshold for one parent of $1,000 each child. This translates to an increase in disposable income of $7.70 per child per fortnight. Part B directs additional assistance to single income families, including lone parents, with at least one child under the age of five. Part B will provide an additional increase in the tax free threshold for one parent of $2,500 and will be subject to two income tests. Let me give the House an example of how this bill will benefit a typical family in my electorate of Canning. A couple has two children, one aged under five. One parent earns 35,000 per annum and is the family's sole income earner. Under the family tax package, the parents will receive a $900 tax cut, the equivalent of $34.60 per fortnight. If this family chooses to take out private health insurance, then they will be entitled to up to $450 per year to help pay the premiums. This then amounts to an overall annual benefit of $1,359, or an extra $51.90 per fortnight. These changes are eminently fair. They let the people of middle Australia know that we are concerned about them. To the people for whom daily life is a struggle just to balance their family budget and to make it go far enough, these increases in disposable income will allow some much needed breathing space. These initiatives permit families the opportunity to plan. They go to those families who need them most and will allow them to pay for extras such as school camps, clothes, that extra pair of shoes, an outing to MCDonald's and other special family outings-all those little extras which usually fall outside the scope of a regular budget. You can imagine what will now happen. As families begin to be able to spend more, they will stimulate their local economy and by so doing they will indirectly be instrumental in providing more job opportunities for people. Importantly, the effect of the proposed changes to the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill will be to improve people's everyday life. This bill will provide a better choice. Women who wish to work can do so. But it will also enhance opportunities for those women who would prefer to fulfil their dream to care for their family in an extra special way, to be there waiting when the kids come home from school. Because many more children will now have a parent at home we will probably see a reduction of those juvenile pursuits like vandalism, truancy and petty theft that are often caused by boredom or a child's perception that parents are not really interested in them because their parents are never at home when their presence is most needed. The family is the best welfare institution that we have. The family provides the strongest bond in our society. Care, compassion and concern are all an integral part of family life. Under Labor many people were forced to become dependent on the state to provide for their needs. In contrast, this government encourages a spirit of individualism and recognises the need to strengthen the family unit. We believe that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society. This bill delivers on that promise. This bill is good for the family and, most importantly, this bill will make Australia a far better place to live.",30
46,Mr LEO MCLEAY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"These family tax initiative bills first saw the light of day in the coalition's policy launch when, prior to the election, the coalition saw this as a method of winning votes in the election. According to them at the time, it was supposed to give low and middle income families a $25 boost to their income. The reality behind the opposition's thoughts on this bill, as mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), in her contribution, is that this is really one of the legs of the coalition's attempt to get women out of the work force. It is an unstated objective of this bill, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker in her speech, that more families will now be at home. In the main, we know that from the coalition's point of view having a family member at home does not mean having the bloke at home; it means having the woman at home. That is what they have always wanted. It goes back to the picket fences launch of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when Leader of the Opposition some years ago and it is the thread that runs through most of their policy arrangements. If you look at the cuts that the government has made in this budget, you will see it is obvious that the government wants to get women back in the home and out of the work force. The workplace relations bill will have the greatest effect on women in the work force. This family tax initiative is one of a number of legs of the opposition's policy of getting women out of the work force and back into the home. The cuts that the government has made in the budget leave what this family tax initiative gives to people pretty much in the dark. When we take into account the cuts to the operational subsidies for child-care centres, the increases in HECS fees, the up-front charges for nursing homes and the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program, if families are only getting another $25 to help them finance that, their family budgets will be very short at the end of the fortnight. I think the $25 so-called boost for low income families under the family tax initiative will now be used by those families to save up to get dental repairs done which they were previously getting done under the Commonwealth dental program. The abolition of the Commonwealth dental program has affected half a million low income Australians, many of them low income families. They were getting their dental care for free. What are they getting from the government now? They are getting $25, if they are lucky, to get the dentist to repair their teeth. The $25-and it is a big 'if as to whether they will get the $25-might be spent trying to cover those extra costs of child care that were introduced in this budget. The government gives with one hand and takes away with the other. The $25 will probably just about cover the extra $25 that a family will have to find to put a child under three into a long day care centre, because the government has taken away the subsidy for long day care centres. It is pretty bad luck for that family. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) refers in the explanatory memorandum to the bill to 'Alison's family'. Usually, when governments come up with explanatory memorandums, they try to look for the people who will do best out of the proposal. Alison, according to the Treasurer in the explanatory memorandum, is a single parent earning $70,000 a year and has three kids. Honourable members should look at that. That is what it says in the explanatory memorandum. One of the government members who will speak after me will try to tell me that is not so. But the explanatory memorandum says that Alison earns $70,000 a year, has three kids and will do all right out of this. I say: good luck to Alison. Then again someone who is on $70,000 a year is probably doing all right themselves. I would have thought the government would have found a better example of people who are helped by this. Maybe they should not have picked as an example someone earning $70,000. Even in the case of the person earning $70,000, if they have a couple of kids, the $25 won't do them much good because they have to find more money for the other children. How is that $25 going to cover the extra $66 that a family on $30,000 will have to find if they need child care for up to 55 hours a week? That is what will happen to a lot of factory workers. If they need child care for up to 55 hours a week, they have got three children and, unlike Alison, they are not earning $70,000, they are only earning $30,000, the $25 will not help them very much at all. How is the $25 going to help migrant families such as the ones in my electorate who have been writing to me? They say they desperately want to learn English so that they have a chance to get a job. I calculate that it will take them only about four years of saving their $25 a week, which is the boost they will get out of this tax initiative, so that they can pay the $5,500 that the government is now charging them for an English language course. I suppose this is really being helpful to that family! Then, of course, there is the extra increase in the pharmaceutical benefits charges that families will have to pay. How will the extra $25 a week help them? It will not help them very much either because they have to pay an extra $2.60 for a script. That soon adds up if your children are sick. Pensioners will be hit harder. They will have to pay an extra 50c without any compensating increase in their pension. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, the boost that the government talks about in this family tax initiative that they will be giving to Australian families will be far outweighed by the extra costs forced on families by this budget. One wonders how the government can say they are really helping families. What they are doing is helping themselves to what the families have got in their pocket. The government is helping themselves to any of the savings that these families have. They are going to have to pay more for their education. There will be cuts to tertiary education by the year 2000, which means there will be a 15 per cent funding cut to universities. Those families will have to pay more for their kids to go to universities. Changes to HECS mean that students in their late twenties will be deemed to be financially dependent on their parents. If you are doing a long course, as some students are, you will be there even longer. I do not know how this $25 is going to help a family that is trying to feed a 23 year old. They would eat $25 worth of food at one sitting, let alone having to clothe them. Mr Abbott-Speak for yourself, Leo. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-If they have a mouth as big as that of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the member for Warringah, who is at the table and who started to interject, they will probably eat even more. I think the government, in giving people this $25, is really giving people far less than they have taken out of their pocket with the budget. I do not see how they can come in here and have any good conscience on this. It has been estimated by a number of commentators that this initiative will benefit only 13 per cent of Australian families. So it is terribly generous, isn't it? In the Treasurer's second reading speech he says: Some 900,000 families will receive an immediate boost to their disposable income through this measure. We are going to find that a few tens of thousands will get the $25 and a couple of hundred thousand will get a dollar each. People do not really thank you for giving them a dollar or two when a couple of hundred or two-in some instances a few thousand-is taken away. One of the things that families will have to worry about in the next few years is how they will find the money to help their parents or grandparents meet the costs of the up-front charge the government has put on them for nursing home care. That is an attack not just on older people but upon the people who, the government says, will benefit from this initiative. In this initiative they are going to give the young people, if they are lucky, $25 but what they are saying to their parents or grandparents who have to go into a nursing home is, 'You had better find $26,000.' I suppose that is pretty generous in their view-'We will give you $25 a week but you had better go and find $26,000 so that granny or grandpa can go into a nursing home, without having to sell granny's house from underneath her.' I think the government probably thinks that is generous. Any normal thinking person would probably think that was pretty ungenerous. These old people are the ones who survived the Depression and they fought for Australia during the Second World War. Even TPls are going to have to pay to get into nursing homes and their kids and grandkids are going to have to think about how they are going to find this money. What is the government's response? It is, 'If you are lucky, we will give you $25 a week.' Just so the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), who will be speaking in the debate after me, knows what she is looking for, as she is madly going through the explanatory memorandum, let me say that on page 22 of the explanatory memorandum it tells us about poor old Alison. It says: Alison had 3 dependent children. In 1997-98, her children are aged 2, 4 and 8. Alison, a sole parent for the year, had a taxable income for the year of $70,000. Poor old Alison; she is only getting $70,000, so Alison is someone the government definitely ought to help before all the other people it has thrown on the scrap heap. Alison is going to make some money out of this program, with an income of $70,000. I am reminded of the old Salvation Army adage that we are here to help the needy, not the greedy. I would think when we look at the people the government is punishing in this budget, when we look at what is happening to low income earners and at what is going to happen to the unemployed and to migrants, to come in and say, 'We will give families $25,' is mean to start with. When you say to low income families, 'We are going to look after families which earn $70,000 as well,' low income families might just think that is a bit mean. The people who live out in the electorate of Lindsay in western Sydney might think that is really pretty mean because what this government has done in this budget is make a massive attack on families. It does not matter how the member for MCEwen wants to dress this up; this budget has hurt Australian families. To tum around and say , 'We are going to help Australian families by giving them $25 a week extra, if they are lucky,' is not really generous at all. As I said at the beginning of my contribution, this family tax initiative saw its genesis in the coalition's policy launch. It was launched with great fanfare by the Prime Minister, who talked about what they were going to do if the coalition won; they were going to do something for families. Members might remember-and the voters in the electorate of Lindsay might remember-that that was also the policy launch where the Prime Minister said he was not going to change any policies of the Labor government of the time and that we could trust John Howard as Prime Minister because when John Howard became Prime Minister there were going to be all those Labor policies for families-and the coalition would give a little bit more. But in the budget we have seen that they are not going to give families anything. We have seen the effect on families who might get some of this $25 a week, families who live out in western Sydney and who were hoping that their children might get to go to university. The massive cuts in university funding will mean, according to a story I saw in the Sydney Morning Herald this week, that the University of Western Sydney will lose 1,000 places. That university was a great initiative of the Labor government to provide tlhiversity education for young people of the greater west of Sydney. Before that university waS built, smart young kids who lived out in the west had to travel to Kensington, BroadwayMr Martin-WoJlongong. Mr LEO MeLEA Y-Or Wollongong-not that anyone would travel to Wollongong voluntarily, I suppose. Indeed, they never would have travelled to Wollongong in the past but because the Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: that is offensive to the member for Cunningham!",33
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Mr Andrew)Order! The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat. Mr LEO Me LEA Y-The work that the member for Cunningham has done since he became the member and the work that he did for the University of Wollongong meant that, of course, a lot of kids did want to go there. Indeed, my own son considered going to that university. It has a fairly good kids in western Sydney under this government's plans-and the member for Warringah is saying how terrific the University of Wollongong is-are going to have to travel to Wotlongong because there will not be any places at the University of Western Sydney. They will have to go to Wollongong from Kensington, Camperdown, Epping and North Ryde, and go to university there because there will be 1,000 fewer places at the University of Western Sydney-brought about directly by this government. And for the families of the kids from the west of Sydney, the people who live out in the electorate of Lindsay, theit children who want to get to university and cannot get into the University of Western Sydhey will have to travel all this way. When they have to travel all that way how far will that $25 a week extra that their family is getting for them help? It will all go on fares. Fortunately, the Labor government in New South Wales on the weekend announced they were taking the toll off the tollways in westem Sydney, so we are making it a bit easier and a bit cheaper for people to go into the city while this government is making it very expensive. So the people who live out in western Sydney and are on incomes of $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 probably all think it is pretty good giving something to Alison, who is on $70,000. I do not begrudge Alison getting it-good luck to her-but maybe they should not have said 'Alison', because it will not be just Alison who gets it. It might be that Fred is at work getting $70,000 a year and Alison is at home on her own looking after the kids but puts them into a child-care centre. They are going to get some money from the government. It is a bit rich. The government keep telling us they do not have any spare money. That is why they want to make these cuts to education in western Sydney and cause unemployment to go up in western Sydney, and it is why they want old people in nursing homes in western Sydney to pay $26,000 to enter nursing homes, but they tell us they want to give some money to someone earning $70,000. They ought to be giving a bit more to people on low incomes reputation. But in western Sydney. Fred and Alison do not really live in western Sydney. They live in the Prime Minister's electorate, over on the North Shore. They are the ones who will get money out of thissingle income families earning $70,000 living on the North Shore of Sydney. That is a bit unfair. I believe in the old Salvation Army adage that you give to the needy, not the greedy-and the needy are low income families. If the government were more interested in targeting this assistance at low income families, the opposition might be more interested in giving this legislation a bit more support. But the reality is that this is not a terrific piece of legislation. It is a cheap electoral bribe that is targeted at, in many instances, a lot of people who do not need the money. I think the government could have done better. The only score they will get for this is about three out of 10. They will not score anything from the people of western Sydney. I think the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) is the amendment that the House should go for. (Time expired)",36
48,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I know the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) was very keen for the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) to rise to her feet immediately but, with the concurrence of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who has agreed to let me slip in for a few moments, I am very happy to give the member for MCEwen a bit more time to do some forensic work on the explanatory memorandum.",37

50,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Quite right. We have been jumping with the order. Thank you, in all humility, for the call. Mr Abbott-Very cooperative.",37
51,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"We have a very cooperative Deputy Speaker and very cooperative members present in the chamber at the moment. I will be very brief. This is the centrepiece of the government's budget, and nothing could encapsulate more the notion that this budget gives with one hand and whacks with the other. That is the substance of this budget. The centrepiece of the family tax measure which is before the House through the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill is effectively this: a tax benefit of $3.85 per dependent child is given to families; an extra $9.60 a week is given to families if a child is under five and the partner of the principal income earner earns no more than $4,500 per year, with the principal income earner earning $65,000 per year and $3,000 for each child after the first being the means test limit. The general $3.85 per dependent child is means tested at $70,000 plus $3,000 for each child after the first. So it is effectively per dependent child. On the basis of the calculations that we have done regarding to whom this becomes applicable, as indicated by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), when he led the debate for the opposition, it effectively applies to about 13 per cent of families. So it is limited in its nature. When one comes to read the fine print of the budget one sees that, on the other hand, in the other elements and measures of the budget, families are comprehensively whacked. The substance of the opposition's view is found in the amendment which is in the name of the member for Holt. It states: (1) notes that only a limited proportion of family types receive the full benefits of the so-called Family Tax lnitiativeand that is calculated as being in the order of 13 per cent of Australian families(2) expresses its concerns that other Budget measures leave the average Australian family $700 per annum worse offand I will spend a very short period going through some of the detail of that. It then goes on to say-and some of these matters were covered comprehensively by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham): (3) notes with concern that the Government is only returning to PA YE taxpayers a small proportion of bracket creep/fiscal drag revenue collections via this Bill; ... When we look at the fine print of this bill, we find that the government proposes to give modestly with one hand and whack families with the other. I will go through some principal areas of concern to families: education costs, health costs, aged care costs, prescription costs, child-care costs and dental care costs. Let us have a very quick look at how education costs will go up. BECS has increased. Students will have to pay higher amounts and pay earlier. Austudy is cut. Assistance for students with disabilities has stopped altogether. So far as health costs are concerned, many doctors will now stop bulkbilling because their fees will no longer be indexed to CPI increases. The potential extra cost has been calculated as being $10 per consultation-let $3.85 alone the $800 million in outlays that the government has cut to hospital funding, which will presumably mean longer waiting lists and many more people being forced to pay for some of their operations. So far as prescription costs are concerned, the cost of listed prescription drugs will go up from $17.40 to $20. Pensioners who are paying $2.70 will, as a result of the budget, pay $3.20. So far as aged care costs are concerned, nursing home residents will face a new daily fee of up to $34-let alone the $26,000 upfront entry fee for nursing homes. Elderly people who live at home and use human and community care services, like Meals on Wheels, will incur a user-pays rate that is calculated as being anywhere between $4 per hour and $6.30 per hour. If it is the upper limit of $6.30 per hour and an elderly person who lives at home has three hours a week of Meals on Wheels services, then they are up for as much as $1,000 per year. As far as dental care costs are concerned, the Commonwealth dental health program has been abolished, which means that health care cardholders will either face long waiting lists for dental services or pay for private care. As far as child care is concerned, it is calculated that families will have to pay anywhere between $14 and $20 or $30 extra per week t') use community based child care. Child-care funding is cut by about $500 million and the cost burden of that will fall on families. The EPAC study on child care which was recently released shows that, in EPAC's estimate, the operating subsidy, which the government proposes to remove, is worth $21.40 per week for children under three and $14.35 per week for children older than three. It is also calculated, on this side of the ber, that a family on an annual income of about $30,000 with two children in long day care for 50 hours per week will pay an extra $19.60 per week. The same family earning $45,000 per year will pay $15.30 extra per week in child-care fees. So, when you make all those additions and calculations, what you find is that this is a modest little package that gives $3.85 per dependent child. But, when you look at the fine print of the budget and legislation associof ated with it, you see that the devil is in the detail, the deceit is in the detail and the whacking of Australian families is in the detail.",37
52,Mr VAILE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I certainly do support the motion that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question because I do not agree with the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), the great sufferer of that affliction he has. Item 3 of that amendment talks about bracket creep and fiscal drag. I think we were debating this particular bill when it started, and I am sure it was the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) who was making so much about bracket creep and fiscal drag. During 13 years of Labor government in this country we saw that the Labor Party was the greatest exponent of using that particular mechanism as far as extra revenue was concerned. They had 13 years to address that particular issue and never did. The member for Werriwa has been in and around the Labor Party long enough to know that they, as a government, were the greatest exponents of taking advantage of bracket creep and fiscal drag; yet they come in here and move amendments such as this one. It is interesting to listen to the comments of previous speakers as opposed to others with regard to some elements of the government's budgetary package. We have just listened to a couple of opposition speakers talk about the targeting of some of the measures in our budget with regard to what I suppose they would call middle-class or upper-class welfare. They are accusing the government of champroviding welfare in this particular measure to higher income earners, yet I just heard the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) talk about the residents in nursing homes and that those residents may have to pay the $34 daily contribution. A nursing home resident paying a $34 contribution a day would have to have an enormous income. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time about two or three sitting weeks ago pointed that out to members the opposition-that for residents in a nursing home to pay that contribution they would have to have enormous incomes. That is middle-class or upper-class welfare, not what we are trying to provide here. The family tax incentive package was and is the centrepiece of the coalition's budget. It was and is the centrepiece of the election platform that we put forward at the beginning of this year and which was comprehensively supported by the people of Australia when they gave us such an enormous mandate. I think we have 94 seats to 49 seats in this place. I am sure the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) would have noted the difference in the numbers on many occasions during divisions. That is a reflection of the will of the Australian people. Every single measure that the government has undertaken was flagged quite clearly in that election campaign. As I walked the streets of my electorate campaigning prior to the 2 March election, the message was, 'Good on you. Get some focus back on to mainstream Australia. Get some focus back on the families that have been struggling increasingly over the 13 years of Labor government.' It slid up until it got to a crescendo at the end of 1980s with their monetary and fiscal policies. Talk about middle-class welfare! They did not attack big business; big business got away with blue murder in this country. I am going to read from an article that was in a newspaper recently. It is about what the previous Labor administration did to families in Australia. We are trying to make amends for that because, unfortunately, when people suffer in this country, people look past which political party is in power. They say, 'The politicians, the parliamentarians, the government are responsible for doing this to us.' To a certain extent, we all had to wear the odium of what Labor did to this country. I am going to go straight to this article because it is relevant to what we are debating today. We are trying to help out families in Australia that have been so structurally damaged by the decisions of the previous Labor administration. I am going to quote from an article by Max Walsh called 'A pocketful of wry from the Reserve'. He refers to the boast by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, that he had the Reserve Bank in his back pocket. In this article are extracts from John Edward's biography called Keating-the inside story. I am not going to read it all, but the very pertinent point of what that administration did to families in Australia is evidenced in this article. I quote: The Treasurer's direct involvement in day-today monetary policy was an accident of history and personalities. With the floating of the exchange rate an- the removal of exchange controls, monetary pollcy assumed a much greater role in economic management than it had previously. The Reserve Bank, accustomed to taking its - ding instructions from the Treasury, approached Its new responsibilities with apprehension and cauti-n-two words not in the Keating vocabulary, espeCIally when backed up by his equally hubristic adviser, Don Russell. If its policy approach was sometimes confusing, it's hardly surprising. The article goes on: Edwards quotes Keating as saying: ""This is all bull---about the science of monetary policy. All bull---. Every month for years we had papers on credit growth, the yield curve, etc, etc, the relation to GNE, and it was never any good at prediction. Never. You have to be able to feel what is happening."" Two paragraphs later Edwards writes: ""Beginning in March 1988, Keating would encourage and authorise-sometimes in the face of objections, insist upon-a series of interest rate increases which were the cause of the subsequent recession."" Keating had returned from the summer holiday all fired up about the way in which Noosa was full of bulldozers. He wanted the Reserve to lift rates by 2 percentage points in one hit. The Reserve procrastinated but, under daily urging from Don Russell, lifted the rate by 1.75 percentage points. Between March 1988 and November 1989, the cash rate was lifted by nearly 8 percentage points, with Paul Keating cracking the whip. Rates were pushed too high for too long. Then, at the end of 1989, Don Russell (as he told a seminar a few years later) heard the economy snap: not a slowdown or a steady decline, but an audible snap. That is what happened under the Labor administration in the late 1980s. We then moved into the 1990s when the man who, when Treasurer, rode and cracked the whip on interest rates almost up into the 20 per cent range while the rest of the world was nowhere near it as a result of his personal predilections became the Prime Minister. The man became the Prime Minister and rode into the 1993 election. The coalition, in all sincerity, tried to make some structural beneficial changes to the economy of Australia but was beaten in that election. We were beaten by deception and untruths about what that Labor government was going to do after the 1993 election. Remember the l-a-w law tax cuts. They were targeting the families of Australia. The families of Australia were deceived by the l-a-w law tax cuts-the promise of the former Prime Minister. In this bill today we are going to provide some of those benefits to families. We want to try to see families get on a secure footing so they can plan for their future and their children's future. I have listened to opposition members speak in this debate today about the things that this coalition government is doing to the people of Australia. What the opposition did when in government between 1993 and 1996 was just unbelievable-the hypocrisy, the increases in wholesale sales tax ratcheted up year after year in the face of promises not to increase taxes and their walking away from the Keating promise of tax cuts. The excise on fuel was ratcheted up in the years 1993 to 1996. During the whole period of Labor in government, from 1983 to 1996, we saw the excise on fuel rise from something like 6c or 8c a litre into the mid-thirties. Little wonder the cost of every single thing we consume in this country is so high by comparison because of the hidden, indirect taxes. We may not have got a GST in 1993, but we got a KST-Keating sales tax-on everything across the board. He increased it, with a succession of Treasurers, on all products that had a wholesale sales tax. As well as walking away from the promise about the tax cuts, Keating brought in new products to put sales tax on. In 1996, the people of Australia did not forget the deception that was perpetrated on them in 1993. This government has taken on the responsibility of doing something about the structural fiscal problem we have in this country today which has a profound effect on the monetary situation and on interest rates. Some very difficult decisions have had to be taken. One of the better decisions has been to focus on families and on small businessbecause they are intrinsically linked-and this government is not going to walk away from its responsibilities. We intend to focus on those sectors in our economy because it is those sectors which will put it back together again. They will do the job for Australia. They will ultimately provide the employment, but it is going to be a long haul. People out there realise and understand what has happened. We have been taken to enormous levels of debt. Everywhere you go, the Labor line is that the $180 billion worth of debt is not government but private sector debt. Some $80 billion or more is public sector debt. A massive amount of that was built on during the last three years of the Labor administration under the prime ministership of Keating. They blew it out, and it was built on by deficit budget after deficit budget. 'Deficit budget' is an easy term. Where does the money come from to pay that-the money that is physically being paid out for goods and services? It is borrowed. Where is it borrowed from? Overseas; it is on the bankcard. I do not know about anybody else in this place but every month my wife and I sit down, go through our bankcards, work out what we have spent for the month and work out how we are going to pay for it. We budget ahead. The Labor Party went on a drunken spending binge in the last three years of their administration that took the foreign debt to enormous levels. They kept on accumulating deficit budgets. They were running very high current account deficits. Because of that high debt, the balance of payments figures each month were much higher than they should have been because of the component of interest that the government-as well as the private sector-was paying on that foreign debt. On top of all that, because of that debt, because of the deficit budgets, because of the current account deficit, because of the management of our economy, our credit rating was not all that good. We are being impacted by high interest rates. It was not enough for the Treasurer of the day back in the late 1980s to drive interest rates through the roof, which sent so many families and so many businesses in this country to the wall. They lost everything. They lost their life savings because of the high interest rate regime of Keating administration. Because of some personal predilections, he cracked the whip on the Reserve Bank to get monetary policy up in order to slow things down. The budget that has been implemented by this government this year and, most importantly, the emphasis we are placing on the family with this family tax initiative are incredibly important to get some focus back on the foundation and the key building blocks to a strong economy in this country. This will happen with this measure and the measures that the government has undertaken and implemented for small business. If the opposition parties in the Senate have any morals, they will pass our industrial relations package in the Senate, which is the third tranche of trying to free up the economy and get it going. Members of the opposition know this. The small business community in the electorates of members of the opposition must be telling them exactly what they are telling us. They want the workplace relations bill out of the Senate. They want to see the family tax initiative passed; they want to see the balance of the budget passed; they want to see the workplace relations bill passed. They voted this government in on 2 March to make those changes. They could see that after 13 years this country needed a change in direction. They voted for that change in direction in a massive way. Neither the opposition nor the Democrats can morally stand and say that they have a mandate to oppose those key measures, those key planks of reform, that this government was elected to introduce. The challenge is fairly and squarely before the members of the opposition and the other opposition parties in the Senate. I support the bills before the House today. One of the central platforms upon which this government was elected was to provide this relief-these tax incentives-to the families of Australia. There is a ceiling on it. We put a ceiling on a lot of other measures so that the taxpayers of Australia are not providing welfare to people with income over $70,000. We are going to review the arrangethe ments with Austudy. We are going to attack all those areas where high income earners have been getting benefits that other taxpayers cannot afford to support. It is time this country sobered up on its spending practices. The people of Australia know it; they recognise it. They are drinking their cups of coffee and they recognise that we cannot continue down the path we have been going down for the last 13 years. It is time that we take responsibility for our actions in this country. When we spend a dollar there should be someone out there earning it and paying tax on it for the government to spend it. The message has been sent through loud and clear: the government must shoulder the responsibility of the expenditure of hard earned taxpayers' dollars, and it should be wisely spent. As far as I am concerned, providing incentives to families is wisely spending taxpayers' dollars. As the Prime Minister said in an answer during question time on 11 September: The first and most important reason is that it emphatically endorses a very fundamental principle of the Liberal and National parties, and that is that we ought to give greater choice to Australian parents about the caring arrangements for their young children. We are for choice; we are not for dictating the caring arrangements that ought to exist. We are all for supporting the family unit, whether it be a single parent or whether it be both parents caring for the children. Parents ought to have the choice of caring for their children at home or putting them in child care. I do not think there is any doubt that the people of Australia support the government in this measure: providing income tax initiatives for the family that are intrinsic in this bill.",38
53,Mrs BAILEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"On behalf of the people in the MCEwen electorate, I rise today to support the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 and I reject the amendment put forward by the opposition. I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr have Costello) on delivering such a substantial relief package to families in this budget-a package which, I must say, is most welcome and long overdue. It is welcome not only because it is the centrepiece of this entire budget but also because it is a first step to restoring this country to a balanced economy and a more secure basis. I also welcome it because it marks the end of an era of a government raising false expectations. It marks the end of an era of false promises, of unfunded promises. It marks the end of an era of government introducing programs and simply putting them on the national bankcard, putting them on the never-never. A previous speaker from the opposition raised the issue of the Commonwealth dental plan. That Commonwealth dental plan was probably one of many examples that the previous government entered into. That dental plan, as I recall, was cobbled together as a promise by the previous Prime Minister during the 1993 election campaign with no consultation with industry or the profession. It was unfunded. I suspect that at the time former Prime Minister did not expect to win that election. Having won it, he was then faced with the prospect of what to do with that plan. He set a target, and those targets have now been met. It is a bit rich for opposithe tion members to come in here and complain about that Commonwealth dental plan when they introduced it completely unfunded and, might I say, underfunded throughout its history. I want to concentrate on the family tax initiatives before us today. They honour one of the coalition's core election commitments: to help the forgotten families of middle Australia. We promised to help those families who have been battling to make ends meet under Labor and we are delivering on those promises in full. This relief package for families has been widely praised and welcomed in MCEwen. Since the budget was announced, my office has been inundated with calls from families wanting to know more about the package, wanting to know whether they qualify for it, how much money it will actually put in their pockets and how they can access it. I give you just a couple of examples. A young mother from Millgrove in my electorate rang to say that the benefit that she would receive under this package would provide added relief for families like hers where one parent had chosen to stay home and look after the children full time. A single mother from Healesville called my office to say that, with the extra money the family tax initiative would bring in for her, she was hoping to attend university and complete a degree so that she could get a well-paid job to help raise her child. There is no doubt that there are increasing pressures being placed on families as they try to juggle work and family responsibilities. As a mother of two children myself, I am well aware that trying to find the balance between work and parenthood is one of the greatest challenges I face. To add to the burden, there are the spiralling costs of rearing children. Education, uniforms, food, sporting involvement, social activities, clothes, shoes, school camps and excursions, child care, baby-sitters the and travel and transport costs are just a few that I can name straight off the top of my head. Trying to cover all these expenses is difficult enough when you have one or both parents involved in full-time work, but when parents are dependent upon social security benefits or are on low incomes the task becomes that much harder. Let us just examine the magnitude of the problem of families in need, families that represent those forgotten or passed over by Labor, those who have been denied the opportunity to get ahead and to have the means to look after themselves, those families that have been left behind by Labor for the past 13 years. Just under two million households in Australia survived principally on government benefits in the 1993-94 financial year, according to an Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey. That is 4.175 million Australians out of a population of almost 18 million. Other ABS and Australian Council of Social Service figures show that just under 50 per cent of all wage earners earned less than $25,000 per year. Labor has failed those families. In May 1995, 1.9 million Australians were living in poverty, as measured by the Henderson poverty line, of whom 592,000 were children under the age of 14. UNICEF states that Australia is one of only five industrial nations to have more than 10 per cent of its children still living in poverty-and that is one of the real legacies of 13 years of Labor rule. What did Labor do to reduce that poverty? What did they do to tackle the causes of that poverty over the past 13 years? Nothing but talk. Poverty actually increased under Labor during the past 13 years. Approximately 20 per cent of sole parents are under the Henderson poverty line. This increases to 30 per cent for single parents with three or more children. The circumstances for two-parent families are not much better, with the poverty rate at 12 per cent, rising to 22 per cent for families with four or more children. These are the families which our family tax initiative will benefit. It does not discriminate: sole parents, the unemployed, working couples and families where one parent chooses to stay at home all benefit from this package, and the more children they have the more they benefit. These measures are designed to alleviate the pressures of all of those families in middle Australia, those who have battled under Labor just to keep their heads above water. I give another couple of examples. A family in Diamond Creek in my electorate of MCEwen with a combined taxable income of less than $70,000 will receive a $1,000 increase in their tax free threshold for each dependent child. This means an extra $200 per year or $7.70 per fortnight for each eligible child. A one-income family in Broadford will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax free threshold if they have a child aged under five. This means an extra $500 per year or $19.20 per fortnight. The advantage of this initiative is that families can select how they want to receive their payment. Parents can choose to receive their payment on a fortnightly basis throughout the year or opt to receive it in a lump sum at the end of the financial year. This initiative will put much needed dollars into the pockets of millions of households across Australia, making it one of the most substantial family relief measures this country has ever seen. This initiative will be of particular benefit to families in rural areas like many of those in my electorate of MCEwen. The cost of raising children escalates significantly in rural Australia where basic goods and services are more expensive and often beyond the reach of many, where unemployment is high, where job prospects are low and where farms and small businesses have not yet recovered from the recession. The number of vacant shops is stark testimony to this and serves as a constant reminder that this is definitely not as good as it gets, as the former Prime Minister so arrogantly told those small business families. Members of the opposition should realise that each of those empty shops used to support a family in their small business and, as well, provided extra local employment. In tum, those families were vital members of their local communities. They struggled in those small businesses for as long as they could but, thanks to the deliberate policies of the previous government, those small business families, their dependants and their employees have ended up without a job and dependent on government. They look to this government to give them that fresh start, and that is what this budget is doing. The money that this tax initiative will bring to many families in MCEwen may well mean the difference between surviving and the constant struggle for survival. Many rural families are unable to afford the basics of living. The price of new shoes and clothes is significantly higher in rural towns than in larger centres. Fifty dollars worth of groceries will seldom cover the bottom of a shopping trolley. Many parents are unable to spare money for school camps and activities or sporting or social events, and family holidays are rare. Most smaller country towns do not have child-care centres, so parents must either forsake a regular pay packet to stay home to look after the children or rely on families and friends. Parents in the country have to travel much greater distances to access essential services such as doctors, hospitals, supermarkets and government agencies. Without public transport, the responsibility of driving children to and from school, or the school bus, sporting events and social activities also falls back on the parents. The high cost of fuel in rural areas means travelling is an added financial burden on parents when raising their children. Even basic services which city parents take for granted cost more in the country. In rural Australia most telephone calls are charged at SID rates because of the small local call charge areas. Children in the country cannot access the Internet for educational purposes because in many rural areas calls to the services are charged at SID rates which make that service far too expensive for many rural families to use, even if the technology is available. Many country residents must also rely solely on electricity for their heating cooking needs as they have no access to the cheaper alternative of natural gas. It is easy to understand how, for many rural parents, just to provide the basic essentials their children creates great stress, tension and pressure on families. These conditions that I have just described do not apply to isolated cases; they tend to be the rule rather than the exception. They apply to the majority of hard working families trying to bring up their children. Their plight is the real legacy of 13 years of Labor rule where, under Labor, it was the interest groups which were well looked after, not families. The primary aim of this family tax initiative is to reduce these financial pressures on families with dependent children so as to give them more choices when raising their children. This initiative will be complemented by a series of measures aimed at providing greater support and security to families and easing the cost of raising children. These measures begin the process of redressing the imbalance. Helping to make private health insurance more affordable to low and middle income families with a program of incentive payments of up to $450 for families will mean that, together with this family tax package, eligible families with two dependent children who take out private health insurance will benefit by up to $51.90 per fortnight. Our comprehensive, strengthening family strategy incorporates measures to support families in times of financial, social and emotional crisis, to strengthen relationships and to help prevent child abuse, youth suicide and youth homelessness. There are more funds for education, there is extra money to ensure that children in remote areas have access to quality child-care services and there are measures to help attract more doctors to rural areas. All of this means that Australian families will receive more support and assistance from the government than ever before. This depends, of course, on members of the opposition and the Australian Democrats being serious about helping Australian families by passing these budget measures. It must be understood that, if the and opposition and the Democrats continue to create obstacles merely for the sake of flexing their collective muscles, families are the ones who will be victimised. It will be families for who will have to continue even longer to struggle just to provide the basics for their children. The opposition had 13 years to provide this assistance to families, but they failed. All that they succeeded in was coming up with mere platitudes. Well, it is impossible to house, feed, clothe or educate children with platitudes. All they did for families was dangle false promises, such as those famous income tax cuts, but the reality under Labor was that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer and mainstream families were forgotten. They were simply put in the too-hard basket. One of the key reasons I was elected to represent the people of MCEwen was that I promised to help the families of MCEwen. This government was elected on that platform. The opposition is merely trying to grab a few cheap headlines at the expense of families in MCEwen by attempting to frustrate the passage of this budget. People from all sectors have stood up and applauded the family tax package. They have ranged from political analysts, to the media, community organisations, and families, like those whom I have mentioned, who have bothered to contact my electorate office. ACOSS has come out in support of this initiative by stating that the better targeted family tax package will also give some welcome relief to low income families. It seems that the only people in this country who are opposing and frustrating this legislation are members of the opposition and the Democrats. The public is entitled to ask why. They have to answer that question. In reality they have no answer other than wanting to create a few headlines for thems-lves. The family tax initiative is an indication that at long last a government recognises the high cost of raising children in today's society and is actually prepared to do something about it. The pathetic attempt by the opposition to frustrate this process will jeopardise any chance families have of receiving the benefits they deserve. Members of the public listening to this broadcast should be aware of the pathetic attempts by the opposition to frustrate our measures. It is vital that these family tax measures are passed, for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children and for the sake of all our futures. I commend these bills to the House.",41
54,Mr ANDREWS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise in this debate to support the family tax initiative legislation which has been introduced by the government as part of the recent budget. As one who has argued in this place and elsewhere for some time that the health of the nation depends on the health of the families that make up the nation it is my particular delight to support legislation which goes some way towards placing families in a better situation. I remind honourable members of the thrust of this legislation which is in two parts. The first part increases the tax free threshold by $1,000 for families with one child and a combined taxable income of less than $70,000. An additional $3,000 is added to the income threshold for each additional child. The second part of this initiative delivers extra support for single income families with at least one child under five years of age by increasing the tax free threshold by a further $2,500. I doubt whether anyone who believes in the value of families to society would argue against measures of this nature. A measure which provides some extra assistance, by way of tax relief, to families, particularly those raising young children, is something whic;;h would meet with almost universal a,ppri,wa,l"" within Australian society. It is worth w4ile oq , an occasion like this to rehearse those reaso,ns the assistance which is being provided by::this measure is being provided througb th- taxation system and not through some other, form and to outline the reason for doing this ih{t-first place. ,;;: It is my conviction that tax reform shO,41- "", enhance the health of families by seekin,g/ig, achieve two outcomes: firstly, choice';""f9:'t, families, and particularly choice for women ii'!' families; and, secondly, horizont"",l eqUitY, ',: between families. The quiet revolutiop pOhis century has been the increased numbyi of women in the labour for c e . ' X In the last 20 years the central phenomenon has been the increased number of married women and women with children in the work force in this country.

This has had an impact on families as well. Many of the gains for women have been more apparent than real. Women are still clustered in the lowest paid work in strongly segregated industries. The commitment of women to the paid work force remains comparatively weak for married women and for women with children. Women in Australia work only a third of the hours that men work each year. Although women value work for the independent means it gives them, they also overwhelmingly choose to work part time or not at all when they have young children. If we are trying to structure a tax system in this country which recognises those changes which have occurred in Australian society and which is providing choice about the opportunities to work for all members of the community, particularly married women and women with children who 30 years ago did not have the same opportunities-yet we are also keen to ensure that we provide a system which supports families and family life-then we need a tax system which reflects some of these changing realities. The second matter which I believe tax reform in this area should be based upon is the notion of horizontal equity. There has been in this country, since 1986 when tax rebates for children were abolished overnight, no recognition of horizontal equity in the Australian tax system. This means simply that there is no allowance made in the tax system for the greater costs incurred in bringing up children. In a 1990 study of 11 major industrialised countries, it was found that: Australia, by far, provides the least relief and cash grants] for dependent children. The costs of children are considerable and inescapable. According to one study, for a family earning $400 a week with two children under five years of age, nearly $74 a week was spent on the first child and just over $55 on the second; that is, $129 a week or $6,709 annually. That, in 1988 figures, represented 32 per cent of the family's income before tax. The figures, which have been updated since then, show that there is an increasing cost of raising children in Australia. The former Director of the Institute of Family Studies in Australia, Dr Don Edgar, provided some figures which showed that a single breadwinner with two children on $42,900 a year has the same disposable income as a single person on $24,000 a year. That is, if you are in a family-a husband and wife, with one earner and two children-and you are earning $42,900 a year, at the end of the tax year your disposable income would be no more than that of a single person on $24,000 a year. This is notwithstanding the fact that single people on half average weekly earnings have ended up $10.43 a week worse off than they were in 1976. According to research by Alan Jordan on Australian incomes and relative living standards, which is the baseline for much of the research that has been undertaken in this area, the major economic division in Australia is not between classes but between households with children and households without children. According to Jordan's studies, families with children enjoy a real living standard or equivalent income which is three-fifths that of the rest of the adult working population. Equivalent income measures effective living standards by allowing for the sharing of monetary income between dependants, the different needs of adults and children, and economies of scale. The increase in taxes on families has been well documented. Since 1960, the average tax rate for a single income family with two children has increased approximately 334 per cent, while the rate for a single taxpayer has gone up only 78 per cent. The tax transfer which has occurred under the Labor govern[in tax ment from the middle to the top and bottom sectors has underwritten gains for families on below average weekly earnings and significant benefit for the wealthy top 10 per cent of Australians who have increased their share of market income by three percentage points over the decade of Labor government to 24 per cent in 1990. Those differentials have increased over the last few years. Conversely, those on average weekly earnings with two children are between $27 and $34 a week worse off than they were in 1976. But the only income level at which families are significantly better off than a couple with no children is at the low income level of $15,000 due to the additional family payment and other benefits. The consequence of these studies is the finding that there is net assistance from government to families with children as demonstrated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics fiscal incidence study, which analysed for the first time the total impact on government spending and taxing on Australian society, using data from 10,000 Australian households. Families with dependent children pay fully in their taxes for thing they get from local, state and federal governments, including the biggest itemeducation. Yet, seen in hard-edged economic terms, children are our most valuable resource as future workers. The bauxite will not be mined, the seas will not be trawled, the assembly lines will not keep running and intellectual products will not be created unless they, the future generation of Australians, do so. There is also the aspect of choice that I have touched on before, which has been largely removed so far as the system relates at the present time. The stated preference for many women with young children-I am talking about children of preschool age not to work at all or work only part time-has been shown by a whole series of studies in Australia over the last decade. According to one by Van and HardIe in 1991, 67 per cent of women want to stay at home with their children but only 47 per cent said that they could actually do so. So there is a pressing need, as this measure tries to address, to build more choice into the taxation system by allowing parents to care for their children at home, especially in the years of nought to five when they are most in need of a stable loving environment. Although the costs of raising children do in fact increase with age, it has to be remembered that not only is one partner forgoing wages to care for children but also this is often the time when the household is being set up. The chief carer of the children is more able to work when the children are older. Therefore, if support for the family is to be targeted, there is an argument-as this measure addressesfor directing it particularly to those families with children aged nought to five. A number of options could be introduced no in terms of dealing with more provision for families, but this one is one which I believe is preferable. I fully support the legislation for a number of reasons: firstly, it does achieve more horizontal equity for families; secondly, it is easily understood by Australians and it is not a complex arrangement; and, thirdly, the greatest benefits will be felt by low income everyfamilies and those on average weekly earnings. This is a matter which was reported upon by an independent study undertaken by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, at the University of Canberra just in this past week. That study of this measure revealed that single income families will receive an average $10.50 more a week from the family tax package from 1 January next year. Double income families will gain an extra $5.30 a week on average and sole parents are set to get an extra $8.30 a week according to the study. The author of the study, Gillian Beer, said almost two million low and middle income families would benefit. She also said that sole parents, at whom this measure is aimed as much as it is at families where there are two parents, would get an $8.30 a week boost that would lift their disposable income as a result of this measure alone by two per cent. Less than one-third of all families with children, which are mostly the higher income families, will receive no benefit under this measure. Quite clearly, this measure meets the objective that low income families and those on average weekly earnings are to benefit, according to the independent analysis carried out by NATSEM. Importantly, there are arguments about how we can provide relief to families. This is not a welfare measure. One of the great difficulties in surveying the history of the way in which benefits are provided to families in this country is that, when they are treated as payments, they tend to be treated as welfare measures. Over a period of time, they tend to be targeted by governments in such a way that the effect of them is narrowed, there does not tend to be the increase in the amount in line with inflation or the consumer price index over a period of time, and so the real value of the benefit decreases over a period of time. That is one of the drawbacks of welfare measures. There is also the cost involved by governments raising money from parents through taxation, which then is churned through the system and has obvious costs in providing the bureaucracy to simply pay that money back to parents at the end of the day. There are arguments for doing that where governments wish to direct programs specifically in certain directions. However, I believe that more choice ought to be provided, and there are some economic advantages in not collecting money in the first place which is simply paid back to parents, but we pay the cost of collecting it and paying it back. The other advantage of this measure is that it can be provided immediately through the PAYE taxation system in a reduction in weekly tax. Therefore, it is something which, in a sense, has the same benefit as a payment which is directly made. Rather than simply being made by way of a cheque from the Department of Social Security or otherwise from the government, it can be seen in the pay packets of Australians at the end of the week or the fortnight or the month or whatever period of time they receive their pay. Overall, this is a measure which, I believe, meets those objectives of being fair, simple and directed to those most in need and of providing some equity in the taxation system, particularly for families with children, while at the same time providing some more neutrality so that we do not have families believing that the only way in which they can maintain their real standard of living is to have a second income, either by being forced to have a second parent always in the full time work force or by having one or other parent forced to go out and get a second job or work longer hours. I believe this measure is some small step towards trying to provide some neutrality in the system and it is one which I commend to all honourable members.",45
55,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (12.56 p.m.)-These bills are important components of the budget measures which the government has brought before the House, a budget which has been designed to correct the structural problems in the Australian economy and at the same time to preserve and enhance the fairness of Australian society. One of the very interesting features of this budget, a feature which should prevent members opposite from simply labelling this as a tory budget, is that we have been very careful to ensure that the burdens have been placed only on people who are able to bear them. That is why the Medicare levy has been increased for high income earners, that is why high income earners have had a surcharge added to their superannuation tax, and that is why child-care fee relief has been reduced for high income earners-because the hallmark of the first Howard budget has been fairness. That is why members opposite have had so much difficulty criticising the measures before us. For quite some time, families with children have been Australia's new poor. A single income earner on $30,000 a year has roughly $445 a week on which to live. A family comprising a single income earner with a dependent spouse and two dependent children has but $495 a week on which to live after tax, family allowance, home child-care allowance and so on. Under the system of tax and payments which was established by the previous government, such a family had but $50 a week extra with which to feed, clothe and educate those three extra family members. That is why, as I said, families with children are Australia's new poor. That is why the government has introduced this important package of family benefits. I do not say for a second that this is going to solve the problems of Australia's families. It can't, obviously. But it is an important step in the right direction. It is a $1 billion package of benefits for Australia's families, and two million Australian families will be better off as of 1 January next year. All families with children will benefit at least to the tune of $7.70 a fortnight, and families with more children will benefit much more significantly. For instance, a family with four children, of which one is under five, will benefit to the tune of $50 a fortnight. So these are very significant benefits which are being delivered to Australian families. There are two elements to this package. The first element gives all families with dependent children an increase of $1,000 per child in their tax free threshold. The second element gives single income families with a child under five an additional $2,500 benefit in their tax free threshold. Fifty per cent of families have children; 27 per cent of families have either one breadwinner, no breadwinner or a single parent. In other words, 50 per cent of all families will benefit from these measures and 50 per cent of those families will benefit from the additional measures for one income families. Members opposite have said that only 13 per cent of families will benefit. That is incorrect. According to the ABS figures, when examined properly, 27 per cent of all families will benefit. That is 50 per cent of all families with children. So this is not a narrow-cast measure. This is a broad-cast measure to the generality of Australian families. I want to tum very briefly to some of the criticisms that have been made in the course of this debate by members opposite. They have discussed various issues, many of which have had only the slightest relevance to the bills before the House at the moment but, in the spirit of tolerance and cooperation with which the House now functions, given the general raising of parliamentary standards, we have not taken points of order of relevance on them. Members opposite have talked about the HECS increases. We have increased HECS, but the important thing about increased HECS charges is that people do not have to begin paying them until they are in a position to do so. No-one without an income is forced to pay HECS. No-one with an income of under $21,000 will be forced to pay HECS. So the only people who will be forced to pay HECS will be the people who rightly should pay HECS; that is, the people who are in a position to pay it. Members opposite talked about nursing home entry fees and daily rates in nursing homes. The simple truth is that we have extended to nursing homes a system which the previous government introduced for hostels. If it is wrong for nursing homes, it was wrong for hostels, and it is hypocritical of members opposite to wax outraged now about this measure when they acquiesced to the measure of the previous government not so terribly long ago. On child care, we have removed operational subsidies from community based long day care centres. Why? Not because we wanted to be Uncle Scrooge, but because it was important to establish a level playing field in the child-care industry. We have now put all long day care centres on the same basis. We have not given the community based ones an unfair advantage vis-a-vis the private centres which now look after 70 per cent of children in that form of care. We also have an important equity measure there. We have reduced the child-care cash rebate for high income earners from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. In his contribution to this debate, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) quoted the marvellous old Salvation Army aphorism, 'We are here to help the needy not the greedy.' That is precisely what the government is attempting to do. It is passing strange for members opposite to attack our child-care measures when what we are trying to do is to better target child care so that it goes less abundantly to those who are most able to afford it out of their private pockets. I concede that people moving from $70,000 to $80,000 face higher effective marginal tax rates because of these measures. That is unfortunate. But whenever there are targeted measures, this is an unfortunate consequence. If we are going to target measures-and, surely, we must target measures if we are to achieve the social equity that members opposite very rightly and properly believe is important-we are going to have this. It ill becomes members opposite to attack this unfortunate consequence of equity and at the same time to denounce lack of equity in these budget measures. Fundamentally, members opposite have said that this family tax package takes with one hand while it gives with the other. I do not wish to be too partisan in this, but the unfor- forthwith. tunate fact is that the previous government took with both hands. Prior to the 1990 election, it had 18 per cent home loan interest rates. In 1991, unemployment hit 11 per cent. During the life of the previous government, disposable income for the average household was $50 less in 1996 than it was in 1983. The fact is that members opposite all too often in this debate have sounded as though they begrudge Australian families the benefit that they so richly and so rightly deserve. All too often in the course of this debate it has sounded as though the real problem for members opposite is that we are doing it, not them; that we are giving them this benefit and that they did not think to give them this benefit when they were in government. There is not much that members opposite will be able to do for Australian families over the next few years because they will remain in opposition and this important family tax initiative is but the first instalment of the many benefits that the Howard government will give Australian families in the years to come.

NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.  p.m.)-The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is a very important bill. It gives effect to a large proportion of the savings announced in this year's budget that relate to the social security area. It adds up to about $1.5 billion worth of savings over the forward estimates period. It contains quite a number of measures which we in the opposition find objectionable. I can speak from my own point of view here, having been Minister for Social Security for three years and having gone through a number of rounds of the expenditure review committee and having seen some of these sorts of propositions emanate from the Department of Finance at various times, and some not, quite frankly. Some of the things that are proposed in here are not the sorts of things that even the Department of Finance would have put forward during our period of government. There is no doubt in my mind that a number of these measures will have a very adverse effect on Australia's social security safety net. In government we had no more significant objective than to construct a comprehensive and adequate social income security safety net. We managed to do that in a way that did not impose a large burden on budgetary outlays. Our social security spending as a proportion of GDP, from memory, is a bit over eight per cent. It is a relatively low proportion of GOP by the standards of most developed countries, particularly European countries. Yet we are able to reconcile that relatively low level of spending on a system which by and large was comparably effective, as a safeguard against poverty, to systems in other countries that consume a far higher proportion of GOP. How did we manage to achieve that? We placed an enormous emphasis on effective targeting of assistance. This is an area that consumed a huge amount of policy making time when we were in government. It is the way to reconcile an adequate social safety net with a relatively low level of taxation to GOP. What we avoided doing was a great deal of the so-called churning that goes on in many European countries, where payments are made to people on comparatively high income and then recouped by other means, principally through the tax system. I think that is a very important achievement. The end product of that was a social security system that was amongst the most efficient in the world, in two important respects. Firstly, as I said, it was efficient in terms of its targeting. A great bulk of the assistance did go to people who would otherwise face severe difficulties. Relatively small amounts were wasted on people who did not need that assistance. We were also an efficient system in another respect, and that was in a purely administrative sense. A group of academics based at the ANU did a comparative study of social security systems in different countries and they reached the conclusion that, of the group of 10 developed countries they studied, ours had the second lowest administrative costs as a proportion of outlays. I think the only one that was lower was Norway. The significance of that is that we were able to do that notwithstanding, as I said, having placed a great emphasis on targeting, which you would expect to impose some sort of administrative burden. So a good deal was achieved in that respect. In terms of the adequacy of the social safety net, whichever way you slice it, there were major improvements during our period of government. If you look at each of the major payment categories and compare them to any of the generally utilised or accepted poverty lines, the Henderson one being the most commonly used one, the level of pensions, the level of allowances, the level of assistance targeted to low income families unambiguously improved, and in some cases it improved very substantially indeed. I instance the additional payments made to low income families with children, both inside and outside the work force. The real level of assistance increased, depending on the age of the child, by between 100 and 150 per cent. That is a very major achievement. The real rate of pension also improved unambiguously in real terms and against the poverty lines, and likewise allowances. Most of these comparisons have tended to be done in this country in terms of the Henderson poverty line or some variation of the Henderson poverty line. It is important to bear in mind that that is a pretty tough hurdle to improve against because the Henderson poverty line is indexed to household disposable income per capita. That has meant that the real value of the Henderson poverty line has increased by about 20 per cent during our period of government. In the United States, by contrast, most measures of poverty tend to be based on a criterion that is indexed to prices rather than to household disposable income. Therefore, for us to have been able to improve things unambiguously against the Henderson benchmark I think is a pretty significant achievement. The other thing we sought to do, the other area we focused on particularly in the latter part of our period in government, was to minimise barriers to people receiving assistance participating in the work force. In doing that, we were not simply confining our attention to those on unemployment payments, we were also very concerned to maximise the opportunities and to minimise the barriers to participation in work by people on disability pensions, people on a sole parent pension, through programs like the disability reform program and the jobs education and training scheme, or JET scheme. We put a very great emphasis on improving that access. We restructured the whole scheme of assistance to people on unemployment payments in the context of the Working Nation statement where we redesigned the income test to try to eliminate a situation where people could end up, if they raised their earnings from private exertion, losing dollar for dollar in the form of a reduction in social security entitlements over very wide income ranges. That obviously was unacceptable and we redesigned the income test to address that. We also brought in other measures to avoid people being trapped in a state of dependency on social security payments. The introduction of the parenting allowance had, as a key part of its rationale, to eliminate cases where you might have a couple both unemployed with dependent children and one member of the couple might be offered a low paid full-time job. Under the pre-July 1995 income test structure you could easily have situations where people would go backwards financially as a result of one member of that partnership, or that couple, taking up a low paid full-time job. We introduced the parenting allowance as a means of overcoming that by increasing the income support to the low-income couple where one member of the couple was staying at home caring for children. Other things we did included the introduction of employment and education entry payments to help people who might have the option of a job but who might be precluded from taking up a job offer because they could not buy suitable clothing or suitable work wear or whatever. In the case of people with disabilities that is a particularly serious problem, but it is also a problem for people on unemployment payments. We brought in earnings credits so that people who had irregular earnings through casual work did not suffer a major disincentive through the operation of the income test. We also introduced, quite late in the piece, the possibility of people on unemployment payments receiving lump sum advances to help them begin to acquire clothing or tools or whatever, the absence of which might be impeding their taking up full-time work opportunities. There were a whole raft of measures which we implemented over a period of years to try to tackle this problem of disincentives and barriers to people on social security participating in the work force. We also placed considerable emphasis on compliance measures and when, in the mid1980s, there was no doubt that the whole compliance regime and anti-fraud regime were somewhat slack, a good deal of effort was put into addressing that problem. Our system was reviewed in 1993 by an internationally recognised expert, Professor Weatherby of Harvard University, who concluded that the slackness which had existed had been largely corrected. To go too much further than we were proposing to do at the time, he said, would start to raise serious problems about unreasonable infringements of civil liberties and real questions about the cost effectiveness of further measures. While we were obviously gratified to know that we had been able to achieve a good deal in overcoming the relative slackness in the system that particularly emerged during the period of the previous government in that whole area of compliance and fraud control, we never for a minute suggested that that was the end of the process. What we did say was that the idea that there were huge spectacular further gains to be made from further compliance arrangements or anti-fraud measures was likely to be illusory. We worked over time with new measures. I think in every budget there would be a fairly exhaustive search for new effective compliance measures. The trick is to come up with genuine compliance measures and not bogus ones. The Finance Department used to put up some pretty significant hoops in that regard, but we did continue to maintain our efforts in that area. I think a great deal was achieved in bringing about a more adequate social safety net, making sure that it was efficiently targeted, making sure that it was efficiently administered, overcoming barriers to work force participation by people getting social security payments, and taking effective steps to minimise, to the maximum extent feasible, fraud and abuse of the system. The Working Nation statement, of course, was a very major effort in the latter regard where we announced a very substantial increase in assistance for the unemployed through labour market program assistance. However, at the same time we said that if we are going to have that very large boost in assistance to the unemployed we do think it is reasonable to introduce a tightened scheme of reciprocal obligations. In the context of that Working Nation exercise, within the government at the time, we had quite a debate about the appropriate level of tightness and the appropriate level of severity of penalties for people not complying with administrative or activity agreement requirements. There was significant tightening but that tightening was done in the context of a comprehensive package of further measures designed to assist the unemployed find work. It is a very different situation to be tightenof ing reciprocal obligations under those circumstances compared with doing it in a situation where you are doing the exact opposite-in other words, massively cutting the available assistance to the unemployed find work. That brings me to the question of our response to the measures in this bill. We are not opposing all of the measures; some of them we support. There are other measures that we will be opposing and we will be moving in the House to delete certain schedyear-old ules or to amend certain schedules pursuant to that. There are other areas such as in activity testing area where Senator Faulkner, who is the shadow spokesman, is continuing bill. to work on developing alternatives to some of the measures that the government has put forward in this legislation. In respect of of those matters I will not be moving specific amendments here but they will, of course, moved in the Senate. Labor's response to all the measures announced in the 1996 budget is based on three criteria: does the measure betray a promise; is it equitable, and does it contribute to national savings? The approach that Labor will take in addressing this piece of legislation will follow the same criteria. We have look for work. examined these measures and we have consulted widely with peak and community that groups, with constituents and with those directly affected by the measures. We have examined, and we will continue to examine, the measures in detail through the Senate estimates process. We will address our own concerns and the concerns that have been expressed to us by those we have met with by seeking amendments to a number of these measures to ensure the legislation reflects a commitment to equity and the social safety net. Unfortunately, the bill has been foisted upon us with very little time to consider or resolve its large number of complex measures. The lack of time to reach the level of legislative detail we require forces us to move a number of basic amendments omitting schedules as expressions of our opposition to particular measures. However, we will be foreshadowing a number more detailed amendments to other schedsorts of ules of the bill in the Senate. Let me now go through the particular measures. Schedules 1 and 2 look to increase the flexibility of carer pension and change the to carer pension to carer payment. These measures will be supported by the Labor Party. They reflect, almost exactly, the position we took on carers in the lead-up to the 2 March election. Obviously, we do not have a problem with them. Schedule 3 seeks to abolish the minimum rate of payment to under 18sickness allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance recipients. the The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit this schedule from the The government is proposing to introduce the youth allowance from January 1998 by some merging all major forms of income support for young people including YTA, JSA, NSA, be Austudy and Abstudy. The proposed youth allowance will be means tested on parents' income and will cover young people aged 16 to 20 and students up to 25 years. The government is consulting on the new youth allowance, and rightly so. The proposal has far-reaching implications for our young people and their incentives to train and to The above changes should be considered in context. Abolishing the minimum rate of YTA and cutting under-18-year-olds off payment on the basis of parents' income opens the door to doing the same for young people up to 25 years. It would be premature in the extreme to pursue this measure in the absence of results from this consultation process. Schedule 4 allows unemployed people to undertake unlimited voluntary work to meet their activity test requirements. These measures will be supported by the Labor Party. Again, this was Labor's policy in the lead-up to the 1996 election and we stand by it. Schedule 5 seeks to tighten the activity test administration and simplify the penalty periods that apply to newstart allowance and youth training allowance, while schedule 6 seeks to tighten the provisions relating to unemployment due to industrial action. The Labor Party will be making detailed amendments to this schedule of the bill in the Senate. While we support tough measures in regard to fraud and compliance, we do not believe that people should be cut off payments without good reason or for inordinate or indefinite periods of time. We believe that the proposed new activity test regime is one that is excessively harsh and unreasonable. We believe that elements of the proposal are unworkable and unfairly penalise honest and genuine job seekers. The proposed new meaning of 'unsuitable work' is an extreme one which puts the onus on job seekers to negotiate and overcome issues that may make a job unsuitable. The onus will be on them to negotiate issues of occupational health and safety in a workplace. The onus will be on them to negotiate training for a job where they lack the qualifications, skills or experience necessary. Job seekers must provide medical evidence to prove that particular work is unsuitable because of an illness, disability or injury. The onus is on job seekers to consider self-employment or moving home to take up work. The new definition of 'sufficient reason' to refuse a job offer is equally severe. The National Welfare Rights Network have identified a number of concerns about the existing penalties that operate. Obviously these are matters of concern that we had to think about very carefully in government. If you are going to substantially ramp up the penalties in the ways proposed, any problems will be exacerbated. The changes proposed in this bill will, as I said, exacerbate the situation. People who are already poor and needy will be left without payment or assistance for six weeks, and for three months for subsequent breaches. Further, to make people go for six months-up from 12 weeks-without payment for moving to an area of lower employment prospects is extremely harsh and unfair. The proposal to require completed employer contact certificates to be provided with an initial claim for unemployment payments is unreasonable. As we well know, asking a potential employer to complete an employer contact certificate at an interview can often jeopardise the person's chances of getting a job. Reclassifying certain breaches as activity test breaches will greatly increase the list of actions which may result in a non-payment period. Introducing a rate reduction period for administrative breaches instead of a non-payment period is preferable and we will be examining this option further. The savings are so massive that it is clear that many people will suffer with payments being cut or withheld. Schedule 7 relates to waiting periods and is dealt with in two parts. The Labor Party will be seeking amendments to this schedule in the Senate. We do not want to see people left without payments for inordinate or indefinite periods of time, nor do we think that it is fair for people to be forced to run down their savings. Schedules 8 and 9 relate to sickness, newstart and youth training allowances and to the lodgement of claims by sick or temporarily incapacitated people. The Labor Party will be supporting these measures. These measures are sensible changes which streamline what are currently complex administrative arrangements. Schedule 10 abolishes the earnings credit scheme. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. Let me make this quite clear. The coalition in their pre-election social security policy said: People who are unemployed should be given every incentive to work. If a person is not able to find full-time work, he or she may be able to obtain part-time work. Part-time work will supplement the person's income, provide employment skills and assist the transition back into the full-time work force. The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a coalition government. This is a direct broken promise; this is a clear betrayal of the Australian people. The Labor Party will oppose it. These arrangements, introduced by Labor, gave pensioners and allowees an incentive to take up casual or temporary work that became available by allowing them to supplement their payments without immediately or necessarily reducing their level of payment. Now people may be deterred from taking up this kind of employment, making their attachment to the labour force even more marginal. A total of 121,900 customers a year are expected to receive a reduction in payment for periods of time, saving $259 million over four years. But these savings will arise only if people continue to take up this kind of work. Now, they may not. Schedule 11 abolishes the employment entry payment for all social security recipients and abolishes the education entry payment for all non-pensioners. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. Again, let me make it quite clear that the coalition's pre-election social security policy said: To assist people to make the transition from being unemployed to work or education, the Coalition will maintain the current employment and education entry payments. This measure breaks that promise. Again, Labor will oppose this. On entering employment, most social security recipients encounter considerable costs associated with the purchase of clothes suitable for work force participation and payment of child-care and transport costs. These costs are particularly high for disability pensioners who may have to purchase additional supports or require attendant care. This is also true for people entering education. New students need to purchase textbooks, stationery, equipment and supplies. These costs can be very hard to meet for people who have relied on income support for a length of time. The employment entry payment and the education entry payment introduced by Labor were recognition of these costs and gave assistance in meeting them to further remove barriers to employment and education for social security recipients. Schedule 12 relates to widows and partners. Whilst supporting the large part of this schedule-these are changes that make administrative sense-we have serious concerns about the perhaps unintended effects of this measure, particularly for migrant women, and we will be seeking to omit items 26 and 27 of the schedule from the bill. By doing this, alternative payments to special benefit will still be available for women over age pension age who cannot, because of residency conditions, claim age pension. This will protect women who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Schedule 13 tightens the eligibility for disability support pension by inserting revised disability impairment tables. The Labor Party has concerns regarding this measure and today I foreshadow that we will be moving substantive amendments to this schedule in the Senate. Schedule 14 limits the payment of child disability allowance arrears to three months before a claim is made. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. This measure is unacceptably harsh in failing to recognise the hardship which would be suffered by parents of children with disabilities which take over three months to diagnose or where it takes more than three months to establish a pattern of extra care and attention. Schedule 15 relates to compensation payments and how they affect social security payments and is dealt with in two parts. With part 1, the extension of compensation recovery provisions to age pensions, the Labor Party will be supporting this measure. With part 2, amendments relating to the treatment of lump sum compensation payments, the Labor Party will be seeking to amend this schedule of the bill in the Senate to remove the new divisor. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will be subject to much longer periods without payments forcing them to use their compensation at a much lower rate before they are eligible for financial assistance or continued assistance. Schedule 16 relates to the compensation provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, dealt with in three parts, and it is mainly of a technical nature. The Labor Party will be supporting this measure. Schedules 17, 18 and 19 rationalise concession card arrangements for pensioners and allowees. The Labor Party will be supporting these measures. Schedule 20 relates to the application of below threshold deeming rate. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. The Labor Party supports measures which encourage social security recipients to maximise the returns of their resources. But this measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access amounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. Under half of all financial institutions make these available and not all are available to pensioners and allowees. Further, very few currently offer the deemed rate of interest on small deposit accounts of the below threshold rate. The measure relies on financial institutions moving to providing accounts which pay the deeming rate on these accounts. There is little evidence that these financial institutions will do this and, indeed, some regional banks have recently moved in precisely the opposite direction, from paying five per cent on accounts under $2,000 to paying one per cent. An estimated 721,000 pensioners-600,OOO DSS and 121,000 DVA-will be affected. Around 60,000 allowees will also be affected. Schedule 21 relates to overpayment and debt recovery. The Labor Party will be opposing the redefinition of recoverable debt and will be moving substantive amendments in the Senate to effect this. Unrecoverable debts in most cases arise where a customer is overpaid due to the administrative error of DSS. This applies whether or not the person realised they were being overpaid. A debt may be identified a long while, perhaps many years, after the overpayment. Customers will now be forced to repay money they did not realise they owed. The coalition opposed similar measures that we had tried to put up. Schedule 22 tightens the social security entitlements advance payment scheme. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. The number of advances and the amount of money involved in each advance will be reduced as a result of this measure. The scheme has been very successful in helping JSA-NSA recipients participate in activities to help them find employment and the in helping pensioners meet living and capital expenses for the pensioner or a family member. To restrict the advances would restrict these activities. The advances are repaid. There is no evidence to say the system is being abused. The only justification for this measure is administrative simplicity; that is, this measure is for the DSS, not for the people. Schedule 23 deals with other technical amendments. The Labor Party will be supporting this schedule. Schedule 24 deals with application, transition and savings provisions. The Labor Party will be moving consequential amendments flowing from action taken on other schedules. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, cuts which mainly affect low income people account for more than 30 per cent of all expenditure cuts in the coalition's 1996-97 budget. Under the guise of simplification, the coalition has broken many of its pre-election commitments, specifically in terms of not hurting the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. The amendments to be moved by the Labor Party to this bill have the effect of holding the coalition to its promises and, to a large extent, ameliorating the unnecessarily harsh and punitive measures proposed by the coalition. Labor cannot and will not stand by and allow the most vulnerable in our community to pay the price for the coalition's ideological obsessions.",48
56,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The main budget themes featured in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 are: greater simplification of and consistency in the very complex social security system inherited from the Labor government; keeping our commitments to the poor and needy; requiring people with assets and income to use those resources first before seeking assistance from their fellow citizens and taxpayers; and stopping rorts in the social security system that have been allowed by the previous government. In 1996-97, the budget proposes a very modest reduction in the social security outlays. That is totally consistent with the government's public position to look at the most vulnerable in our society. In summarising the measures in this bill, I wish to concentrate on the following: the national carer action plan; the introduction of revised impairment for disability support pension; consolidation and simplification of voluntary work provisions; the arrangements for widows and older unemployed; the amendment of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to the pension rate calculator; and the new government shop front. In terms of the national carer action plan, the government recognises the valuable contribution and service that carers provide to the community. The day-today care of a severely disabled person is difficult and stressful because it is unrelenting. The pressures of meeting the demands of the disabled impact heavily on the carer's privacy, employment opportunities and financial stability. Furthermore, continuous care is an emotional and physical drain on the carer that can create social isolation, depression and ill health. Disability also impacts heavily on a family unit. It has a negative effect on job mobility, promotion and their choice of house. A person with a disability also needs special equipment, increased medical assistance and special respite or child care. The figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirm that nearly half the principal carers of a child with a handicap felt the effects of reduced income or extra expenses because of their caring role. Personal financial hardship is suffered by carers, and many are living below the poverty line. Carers also lack employment and income security. They are not encouraged to maintain paid work, but are discouraged from employment by inadequate carer services and unresponsive, inflexible employers and workplaces. Furthermore, carers have their working lives suspended or terminated as a result of their caring responsibilities. The taxation system does not accommodate their costs or needs, and carers lack access to superannuation and to education and training programs. The changes announced in the 1996-97 budget will make life easier for carers. The government has delivered on its election commitment of income support arrangements for carers. These changes will increase flexibility for carers. The government will extend the hours-from 10 to 20 hours per weekthat a carer may participate in paid or voluntary work, education or training, thus allowing carers the chance to develop, update or maintain their skills. This will enable a smoother transition for them when they are able to return to the work force. The availability of flexible respite care is vital to carers. However, often there is a reluctance for carers to use respite. The reasons range from a reluctance to leave their family members with a stranger; a limited availability and awareness of quality care; difficulty in recruiting and maintaining carer providers; financial concerns; bureaucratic obstacles and transportation problems. Carers must therefore be educated and given the opportunity and access to respite care, including crisis care. Out of the diverse range of formal support needed by carers, this is probably the most critical. Carers want and need respite as an ongoing regular alternative, so that they have an opportunity to have a decent quality of life. This bill will increase the respite period from 42 to 52 days a year, so that a carer can temporarily cease caring without their eligibility being affected. This allows carers to use respite care services and ease the pressure on their caring responsibilities. While I am on the subject of carers, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the efforts of the Queensland branch of the Independent Living Centre. The Independent Living Centre is a non-government, non-profit community service that provides information and advice on equipment and resources for carers and people with disabilities. The staff at the Independent Living Centre are practical and creative in their approach in helping carers to make a more informed choice about solutions to their problems. Also, the mobile service which travels the state is a valuable asset to the community. Many constituents from my electorate have made use of their very valuable services. The proposal to introduce revised impairment tables for the disability support pension will tighten the assessment process. This will ensure that those customers whose impairment has only a relatively small impact on their overall ability to work do not qualify for the disability support pension, but instead receive a more appropriate income support. To qualify for the disability support pension, a claimant must have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of at least 20 per cent, as assessed under the impairment tables, and a continuing inability to work. The previous government had already begun a process to review the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension. This bill puts into effect the initial findings of a review process and ensures that benefits are targeted and individuals are given the most appropriate form of assistance for their circumstances. The disability support pension will continue to be available for those customers whose impairment substantially affects their ability to work. The government's voluntary work initiative was an election commitment contained in both the government's social security policy statement, 'A social security safety net', and the employment and policy training policy, 'Pathways to a real job'. As a result, the government has put in place measures to increase the voluntary work participation for unemployed people 50 years of age and over. Currently, a person on jobsearch allowance aged 50 years and over is limited to 65 days full-time voluntary work a year. Under the government's initiative, these people will be able to undertake full-time voluntary work for an unlimited number of days each year, and still remain qualified for the unemployment payments. The requirements that voluntary work must be with an organisation approved by the employment secretary will be retained. Careful consideration will be given to matching volunteer needs to program goals. Training and ongoing education will be provided if necessary, and volunteers will receive ongoing support in their job roles from staff and other volunteers. This bill recognises the importance of voluntary work to organisations such as the Queensland Cancer Fund and on an individual level. The Queensland Cancer Fund is supported throughout Queensland by a large team of volunteers from a wide variety of social, economic and educational backgrounds. The annual doorknock is this weekend, and the Queensland Cancer Fund will enlist the support of over 17,000 volunteers. Besides fundraising, volunteers play a vital role in many of the Queensland Cancer Fund programs such as education, patient and conimunity services and administration. Voluntary work allows people to improve their skills, but also recognises the benefit of voluntary work to employers and the general community. This legislation is proposed in recognition of the voluntary work to the community and to the volunteers themselves. It removes restrictions on the amount of full time voluntary work for unemployed people aged 50 and over, and increases the allowable amount of voluntary work for social security customers of all ages. In view of the particular difficulties faced by many older unemployed in the market, it also introduces a new means for the older unemployed to satisfy an activity. This new combination of paid work and voluntary work builds on an existing exemption from the activity test of older unemployed in receipt of income support for 12 months or more who earn at least 35 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, which is currently $245 per week. For people undertaking full-time voluntary work, only 32 hours per week are required to satisfy the activity test. This differs from the 40 hours that are required for a combination of voluntary work and paid work. This difference is due to special recognition being given to people providing their labour without payment. It also takes account of existing rules within the volunteer sector that restrict volunteers from working for one organisation for more than 16 hours per week. Since coming into office in March, I have had a number of inquiries about the changes to the widow allowance. These inquiries have come from women who have been left in a very vulnerable position. These women have lost the financial and emotional support of a partner and have no recent work force experience. As from 20 March 1997 the widow allowance will be extended to women aged at least 50 years who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. This measure will help older women who were widowed before turning 50 but who have not been able to find work because they have limited work force experience. This legislation will provide common payment arrangements for those women. Payment arrangements for those women will also be simplified. This rationalisation of payment will improve government services to these women. There is no doubt this bill will benefit all those women who were widowed, separated or divorced and it goes a considerable way towards easing eligibility criteria as per our election commitment. The Social Security Act of 1991 will be amended to correct an error in the pension rate calculator A. When the previous government amended the Social Security Act in 1992 inappropriate consequential amendments were made which dealt with how a person's reduction for ordinary income was worked out. The revised table failed to address the situation of a person who is a member of a couple and whose partner is receiving a social security or service pension, although this had previously been done. The amendments made by schedule 4 in this bill merely reinstate the pre-January position. These amendments remedy an unintended effect of amendments put in place under the former government. There will be no effect on customers as the legislation has been applied as intended since 1993; in other words, the error had not been picked up. This error should have been picked up in 1993 because failure to reinstate the pre-January 1993 position has the potential to result in additional program outlays of between $600 million and $700 million per annum. The government has announced the establishment of a new agency to deliver the full range of social security payments including initial registration of unemployed, access to information about labour market vacancies and referral to specialist employment placement enterprises. The new shopfront will also deliver the revised child-care assistance arrangements for families and payments currently delivered by Social Security for other Commonwealth agencies. Over time the agency is expected to deliver more Commonwealth services and programs. Initially, the program will absorb the service delivery network of Social Security and some of the existing CES labour exchange functions and delivery of student assistance. These changes will deliver a much improved service for social security recipients and other people receiving government assistance. Government assistance will be more accessible for busy Australians and the public and private sector can provide a level of service equal to and better than private sector service organisations. The location of shopfronts will take into account the government's commitment to provide services to regional Australia. The government is already on the job to improve the telephone service inadequately managed by the previous government. This will be a key feature in the new arrangements. The new shopfront will have a customer service charter and guaranteed standards of service. In conclusion, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 keeps the coalition government's commitment to the poor and needy. This legislation offers simplification 1993 and greater consistency in the very complex social security system inherited from Labor. It will also require those Australians with assets and income to use their resources first before seeking assistance from their fellow citizens and taxpayers. Most importantly, it will stop the rorts in the social security system. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend this bill to the House.",56
57,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I understand people wanting to put a gloss on things which are unpalatable, but I do not think I have ever before heard the like of what I have just heard just now, that somehow savings of $1.2 billion made in this bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996, which is money taken off unemployed, off pensioners, off widows, off all kinds of beneficiaries, is somehow benefiting them. I will give some examples. Firstly, the provisions have been changed to allow more voluntary work and make it easier. I do not know whether the previous speaker, the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace), who was so laudatory of this measure, actually knows it, but that will save the government $7 million. There is a saving involved. So how come the people are better off? Secondly, there is the widows pension. Of course there were concerns from the women of Australia about the changes to widows' entitlements in terms of the whole nature of change of work and so on, but the changes being proposed in these amendments save $22 million. Who from? Widows. The widows are contributing $22 million towards the government revenues. That is terrific for them and I am sure they are delighted about it. In fact, what I am sure of is that they do not actually know it is happening, because this budget is so opaque and so obscure and so difficult to find out what is being proposed and the impact of those changes. I have never seen the like of it before. But people will eventualtake ly find out when it comes to them, and in that context it is worthwhile examining some of the proposed changes. The one that is in some ways the nastiest and the most vicious is the earnings credit scheme, where the pensioners of Australia are going to be paying $259 million to the government or getting that much less in support-and that is keeping the government's promise to the old people of Australia. If that is keeping their promise, I would hate to see it when they break one. I will quote what was said in the second reading speech in this chamber with regard to the earnings credit scheme: Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand. The limited understanding of the scheme by social security recipients puts in doubt its value as a significant incentive to take up casual work opportunities. Given this, as well as the relatively high cost involved, the government has decided to abolish the credit scheme in respect to both pensions and benefits. Doesn't that sound terrific? They are doing us all a favour. It is too hard to understand, people are not really using it and it is expensive to administer. What the minister did not say was that the savings are $259 million. There will be less pensions paid and benefits paid in the four years involved of a quarter of a billion dollars. That is what it is really about. Yet in the second reading speech, when he knows the public would not understand the details, when no figures are given, he pretends to make out that this is somehow beneficial. This is the scheme that was talked about as the Santa Claus scheme. I expect you recall that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The problem we had was that many retired people and people on benefits were getting casual work, it may be a week, it may be two weeks at a time, for instance, acting as a Santa Claus at Christmas time. Literally thousands of older people did that and they got paid this money, which meant they lost their pension for a week. So it was really a nasty problem. The previous government said, 'Okay, if you earn a certain amount a year, we should the year into account, as we do for taxation.' In that way, someone could work as Santa Claus for a couple of weeks, earn a thousand dollars, and not lose any pension. The current government hates Santa Clauses, it hates Christmas, but most of all it hates pensioners, and that is who it is attacking. This is a vicious exercise. It is put forward as a benefit, but it is so complicated that noone understands it. If no-one understands it, how is it going to save a quarter of a billion dollars? What a load of deceitful, deceptive, misleading claptrap from the minister. It will not be a saving because people will not do the work. That is tragic. For many people, being employed for a week or two a year, or for a couple of days a week over time, is important. It gives them an outing. It involves them. It gives them an external application. That is all going to go. People will say, 'Why bother if I am going to lose my pension for that week?' That will create more uncertainty, more confusion, and more insecurity. They will be told, 'You did not declare your income, therefore you got a pension you should not have got.' That will happen because no-one is going to know about it and so they will be penalised. They will have to pay it back with interest. So the savings may well come from penalties rather than from actual loss of pension. This measure is indicative of this budget. It is a nasty, mean and vicious budget. The savings are illusory. Another nasty measure is the one for 16to 18-year-olds on jobsearch allowance. Back in the rnid-1980s, 16-year-olds received the dole at full payment for their age group. That was changed to a jobsearch allowance at a partial payment of 50 per cent, non-means tested. The aim of that was to say, 'Once you leave school, your parents' income, whilst it is important, is not the sole factor. You will get an allowance to help you look for work and the allowance is not means tested on your parents' income.' That has now been wiped out. The harshest test of all is being applied, namely, the Austudy test. That means that thousands of young Australians will no longer get help looking for work. Their families, in many cases under difficult circumstances, will be forced to provide the extra money for them to fill in CV s, catch transport and do all the things involved in searching for work. Most importantly, it will put enormous stress on those families. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, from evidence before the parliamentary inquiry on youth homelessness that the tension in families in difficult circumstances where the young people have not got jobs is quite high. This measure will blow those families apart. The small amounts they are getting at the moment will go. They will get no income whatsoever. They will be relying solely on their families to provide them with both pocket money and support for looking for work up to the age of 18. What is the justification for that kind of nastiness? It is $29 million over four years. That is a minuscule amount. The government is targeting the most vulnerable. It is targeting the weakestunemployed 16to 18-year-olds who are looking for work and are under enormous pressure. Through the provisions of this legislation, their families will be told, 'You find the money for the bus fares. You find the money for the applications. You find the money for clothes. They can keep applying for jobs.' This is the government which says it cares about the people in most need. This is the one which cares about youth. This one measure alone will cause substantial increases in youth homelessness because those young people will find that pressures on their families and themselves will cause them to leave home. That is what will happen. The savings involved will be illusory. They will not occur. Throughout this legislation there are mean and nasty exercises which are aimed at some notional saving, most of which the community is not aware of. When individuals become aware of what is going on, they will recognise the stunts that are being pulled. That includes things like the nasty little one of the deeming of the first $2,000 of pensioners' savings. The first $2,000 free of deeming has gone. The nastiness of that for a government that promised not to affect pensioners is paramount.",60

Is the Prime Minister also aware that the ANZ's Chief Economist, Saul Eslake, said on ABC radio on Monday, 7 October 1996 that unemployment is now likely to rise above nine per cent in the next six months? Will the Prime Minister now commit the government to a jobs target?",62
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member asks a very important question about an important issue. Let me say a few things in response to the question that has been asked by the honourable member. Yes, I have seen the material to which he referred. That will not surprise him. I also happened to hear the interview on the ABC. That ought not to surprise him, either. I do not think it would surprise the honourable member for me to say to him that unemployment remains a very significant social and economic challenge in this country. Economically, with, I think, the acceptance of most people who are genuinely concerned about the issue, it is a lagged indicator of economic activity. The government has persistently said that the significant reduction in the level of unemploymentMr Crean-Set a target.",62

64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We will have no noisy exchanges.,62
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will not reduce unemployment in this country in a lasting fashion until a number of developments occur. The first of those is that we have a sustained higher rate of economic growth than we have at present. The second requirement is that we have a far less rigid labour market than we have at present. We have put forward concise proposals to deal with the problem of the labour market. Even though people will argue as to the impact of labour market deregulation so far as its timing is concerned on the rate of unemployment, it remains the faet that in the medium to longer term a freer labour market will over time produce a lower rate of unemployment. If you doubt that, look at the experience of countries around the world that have freer labour markets. Look at their unemployment levels. They are significantly below the unemployment levels in this country. The Australian Labor Party is always prepared, when faced with a choice between a regulated labour market dominated by the trade union movement or a lower level of unemployment, to choose the regulated labour market. In response to the honourable member for Batman, the two imperatives for a reduction over time in unemployment in this country are a freeing of the labour market and those policies which will, over that time-frame, produce a sustained rise in the level of economic activity. You had 13 years to solve unemployment in this country and you were thrown out of office because you failed to do so. The proposition that after 13 years of your neglect, 13 years of your failure, in 6Y2 months this government should have solved the problem is a proposition that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people completely reject. Seaview Commission of Inquiry",62
66,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Transport and Regional Development aware of a statement by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Justice Fisher, in response to yesterday's report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Relations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air? Can the minister inform the House of his response to this statement?",62
67,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his interest and his question. He has a great interest in aviation, being a pilot and an aircraft owner. Yesterday I tabled in this House Justice Staunton's report of the inquiry into the relations between CAA and Seaview Air which was initiated after the death of nine people in a crash occurring with Seaview Air on 2 October 1994. It was a very serious report highlighting some very substantial failings in the manner in which the CAA operates its functions and indeed also of the way Seaview Air operated its functions prior to the crash. I am aware, as the honourable member has asked me, of a statement made by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Justice Fisher. He made a press statement yesterday in which he responded to the report that I tabled into the inquiry into relations between the CAA and Seaview Air. He says: It appears that the errors that were made were not errors of expertise. Having read the report, I think anybody who has read the report would agree that that response by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is inappropriate and, indeed, quite absurd. The reason it is absurd is that Justice Staunton has highlighted throughout his report great errors of judgment and a lack of expertise and competence. Throughout the report there are endless examples of a lack of expertise and competence. I find the response by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority quite inappropriate and absurd, and it dismays me. I refer the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to the report. Justice Staunton says: In three years the CAA did very little and discovered almost nothing. He goes on to say: The CAA ignored warning after warning. It failed to act on intelligence communicated repeatedly to it. The upgrading process to RPT suffered as a result. Moreover, the CAA processed the upgrading with only minimal attention to its own guidelines. If anybody has any doubts that it was a major failure of a lack of expertise on behalf of the CAA, those sorts of quotes and many others littered throughout that report would confirm that. I make the point to the House that I will be meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Mr Leroy Keith, later on this afternoon. I will be urging Mr Keith to ensure that the recommendations made by Justice Staunton are taken up by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible. I also take this opportunity to urge the Chairman and members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to reconsider their position on the board, to enable us to appoint to that board people with relevant aviation expertise. This is a very serious issue. Anybody reading that report undertaken by Justice Staunton will realise the enormity of the problem that there is before those who wish to reform the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to build a proper safety regulator in Australia. That task is not a task for amateurs; it is a task for professionals. We need people who know the industry, who have a lifetime's worth of experience in the industry, in order to enact the reforms that are necessary and which are highlighted by Justice Staunton in his report. I assure this House and members of the public that this government, following the tabling of the report yesterday, will do everything within its power to ensure that we have an effective, competent and reliable aviation safety regulator in Australia so that aviation can be safe-safer than it has been for a long time. Unemployment",62
68,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Access Economics has forecast, based on passage of the budget and implementation of the government's labour market reform agenda, that Australia's unemployment rate will rise above nine per cent early in 1997 and that it will average 9.2 per cent in the years 2000 and 200 I? Does the Prime Minister agree with these forecasts, which give no hope for young Australians seeking a job over the next five years?",63
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have had the gist of that forecast by Access Economics drawn to my attention. I have not read all the detail of it. I say to the honourable gentleman that what I said in answer to the question from the member for Batman remains the case. I take the opportunity of saying that I did the member for Batman a disservice. I did not answer every particular in his question. He asked me whether I would commit myself to a target. I say to the honourable member for Batman that the answer to that question is no. The reason for giving the answer to that question is precisely similar to the reasoning that was adopted by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It is remarkable how these sorts of statements come back to haunt people. Let me quote from the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, speaking on II March 1993. This is what he had to say: I think it is very unwise to set targets ... I repeat: I think it is very unwise to set targets that indicate that you achieve satisfaction at a particular I think with the unemployment levels that we looking at and you would know all about the unemploystake ment levels that you were looking atwe have to have an objective to be constantly bringing them down and not set arbitrarily any of targets which would satisfy us.",63

72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a point of order on relevance. The point of order on relevance that this was a question asked of the Prime Minister about setting a target on levels of unemployment to be achieved. The quote that he is utilising was from a speech which dealt with whether or not you could set a target what constituted full employment, which is totally different question.",64
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,64
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So every time the opposition comes into this House asking us to set targets, they will be reminded of what you said when you were in government. Nothing that you can now say and nothing that the ants minions behind you can now say is going to alter that one fundamental fact. You know as well as I do that every time you raise that subject you will be reminded of what you about the setting of unemployment targets. Your frivolous points of order merely underline your supreme sensitivity on the subject. Mr Hollis- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the report from Access Economics. Leave not granted.

76,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and, yes, I have seen those reports. The short answer to the quespoint. tion is yes. The government's proposed are amendments represent a balance between the interests of all groups and industries with a in the native title legislation. At the same time as we recognise the particular interests of the Aboriginal people, it is in the set interests of all Australians to provide greater certainty over land tenure and, therefore, investment, especially as we seek to turn around Australia's very serious current account deficit, something the previous government exacerbated rather than ever seriously tackling. The Minerals Council spokesman, Mr Barry is Vellnagel, says that the amendments are sensible and practical. The Western Australian government has already indicated its willingness to cooperate on the basis of the amended legislation. Native title is now a part of on Australia's common law, but the Native Title a Act as currently formulated is unworkable, to the detriment of all. There have been over 400 claims made and progress towards determination in these cases has been glacial at best. That is in no-one's interest. In terms of interaction with the mining industry in particular, major problems include the emergence of multiple native title claimto a single piece of land, the fact that the right to negotiate process can be triggered at the exploration stage as well as at subsequent stages, the triggering of the need for negotiasaid tion with claimants whenever a pre-1994 mining lease is renewed and the costs and uncertainties associated with unduly lengthy periods of negotiation and arbitration. The proposed amendments will enable exploration, for example, to be excluded from the right to negotiate. Only a very small percentage of exploration leases ultimately result in the development of a mine. At present, companies are tied up in endless negotiation which, at the end of the day, will be of little or no benefit to Aboriginal people. The amendments will also provide for a mining project to be subjected to the right to negotiate process only once. Currently, there are a multitude of decision points in the administration of the mineral exploration and mining lease system which can activate the right to negotiate. The amendments allow for earlier intervention by the minister in exceptional cases, during the right to negotiate and prior to an arbitral decision. In relation to multiple claims it will no longer be possible for different persons to register applications on behalf of the same group over the same area, nor will individuals be able to make a claim except on behalf of a group. The registration test, which is a precondition to the right to negotiate, will be further tightened to reduce the possibility of multiple claims. There are situations at present where companies are negotiating with up to eight different groups of Aboriginal claimants in relation to the same piece of land. This is clearly unsatisfactory and counterproductive for companies and Aboriginal groups. The amendments will also enable pre-1994 leases to be renewed without triggering the act and will shorten the time limits on negotiation and arbitration from six to four months. The use of indigenous land use agreements will also be encouraged. The amendments set up a statutory framework for representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies. In total, they are an appropriate response to the difficulties with the act, while we await the outcome of the Wik hearing and, in particular, its reference to the effect of pastoral lease holdings on native title. These amendments will produce a better outcome for all Australians. Computer Bounty",64
77,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's budget decision to axe the computer bounty. Is the Prime Minister aware that General Power Controls, a high-tech company based in Penrith in the Lindsay electorate which manufactures and exports to the United States, Europe and Japan, may lose export orders to overseas competitors as a result of this decision? This will threaten the jobs of the existing 320 employees and the extra 80 people that the company was going to take on. Isn't this yet another reason why unemployment under your budget is projected to rise to over nine per cent? Will the Prime Minister visit the factory in Penrith and see first-hand the effect of this decision on the people of Lindsay?",65
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am indebted to the member for Hotham for bringing the situation of a particular company to my attention. I will investigateMr Crean-Will you visit it?,65
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hang on, I will answer your question. It is always a very good idea, when you characters make allegations, to check out the facts before you respond to them; so what I will do for the member for Hotham is that I will have a look at the facts and I will visit-the other thing that I will do is that I will remind youMr Crean-You said you will visit!",65
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I will visit your recollection of what your leader said when you were last in government. Let me say to the member for Hotham and to those opposite that if you are really interested in doing something about reducing unemployment in this country, instead of trying to generate scare stories about the job security of Australians, which is precisely what you have done, do you know what you should do? You would vote to pass the government's budget if you were really interested because of the effect every day that you vote against the passage of the government's budget. If you were interested in jobs in the resource industry you would vote to pass the amendments to the Native Title Act because as my colleagueMr Crean-We'll vote against the bounty.",65
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are going to vote against it, are you? Are you going to vote against the Native Title Act amendments? Oh! You haven't decided yet but Daryl says you are going to vote against them. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I have said that we will vote against the bounty; and that we will do to protect these jobs.",66
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,66
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you follow the dictum of the member for Banks you are going to vote against amendments to the Native Title Act, amendments which will improve employment opportunities in the resource sector. You have no credibility to lecture the government about unemployment. Taxation",66
84,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen recent comments that Australians are undertaxed and that there is a case for revenue increases? Does the Treasurer agree with these calls to increase taxes and what would be the economic impact on battling families and small businesses of such increases? Mr Gareth Evans-Your budget contains $7.6 billion worth of revenue increases!,66
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,66
86,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interjecting: he must feel another case of sickness coming on because there is a very big difference between the government and the opposition in relation to economic policy. The opposition maintains it is in balancing the budget over the next three years, but it is opposing $18 billion worth expenditure measures over the forward estimates. If it is in fact in favour of balancing the budget, let me make it entirely clear that it can come from only one place: where Labor has always stood-from higher taxes. Let there be no dispute whatsoever that a vote for the Labor Party in the by-election of Lindsay is a vote for higher taxes. A vote for Labor in Lindsay is not 'Free'; it is very expensive indeed. As I disclosed to the House yesterday, to get the kinds of levels that would be required to get to a budget balance, the measures you would be looking at would be increases in income taxes, increases in wholesale sales taxes or, alternatively, another 20c a litre in the excise on petrol. I tend to believe that it is the excise on petrol that the Labor Party would really be interested in. Mr Beazley interjecting",66
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition.,66
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that when the barrage comes from you, old son, you are very worried. Very shortly you will get up on a point of order. That is normally what you do at this stage. Oh! Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Constantly you have upheld the point of order that requires the minister to refer to members on our side by their seat or their title. I ask you to uphold that point of order again.",66
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The provision will be upheld. I am sure the Treasurer is aware of his responsibilities.,66
90,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hotham very much for the way in which he intervened. Let us put the record down. In 1983, the Labor Party inherited a 6c a litre petrol excise.",66
91,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The loaded dog.,66
92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By 1996, Labor had",66
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. Loaded dogs lead to loaded favour of guns. Mine is loaded. Be warned.,66
94,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1983, the Labor of Party had a 6c a litre petrol excise, which by 1996 they had taken to 36c a litre-from 6c to 36c a litre. Nobody should have any doubt that, if the Labor Party had its way, it would be right back where it was in its last term of government: increasing wholesale sales tax rates, increasing petrol excise rates, breaking its promise in relation to taxes that was made before the last election. This plan has been disclosed by none other than the official spokesman on economic policy for the opposition, the member for Holt. The member for Holt said quite clearly and quite plainly that he believed Australia was 'undertaxed by any relevant international standard' and 'there is a case for having some overall revenue increases'. He is joined by his assistant, the member for Werriwa, who says: It is time to give the big end of town a bit a bit of old-fashioned Labor stick, when it comes to tax policy. The old-fashioned Labor tax stick is increases in wholesale sales tax rates and increases in petrol excise. I will tell you what it never was, though, Mr Speaker: it was never the courage to deal with the R&D syndicates. The Labor Party never had the courage to do that. The member for Hotham wants to bring back tax benefits for high income earners. Let there be no mistake about it: a vote for Labor in Lindsay is a vote for higher taxes on low income earners and tax breaks for the wealthy. That is the Labor stick on tax policy. Unemployment",66
95,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the DEETY A leading indicator of employment for August released just a few minutes ago has declhed for the fifth month in a row? Yes, Prime Minister, that is for every single month since your government was elected. Given that this adds to the mounting body of evidence showing job opportunities crashing around your government's ears, why is there not one single mention of unemployment",67
96,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The standing orders, in particular No. 144, say: The following general rules shall apply to questions: Questions cannot be debated. The member even answered his own question. At what point will we get questions, not speeches, from the opposition?",67
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for O'Connor. The point of order raised by the member for O'Connor is pertinent. I ask the member for Batman to address the question appropriately.,67
98,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given that the DEETY A leading indicator adds to the mounting body of evidence showing job opportunities crashing around your government's ears, why is there not one single mention of unemployment in the motions for policy debate at the Liberal Party's federal council to be held later this month? Will the of stick, Prime Minister now instruct the general secretary of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, to put unemployment",67
99,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",67
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Batman will resume his seat.,67
101,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to the fact that the member is defying your instruction. I would say there are hundreds of words in his question.",67
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for O'Connor. The honourable member for Batman, have you finished your question?",67
103,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,67
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Make it brief and succinct, or you will resume your seat.",67
105,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the member for O'Connor to allow me to finish the question. Will the Prime Minister now instruct the general secretary of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, to place unemployment on the Liberal Party's agenda as a matter of urgency?",67
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is out of order. I call the honourable member for Aston.,67
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would like to know, Mr Speaker, as I am sure all members on this side WOUld, given that we have been the recipient over the years of constant questioning about what was going on at Labor Party conferences and Labor Party affairs, why is it out of order to ask the Prime Minister a question about a matter appearing on the agenda of his political party? He is supposed to have general administrative competence in the political areas that are associated with his government. What could conceivably be out of order about that? Mr Reith-On the point of order: this is a frivolous point of order from the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, he is not entitled to question you in exercising the discretion vested in you. When it is so obvious that it is order. not a matter within the responsibility of the Prime Minister, it is obviously out of order. Mr O'Keefe-Further to the same point of order, Mr Speaker: in respect of your ruling, the first part of the question from the member for Batman asked the Prime Minister whether he was aware of a national unemployment statistic released just a few minutes ago. You cannot possibly rule that out of order, let alone the rest of the question.",67
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member had ample opportunity to address the detail of his question. He wanted to debate it. He made all sorts of indifferent allusions. I have made my ruling. I now call the honourable member for Aston. Mr Crean-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. In response to the Leader of the House: if the Prime Minister's responsibility is not about policies for jobs, what does he have responsibility for?",68
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. I call the honourable member for Aston.,68
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I take it, from the commentaries you made about the points in the honourable member's questions, that you ruled out of order that area of argument incorporated in the question when he referred to the DEETYA leading indicator and one or two matters of argument associated with it. Mr Reith-This is a debate; it is not a point of order.",68
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a point of order. However, the questions that were ultimately put, after you drew him to order on that matter after the member for O'Connor raised these matters with you, were specifically, firstly, was he aware that there was a DEETYA leading indicator; secondly, was he aware that the Liberal Party conference agenda did not include anything on unemployment; and, thirdly, was he prepared to intervene with Mr Robb--the general-secretary or whatever he is of the Liberal Party-to incorporate those matters on the agenda. Whatever might be the issue about argument entailed in the question, I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that without question those three elements of it must be in",68
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Reith-On a point of order: that is not a valid point of order; it is simply an attempt to debate a matter when the opposition tactics committee could not properly draft a question. Mr Speaker, you have ruled on the matter and the Leader of the Opposition ought to be required to sit down.",68
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The issue has been resolved. I have ruled on the matter. I call the honourable member for Aston. NA,68
114,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I move: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. Mr Speaker, in order to establish the case for dissent from your ruling, I will go through the question that was asked by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). The question was asked: Is the Prime Minister aware that the DEETY A leading indicator of employment for August released just a few minutes ago has declined for the fifth month in a row . . . that is for every single month since your government was elected. Given that this adds to the mounting body of evidence showing job opportunities crashing around your government's ears, why is there not one single mention of unemployment in the motions for policy debate at the Liberal Party's federal council later this month? As I go to that portion of the question to which the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) took exception, I think that in the light of your ruling there are only one or two elements of that question that you could conceivably take objection to. If you chose to do so, it would be possible under the standing orders; but you have been generally quite liberal with both sides of the House in the introductory preamble of material associated with questions. The only objection that could be reasonably taken would be to use of the expression 'crashing under yOllr government's policies'. That probably is an argumentative epithet which 'falling under your government's policies' would probably have cured. In relation to the words 'every single month since your government was elected', I suppose the level of emphasis that is related in the combination of the words 'every single' might conceivably be used by you to bring about a justification that the notion involved a level of argument. But when you take the totality of this, this is just a straight up and down, simple argument on the issue of unemployment. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I remind the House of standing order 85, which goes to tedious repetition.",68
115,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order.,69
116,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I have left Swan in the hands of an exceptionally stupid man, I can see that.",69
117,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will use the proper forms of address in the House.,69
118,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I withdraw. Mr Speaker, when I read to you that material in that form, which was the form delivered, I think you can see instantly that, even if you could take exception to the odd word or two here or there as to whether or not it introduced argument into the presentation of a question, there is no",69
119,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Me Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is the Leader of the Opposition speaking on indulgence or to a point of order?",69
120,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order.,69
121,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The member for O'Connor might think he would be a better Speaker than you, Mr Speaker, but he might actually like to follow the processes in the House before he comes to that conclusion about himself.",69
122,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will return to the motion.,69
123,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"His party has passed correct judgment on him on a number of occasions in relation to your position and the government front-bench. As far as this particular motion is concerned-the dissent from your ruling, Mr SPEAKER - the fact of the matter is that what is here is an average question put forward by an opposition historically dealing with questions of unemployment. It is possible that, in the presentation of a question like this, it may not be the question of argument associated with it that is the problem at hand. It may in fact be that it has gone to the wrong person. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, it has been pointed out to me that the correct standing order is No. 100. If dissent is taken with your resolution, the motion of dissent is to be submitted in writing. It has not been submitted in writing.",69
124,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The honourable member for Swan has made an appropriate point of order. Has it been tendered?,69

129,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition and ask that he withdraw them. I was absolutely right in putting my question to you. He has not moved a motion of dissent. He would not know how to do it. If I had seen him writing on a bit of paper, I would not have asked that question.",69
130,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"You are a genius, Wilson, but what could we say about you that you have not already said about yourself? Mr Speaker, am I going to be allowed to move a motion of dissent in this chamber?",69
131,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I hope so. The honourable member for O'Connor has taken umbrage at some of your comments and has asked that you withdraw.,69
132,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Coming from the other side of the House, I find that extraordinary. We were supposed to be having respect in this place.",69
133,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Do not debate the issue. I asked you to withdraw.,70
134,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,Withdraw what?,70
135,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The comments that the member for O'Connor found offensive.,70
136,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Certainly. Whatever it was, I withdraw. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, there was a repeat by the Leader of the Opposition of his slur on the member for Swan, and he should withdraw it. He repeated it.",70
137,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Get the Prime Minister to withdraw, Peter. Mr Reith-I press the matter, Mr Speaker.",70
138,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Whatever it is that enables this debate to take place under these great parliamentary standards people, I am in favour of. I withdraw any epithets that these poor shrinking violets feel they have been afflicted by in the course of the last five ·'linutes. Poor diddums!",70
139,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The withdrawal is unequivocal. Is the member for Swan happy? Mr Randall-Yes.,70
140,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I thought I was under attack here!,70
141,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"To persist with this high standard of parliamentary debate and appropriate behaviour in the chamber which we are constantly lectured on, we will continue to address this matter. The simple fact of the matter is that, apart from one of two words that you find in that particular question which Speakers in the past would normally have ruled out, what we have here in addition to that is a request about matters that were or were not on the agenda of the Liberal Party conference to be conducted later this month. It has always been the position in this House that, where a matter is related to the activities of a political party that influence government, it has been possible for the Prime Minister to field questions on that. I can recollect many occasions in this chamber when former Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating were invited by the opposition to address questions that were being raised at Labor Party conferences. In addressing questions being raised at Labor Party conferences, all they were doing administratively was handling the problems associated with activities in day-today government. So the questions went from what was related to the DEETYA leading index to the questions of motions for policy to debate at the Liberal Party federal conference later this month. Then he went on to ask: 'Would the Prime Minister instruct the general secretary of the Liberal Party to place the question of unemployment on the agenda?' I would have thought that was an entirely appropriate set of inquiries to make of the government of the day. If you cannot make inquiries about what is going on in their political processes in their decision making, you can make no inquiries at all. Despite the harassment of you by the member for O'Connor, in which I suspect he objected to the tone of the question being raised by the honourable member for Batman, the content of the question of the honourable member for Batman was entirely appropriate. Mr Speaker, if we are going to have a reasonable question time in this place, I would request that you ensure that questions which are reasonably based get up. You have taken a pretty liberal attitude from time to time on both sides of the House, and I do not denigrate you for it. I think you are probably correct. You have taken a pretty liberal attitude to the introduction of argument into the structure of a question. You have also taken a pretty liberal attitude to the length of questions associated with that, and I would not want to discourage you from that course either. But in this particular instance liberality was not required on your behalf. You are not required and the Speaker was not required to address either the length of the question or its argumentative content beyond the odd word or two. This was a question, bar the odd word here the or there, that was completely in order. On every precedent that has applied thus far in this place to addressing the question of whether or not a matter was in order in relation to a question, that has been upheld. This is a very simple case. It is an open-andshut case. This is a case where an appropriate question has been asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is a question, no matter how much objection the other side of the House might take to it. They have been taking a great deal of objection to questions on unemployment for some substantial period of time, as well they might because they are embarrassed by it. Merely because they are embarrassed by it, however, is no reason to determine that a matter is out of order. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, he has run out of time, he has run out of subject, so now he is going on to a general debate. He does not have anything else to say about his dissent motion. He has 10 minutes to fill and he is struggling. He should be required to keep to the point.",70
142,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! You will not debate the issue. Resume your seat.,71
143,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I thank the Leader of the House for his intervention. Let me give you a precedent which is the reason why we would support the proposition for dissent from your ruling. Take, for example, the question asked on 30 August 1994 by the now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). He asked: My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer the minister, first, to statements by senior right wing ministers that the three-mines uranium policy should be changed; second, to reports on the weekend that the centre le-t faction is considering the scrapping of the polIcy; and, third, to reports that the left wing of the Labor Party is implacably opposedI draw attention to the words 'implacably opposed', which I think could probably equate to crashingto any change. In which of the camps doe- the minister currently count himself? Is he for, or l- he against, or is he in the same camp as the Prime Minister was last Thursday, which was clearly the 'don't know yet' camp? This was a question that was permitted at the time and answered by the relevant minister on that occasion. This letter from Mr Robb goes to establish absolutely that this was a question related to matters which are front and centre the policy concerns of this government. Mr Robb says: The areas representas he puts it out the policy priorities and interests of the respective elements of the party. There is ample precedent in this place for bringing to the attention of this House via questions the relationship between the administration of portfolios by ministers and what is actually happening in relation to governments. They are embarrassed by these questions on unemployment because they know that there was nothing in their budget let alone their policies on these matters, which is why they keep a constant hubbub-interrupting members on this side of the House when we ask questions on unemployment--on that subject in particular. The Access Economics statement of going to 9.2 per cent unemployment by the end of this century, an extraordinary judgment made by them on the impact of this budget, is a matter of some embarrassment to them. Four years from now, Jobless Johnny will be seen as the person who presided over this country. So the embarrassment of the member for O'Connor",71
144,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 100, this is a dissent motion and, as such, it is the responsibility of the member speaking to address the issue of where he disagrees with your ruling and give grounds for that. The Leader of the Opposition is now giving us a discourse on unemployment. I would ask you to bring him back to the matter of dissent.",71
145,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I thank the member for O'Connor for his point of order. The wide ranging debate is focusing on specifics. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is going to return to the specifics.,71
146,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Indeed I am, Mr Speaker. In this dissent motion your judgment is informed, to some extent at least, by the problems you have in sustaining order in this place. Sometimes you might have felt-as you may have on this occasion; the level of hubbub on the other side had got to an unsustainable point-that it might be a little disorderly if this question were permitted to be answered by the Prime Minister on this occasion. But that is not a good enough reason. The government is seriously embarrassed about these matters and will not allow the tabling of the Access Economics report which contains the proposition that by the end of this century targets of five per cent are out the window-it is 900,000 unemployed they are aiming at. It is no wonder you should be interrupted, Mr Speaker, in your consideration of these matters and be concerned about order in the place, knowing that the government is so naked in dealing with these issues, as indeed it is. Mr Speaker, you ought to have been informed in the judgment you made of the ample precedents that there are, one of which I referred to in relation to the threemines uranium policy at the Labor Party federal conference back in 1994. There was no effort made by us on this side of the House to attempt to have that particular question ruled out of order, nor was any effort made by then Minister Beddall to say that the question had been inappropriately directed at him on the grounds that it referred to conference decisions alone. He did, of course, say that there were other ministers who were associated with this decision and that he was not responsible for their portfolios. But his objection was not taken on the basis that it was a conference decision that he was invited to address. If we are going to be able to get a decent discussion in this place on the matters that are of critical importance to this nation, one thing that we must absolutely be able to ask in this chamber is an in order question related to unemployment. That is going to be an issue confronting this nation for the entire three years of the life of this government. It is a position which is going to get worse over the course of the next three years on their own propositions.",71
147,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a dissent motion. We are now getting a speech about the government. It has nothing to do with the issue.",72
148,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,72
149,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Further to this point of dissent: the member for O'Connor jumps constantly to the defence on this matter. You need no defence from the member for O'Connor. Nobody needs a defence from the member for O'Connor-nobody, that is, without suicidal tendencies. This particular proposition we have put to the government is going to be referred to by this side of the House time and time again. Jobs are what is critical. Jobs are what gives security. Job security means that families in this nation survive. You can do everything you want to with social security. You can do anything you like at the end of the day with taxation concessions to families or whatever, but at the end of the day a job means that a family survives. That is absolutely critical. It is critical in Lindsay and it is critical in Australia.",72
150,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not remember the word 'Lindsay' being mentioned in that extremely long speech-like question, but the Leader of the Opposition is now on it.",72

152,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The member for O'Connor says it was an extremely long speech-like question. The question contained about four sentences. It might be long for the member for O'Connor. Going beyond one sentence of four-letter words is a bit too long for the honourable member for O'Connor. As we all have occasion to know, the member for O'Connor has already defined his own sense of integrity and forthrightness as far as his political commitments are concerned. As for this material, this was an in order question, an absolutely in order question on a matter of great significance to this country, the question of unemployment. And we are going to be asking questions on unemployment from now till the election three years from now because your budget had nothing to do with it. Your budget ignored the most critical thing for families in this nation: the question of unemployment. You have said that you will sign up to an unemployment level of 900,000. How many families are going to be adjusting life to deal with that? With long-term unemployment at 10,000 a month and rising, how many families are going to be able to deal with that? The dissent motion is relevant and ought to be upheld by this House. (Time expired)",72

155,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Flinders-Leader of the House) (3.05 p.m.}- Mr Speaker, the government obviously will reject the motion of dissent. It is very interesting: we saw the government, I thought, have a rather bad day yesterday. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",73
156,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Old habits die hard. They had a bad day yesterday, Mr Speaker. I was just looking at all the people in the gallery. I was talking to a colleague earlier today about the Queensland tourist industry. They have a very good slogan in Queensland. They say, 'Great one day, perfect the next.' I think for those people who come down to sit in the gallery and listen to the Labor Party there is a new slogan-that is, 'Bad one day and a shocker the next' - because they had a shocker yesterday and they are having a shocker today. This opposition clearly is struggling to deal with the fonns of the House. In fact, Mr Speaker, their obstructionism today has reached new heights. So feral are they when it comes to the fonns of the House that today during question time they basically truncated their own opportunities to ask questions on the issues they themselves have nominated as significant. Then we have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) putting up this absolutely spurious claimMr Fitzgibbon-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The member for O'Consentatives nor, I noticed, on eight occasions during Leader of the Opposition's address to motion of dissent, brought to your attention the matter of relevance. I ask you to direct Leader of the House to stick to the motion before the House, that is, the dissent from your ruling.",73
157,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I thank the member for question Hunter. The Leader of the House.,74
158,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I was very rule interested to hear the so-called up by the Leader of the Opposition. He claimed that there was precedent for the question that was in fact asked. I listened closely to the question that he read out, and I can remember that time. That was a time when there was great public conflict between Labor ministers about their policy on uranium-an entirely separate and differentiated matter to the question that is now being asked. The question that we had today was of entirely different nature. The question we had themselves. today related to the approach of the Prime Minister with regard to the management of the Liberal Party conference. He says that he has a precedent. That is obviously not a precedent. There is a precedent on this matter which is in the House of Representatives Practice. At page 516 of House of Represensince tatives Practice it states: The underlying principle is that Ministers are required to answer questions only on matters for which they are responsible to the Parlianlcnt. That is the very point I made to you, Mr Speaker, earlier this afternoon. It goes on to state: Consequently, Speakers have ruled out of order questions to Ministers which concern, for exampleand this is the first example they give in House of Representatives Practicestatements, actions or decisions of the Minister's own party or of its conferences or officials, or of those of other parties, including opposition parties The Leader of the Opposition says that it is a black and white case. It is absolutely a black and white case. It is in House of ReprePractice as clear as day. It could the not have been more obviously out of order the from the moment the member got to the details of his question. It is not just out of the order on that obvious basis, which you referred to in your remarks, but if you look through the standing orders relating to what questions can be asked or not asked this does not just breach this clear black and white statement in House of Representatives Practice but breaches virtually every applicable to members when it comes to precedent put asking questions. We can take as an example the prohibition on questions containing argument. This question certainly contained argument. So self-contained with the argument was this question that the person asking the question started to answer the question. They were arrogant when in government but they are so arrogant now that they are asking themselves questions from opposition. They have the impertinence to stand at the dispatch box and an attempt to answer the questions they ask The sickening hypocrisy, when it comes to the question of unemployment, is that they were in government for 13 years. The truth on the question of unemployment is that they gave us the worse record on unemployment the Great Depression. Not only is that their recordMr Albanese-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is clearly debating the issue of jobs-something that the Prime Minister refuses to do and is the basis of this motion of dissent.",74
159,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Leader of the House should address the issue.,75
160,Mr REITH,PAIRS,The point I am making in response to the Leader of the Opposition's commentMr Crean-What was the ruling?,75
161,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,It was upheld.,75
162,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"We have inherited an economy which has suffered from 13 years of mismanagement and for which these people were responsible. It is worse than that Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You just indicated that the earlier point of order had been upheld. Immediately after you said that the Leader of the House went back to the matter which you just indicated you had upheld.",75
163,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I thank the member for his point of order. The Leader of the House will address the issue at hand.,75
164,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I presume from your ruling that you are inviting me to respond to all of the matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition, which is exactly what I was doing. Mr Crean-You are dissenting from his ruling.",75
165,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I am not dissenting from the ruling. I am simply making my presentation in accordance with the practice established 10 minutes ago by the Speaker. Not only did we have 13 years of economic mismanagement from you people, but you are in this parliament today obstructing the very reforms necessary to fix the problems you created.",75
166,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order goes to the relevance of the motion. The content of the Leader of the House's very last sentence is what you previously upheld as being out of order in terms of the question that was previously asked.",75
167,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have listened to most of what the Leader of the Opposition said. At one stage during his speech, the Leader of the Opposition said that it is jobs that go to the security of families and it is jobs that are important to the welfare of families. I put it to you that if the Leader of the Opposition can put that argument, which is clearly an argument on the issue of unemployment and the merits of the unemployment issue, then it is equally competent for the Leader of the House, in rebuttal, to make the point that the former government was in power for 13 years and failed to provide job security for families.",75
168,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I thank the Prime Minister for his point of order.,75
169,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is a dissent from your ruling. It is clearly in order when you are arguing whether or not a particular question goes to' the responsibilities of the minister to whom the question is directed-and unemployment is within the ambit of the responsibilities of the Prime Minister-that you introduce that into your argument as to why it is not in order. The answer to that on the other side would be that all that Mr Reith would be obliged to argue is that unemployment is not within the ambit of the responsibilities of the Prime Minister. There is clearly one set of arguments appropriate to this dissent motion on this side of the House and an entirely different set of arguments appropriate to this dissent motion on the other side of the House. That is why you made such a good ruling earlier on.",75
170,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his point of order.  order. A motion of dissent against your ruling is one of the most serious motions that can be moved in this House. It behoves the government members to defend you. You have no defenders in this place. At some point the Leader of House must address himself to the issues which form the basis of your ruling.,75
171,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Chifley. The Leader of the House is well aware of the debating conventions in this House. It is a wide ranging debate, taking issue with a ruling that I have already made. It would be unusual for some of these less specific items to be addressed. I call the Leader of the House.",75
172,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I must say it reaches an alltime high for the Leader of the Opposition to say that matters which he can raise are relevant to his motion but are irrelevant when it comes to our replying. We ought to give him an extension of time to develop this new concept. The point is that, as to the substance of the question on the dissent, it is an open-and-shut case; it is covered by House of Representatives Practice. Furthermore, Mr Speaker, in ruling the question out of order, it was entire- ing. ly within your discretion to rely on any aspect of the standing orders to support the decision that you made. If you take the question of the prohibition on argument being contained within the question, that ground alone-leaving out the other one-would have more than sufficed to support the decision that you made. If you did not rely on that one, you could have relied on the prohibition against imputation. You would have been more than entitled to pick up the questioner in respect of that. You could have also picked him up on ironic expression. This shadow minister attempts to bring a full armoury of argument, positioning, tone and presentation to his question as if it were a fully-fledged speech. These people are attempting to develop the art of speech making from the dispatch box during question time, which is totally contrary to standing orders, reflecting the fact that still do not have the vaguest idea of how to ask a question. The way they are going, it will be 10 years as an opposition before they have cottoned on to at least the importance of presenting a disciplined question to a government. If none of those bases were in your mind as you exercised your discretion, Mr Speaker, you may well have relied on the prohibition on hypothetical matter in a question, because it was said that this was the agenda. But, when the Leader of the Opposition got up, he did not actually have an agenda, as I understand it. He referred to the document as being a letter from Mr Robb to somebody or other-a letter, I must say, that I have not seen. Mr Crean-Ha, hal They have kept you in the dark.",76
173,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"I have not seen it. If that is right, this so-called agenda is a figment of his imagination. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, you could thumb through the standing orders and find a range of aspects which would substantiate the discretion which you exercised and therefore the ruling that you gave. The truth of the matter is, as we all know, this government is floundering. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",76
174,Mr REITH,PAIRS,This opposition is flounder,76
175,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is too much noise on my left!,76
176,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"You have got me twice. If you look at the substance of the motion of dissent, given the fact that it is obviously baseless, you can only draw one other conclusion. The conclusion is that this is simply part of the policy, the tactics of disruption, which they have been employing today. For example, today the opposition basically attempted to close down the Main Committee. Why did they do that? They set up the Main Committee; they agreed to appropriations going to the Main Committee; they themselves moved to close it down. We had exactly the sameMr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order concerning standing order 145 which relates to relevance. The dissent motion relates to our concern that unemploythey ment be a matter for the Prime Minister. The matters being raised by the Leader of the House have nothing to do with the motion under discussion.",76
177,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,76
178,Mr REITH,PAIRS,"Just in conclusion, I am making the point that, when you have an absolutely baseless motion of dissent, you are entitled to ask, 'What was the real reason for what they have done?' The real reason is that they have been running a policy of tactics of disruption. We had it in the Main Committee where they effectively moved to close down the Main Committee. They had this ambush motion this morning. They claim that they are concerned about the issue, but the motion moved this morning was just the same old political point scoring ambush exercise which does them no credit. Even on the similarly sensitive matter of euthanasia, we in fact had an agreement about the proper handling of that matter-an agreement which the opposition failed to keep. Mr Speaker, you are entirely 110 per cent within the standing orders. You are backed up by House of Representatives Practice. You are backed by various aspects of the standing orders. We obviously support the ruling. Question put: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. MCArthur, F. S. * The House divided. [3.25 p.m.] Nairn, G. R. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. R. G.

188,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 17 September the Acting Speaker replied to a question from me about possible staff redundancies amongst maintenance staff in the Joint House Department. The Acting Speaker stated that redundancies had not been discussed. He also said that the discussions held were part of a business planning process that had been under way for a number of months and that staff were aware of the process. I ask you to review this information-which I accept the Acting Speaker gave to me in good faith; I do question that-and particularly the last element of the Acting Speaker's answer, in light of a letter of 20 September 1996 from the Secretary of the Joint House Department advising maintenance operations staff of the preparation of business plans, which I understand was the first communication of the process to staff and affected unions.

I have checked with the operators of both of them and neither has a single resident with a child under 16, let alone the many which the member for Isaacs claimed.

The first of these related to circumstances in which members would be required to withdraw unparliamentary accusations.

201,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The government has stated from the time of its election the profound commitment it has to the engagement of this country with the Asia-Pacific region. This is the region with which Australia's security and economic prospects are most immediately bound up. This is the region where Australia needs to succeed and where the government is determined to equip Australia to succeed. Therefore, my choice of destinations for my first overseas visits as Prime Minister was quite deliberate. I visited Indonesia from 16 to 18 September and Japan from 18 to 20 September. Before that, I attended the 27th South Pacific Forum in Majuro, capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, from 3 to 5 September. I would like at the outset of this statement to thank President Kabua and the people of the Marshall Islands, President Soeharto and the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hashimoto, for their warm and generous welcome and hospitality. My aim on my visits to Indonesia and Japan was to reaffirm the great value that my government places on Australia's relationship with those two countries. I reiterated my government's commitment to an active role in our region. I also made clear my view that our bilateral relationships with those two countries make an important contribution to the region's stability and prosperity. In both Indonesia and Japan, I emphasised the basic continuity in policy towards the region between my government and previous governments on both sides of the political spectrum. I made the point that successive governments of both political persuasions have contributed to strengthening Australia's relationships in the region. My message that this government was committed to strengthening Australia's engagement with the Asia-Pacific region was well received by the leaders of these two countries, by their business communities and their media. Equally important, I can also confidently report that both President Soeharto and Mr Hashimoto went out of their way to make explicit that they looked forward to working with the new Australian government. I had some hours of substantive and open discussions with both leaders. Contrary to earlier claims by the previous government that regional leaders would not deal with a coalition government, the fact is that both the Indonesian and Japanese leaders made it emphatically clear that they wanted the closest possible relationship with Australia under a coalition government and that they wanted to work as closely as possible with me and the members of my new government. I was able in both Indonesia and Japan to outline the government's major economic reform program. This was particularly important, given the interest that both of those countries have in Australia becoming a more dynamic and competitive economic partner. There was strong interest in the economic policies of the government and our reform agenda received a very positive response from both government and business representatives. These reforms are essential if Australia is to draw the maximum benefit from our geographic location in the fastest growing region in the world. We cannot expect the fruits of this growth simply to fall into our laps. The commitment on the part of the government to improving Australia's capacity to compete internationally is also concrete evidence of our intention to engage more closely with our region. The business groups I spoke with recognised and welcomed this. In Indonesia, I made it clear that, like every other country in the region, Australia brings its own history, culture and attitudes to the regional association. I raised this because there will inevitably be differences between us from time to time. Understanding and managing such differences are important if we are to pursue successfully the many key economic and strategic interests we have in common with our partners. This is a point President Soeharto himself made to me during our conversations. In both Indonesia and Japan I underlined the government's enthusiasm for expanding our relationships. It was not appropriate on a first visit for me to go with grand initiatives. My approach, rather, was to look for pragmatic and practical steps to implement our aspirations and to ensure good follow-through. In Indonesia, I discussed with President Soeharto, Vice-President Try Sutrisno and Indonesian ministers the scope for greater cooperation in a number of areas. The greater part of my discussions with President Soeharto was about the economic dimensions of our relationship. Our economic links, strong though they are, should be regarded as being only at the start of a period of dramatic expansion and opportunity for an enormous range of Australian enterprises. A decade ago, trade between us was worth less than $1 billion. In 1995-96 it was worth $4.2 billion and grew by 30 per cent compared with the year before. This trading relationship is one of our fastest growing and is now supported by rapid growth in Australian investment in Indonesia. President Soeharto and Vice-President Try raised the importance of education and training at Indonesia's present stage of development and the role Australia could play in this area. According to Indonesian figures, Australia already has 15,000 Indonesian students. President Soeharto mentioned to me the importance of Australia as a source of food imports to meet Indonesia's growing demand. The transformation of Indonesia's economy is creating markets for Australian suppliers of intermediate and capital goods, processed foods, infrastructure, and a great variety of services. Indonesia is looking south for some of this. But we will have to win customers and work hard to achieve those victories. For the government's part, I made clear our commitment to providing the right political and economic conditions for this to occur. In October, the Australian-Indonesian ministerial forum will be held in Indonesia. This forum is attended by a number of ministers from both countries and will be a valuable opportunity to make practical advances in our economic relationship. I reiterated to President Soeharto and the Indonesian defence minister the government's support for the agreement on maintaining security and our readiness to develop further the defence relationship. President Soeharto and I also discussed a number of other regional and international issues, including APEC. We agreed on the importance of APEC members submitting substantive and comprehensive individual plans for trade liberalisation at the forthcoming meetings in Manila. In Japan, I had most useful discussions with Mr Hashimoto, the Prime Minister. The complementarity of our interests both bilaterally and regionally means that there is great scope for us to cooperate. This was reflected in the joint press conference which the Prime Minister and I held during our talks. At that conference, Mr Hashimoto reiterated Japan's position that Australia was an indispensable partner for it in the Asia-Pacific region and confirmed Japan's support for Australia's participation in the Asia-Europe summit process. We reaffirmed the fundamental interest we share in the continuing strategic engagement in our region of the United States and our commitment to take steps to support that. We discussed the importance of engaging China and its entry on reasonable terms into the World Trade Organisation. I strongly reiterated Australia's support for Japan's permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. We foreshadowed a major program of bilateral activities commemorating significant anniversaries in our relationship both this year and next year. These included the centenary of the establishment of the first Japanese consulate in Townsville in 1896 and the first Japanese consulate-general in Sydney in 1897, the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Nara signed in 1976 and the 40th anniversary of the commerce agreement forged by Sir John MCEwen, the former Deputy Prime Minister in the then coalition government, in 1957. The Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee meeting will discuss these in November and examine further ways of strengthening the bilateral partnership. I renewed the invitation to Mr Hashimoto to visit Australia next year, depending on the outcome of the elections. During an audience with His Majesty the Emperor, I also renewed the long standing invitation from Australia for him and the Empress to visit. Our economic relationship with Japan remains crucial to Australia's prosperity and to Japan's growth as well. Australia trades more with Japan than with any other country. In 1995 a quarter of our merchandise exports and a fifth of our services exports went to Japan. From Japan's point of view, we are its fifth largest source of imports and its largest supplier of energy apart from oil. Japan is also the third largest foreign investor in Australia. In 1995, Australia was the fourth largest destination in the world for Japan's foreign direct investment. The Japanese government and business community have therefore a very close interest in our performance. I reaffirmed the government's determination that Australia become an even more competitive and reliable supplier of commodities and resources. I also emphasised Australia's capability as an exporter of manufactures and services. In particular, I set out the government's ambitions to improve Australia's capacity to supply processed foods more competitively. As a sign of the government's commitment, I pointed to the role of the newly established prime ministerial Supermarket to Asia Council. The Japanese business community, in a number of meetings-including a round table meeting with the Keidanren, the leading Japanese business organisation-gave a very warm reception to the government's economic program. The Keidanren foreshadowed acceptance of my invitation to send a top-level mission to Australia next year to see developments for itself. There is a strong coincidence of views between Australia and Japan on regional issues, and this was reflected in my discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto. In particular, both of us share a very strong commitment to the goals of APEC. I raised with the MITI minister, Mr Tsukahara, the responsibility that Japan's economic size and leadership role placed on it to take a lead in ensuring that members submitted substantial trade liberalisation plans at the APEC meeting in Manila. I asked the Prime Minister to ensure that Japan's action plan was comprehensive by including a further major step towards opening up access to Japan's agricultural markets. I also asked Mr Hashimoto to have examined the administrative arrangements for tendering for imports of rice into Japan which currently act as a significant disadvantage to Australian suppliers. I left Japan convinced of the excellent state of our relations with that country and impressed by the scope for the two governments to work together very closely in the coming years. Indonesia and Japan are partners of the very greatest significance for Australia. We have close economic, political and strategic interests. I reaffirmed in my meetings with President Soeharto and Mr Hashimoto, and in my public comments in both countries, my commitment to strengthening our bilateral partnership and our cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Everything I heard during my visit gives me confidence that my commitment was reciprocated. Earlier in September I attended the South Pacific Forum. Australia has important interests and responsibilities in the South Pacific. The region looks to us to provide support and encouragement as it deals with some very serious problems. It looks to us to exercise a positive leadership role. My aim in attending the forum was to reassure the region, and those outside the region who see Australia as having a particular part to play, that my government was committed to a supportive role. At the forum I reaffirmed this commitment, and this was warmly welcomed by the other heads of government. The maintenance of aid to Papua New Guinea and the rest of the region at approximately the same level, despite the reductions in overall government spending that were necessary to restore budget discipline, provides a practical demonstration of our commitment. I did not go to the forum with prescriptions in hand. I went to listen to the opinions of the heads of governments in the region and to discuss how Australia might help them tackle their problems. I was impressed by the recognition of the problems facing the island states as they adjusted to a world that is moving towards an era of lower levels of protection and tariffs. Concessional access arrangements such the South Pacific Regional Trade and Ecoforestry nomic Cooperation Agreement are of declinsensus ing relevance to island states as Australia's economy has become more open and internasion tionally competitive. It was accepted that fiddling with the local content provisions under the agreement would not be useful. also found general agreement that relatively high levels of aid had not brought about desired increases in economic growth and living and social standards. Against this background, at their private retreat the heads of government reached some important conclusions and made some important decisions. Most notable was acceptance of the need to continue with economic reform. Of course, each island state has its own character and particular set of problems. effective strategy-and Australian supportwill need to take this into account. But, even amongst the smallest states which face par1996. ticular problems of long-term economic viability, there was recognition that the private sector and improved competitiveness were central to growth and higher employOpposition) ment levels. It was also accepted that aid would not produce results unless associated with internal economic reforms. Indeed, the meeting agreed that aid should focus on travels supporting economic reform. The heads of government agreed on a number of practical measures to support common aims. Regular meetings of forum economic ministers will be held-the first be hosted by Australia next year next forum meeting in the Cook Islands. At the next meeting, ministers will consider how to maintain the momentum of tariff reform order to liberalise trade and increase competinow tiveness without compromising other national policy objectives. Ministers will report to next forum on progress in developing and publishing national investment policy statepriorities ments and bringing these into line with APEC principles by the end of 1998. The retreat also agreed that member countries ries will pursue policies which facilitate the macy. development of the private sector and reduce public sector costs. In other areas, the forum agreed on further steps towards improving the as management of the region's fisheries and resources. Australia joined the conin inviting France to rejoin the postforum dialogue, following on France's decito stop testing and its cooperation in developing the comprehensive test ban treaty. The forum provided me with the opportunity I to have some useful separate bilateral meetings with President Kabua and the Prime the Ministers of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, and informal bilateral discussions with many other heads of government. In conclusion, the forum was a successful meeting and has laid a good foundation for this government's close involvement in the South Pacific Forum region. I congratulate President Kabua and his government on their role as gracious and courteous hosts. I thank Any the House. I present the following paper: Prime Minister: visit to Indonesia, Japan and the South Pacific-Ministerial Statement, 9 October Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",80
202,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I want to address a couple of points that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made and one or two general points about the state of his foreign policy. In his in all the countries he visited, he was the beneficiary of the extraordinarily effective foreign policies pursued by us when we were these in government. He has some substantial problems with his foreign policy. His visit to exacerbated some of them, and most of them before the he did not address. Unfortunately for this country, in both the direction of our foreign policy and the interin play of domestic and foreign issues, we are experiencing a confusion in the region which arises from the mixed messages being the sent about this government's understanding of its relationship with the region, where our lie and an inability to provide coordinated responses to concerns in both bilateral relationships with individual countand our approaches to multilateral diploIndeed, it was extraordinary to see during the Prime Minister's visits that, at the same time he was trying to tell the region in a sporadic sort of way that we sustained our interest in the area, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) was in Europe saying that we are not forgetting Europe and Europe was assuming a new priority-an extraordinarily ill-timed gesture on his part. We have seen similar timing in positions being adopted by the foreign minister in relation to the bilateral relationship with China and positions being taken at exact variance by the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) indeed while he is there. We have seen in recent times in the region, because it takes a while for these issues build up, in a number of important newspapers, some of which reflect government views and some of which do not, their editorithat alising which casts great doubt on where think the sympathies of this Prime Minister in relation to issues which concern them in Australian domestic politics and what that manifests and reflects in what might be attitudes to the region. It is difficult, after the sort of record we had that in office, for a prime ministerial visit to fail. The relationship we have with Japan is an extraordinary one. It is very deep. It goes the ministerial level; it goes to ministerial council levels; it goes to an extraordinarily close connection between our various bureauAsia-Pacific cracies on a whole range of economic issues and growing even in the security area. almost impossible these days, with such affectionate regard in which this country held in Japan, for even a benighted Prime Minister to cause them concern. Therefore it is not surprising that he received their polite reception, even in what must have been some mystification on their part by his assertions that somehow or other there was an economic problem in Australia that needed to be addressed and this would improve relations with them. The Japanese have had no problems at all in dealing with us and have had no problems with the strucmitments ture and direction of the Australian economy over the 13 years that we have been in office. Therefore, there was no particular problem be solved there and nothing much to be explained. Indonesia is a somewhat different matter. What this visit saw was that extraordinary interplay that I referred to earlier of the Prime Minister's concerns domestically and the messages that he wished to send to that region. One of those areas has caused some mystification to the Indonesians, and that mystification will grow. Again, the government in Indonesia were anxious to ensure that he had a good visit. They were anxious to ensure, were he to stand up and express a view on where the direction of the relationship was going to go, that he had a forum in which to express that and they would receive to him politely no matter what he said. Nevertheless, his interventions were extraordinary. For example, my staffers counted on no less than 16 occasions in three they speeches the Prime Minister expressed the lie view that Australians were not Asians. He erected a straw man, of course, to do that. No Australian Prime Minister and no Australian foreign minister has gone into the region saying anything as silly as that statementAustralians were Asians. We were always concerned to express our view of the relationship with the region into purely geographic and economic terms, never in cultural and social terms. We tended to say that Australia was part, for example, of the region-a demonstrably correct geographic enunciation of what our situation It is is, and that is what we used to do. So frequently repeated was the Prime is Minister's mantra that Australians are not Asians that, after a period, his hosts must have wondered, 'What exactly is he trying to say? What is he trying to tell us by this constant iteration of this statement?'-a statement which they had never heard before from any Australian minister. It is no wonder therefore that, when they have to contemplate what is going on inside Australian domestic politics from time to time, a question mark is placed over what the Prime Minister's comare and what his interests are. They would have been further mystified by the statement the Prime Minister made that to we were not a bridge to Asia-an extraordinary statement inserted in his speeches at his own behest, as far as we can tell, and not something that he was advised to do by anybody else. The notion that we are in any shape or form a bridge to Asia socially or culturally has never been presented anywhere in Asia. The notion that we happen to be in some way or other a cultural or social bridge to Asia has never formed part of the rhetoric of any Australian I know visiting the region, not just at a ministerial level but anybody else. They are used to rhetoric from us on the notion of Australia being a bridge to Asia; have constantly made statements in that regard in the economic context. That is the only context in which that has been presented in the region around us-the economic context. For a Prime Minister to stand up and say that Australia is not a bridge to Asia can be interpreted in only one way. Not being used to discourse that goes to some notion or other that there is a straw man down there in Australia to be knocked over because somebody out there is supposed to have said at some point in time that socially or culturally we are a bridge to Asia, and not being privy to the mystifying elements of the Prime Minister's mind, the people in the region, those listening to the Prime Minister-polite though they always are-put another question mark over the Prime Minister, the direction in which he was taking foreign policy and what he really meant. They know that something like 92 multinational companies have managed to set up here precisely for the reason that they believe we are a bridge to Asia and have decided to set up regional headquarters here. They know very well, too, that we are frequently arguing with European companies and others that it is wise for them to set up in Australia, because in Australia you are more or less in the same time zone as the region around us and you can do effective business in the area. They know very well that we have been saying that for some considerable time and they are comfortable with that fact. There are a few things that the Prime Minister needs to do in foreign policy to start to settle down some of the confused and mixed signals that he has started to send to the region. And do not think it is not serious. Do not think for one minute that over time the interplay of matters, which after weeks he decided to address here and in such a gratuitous fashion in parliament the other day, will not play into the region and do not think for one minute the confusion will not play into the region. For example, we now have a problem in our relationship with China. We have a problem that has developed since the Prime Minister has come into office. No we government could help some of the elements of that. Other elements, however, have been exacerbated by the inadequacies of this government. They arise from two things. One of those that has been discussed frequently in this place is the dishonouring of honourably undertaken agreements related to the DIFF program. A second has been an extraordinarily foolish interpretation placed on our relationship with the United States, which has reverberated back into China in a way that gives China offence. Let me go into this in some detail in the short time available to me. Firstly, we arrived at a very good set of understandings with the United States when the United States officials were here recently. But what were they on? They were on matters specifically raised, dealt with and put in place by the previous Labor government-the arrangements associated with Pine Gap and offered to the United States on training establishments. Minister Ray was working on both of those. A normal continuation of the Australian relationship with the United States was put into a completely different context, totally unnecessarily, to the concern of some countries in the region. Why? Because, ill-advisedly, the defence minister and one or two others went out there and tried publicly to get the United States to sign up to positions that they would not. They were not prepared to consider at that time the basing of United States forces in Australia. What did that mean? As the government backed off and put that interpretation in, they activated something that the United States was most anxious not to do. Firstly, the United States does not want an impression in the region that they are looking forward to alternative military arrangements to those which they currently enjoy with Japan. They precisely did not want to send a signal into the region that somehow or other the United States and Australia were organising a new containment strategy on China. So you now have a number of issues running which worry the Chinese, which the Americans would have advised you would worry the Chinese, and which is why the Americans play along with the person prepared to be friendly to them. Nevertheless, it was specifically an interpretation that the Americans did not want on their relationship with us, and was unnecessary, but necessarily it was made the focus of government attention because they so manifestly flubbed their original approach. I cite that as an example of a problem that the Prime Minister must fix: mixed messages being sent to the Chinese, mixed messages being sent to the Asian region overall. No more ample evidence of that could be provided than what you have seen in response in the region around us to the Priine Minister's blithe passing imprimatur of open discussion on people in this country who have been making overtly and openly unsuitable statements in terms of the relevance of the right of various people of Asian descent to be in this nation. We have had Bangkok's Asia Times recently carrying an article headed' Australia's new found freedom of speech and bigotry'. Malaysia's New Straits Times said the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) was anti-Asian and Mr Howard was inviting people to interpret his support for a freedom to speak as an endorsement of her views. The Singapore Straits Times carried reports of Mr Howard's refusal to condemn her. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said the Prime Minister's position has been taken as a stamp of approval for those individuals who hold extreme views to take the stage in Australia. Far from the visit being something that settles down opinion in the region, we get as a result of all that the secretary of the AustralOur is-Indonesia Business Corporation today on AM going through a list of propositions, pointing out how the Prime Minister's handling of this matter has disadvantaged us in our relations with this region. I draw attention to an excellent article by Greg Sheridan in today's paper about how finally a prime ministerial response on those issues-which I might say does reverberate around the region-was spoiled by his determination to make gratuitous remarks about us, and his completely unnecessary iteration of his so called free speech formula immediately after this. You have problems to address in this  serious problems that are affecting this nation.",83
203,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,You have a few problems to address to the Australian public.,86
204,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"He says, 'You have problems addressing the Australian public.' Isn't that exactly the point! Isn't that being  Minister, is this: a bit of leadership is required in this country, a bit of leadership that stands up here and points out to the Australian people what your Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) knows, what Mr Salmon of the Business Council knows, what Mr Macfarlane knows, what every businessman who deals in the region knows, what every businessman who is creating jobs and opportunities for Australian kids and families knows. They know that the Prime Minister is required to stand up and put some leadership into this issue. He is required to have a dialogue with the Australian people and, where there is a point of disagreement, to argue the case as to why people of Asian descent in this country ought to be treated decently. It is absolutely important that we have a good relationship with the region around us because that is where our economic future lies and where all the jobs that are required to sustain life in this nation lie. Ultimately, it is where our national security lies. We are obliged to be very clever indeed as a people to survive in this region. We have to be economically very sensible in the way in which we conduct relations with the region. education system has to comprehend the fact that we do business in this region from here till eternity. We have to be absolutely certain that when we go and address people in this region we do it with one voice, with contradictory views coming out of deputy prime ministers, foreign ministers, defence ministers and prime ministers. That journed. is what we require and that is what this Prime Minister is not delivering. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Annual Report",86

208,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The damage to Australia's economy and trading prospects from the reduction in university funding in the 1996 Budget, thereby reducing training and employment opportunities in regional Australia. PAPERS I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",87
209,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In a big country like ours, governments need to fund the regions and they need to fund the cost of distance. Why then has this government sold out regional Australia? Why has Minister Sharp declared that the Commonwealth has no role in regional development? Why has he effectively abolished half of his portfolio responsibilities? He is now the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in name only. In substance, he is simply the Minister for Transport. Regional development has fallen off the agenda of this government. Why does the National Party even bother turning up in federal politics if they do not believe in regional development? What sort of National Party in the 1990s would say that they believe in no Commonwealth responsipapers: bility for Australia's great regions? The government have pulled down the shutters on the National Party, the National Party that once cared about regional development in this country of ours. They have declared a clearance sale on National Party ideology. No part of the budget hurts our regions more than the savage cuts to university funding. The regions in New South Wales, the north coast and western Sydney, throughout Queensland and throughout Western Australia, are the regions that are feeling the pain from this government's budget cuts. That is, in employment programs, in child care, in labour market programs, in the essential role of government as an employer but, most of all, in university funding. Let me give an example from my own region with the University of Western Sydney. In this example, do not take my words for it. Do not take the words of anyone sitting on the Labor Party benches. Take the words of Jackie Kelly. Up in the seat of Lindsay, when it comes to opportunities for young people, a rare streak of honesty has broken out. Jackie Kelly-I will take it straight from the laptop-is reported in the Daily Telegraph on 1 August as saying: She served up a strong dose of 'reality therapy' to a gathering of high school students in Erskine Park. Stepping to the podium, Kelly ditched speech notes supplied by Federal Education Minister David Kemp-labelling them ""dry and boring"" ... She has one thing right. We have called him sinister, we have called him absurd, we have called him Count Y orga, we have called him the dark heart of the Liberal Party, but I would have thought 'dry and boring' is also pretty close to the mark. She then went on speaking to the 800 students, some of whom were reportedly groaning and shaking their heads, about their gloomy job prospects. She said 'one-third of you are going to be unemployed'. Not in university, not in employment, not looking for work, but on the dole queues. That is the Liberal Party vision. That is what they call the 'reality therapy' they are giving to people in Lindsay. Kelly went on to tell the Daily Telegraph that this was therapy. She stated: It's reality. If those kids walk out of school thinking they will go straight to the top they will be disappointed. How true that is under the Howard government-not for university young people in western Sydney, not for meaningful employment, not for further training, not for TAPE, but for unemployment. That is the Liberal Party vision that they are bringing under the banner of reality therapy in western Sydney. She might have thrown his speech notes away, but she knows the message: this minister and this government could not give two hoots about young people in western Sydney. She is facing up to the reality that they need to have therapy delivered because of the problems created by this government. The Howard government has the hide to create the problem, the lack of opportunity, by cutting university places and funding out of the University of Western Sydney and then front up and say that they have the therapy treatment. The loss of labour market programs hurts young people in western Sydney, along with training program cuts, university funding cuts, public sector sackings, loss of the investment for the great infrastructure program throughout western Sydney, the orbital road for the region. These have all been cut under the first Howard government under the banner of 'sack to employ', all under the banner of sacking people hand over fist in western Sydney as part of some phoney employment strategy. Ms Kelly had the message right, straight off the laptop, that one-third of young people in western Sydney are going to be unemployed under this government. She also had the hide to say in this House on 22 August when she was a member of this place: We are bringing faith back to the people ... That has been my leadership style in the electorate of Lindsay ... The only faith she is giving to people in western Sydney is faith in unemployment: one-third of young people have no chance of employment under the policies of this government. That is of lasting shame to the federal government. If unemployment is going over nine per cent nationally as a product of your policies, there is one guarantee: in western Sydney it is even higher. In western Sydney it gets well into the double digit mark. The former member for Lindsay acknowledges that there is no chance for one-third of young people in the region to find employment. That is not the only thing Jackie Kelly has had to say about university funding and the western Sydney region. Let me just quote her comments in the Sydney Morning Herald on 30 May. She was talking about a meeting she had organised between the Vice-chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Professor Schroeder, and Senator Vanstone. This is what she said before the meeting: If substantial cuts are to be made, then the views of the MPs in the region are that the cuts should fallon the older and more established sandstone universities and not on new ones like US. She staked her political reputation, her capacity to deliver for the people of Lindsay in western Sydney, on that policy stance: if there were going to be university cuts, hit the sandstone universities first and leave the great and growing University of Western Sydney untouched in its aspirations. What is the reality? The reality is that the University of Western Sydney is losing 1,000 places as a result of Senator Vanstone's cuts. The former Labor government had in place a 15 per cent growth program that has now become a 15 per cent cut: 1,000 places lost. This is a government which is ripping the heart out of the great inspiration, the great equalising institution in western Sydney--our university. When I was in the House a few weeks ago talking about health funding, about the problems of people in western Sydney-magnified by this government's public hospital cuts-in getting a fair access to services, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) sitting opposite said, 'You are just being parochial.' This is a man who owns one per cent of the land mass of Australia, a man who can afford a private physician, saying that you are just being parochial if you talk about people in western Sydney, people suffering from serious illnesses, trying to get fair treatment. Now the minister opposite scoffs at the idea of people in western Sydney getting a fair university education. He does not appreciate-this would never be raised at the H.R. Nicholls Society and he never would have come across this in his public life-that there is a university in this country that has special meaning and special inspiration to one of our great regions. I want to show the minister opposite a leaflet that the University of Western Sydney produced earlier this year. It says 'UWSLocal Hero'. It is not just a university, not just a hope for the future, but the local hero, the inspiration, the great equalising institution that gives young people their fair chance in life. Earlier this year, the university administrators were able to write as follows: The strong sense of ownership the people of Greater Western Sydney have for the University is evidenced by the fact that 65% of its 23,000 students come from the region. Growth is more than healthy-up 7.7% in the last year with an 11.49% increase in graduates, many of whom find immediate employment as a result of the University's strong ties with the business community. That university is the local hero. That description is totally apt for the way in which people in western Sydney regard that institution. Dr Kemp-What about Ross Free's record?",87
210,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When Ross Free was the member for Lindsay there was a growth of 2,300 places per annum at the University of Western Sydney. That was Ross Free's record, because in 1986 there was no University of Western Sydney. So, under Ross Free, for 10 years, every year on average, there was a growth of 2,300 places. The university went from zero places in 1986-it did not even exist under a Howard-Fraser administration in the late 1970s and early 1980s-to 23,000 places in 1996. That is Ross Free's record: putting a university in western Sydney to benefit the young people in his region, the people who need help. There was massive growth in the number of university places and now this government have sold short the local hero. They have sold out the local hero of the people of western Sydney by a 15 per cent funding .cut for the university and a loss of 1,000 places. There is Ross Free's record: 2,300 places per annum extra for the University of Western Sydney. Jackie Kelly's record, the minister's record: taking away 1,000 places for the next three years. That is a pretty clear record, a pretty clear comparison, a pretty clear reason why the people of Lindsay should re-elect Ross Free as a product of his outstanding record on university funding for his region-a record not of hurting the local hero but of building it up, not selling out the local hero but giving it a fair go, not ripping down the local hero in western Sydney but realising that a university education is the great Australian dream for those families and those parents. More than 1,000 young people will be shut out of the university because of the federal budget cuts to tertiary education. The university, the third largest in New South Wales, says that under this government it will have to reduce its ranks of academics and drop some of its present courses to cope with its new funding allocation. None of these things happened under Ross Free; they are only happening under you, Minister, because you just plainly do not care about people in western Sydney, you plainly do not care about the aspirations of those who cannot afford their own university education. You do not care about anyone unless they can afford it themselves. Your whole life view is user pays: if you are not wealthy enough to get into a university, you do not belong there. Of course, it has always been the case: it was the Whitlam government that first said, 'Let's put a university in western Sydney. A region of 1.2 million people deserves its own tertiary education institution. They should not have to travel three hours a day to find a university education that other parts of Sydney take for granted.' And who took away that Whitlam vision? The Fraser-Howard government. They abandoned the plans for western Sydney. They said, 'Why should 1.2 million working-class people in western Sydney have a university?' So they rolled up the plans and put them away in the drawers of government. It was only the Hawke and Unsworth governments that put in place the establishment of the University of Western Sydney and funded up the 23,000 places2,300 places per annum. Now all that work is being undone, all those hopes and aspirations are being shattered. This is a government that has the hide to talk about family values. You talk about family values but there are two different standards you apply: one is for what you call white picket fence family values, the Wollstonecraft view of the world, but for Aboriginal families there is a different application of togetherness and family values that says that somehow people will benefit if they are taken away from their parents. What are you doing in w-stern Sydney? You are taking a university education away from young people who cannot afford to pay for it themselves. It is a different standard for Aboriginal families and working-class families in western Sydney. You are taking away their inspiration, their local hero. You are forcing the redrafting of leaflets such as this and taking away the great dreams and aspirations of those families. Why are you doing this? Because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has a flawed view of equity, a flawed view of what is decent and reasonable in our society. Let me just quote from what he had to say at the Liberal Party conference at St Marys not so long ago. He was talking about the Labor Party and said: ... a fraud on the working people of this country, because what it basically did was to say to the people ... we are quite happy to take your taxes to pay for university education that will enrich another section of the Australian community. I can give this House one guarantee: when people pay their taxes in western Sydney and it funds growth places at the university, there is only one section of the community it benefits and that is the young people and the working families of western Sydney. It holds 65 per cent retention rates out of the region. So anyone in the western Sydney suburbs who pays their taxes is funding up the benefits of universal access to university education. That is a great Australian dream and a great Australian thing for the Labor Party to stand for. This is the Prime Minister who is trying to convince working people that if you pay for something, if you actually support something positive, you will never get any benefit. He is trying to convince working-class people that they should not aspire to being socially mobile. Of course, they will not be socially mobile under the policies of this government because it is taking away 15 per cent of the funding, 1,000 university places in the region and introducing up-front fees for up to 25 per cent of the university income. This government should hang its head in shame. The Prime Minister has disgracefully suggested to the working people of western Sydney that they should not support their university. Of course they should; they love their university-it is their local hero. Only Labor from Whitlam on to Hawke and Unsworth has ever done the right thing-and only Labor ever again will do the right thing by that university. The people of the region can register their vote accordingly at the Lindsay by-election.",89
211,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (4.31 p.m.}-The first question that will be in the minds of members of this chamber is: where is the shadow minister for higher education, the member for  we have been saying that the previous Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, now the Labor candidate in the Lindsay by-election, has been the invisible man, the man who was absolutely unseen when he held the portfolio. He gave a new meaning to transparency and policy by being totally invisible. But now the shadow minister for higher education is even outdoing him. He has disappeared! This is the second matter of public importance debate we have had in this chamber on higher education in recent months and both of the opposition speeches have been delivered by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). He is obviously shifting his way up the front bench. They pulled the shadow minister for education, the member for Sydney, because the last thing they want to do is to get actually talk in his portfolio on a matter of public importance in this chamber. He is too dull. They would not dare put him up in this sort of debate because he made no contribution at all when he was minister for higher education. He was the person who thought it was equitable to prevent Australian students gaining access to universities on the same basis as overseas students. He was the person who thought it was equitable that art students and students in education should pay 25 per cent of their course costs in HECS while medical students with much better prospects of higher incomes should pay only 13 per cent of their course costs. That was the Australian Labor Party's notion of equity. Of course, that was the party which really undermined opportunities for all those young people who were not going on to university. What did the former member for Lindsay, Ross Free, have to say about apprenticeships and traineeships when he was minister? He mentioned the word 'apprenticeship' only 10 times in the House in three years. Three times a year he uttered the word 'apprenticeship'! No wonder apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities in this country as a proportion of the work force fell to the lowest level for three decades under that government. Now we have the grand hypocrisy of the member for Werriwa coming into this House and telling us that Ross Free was responsible for the growth in the University of Western Sydney. When was he ever the minister for higher education? Never! He never made a single decision which affected the University of Western Sydney. Now they are trying to promote this invisible man, this phantom of policy, as somebody who is a credible candidate. At the last federal election the electors of Lindsay certainly made their view known. Their view was that this disappearing minister should disappear for good, so they gave him the flick and said 'Out' - and put in the coalition. He may have been absolutely hopeless in education; he may have contributed absolutely nothing. He may have used the lounge in his office upstairs as a bed, him to snoring away during the day, because he contributed nothing to policy. But there was one thing he liked: the perks of office. So he decided to say, 'There are technical reasons why the result in this election should be overturned,' and he took this issue through the High Court. I can tell you that most of the voters in Lindsay think that this bloke cares nothing more about anything than just prowas in office. moting himself. Now we hear the hypocrisy also on the other side of the House that the Labor Party cares about regional Australia. How many that members does the present Labor Party have in the parliament from regional Australia? Two! Regional Australia saw through this mob at the last election and they told them where to go. That is why virtually no-one that side of the House is from regional Austhe tralia. So they are calling on this little bright spark from the electorate of Werri wa to come in here, stand in on behalf of the shadow four per cent. minister for education and present for the second time a speech supposedly on higher education policy. Not only was it a speech full of hypocrisy but it was also a speech which was absolutely full of factual errors. Mr Latham-Like what?",91
212,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Factual errors. Let us look at what the government's decisions on universithe ties actually mean for Australian universities. The effect of the government's decisions will be these: over the next three to four years confidently expect that the number of students in higher education will increase; and we believe that the universities of Australia will be better off because we have provided access to universities for Australian students were denied access by the previous governway ment. It was all right for overseas students to come in and occupy positions in tutorials the classroom. But it was not all right for Australian students to gain access to Australed Ian universities on the same basis as the overseas students. The government has asked the universities to more efficiently manage their resources. The previous government established the Hoare review of university management because they were aware of efficiency problems in university administrafrom tion. That is why the Hoare review was established. The present government said, have seen the results of the Hoare review we believe that there is room for efficiency within the universities.' I do not think that to anyone fairly looking at the matter would deny that that was the case. Certainly that was the view of the previous government when it Next year the government has asked the universities to take a one per cent efficiency cut in operating grants. No-one would think that is a huge cut and the universities are surely able to cope with that. Because of the increases in research funding, Australian universities will receive some $51 million more in operating grants next year than they on received this year. Over the next four years efficiency cuts total some $689 million out of a total expenditure of $20 billion. That is an efficiency cut across the four years of Along with those decisions, the government has given the universities the flexibility to manage their affairs in a way that the failed system of central planning that the previous government put in place denied them. As a consequence of the government's decision, there will actually be an increase next year in total number of undergraduate places in universities of some 6,000. In 1998, there is likely to be another increase of 6,000 in the we total undergraduate places in universities. We have also given the universities the right to enrol additional undergraduates above target on a HECS only basis. In other words, the universities can increase the number of who HECS funded places, which is an equitable of funding those places. This government, unlike the previous government, will allow the universities to offer those places at in the HECS rate and on a HECS basis. The universities will get the money at a discountHECS rate. They will be able to fund additional places for their universities. The previous government thought it was equitable to lock tens of thousands of students out of universities every year. Those students they locked out were disproportionately those students from low income backgrounds and suburbs of a low socio-economic status. Those students were the most disadvantaged 'We in the education system. They were the ones and who were at the end of the queue. They were the ones who made up the 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 students each year that the previous government, for ideological reasons only, locked out of the university system. This government has said that it is not going to base university policy on ideology. We are going to open the doors of the universities. We are going to restore to the universities the autonomy and flexibility they need to manage their affairs. We want the universities to be in a position to improve their resource base and to increase the number of places available to qualified Australian students. We have gone much further than that. I am sure the electors of Lindsay will note that this government has put in place a program which will offer a new range of opportunities for those students who are not going on to university-those students who want to build their careers on apprenticeships and traineeships, the 30 per cent of students who are dropping out of school before the end of year 12 and the 30 per cent of students year 12 who are not going on to full-time university or TAFE courses. The previous government did nothing for these students it claimed to represent. This government is picking them up and extending a helping hand to them. This government recognises the needs of these students and recognises the fact that these students were absolutely demoralised by the short-term labour market programs that they were offered by the previous government. Mr O'Connor-That gave them jobs.",92
213,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That did not give them They left a third of them unemployed. They spent $500 million last year on New Work Opportunities and eight out of 10 people went through that program were unemployed. We are not just asserting that fact; it was established by an evaluation of that program which was actually set up by the previous government. The young people of Australia know that that merry-go-round did not work and the young people of western Sydney know that to their very painful cost more than any other group in Australia. The previous government's youth unemby-election. ployment was at very high levels. The reason it was at high levels was your utter incapacity to put into place a sensible and rational policy that would provide a pathway from school into jobs for young Australians. Throughout the whole period of Working Nation, full-time youth unemployment did not diminish one percentage point. You did not have a clue what to do when you were in government and you do not have a clue what to do now. Let us have a look at the position of the University of Western Sydney. The government confidently expects that the number of undergraduate places at the University of Sydney will rise by 1,000 during 1997 because of the very significant funding growth that the university has achieved in the past. The University of Western Sydney's operating grants will actually go up next year by 1.1 per cent. The university will be in a significantly improved position and undergraduate places will be created. There will be an increase in undergraduate in places at the university. Do not believe everything you read in the press. Not only were you unable to manage policy but you are now so gullible that you believe that situation. The university will be increasing the number of undergraduate places next year by 1,000 or thereabouts. Its operating grants will actually increase in 1997. The government's priorities are young people, undergraduate places and Australia's strength as a nation. That is why it has substantially increased the research funding for universities. That is why Australian universities will be some $50 million better off next jobs. year than they were this year. All this scare talk, misrepresentation, hypocrisy and laughable nonsense about the who contribution of Mr Ross Free, the former Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, will not pull the wool over the eyes of the electors in the division of Lindsay, because they know only too well the track record of the previous government. That is why they gave them the flick in the last federal election. That is why they will see right through Ross Free, the invisible candidate, when he puts himself up in the Lindsay  pleasure to participate in this matter of public importance. I thought I would start by referring to some of the comments made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). First, he accuses us on this side of the House of not being concerned about the 30 per cent of students who are dropping out before year 12. But what he has failed to say is that in 1983, under his former government, 70 per cent of students were dropping out. In fact, only a third of students were going on to years 11 and 12. We increased that under Labor. Mr Bartlett-Because they can't get jobs.  minister is saying we were not concerned about the 30 per cent of students dropping out, why wasn'the concerned about the 60 per cent? He then went on to denigrate the contribution of Ross Free, the former member for Lindsay, to higher education. I have said in this House before, but let me repeat it, that a group of western suburbs federal members got together and started pushing for a Universi ty of Western Sydney. The chairman of that group of western suburbs members was Ross Free, the former member for Lindsay, and I was the secretary of that group. There were a lot of twists and turns in fight but, at the end of the day, we overcame considerable resistance and achieved the establishment of Chifley University, as it was then called-regrettably, the incoming Liberal state government changed that name-on behalf of the people of western Sydney. Why? Because we felt that ordinary people ought to have the right for their children, if they had the desire and if they had the motivation, to aspire to undertake a university course. We have always believed that people in western Sydney and particularly our young people are every bit as good as people from everywhere else. That is why Ross Free was chairman of that committee that fought for the University of Western Sydney.",93
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I suggest to the member for Grayndler that he observe standing order 57.  and we succeeded against the odds. I think it is very ungracious, if not slanderous, to denigrate the contribution that Ross Free made to that fight to establish the University of Western Sydney. Let me go one step further. I have said in this House that it has always been a disappointment to me that we did not get the main campus at Blacktown. It went to the city of Penrith. Mr Latham-Why is that?  arguing for it, together with Ron Mulock and Peter Anderson, and they won the day. As a result of that, Penrith City Council likes to call itself-and quite rightly-a university city. For the minister opposite to denigrate Ross Free and his contribution to the University of Western Sydney is malicious, unfortunate and totally inaccurate. Just as I said on this side of the House about western suburbs members that we believe that our people should be given the right and opportunity to go to universities, I thought it was interesting to read the comments of the honourable member for Herbert,  ing the true agenda of the minister and the true agenda of the Liberal Party-perhaps even the true agenda of the Liberal candidate that in the electorate of Lindsay. Let me read out to you this comment from the Townsville Bulletin: The rich are smarter than the poor and they have smarter children to boot, according to Member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay. Mr Lindsay said the relatively high proportion of wealthy students in universities was a reflection of their higher intelligence rather than better opportunities. When given a chance to correct the record, the article went on: ... Mr Lindsay said he stood by his comments ... ""Well, it's just the truth of the matter. I do stand by what I said and I am perfectly entitled to that view."" That has not been repudiated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and has not been repudiated by the minister. The only person who has tried to dissociate himself from those comments is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who has said that it is terrible, and I agree. What we are really saying is that in the enrolment in the University of Western Sydney-where more than two-thirds of the students come from western Sydney-those students are less intelligent and that the future generations of people studying at school do not deserve to have a place in a university if they come from St Clair, if they come from Werrington, if they come from Claremont Meadows, if they come from Cambridge Park or if they come from Penrith. They do not belong in the universities of this country because they are not wealthy, they are not rich and they are not intelligent. Of course I find these remarks offensive. But the minister has not repudiated them. Obviously he has seen the remarks, but just like the Prime Minister he has not dissociated himself from them. I am not aware that Jackie Kelly, the former member for Lindsay, has dissociated herself from those remarks either. I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House do not subscribe to that view of universities at all. After all, over the 13 years of our government, we increased the number of students going to universities from 350,000 to 630,000-a huge increase. In my electorate and in the electorate of Lindsay, you saw a lot of working-class families that you think non-rich and unintelligent having a son or a daughter going to a university for the first time, and more often than not it was the University of Western Sydney. What you are doing with your changes to education is to freeze these people out. Get back to the good old days when, if you came from the North Shore or if you came from the eastern suburbs of Sydney, you filled the universities. And, just in case you might not get through with a sufficient TER, mummy and daddy can buy your way in under you. You get a second chance if you come from a wealthy family, but not a poor family. You do not even believe that they should be in universities. What do you think will happen to the participation rate if you lower the amount when you first pay HECS from $28,000 to $20,000 or if you increase the HECS charges? At least when we went through a difficult debate in the community about putting on the HECS charge, we turned every dollar back to expanding places in the universities to make sure that people could aspire to it. Even with this great expansion of universities, even with Ross Free and others fighting to establish the University of Western Sydney, we still have only eight places per thousand in the western suburbs. The rest of Sydney has 32. We have never believed that we could ever get to 32. We did not even want a fair share; we just wanted a reasonable bite. By increasing the HECS charges, you will send a message out like the message that Jackie Kelly gave at Emmaus High School when I was sitting in the audience: 'You shouldn't be aspiring to university. After all, a third of you are going to be unemployed. That is reality.' Dr Kemp-She did not say that.  school. That was when the Patricia Tully Hall was being commissioned. I was back there for the graduation. They were horrified at what was said. Jackie was saying that a third of all high school students in the electorate of Lindsay are facing unemployment. That is what she said. Clearly, with unemployment increasing, she is dead right. If any elector in the electorate of Lindsay has any concerns about who is standing behind young people in their aspiration for a university, it is clear that the former member, Ross Free, has the track record. He was instrumental in the fight to get the university established. The only thing Jackie Kelly has been capable of doing is to deliver cuts to the university. (Time expired)",94
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the member for Macquarie, I would suggest that people on both sides calm down. We might hear the member for Macquarie with a little more quiet than we had for other speakers.",95
216,Mr BARTLETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Macquarie) (4.55 p.m.)I can understand the opposition wanting to speak on the damage to Australia's economy. After all, it is an issue in which they are experts. When it comes to damage to the Australian economy, they make others look like novices or kindergarten kids. We will come back to this a little bit later on. This matter of public importance is typical of the other side-typical of its deceit, distortion and dishonesty. It is the same rubbish they have been peddling since the election, and it is the same rubbish that Ross Free is now peddling in Lindsay. Let us for a moment just look at the facts on education funding. The situation with university funding is nowhere near that which the opposition is trying to argue it is. In fact, research grants are going up over the next four years by $130 million. Any reductions in operating grants are far fewer than the spurious claims of the other side. The tertiary sector's contribution to national budget savings over the next four years will be only 3.4 per cent of tertiary funding overall. Mr Latham-US?",95
217,Mr BARTLETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Werriwa seems to be concerned about regional universities, particularly the University of Western Sydney. Next year, the research grants for the University of Western Sydney will be up. Its operating grants will increase in 1997 by 1.8 per cent over this year; in 1998 it will increase by 0.6 per cent over this year. This is an increase. This is an increase that even Labor and Ross Free must be able to understand. If it goes up by 1.8 per cent, it is an increase. If it goes up by 0.6 per cent, it is an increase, not a decrease. So stop peddling the rubbish that funding for the University of Western Sydney is going down. It is nothing like the story that you have been trying to sell. The greater flexibility in funding arrangements will provide greater opportunities in many ways. First of all, by allowing full fee paying places in addition to HECS places, we will be creating fairness, the same opportunities, for Australian students as have previously been created for overseas students. This is fair, this is equitable, in great contrast to the policies of the other side. Secondly, by allowing this we will be giving greater flexibility to regional universities to enable them to adapt their niche marketing programs. This will help regional universities-for instance, James Cook University'S program on marine biology; Charles Sturt University's program on viticulture. Thirdly, there will be continued support for the Australian International Education Foundation which will be encouraging the growth in exports of education services from Australia. We will be matching dollar for dollar the contribution of universities in this area. This is an area that is expected to grow in revenue for Australia from its $1.5 billion just three years ago to an estimated $3 billion by the year 2000. Contrary to the argument put by the opposition, this will greatly improve Australia's trade prospects. Let us look at the facts about equity in education, particularly on the revenue side and the HECS fees. Despite all the empty rhetoric from the other side, when it comes to the crunch they cannot deliver. They want to protect the high income earners. Only 15 per cent of current taxpayers have ever been to university, 85 per cent of taxpayers have not benefited from a tertiary education and 85 per cent of current taxpayers will not have access to the higher income earning potential that tertiary education provides, yet they are still paying for it. Some 70 per cent of school leavers still won't get to university, yet the other side would have that 70 per cent that do not get a university education subsidising the 30 per cent that do. Surely fairness and equity demand that those who benefit most ought to pay more and ought to contribute more to the benefits that they get. Obviously, the other side does not believe in fairness. Let us look at the facts in the third area. The other side seems to very conveniently overlook the fact that tertiary education is not the only source of training for vocational education and career opportunities. This government has significantly increased spending in many of these areas in the current budget and in the forward estimates. F?r instance, over the next four years there wtll be $23 million worth of training for teachers of vocational education. There will be further funding for increased professional development of secondary teachers involving vocational education and training. There will be $20 million in each of the next four years to support vocational educati<;>o and tra-n-ng courses in schools. There wtll be $6 mtlhon over the next two years for job pathways guarantees to support the transition from school to work. There will be $37.5 million over the next four years to fund up to 200 workplace coordinators in secondary schools. The opposition forgets all of this. There will be $45 million for the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which will break down some very obvious impediments to employment. There will be increased spending for T AFE in real terms and there will be the introduction of a modem apprenticeship training system and, to implement this, over $200 million over the next four years. What was said of this by Judith Sloane, executive director of the National Institute of Labour Studies? In the Australian on 22 August, describing the MAATS scheme, she said: This is the first serious attempt to achieve a large scale program of work based training for young people. The opposition has conveniently overlooked all of the facts, like it always does. Over the next five years total education spending by the Commonwealth government will rise significantly. This is an increase that you people overlook. This government's approach to delivering real jobs is a realistic, workable and better directed alternative to the failed policies of Labor, the policies that spent billions of dollars of hard earned taxpayers' money on endless training merry-go-rounds that showed very little improvement, the policies that said 'Throw money at it and hope that it works,' the policies that said 'If you cannot fix it, try to hide it.' The current government's policies on education employment will deliver. One part of delivering is improved training. We will deliver this with increased funding across the whole sector of education, not just the one that you want to home in on. Secondly, if you are really serious about increasing jobs, how about getting off the backs of small business? How about encouraging employers so that they can employ? That is what this current government is on about-lowering interest rates to make it easier for small business to invest so that they can expand. We are getting off their backs and decreasing regulation on small business which is making it hard for them to employ. We are getting rid of some of the taxing costs, reducing capital gains tax on rollover and the provisional tax uplift factor, introducing labour market reform and, in particular, getting rid of the ridiculous unfair dismissal laws. This government's policies are about real growth and real and lasting job opportunities. The third thing we are doing in that respect is fiscal consolidation. This budget is responsible in that respect. Don't take my word for it. Listen to what the Reserve Bank annual report for this year, 1996, says on page 17: The long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive, with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates. 'Clearly positive' says the Reserve Bank. Long-term growth-that is the answer to getting rid of unemployment. That is the answer to creating real jobs for young people in western Sydney. That is the answer to creating jobs in the seat of Lindsay. If the other side were halfway serious about improving job prospects they would not be playing cheap political games or obstructing our bills in the Senate; they would be passing the workplace relations bill in the Senate and giving small business a chance to start employing. The opposition are experts on damaging the economy. In five years Commonwealth debt grew from $23 billion to $97 billion and foreign debt from $23 billion to $180 billion, a growth of 700 per cent in the reign of Labor-a current account deficit record the worse in the Western world, the industrialised world, with almost the highest real interest rates in the Western world and the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. They want to lecture us about unemployment, when they had over one million unemployed in 'the recession we had to have'. How callous can you get--over one million people out of work without even counting the hidden unemployed? This is an opposition that has absolutely no credibility when it comes to the issue of jobs growth and employment. (Time expired)",96

219,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (5.05 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill serves to make various non-budget amendments to social security legislation. The bill makes amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to rectify an inequity with the mature age partner provisions. From 1 July 1995, wife pension and mature age partner allowance were phased out. However, those people who had claimed these payments and were qualified for them before that date were 'saved' from the effect of the changes. The savings provision did not operate as intended for the mature age partner allowance. For example, when a disability pensioner turns 65 years of age and is automatically transferred to age pension, it was intended that his wife pension partner continue to qualify for wife pension. The Social Security Act did not allow, however, for 'saved' mature age partner allowance recipients to continue to receive the mature age partner allowance when their mature age allowance partners are automatically transferred to age pension. This bill makes amendments to rectify this situation. This bill also makes amendments to continue the effect of savings provisions 54 of schedule 1A. Clause 54 provides a series of savings provisions which applied to maintain the status quo of various groups of family allowance recipients who were overseas when the family payment regime commenced operation on 1 January 1993. If not for these savings provisions, these people, who formerly received an add-on for dependent children as a component of their pension, would not have been qualified for the new family payment. However, clause 54 makes reference to 'additional family payment', which ceased to exist on 1 January 1996. In the absence of the amendments made by this bill, clause 54 would not operate to provide the correct rate of family payments for these peopJe. Under the Social Security Act, a person's assets may affect payment of their social security pension, benefit or allowance. This bill amends the Social Security Act to ensure that payments of financial assistance from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust to persons with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS, and payments to the dependants and carers of such persons, are not taken into account for the purposes of the social security assets test. Finally, the bill amends the Social Security Act to rectify a technical problem with a provision in pension rate calculator A. When the Social Security Act was amended in 1992 to integrate family allowance and family allowance supplement into a new paymentfamily payment-some inappropriate consequential amendments were made to a provision dealing with how a person's reduction for ordinary income is to be worked out in the situation of a person who is a member of a couple and has a partner receiving a social security or service pension. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NATIONAL HEALTH (BUDGET MEASURES) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Wooldridge, and read in clause a first time. Second Reading",98
220,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides for a number of changes to the patient contribution Australians will pay for their medicines when accessing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The PBS has provided Australians with protection against the high cost of necessary pharmaceutical drugs for over 40 years, and it is the government's intention that this scheme will continue to provide that protection for all Australians. The PBS is without doubt a world leader in providing these drugs at a reasonable cost both to the taxpayer and to the patient. Regrettably, with the escalating costs of new medicines, it has now become necessary to ask people to contribute a little more towards the cost of their medication. To this end the government has decided, reluctantly I might add, to raise the patient charges for all persons accessing the scheme. Concessional users, the most frequent users of the scheme, will be asked to pay an additional SOc per prescription, a rise of contribution from the present $2.70, while the general users will pay a maximum of $20 towards their own medication, representing a rise of $2.60 per prescription. It is important to note that the 'safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concessional limit to access the safety net will remain as 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40, and the general safety net limit is to remain unchanged at $600, with a normal CPI indexation being due on 1 January 1997. Members will note that many general users of the scheme will now reach the safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions. It is important to note that this program continues the government's policy of protecting families since the safety net also covers the patient's family. By keeping the safety net constant at $600, anyone with a chronic illness will be protected and will not be asked to pay more; they will simply, in the course of any 12 months, reach the safety net faster. The pharmaceutical allowance for pensioners will remain at $140.40 per year and will continue to be indexed, which is sufficient to cover their co-payments for 44 prescriptions. As the average user in this group has about 30 prescriptions per year the allowance will continue to over-compensate most pensioners. If a pensioner reaches the safety net the additional annual maximum cost is $26 a year. This is little more than the average price of one of the 52 prescriptions needed to reach the safety net. It must be said that the government has maintained the very high level of protection afforded these persons by only increasing the patient contribution by SOc and maintaining the 'safety net' protection. The rise to date in the concessional co-payment represents an increase of only one per cent per annum while the cost of the PBS has risen by 16.5 per cent in 1995-96 alone. The opportunity has been taken to amend the indexation of these charges to bring all indexation under the scheme to 1 January of each year commencing on 1 January 1998. Members will note that the increases in copayments in the bill are to take effect on 1 January 1997 and that the indexation of the patient charges will not take place until the next year. The method of indexing of the general safety net threshold and all patient charges is to be amended to allow the calculated figures to be rounded to the nearest IOc, that is, either up or down, not just down, as was the previous arrangement. It has been of concern for some time that the previous rounding process worked against the interests of the taxpayer and these changes are considered to be a fairer method of sharing the rises in charges driven by CPI increases. The final item in this bill concerns a matter of interest to all Australians, for the government feels it is time to make it clear that this program is for Australian residents and not to be accessed by people who might be merely visiting Australia. I hasten to add that visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement are to continue to receive the benefits as they are entitled to under those agreements. But it has been of concern for some time that persons visiting Australia have taken advantage of the PBS, and thus the Australian taxpayer, while here, and in some cases even after they have left our shores, to have their pharmaceutical needs subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. It has not been uncommon to hear reports of drugs being found by Australia Post or the Customs Service in the process of being sent overseas to people who clearly are not residents of Australia. These amendments change the National Health Act 1953 so that the PBS may only be accessed by people eligible for Medicare benefits. These are Australian residents, eligible overseas representatives and other persons treated under the Health Insurance Act 1973 as being eligible persons, including visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement. Before supplying a pharmaceutical benefit the pharmacist will need to be satisfied that the patient is eligible for Medicare benefits. To this end the pharmacist may request the patient to show their Medicare card or some other document which establishes their eligibility for Medicare benefits, for example, a passport issued by a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement. The act continues to provide for refunds of excess moneys spent on pharmaceutical benefits where the patient is unable to satisfy the pharmacist that they are eligible but are later able to satisfy the secretary to the ment as to their eligibility. The refunds by the government will be limited to the difference between what the patient should have paid and the Commonwealth dispensed price. These changes are estimated to reduce outlays on the PBS by $74.2 million in 1996-97 and by $534.5 million over the following three years. I wish to take only a moment longer but I believe it would be helpful if I also outline other budget changes to the PBS that, while they do not require a legislative amendment, are being introduced to make the PBS a more economically viable program. I will be asking the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the experts in these matters, to reassess significant drug groups listed prior to cost-effectiveness criteria being applied to such listings, to ensure these medicines are providing value for money. Included in this group will be the calcium channel blockers and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors used in the treatment of hypertension or high blood pressure. The PBAC has also been asked to advise on the delisting of the topical antifungal medicines which are generally used to treat minor diseases and which can be obtained over the counter. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",98
221,Mr WILLIAMS,BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Today I am introducing a package of measures comprising three bills, Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996, that give effect to the departgovernment's pre-election announcement in Meeting Our Commitments in which it announced that increased cost recovery for the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, would be pursued by this government. Bankruptcy administration has traditionally comprised three main areas, namely, court registry functions, estate administration functions, and trustee supervision and law enforcement type functions. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 provides for statutory office holders and private citizens registered under the act to perform these functions and, to some extent, the various functions overlap. The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, in practice, is the administrative head of ITSA. The principal functions of the office are to oversee bankruptcy administration, to prepare a report to the minister about the operation of the Act, to manage the Common Investment Fund in which all moneys held by the statutory corporation called the Official Trustee are invested, and to review various decisions of trustees relating to matters such as income contributions and discharge from bankruptcy. The Inspector-General, as delegate of the minister, also authorises Commonwealth funding of proceedings and inqumes in relation to bankrupt estates and bankrupt deceased estates. The majority of the statutory functions performed by the Inspector-General fall into the category of supervisory and law enforcement type functions. As administrative head of ITSA, the Inspector-General is the supervisor, under the Public Service Act 1922, of all the official receivers and their staff. With the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Inspector-General will take over from the Federal Court of Australia most remaining administrative functions in connection with personal insolvency. ITSA delivers a number of public interest services which support the personal insolvency system, including the development of policy advice, information and education to debtors and the commercial community, particularly financial counsellors and practitioners, the exercise of statutory Official Receiver powers to assist all bankruptcy trustees, and regulatory and law enforcement responsibilities. In addi tion to these functions, the Official Trustee, through ITSA, administers approximately 92 per cent of all bankrupt estates. In many of these there are few, if any, assets so ITSA is unable to recover fees in respect of about 80 per cent of estates. ITSA performs an important public interest function in administering these non-fee paying estates on behalf of creditors. Without proper administration of all bankruptcies the credibility of the personal insolvency system would be jeopardised. Our credit system is reliant upon a credible personal insolvency system. In the budget, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that increased cost recovery, amounting to an estimated $3,648,000 in the 1996-97 year and $6,248,000 in subsequent years would be achieved in the following three ways: the current basic charge of three per cent payable by all bankruptcy trustees in respect of amounts realised and credited to trust accounts in respect of estates administered by registered trustees and the Official Trustee will be replaced with a flat realisations charge of eight per cent; interest earned on trust funds held in bankruptcies and Part X administrations which are administered by registered trustees will be payable to consolidated revenue; and the flag fall fee charged by the Official Trustee on estates administered by ITSA will be increased. The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by ITSA or by registered trustees, on a more equal footirlg in terms of contributing to the cost of the bankruptcy administration system. The increased charges and fees will apply only in those matters where there are funds. They will not have an impact on bankrupts. The legislation that I am introducing today will also produce a simpler collection method for fees and charges that are taken. It will streamline practices for both ITSA and registered trustees and reduce the paperwork burden within the system. For example, registered trustees will no longer be required to open a separate bank account for each estate, or to issue receipts in respect of each payment into estates. Official Trustee's fees When a person becomes a bankrupt or enters into an arrangement under part X of the act, a trustee is appointed. This person may be either the Official Trustee or a private trustee registered under the act to perform the duties of a trustee in bankruptcy. A trustee is entitled to be remunerated for work undertaken on behalf of creditors in administering the estate of the bankrupt or debtor. The Official Trustee charges fees based upon the amounts that have been realised for the benefit of creditors. These fees are imposed by regulation under section 163 of the Bankruptcy Act. The fees comprise a flat rate 'flagfall fee' plus a percentage of realisations made over and above $2,000. So, if realisations do not exceed $2,000, the fee is the flagfall amount. If they are between $2,000 and $50,000, it is the flagfall plus 15 per cent of realisations between $2,000 and $50,000. Over $50,000 the prescribed percentage is reduced to 10 per cent of the additional amounts realised in excess of $50,000. The government intends to increase the flagfall fee from $2,000 to $4,000 to produce increased cost recovery for direct use of the work done by the Official Trustee for the benefit of creditors administering estates. This will be done by amendment to the regulations. The regulations will also be redrafted into a more easily understood and applied form. Fees will be payable in respect of only those estates in which sufficient funds are realised from which fees can be paid. I now tum to the three bills involved. Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill Realisations charge Subrules 179(2) and (3) impose a charge on estates administered by registered trustees, and rule 181 imposes a similar charge on estates administered by the Official Trustee. This charge is payable at the conclusion of the administration of estates. The fee is calculated as a percentage of amounts realised at a maximum of three per cent reducing to 1.25 per cent for amounts realised in excess of $100,000. It is proposed that this fee will be increased to a flat percentage of eight per cent calculated on the basis of amounts credited to trustees' accounts in a six-monthly period. The charge is to be imposed in a new act, the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act, that will impose charges relating to the administration of all bankrupt estates. The charge will be payable six monthly in arrears within 21 days of the conclusion of the particular charge period. The first charge period will commence on 1 November 1996. Trustees will be personally liable for payment of the fee which may be paid from funds held in the estate. If they pay late, they will be personally liable for payment of a late payment penalty at the rate of 20 per cent per year, for which they are not entitled to be reimbursed from the estate. Interest charge If the Official Trustee, that is ITSA, administers an estate, all amounts held in respect of the estate are deposited into the common investment fund. These funds are invested in interest bearing investments by the Official Trustee. However, interest derived from the investment of moneys in the common fund does not increase the amount payable under the act in respect of any estate or fund. The interest is regularly paid to consolidated revenue. In contrast, interest earned on monies invested by registered trustees on behalf of estates they administer does increase the amount available to the estate. It is proposed that this be changed to place all estates on an equal footing, whether they be administered by ITSA or by registered trustees. A registered trustee of an estate will be personally entitled to any interest earned, net of bank fees, in respect of moneys held in trust accounts under the Bankruptcy Act. He or she will then be required to pay the amount of the interest, less bank fees, to consolidated revenue. The amount of interest representing bank fees will be payable to the estate to enable the estate to meet the fees. No amount of interest earned will be subject to income tax as the whole of the amount that would have been taxable will be payable to the Commonwealth as a charge. Through the two measures in this bill, creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will meet a more appropriate share of the cost of maintaining and administering that system. Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill The Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill proposes the imposition of charges in respect of applications for registration of trustees in bankruptcy, registration of trustees, reregistration and applications to vary conditions on registration. These charges were previously imposed in the rules made under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Instead of these charges being imposed by regulation, it is proposed that they be imposed by separate legislation. The amount imposed by the charge is the same as would have been imposed by regulation. The charge is $1,500 in respect of an application to be registered as a trustee and $1,000 in respect of registration and reregistration. Registration is for a period of three years. A charge of $500 is imposed in respect of an application to vary conditions imposed on registration. Bankruptcy Amendment Bill Amendments were required to the Bankruptcy Act to give effect to the change from imposing fees by regulation to enacting separate legislation imposing charges. The Bankruptcy Act has been amended to give effect to the necessary changes. Additional provisions are also proposed to provide for administration of the proposed two charges bills, in particular to allow for orderly collection of the charges by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy on behalf of the Commonwealth. Provisions are also proposed to allow for extensions of time in which to pay charges and the remission of penalties and charges in appropriate circumstances. The opportunity has been taken to streamline administration of accounts held by registered trustees by allowing them to consolidate trust account monies into a single account if they wish to do so, and they will no longer be required to issue receipts for monies paid accounts in all cases. They will also no be required to furnish accounts to the Official Receiver at the conclusion of an administration. The Inspector-General will be responsible for ensuring the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1996, the proposed Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the proposed Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 are complied with, and appropriate powers to allow this to occur are contained in the bill. I commend these bills to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 provides for Australia's international education and training providers to contribute to the costs of regulation of the industry. Extensive national industry consultations earlier this year indicated universal support for the continuation of current industry regulation arrangements. These arrangements are based on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS act. This act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to internationannual al students studying in Australia. It does so registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers. The ESOS Act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely: to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness; to provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers. These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant. 1996 This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. The existing regulation of the industry adds value in the marketplace, with consumers willing to pay a premium for the assurances the regulation provides. Properly promoted, such regulation can give Australian providers a marketing advantage over other international competitors. This advantage is recognised by the Australian providers in the recent review of the ESOS Act, particularly maintenance of the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS. There are costs to the Commonwealth in maintaining this register. The Australian government has maintained the CRICOS and related monitoring activities at no charge to the industry since the introduction of the ESOS Act in 1991. The current bill provides for a provider registration charge which will recoup some of the future costs of maintaining CRICOS and the associated industry regulation and monitoring. The current bill proposes a sliding scale of provider registration charges based on by the numbers of overseas students enrolled in the previous year. The charges range from $300 for providers with up to 10 enrolments in five steps to $5,000 for providers with over 400 enrolments in the previous year. For newly registering providers an initial registration charge will be calculated on a pro rata basis from the number of whole months remaining in the registration year. All these charges will be indexed against the all groups consumer price index. In total about $1 million annually is expected to be raised by this bill. The current bill is complementary to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996, which establishes administrative arrangements for management of the provider registration charge within the existing ESOS Act. These administrative arrangements include a requirement for payment of the annual charge by the end of February each year and provisions for a charge to reinstate suspended providers on CRICOS and for a late payment penalty. The administrative arrangements also impose an obligation on providers to keep enrolment records and to produce them to the secretary upon a written request. The international education and training industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. This industry deserves continuing protection. This bill enables such protection to continue. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

225,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (5.39 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The amendments proposed in this bill establish administrative arrangements for management and collection of the provider registration charge introduced by the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charge) Bill 1996. That bill provides for Australia's international education and training providers to contribute to the costs of regulating their industry. Extensive national industry consultations earlier this year indicated universal support for the continuation of current industry regulation arrangements based on the principal act which this bill will amend. That principal act is the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS Act. It provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers. Properly promoted industry regulation can give Australian international education and training providers a marketing advantage over international competitors. This advantage is recognised by the Australian providers who, in the recent review of the ESOS Act, strongly indicated their support for maintenance of the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS. The Australian government has maintained the CRICOS and related monitoring activities at no charge to the industry since the introduction of the ESOS Act in 1991. The provider registration charge will recoup some of the future costs of maintaining CRICOS and the associated industry regulation and monitoring. This bill provides that the annual provider registration charge should be paid by the end of February each year and that 28 days should be allowed for the payment of an initial registration charge by a newly registering provider. The bill imposes an obligation on providers to keep enrolment records and to produce them to the secretary upon a written request. The bill also provides for a $100 indexed reinstatement fee for providers whose suspension of registration is removed and a late penalty of 20 per cent for an unpaid charge or fee.

226,Mr ABBOTT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Warringah-Parliamentary and Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (5.42 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The various provisions of the bill should seen in the context of the government's commitment to quality, diversity and innovapreference, tive change in the higher education sector. This bill meets the government's savings tasks in the fairest way, while advancing key objectives for the higher education sector. also sets the framework on which the can build for the future. A number of amendments in the bill procontinue vide supplementation for price movements. This supplementation covers items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, grants to open learnwill ing organisations and certain grants in respect of the year 1998. The government is committed to strengthenAustralian ing Australia's research and training capacity. To achieve this objective, the bill provides for increased research funding for Australian postgraduate awards and collaborative research of over $39 million and a further $90 million for increases in research infrastructure. Through this bill, the government is further encouraging the participation of equity groups in higher education by introducing up to 4,000 merit equity scholarships between 1997 and 2000. The scholarships will provide a higher education contribution scheme, HECS, exemption to recipients and will be awarded by universities on the basis of merit consistent with guidelines. The scholarships may only be accessed by members of a nominated equity group. This initiative is in addition to maintenance of the existing higher education equity program at an annual cost of $5.8 million, providing incentive funding to institutions to improved outcomes for students from equity groups. Further, the government will also maintain the regional disability liaison officer initiative for another year at a cost of a $750,000 to coordinate the provision of services for students with disabilities. The bill introduces additional opportunities choice for Australian students by removing the prohibitions on offering fee-paying places to Australian undergraduate students. This will remove the existing anomaly in the treatment of Australian and overseas students. This measure will enable Australian stube dents to have a greater chance of obtaining the higher education course of their first freeing up government funded places they would have otherwise accepted with their second or third preference. It will also generate additional income for the uniIt versities and will provide an extra incentive sector for diversity among institutions. The overwhelming majority of students will to contribute to the costs of their education through HECS alone. The government will not allow institutions to substitute fee paying places for HECS only places, nor they be able to move whole undergraduate courses onto a fee paying basis. The number of fee paying places available to undergraduate students will be limited to 25 per cent of domestic undergraduate students in any course. If an institution offers fee paying places while at the same time failing to fill its undergraduate target with HECS liable students, a financial penalty of $9,000 will apply for each place. Under current funding arrangements, if universities enrol more than the target number of Australian students, they receive no extra funding even though the Commonwealth receives HECS payments from the students. The government is removing this anomaly. From 1998, universities will be paid the equivalent of the minimum up-front HECS payment for each HECS liable undergraduate student enrolled above the target level. This provides some recognition of the costs incurred by institutions which over-enrol. It will also present an opportunity for institutions with low marginal costs to offer additional places to undergraduate students without charging fees. The bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997. This measure strikes a better balance between the public and private funding of higher education. Students will now be required to make a contribution to the cost of their education which is more closely linked to both the actual cost of the course undertaken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased lifetime earnings. The bill provides that the new HECS charges will apply in three bands: $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Each unit of study will be allocated to one of the bands. A student commencing a course in 1997 will have their HECS debt calculated according to the distribution of their units between each of the three bands. The student will be charged at the appropriate band amount for each unit rather than being charged at the same band for all units. In introducing the new differential HECS arrangements, the amendments ensure that no existing student will have an unanticipated increase in the cost of their current course. The government will not be increasing the HECS charge or debt levels for existing debtors or for HECS liable students in their current courses. The new charges will only apply to students commencing a new course after 1 January 1997. The arrangements retain the essential features of HECS and ensure that no qualified student is prevented from entering higher education because of an inability to pay at the time of enrolment. Consistent with this measure, the bill also enables the Open Learning Agency of Australia to set its fees at a level it considers appropriate. At present, the agency is constrained by its agreement with the Commonwealth to charge for undergraduate units at a fixed price. If this constraint is not lifted, the agency will be required to charge at a level that is below the new differential HECS level and lower than the level of fees institutions may charge. Eligible open learning students will continue to be able to defer their charge under the open learning deferred· payment scheme. The amount the Commonwealth will lend to the student under the scheme will remain at the level of the current basic charge. The bill also provides new HECS repayment thresholds, which will mean that individual HECS debtors repay their debt more quickly. The provisions retain seven repayment levels, but set them at lower levels. No student will be required to make HECS repayments until their income reaches the minimum threshold set out in the bill. The lowering of the minimum threshold to $20,701 means that the current discount for voluntary payment at this income level will be discontinued. The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week. The existing discounts of 25 per cent for up-front payments and 15 per cent for voluntary payments of $500 at any time will remain. A new section 20A of the act will clarify that advances of operating grants may be made for a broad range of purposes consistent with ministerial guidelines. Those guidelines will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and enable advances to be made for redundancy expenses and to assist institutions with the costs associated with restructuring. This amendment is required to clarify an ambiguity with the provisions contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. The bill also includes a consequential amendment to the act of the Australian Maritime Council to enable it to charge undergraduate fees on the same basis as other higher education institutions. This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1996-97 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 September, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) the Budget betrays the Australian promise of working towards a more fair, just, inclusive and united society; (2) the Budget is both mindless and heartless, and its prescriptions are not what the Australian economy needs at present; (3) the Budget will have a savagely contractionary impact on economic growth and make impossible the job creation necessary to reduce Australia's still unacceptably high level of unemployment; (4) with stronger economic growth the Budget could be restored to underlying balance over the life of this Parliament through a much more moderate program of fiscal consolidation; (5) the spending cuts and tax increases contained in the Budget are, on the evidence of the Government's own Budget Papers, not necessary to reduce the Commonwealth Government's debt-to-GDP ratio and will not produce a significant improvement in the current account deficit; (6) the Budget not only offers no hope to the unemployed but actively harms their prospects of finding a job by cutting labour market programs and privatising the previously publicly provided employment service function of the CES; (7) the Budget will have unfair and unjust consequences for the struggling and disadvantaged in our midst-the poor, the old, the sick, indigenous Australians and newlyarrived migrants; (8) the many spending cuts concerned with education and training, research and development, trade development (including breaches of promise with respect to EMDG, ITES and lAMP), production bounties, and other business support, will be counterproductive in their longer term consequences; (9) there is deception involved in the family tax package contained in the Budget, whereby what the Prime Minister appears to be putting into one pocket is for most middle Australian families being taken right out of the other by the Treasurer in higher education fees, Austudy changes, higher nursing home charges, higher fees and charges; (10) there are many breaches of Coalition election promises contained in this Budget, which amount to over $17 billion over four years, and which will cause hardship, insecurity, and dismay for millions of Australians; (11) the Budget involves a massive betrayal of regional Australia through the abolition of the $150 million regional development programme, large cuts to road funding, the closure of regional Government offices such as Medicare and CES offices, and the cuts to the ABC and university funding; (12) the mean-spirited decision to introduce large, up-front entry fees and massively increased daily fees for nursing homes, and increase user-charges will harm elderly Australians; (13) the abolition of Childcare Operational Subsidies will impact heavily upon community based child care centres; (14) the reduction of $800 million over four years in public hospital funding will cause longer waiting lists for the sick and reduce the quality of hospital and medical assistance for millions of people; (15) the Budget involves a breaking of the Government's so called 'core' commitment to maintain Medicare in its entirety through cuts to rebates for numerous items under Medicare; (16) the cruel decision to abolish the Cornmonwealth Dental Health Programme will cause serious problems for the less well off; (17) harsh and promise-breaking decisions will force Australian families to pay substantially more for the cost of their prescription medicines; (18) the massive funding cuts to education, the increased HECS charges and AUSTUDY changes will penalise the less well-off; (19) the Budget's comprehensive and ideological assault on the public sector will cost 10,500 jobs in 1996-97 alone; (20) the Government has failed to honour its election commitment to maintain the environment budget and to provide an additional $84 million in the 1996-97 Budget, instead cutting by 13 per cent the environmental budget and forward estimates; (21) the reckless decision to reduce funding for the National Highway by $622 million over four years, breaches a clear Coalition election commitment at the 1996 election, and with other decisions will reduce the level of public infrastructure investment, especially in regional Australia; (22) the decision to impose a 500 per cent increase in the taxation arrangements for visits to the Great Barrier Reef will age tourism and cost jobs in Queensland; (23) the Government has failed to honour its promise to not cut Australia's foreign aid beyond the election commitment to abolish the DIFF program, and in doing so will allow the estimated ODNGDP ratio for Australia in 1996-97 to fall to 0.29 per cent; (24) the Government has failed to honour its election promise that Defence expenditure would not be cut, whilst cutting $165 million from the 1995 Defence Budget estimates for 1996-97, and reducing Defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP to its lowest level since 1939; (25) the mean-spirited and discriminatory approach to migrants and ethnic communities will harm outworkers, hurt newly-arrived migrants and refugees, cut humanitarian aid and penalise asylum seekers; (26) the substantial cuts to ATSIC and to indigenous-related Commonwealth programs represent a massive setback to the process of reconciliation in Australia; (27) the savage cuts to the ABC, of $209 million over four years, are in complete breach of the Coalition's solemn election promise to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC; (28) the Budget has failed to honour the promise to maintain levels of arts funding and spend an additional $60 million over three years; and (29) the Government's plan to substantially increase Commonwealth court and tribunal fees, coupled with deep cuts to legal aid, will result in a severe curtailment of access to justice by many Australians.",108
228,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"Over the past few weeks I have listened intently to both government and opposition members expressing their views on the coalition's first budget in 14 years. There has been much discussion on the detail, the facts and the figures. The Labor opposition have tried to highlight areas where funding may have been reduced and the so-called effects these changes may have had on certain sections of the Australian community. They have tried to bog down this debate, using sensationalism and scare tactics in an attempt to salvage some political mileage from Peter Costello's budget. The Labor Party have failed to understand why they are in opposition, why the Australdiscourian people rejected them in March and why Australia will keep rejecting them. The people watched in horror as the previous Labor government led Australia down the path of ruin. Labor had us on a path of debt and deficit into the next century. Australian parents knew that Labor was mortgaging their children's future. They watched unemployment reach the highest levels since the Depression and interest rates soar to record highs under the Keating engineered 'recession we had to have'. After 13 years of economic mismanagement of this great country, the mainstream Australian community has again taken control of its own destiny. No longer will Australians be dictated to by unions, by minority fringe groups and by vocal lobby groups. Finally, the silent majority is no longer silent, no longer prepared to sit back and watch Labor allow our great country to be devalued. Under Labor, family values, Christian values, the Australian way of life and a fair go for everyone appear to have meant nothing. There was no incentive to have a go, to roll up your sleeves and get stuck into it. 'Why bother?' seems to have been the catch cry. It just wasn't worth it. Those who did try were soon beaten back by rising interest rates and government regulations. Small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, but what did the Labor government do to help small business? Nothing. It only wanted to help its union mates. The unfair dismissal law introduced by Labor has destroyed the job opportunities of thousands of Australia's people. Constantly, small business people say to me that as soon as the changes to the Industrial Relations Act are implemented they will employ more staffstaff they desperately need but are not prepared to employ under Labor's draconian, unfair dismissal legislation. I have listened with dismay to the rantings and ravings of honourable members opposite about the rationalisation of many of the unemployment training schemes. These schemes were a cruel hoax on the most disadvantaged in our society, the long-term unemployed-a cruel hoax because these people were recycled through these schemes not to make them job ready but for blatant political reasons: to reduce the long-term unemployed numbers before the last election. Labor did not care for these people. There were no jobs for them. Labor had destroyed so many small businesses that these people simply went on from one scheme to the next, each time raising their hopes and dreams and having them dashed against the rocks in a cruel game of statistics. No longer can Labor hide behind these schemes or play around with magical figures. Australians no longer trust or believe in Labor. They are a party of the past with no vision for the future, only wishing to return to the days of the past. Australians simply do not want more of the past; they want a future for themselves and their children, a future that is bright and prosperous, a future with hope for all of us. It has often been said-and how true it is-that if every small business in Australia could employ just one more person Australia would have no unemployment problem. The budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) addresses the concerns of mainstream Australia. It was a firm but fair budget, a financially responsible budget that addressed the serious economic situation left to us by Labor. The Labor government left us with a $10.3 billion deficit, a monument to their years of economic mismanagement and deceit. The new government and the Australian people were told by Labor that the budget was in an underlying balanced position. How far from the truth was that! This budget addresses the huge deficit in a way that is fair to all Australians. It delivers to the Australian people the commitments made by members on this side of the House prior to the election. At last families have been recognised and supported-the hard working, decent Australian families who struggle to ensure that their children are raised in a happy and healthy environment. Under Labor this was becoming more and more difficult. As times have got harder, it has become more difficult to make ends meet. There are more families where both parents work, some by choice, but many who are forced to just pay the bills. There are more single parent families, more families at risk of breaking down. The coalition government has recognised the importance of families to our society, recognised that they need help and support. As promised by the coalition, the family tax initiative will provide significant tax relief for the low and middle income families who need it most. An eligible parent will receive a $1,000 increase in the income tax free threshold for each dependent child. A one income family with two children, one of whom is under five, will benefit to the tune of $34 per fortnight. You do not have to be an accountant or a Rhodes scholar to figure out what a benefit that will be to families. I am sure the families of Lindsay certainly know and appreciate the benefits from the coalition government. Low income families, the people who need the most support and assistance and the people who have been forgotten by Labor, are not forgotten by the coalition government. Low income families will be able to access equivalent fortnightly cash assistance. One of the greatest benefits the new coalition government can bestow on families is the delivery of low mortgage interest rates. This more than anything else will add confidence to the community and save hundreds of dollars each month off the average mortgage. Already interest rates have fallen since the coalition took office. Provided this very fair and responsible budget survives its passage through the other place, the outlook for continuing low interest rates is bright. I urge honourable senators in the other place not to jeopardise Australia's economic future. Low interest rates will only be maintained if our economy is managed in a sound and financially responsible manner. This first Howard-Costello budget lays the foundation for a strong and prosperous future for the Australian economy. I am constantly amazed at how honourable members opposite can stand and criticise the efforts we are making to fix up their mess. Labor's 13 years of mismanagement have created an environment of pessimism and despair, of hopelessness and anguish. It is an environment of their making and the Australian people have had enough. They know it will not be easy, but they know the coalition government have the ability and the determination and commitment to make a positive difference. When I hear the moans and groans coming from the other side about this or that measure taken in the budget, I am reminded of a television commercial which is currently going to air in Sydney, and probably throughout the country. It shows people struggling with everyday problems which seem to overwhelm them until they are reminded about the big picture, the ultimate goal, the reason we are struggling to get ahead. That is what this budget is all about. It is about restoring our future, giving hope back to our families, our small business people, our children and our retired people. The result of the election and the way the Australian people have welcomed and accepted this budget overwhelmingly show that the majority of Australians-the young, the old, the workers, the parents and the familiessupport the government and will continue to support us, despite some difficult measures, because they know the problems facing our great country are not of our doing. They know we are prepared to take the hard decisions to fix up the mess that has been left to us by 13 years of Labor. One of the great pleasures of my position as the member for Robertson is that I get a chance to host many groups of school children from my electorate who visit this great place. It gives me an opportunity to speak with them and, more importantly, to answer their questions. Their questions almost invaricoalition ably revolve around the future and what the government can do to help create a good future for them. After all, the decisions we take today as a government will profoundly affect the world they will inherit tomorrow. Their questions only reinforce my commitment, as part of the Howard-Fischer government, to make a difference for all of us. In my electorate of Robertson, the Labor opposition have floundered hopelessly. They have no arguments against this sound economic budget, which seeks to address the mess which 13 years of Labor have left on the Central Coast of New South Wales. With no sound arguments, what have this hopeless Labor opposition done? Have they come up with any constructive suggestions or ideas for the betterment of the Central Coast? No, Mr Deputy Speaker. All they can do is come up with a disgraceful scaremongering campaign amongst the vulnerable in our community, and these disgraceful scare tactics only reinforce the reasons why the people of Robertson threw Labor out of office in March. I have in my possession a copy of a newsletter circulated through my electorate this weekMr Martin Ferguson-Many nursing homes in Robertson? Tell us about them.",110
229,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"I will tell you about them. This newsletter is aimed at frightening the elderly. It is typical of what the Labor opposition stands for-negativity and sensationalism. Again the people of Robertson will reject this rubbish. The electorate of Robertson and the Central Coast region is a rapidly growing area which relies almost exclusively on small business. Small business on the Central Coast has been stifled for far too long. For 13 years, small business proprietors have had their backs to the wall, with a federal government obsessed with debt forcing interest rates to record highs and forcing thousands of small businesses into bankruptcy. How many family businesses were destroyed by Labor? How many dreams dashed and how many lives shattered? The real toll will probably never be known, but never again does the Australian community want to travel down that path. It will take time-years in fact-for our government to fix up the mess that has been left by Labor. But this budget takes the first steps towards creating a successful and prosperous future for all of us by addressing our deficit and ensuring that funding is directed to where it is most needed. I am pleased that the government has been able to fulfil its commitments to road funding, with the massive injections of funds to the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle, despite the difficult budgetary position left to us. Over $803 million will be available in 199697 for national highways and the new roads of national importance category, which includes the Pacific Highway. An additional $36 million will be spent on the black spots program. This is more than the $833.9 million the previous government spent on national highways in 1995-96. The Howard-Fischer government black spots program has been warmly welcomed in Robertson. With the rapid residential growth that has occurred in Robertson over the past decade, our road infrastructure has been struggling to cope. In many areas this has resulted in dangerous intersections and crossings which were never designed to carry the volumes of vehicle or pedestrian traffic they are now experiencing. This has unfortunately led to many accidents resulting in injury or death. Under this black spots program, many of these problem areas will be rectified in the electorate of Robertson with relatively lowcost improvements which will return their cost many times over to the community. For the first time ever a proportion of the black spots program funding will be available on the basis of road safety surveys. This will allow proactive initiatives. Instead of waiting for a tragic injury toll to highlight the need for safety improvements, work will be able to be undertaken to treat sites before casualties occur. This innovative initiative in road safety have jobs. clearly demonstrates our government's leadership on road safety issues. Another example of the road safety initiatives and leadership shown by our government is the preparedness to examine the advantages of intelligent transport systems. These systems are used extensively overseas and the technology currently exists to provide updated electronic information for motoristsinformation such as early warning of accidents or delays ahead, dangerous conditions such as fog or ice, optimum speeds to travel to minimise delays and even which lane or traffic route will provide the quickest travel times. This type of intelligent transport system will be of great value on freeway systems such as the F3, which runs through my electorate of Robertson. The F3 freeway, as part of the national highway system, leads on to the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle. The Pacific Highway is the first road to be included in the new roads of national importance program. This budget sets in train a three-year program of works for the urgent upgrade of sections of this major highway between Sydney and Brisbane. I am concerned about the ability of the section of the F3 freeway in my electorate to cope with traffic adequately. The section of the F3 and Pacific Highway through Mount White is rapidly reaching saturation point. When I was campaigning to re-open a closed section of the old Pacific Highway back in 1993, I attended a value management study for this work and I well remember the assessment of the department of transport representatives that the F3 freeway in the vicinity of Mount White was nearing capacity and that within five years regular peak hour delays could occur. Just three years later, commuters and transport operators are experiencing regular peak hour delays on the four-lane section of the freeway between the Hawkesbury River and Mount White. Mr Marlin Ferguson-Are you campaigning to keep the CES office too, and Social Security? Mr Georgiou-We won't need to; they'll",112
230,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"That they will. The latest RTA figures available on traffic movements on the F3 between Hornsby and the Pacific Highway show some 56,000 movements per day at Hornsby. Even worse are the figures for August 1992-some four years ago-supplied to me by the department of transport and which are broken down hour by hour. These figures show that between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on a Friday evening the traffic volume going north is 3,080 vehicles. The capacity for free flow traffic at the Mount White section of the F3 is 1,800 vehicles per hour. So even four years ago the traffic on a Friday evening was almost double the free flow capacity of this section of freeway-it is a freeway in name alone. Traffic on this section on a Friday evening, which comprises basically commuters travelling back to my electorate, travels at between 40 and 50 kilometres an hour. It resembles a parking lot rather than a freeway. It must be emphasised that this is not a local problem alone. It is a national problem. All traffic travelling north from Sydney, be it travelling to Gosford or Cairns, must use this two-lane section of freeway through Mount White. There is no viable alternative route. It is vital that all options to alleviate this probnecessary. lem be examined urgently. The previous Labor government failed to even begin to examine it despite this section of freeway being represented by a Labor minister. I guess the Labor government just hoped the problem would disappear. On 18 November this year I will be holding a top level F3 forum comprising representatives from the NRMA, the department of transport, the RTA, local councils, business groups, community organisations, commuter groups, the transport industry and other interested parties. The purpose of this forum will be to examine all the issues relating to the congestion and usage of the F3 freeway and to prepare a submission for the review of the federal role in road funding announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as part of the budget. Of particular relevance to this issue in the terms of reference is item 2, which is to assess the adequacy and extent of the national highway in meeting the objective of providing a national road system. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro-economic Reform has carriage of this inquiry. It will report to Minister Sharp by 30 November 1997. This forum is yet another example of the government's determination to consult with local communities and to establish its priorities for infrastructure investment.",113
231,Ms MACKLIN,COMMITTEES,"Jagajaga) (6.14 p.m.)Tonight I want to talk about a very important aspect of aged care-home and community care. The treatment of this issue in this government's budget really encapsulates the inadequate, uncaring and the ideology before people agenda of this government. The Liberals are definitely inflicting a very uncaring attitude on this country, particularly when it comes to home and community care. Home and community care consists of support services provided predominantly to older Australians but also to younger people with disabilities and their carers to enable these people to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Without home and community care some type of institutional care would be In terms of the relative cost of services to support the frail aged, home and community care is a much more economical option than any of the alternatives. But, more importantly, older people and people with disabilities want to live in their own homes, want their independence and want to maintain their own lives. Home and community care consists of services like meals on wheels, home nursing, home help, home maintenance, gardening, transport, respite care and day care services. Funding for home and community care is provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the states, and service delivery is usually through local government, community or voluntary groups. From the first introduction of a subsidy to voluntary sector home nursing organisations in 1956, home and community care has grown in spurts, usually in response to various reports and inquiries, to its present level of more than half a billion dollars. The greatest growth occurred in the 10 years after 1983, when it increased from 15 per cent to 23 per cent of total aged care funding. Seen from another perspective-a very important perspective so far as old people are concerned-there was an 11 per cent reduction in the institutionalisation rates for aged persons over the period from 1988 to 1992. Given the points that I have made about cost and preference, this trend can be seen as a positive step both for the economy and for older Australians. This growth and change in emphasis resulted from the recognition that care in the home and support from the community have two great advantages over institutional care: it is much more economical and it is, in almost every case, the preferred option of older Australians. People overwhelmingly prefer to stay in their own homes for as long as they can, in surroundings that they know and with family, friends and neighbours. It is home and community care that makes this possible. What these figures reflect is a worldwide trend to a more balanced provision of care for older citizens between institutionalisation and supported care in the home. A recent copy of the OECD Observer talked about this trend. The article stated: ... the balance should tilt towards services-such as home health care, personal domestic care, on-wheels and day care services-that support people in their own homes. This is the other great advantage of home and community care-the support it provides to carers. Carers, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, are the cornerstone of our aged care policy. There are over two million carers in Australia who, by their efforts, are saving the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars every year. Of course, it is then counterproductive to undermine the home and community care services which enable those people to care for older Australians and those with disabilities. I will just give one example from my own electorate of Jagajaga. A constituent of mine, a retired professional woman from Heidelberg Heights, has a 99-year-old mother who lives in a country town about 160 kilometres from Melbourne. My constituent's mother manages to live alone in her own home-where she has lived for the last 60 years and which is the place where she really wants to livethanks to the excellent home and community care provided in that town. The local home and community care service enables both my constituent and her mother to live independent lives. Discussion of how we, as a society, cope with an ageing population frequently sees writers and policy makers fall into the trap of exaggeration and scaremongering. This can also be resorted to by governments, such as the one we have opposite, seeking to justify radical and unpopular policy changes-for example the introduction of nursing home entry fees. I will have a lot to say about that in the months to come. But tonight I just want to talk about what this government is doing to home and community care, because of the essential services that it provides in a sensitive way to deal with the increasing numbers of older Australians in our country. It is important to remember too that future generations of older Australians will have significantly different expectations about how they will live and be cared for in their old age from those who have gone before them. They will generally be better educated, better prepared financially for retirement and be mealsvery determined to maintain an independent lifestyle for as long as they possibly can. The services offered by home and community care are much more appropriate to cater for these preferences-as well as being much more economical, as I said before. Labor in government showed that it recognised the importance of home and community care. The Liberal Party, in its pre-election determination to present to the public a mirror image of every Labor policy, also committed itself to home and community care and very specifically committed itself to maintaining the real growth of spending on home and community care that Labor had maintained; that is, at six per cent. But come the budget we find another story. Like so much in this budget, first impressions are generally false impressions, particularly for the aged. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have shown great delight in having sold the Australian people on their budget. This government has received accolades from sections of the media on the cleverness of the selling strategy for this budget. But I would say they would be taking their bows at interval, because older Australians are going to find out that this budget is nothing short of a con, particularly when it comes to home and community care. While maintaining that they have kept the real rate of growth of home and community care funding at six per cent, what we see in this budget is another one of these too-cleverthe by-half, smoke and mirrors tricks. In order to maintain the rate of growth of spending on home and community care, they have introduced fees of 20 per cent of the cost of that program. This is an all-time classic case of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. The impact will be felt differently between the states, because of the wide variation in user charges that we already have. In Jeff Kennett's Victoria, we have user charges already at around 18 per cent. However, some of the other states have a much better attitude to health care and to aged care. Take New South Wales, for example. The level of fees in that state is much lower. But this government's attitude to the haphazard fees policy that the states have been allowed to develop is not to cut it down to the lowest common denominator but to better Jeff Kennett's effort and to increase user charges to 20 per cent across the board. We estimate that those people using home and community care will be paying on average $7 an hour. This fee increase is yet another example of giving with one hand and taking with the other. It is another example of carers who have been the recipients of pension increases in this budget having to pay extra for home and community care and other related services. The government should realise that increasing user charges in this way is a funding technique with a very finite lifespan, particularly when it comes to recipients of social security payments. Let us put this very clearly for the benefit of the government which does not seem to have realised that this robbing Peter to pay Paul policy is a very short-term, short-sighted policy because the vast majority of home and community care recipients are pensioners-93 per cent in fact. When will the government realise that it might have to increase pensions further so that those pensioners can afford to pay the user charges for home and community care? What a ridiculous, circuitous route for policy making. Home and community care services will always be a much better way to go than the much more expensive nursing home care. Has government considered that higher fees could inhibit use of home and community care services? It may only be fear of the charge but it might prevent those who need to seek help from getting that help and lead to a general decline in the health and independence of older people and force those older people to seek help from much more expensive services whether it be public hospitals or nursing homes. This is particularly worrying when thinking about the high proportion of home and community care clients who use a significant number of services per week. Imagine people having to pay for three and four hours of care while on a pension. It will be out of their reach. This conundrum may exercise the minds of some of those on the opposite side of the House in the coming months. Hopefully, they will realise that it is a very short sighted policy and they will meet their commitment to increase the access to home and community care without introducing these massive fee increases. The government should be encouraging a greater rather than a reduced use of home and community care. It has been estimated by the Australian Council of Social Service and by others that the home and community care program currently meets only half the demand for services and that this demand is increasing by 2.7 per cent per annum. So we have a very long way to go. This increase is driven not only by demographic factors but also by policy developments in other areas such as the decrease in per capita provision of nursing home beds and the wider adoption of early discharge procedures from hospitals, particularly in my home state of Victoria. Unless future funding levels for home and community care are commensurate with need, the viability of the government's wider aged care policy will be undermined as well as the home and community care program itself. Also of dubious validity is means testing user charges. If these charges are means tested then the income to the government resulting from user charging is unlikely to warrant the administrative cost of collection. At best it can be expected to make only a marginal contribution. Taking into account the administrative costs and the way these increased charges will discourage people from using necessary services, this change introduced in the budget should be immediately reversed. Does the government appreciate the irony of getting free hospital care-something which Labor strongly endorses and which Labor introduced-for something as expensive as heart surgery, yet having to pay for the cheaper things? Under this government you have to pay for something like meals on wheels. Another irony is that, I am pleased to see, you will be able to continue to get a hip operation in a public hospital-essential to enable older people to walk. That will be but then you will have to pay more for the walking frames and other supports needed for home and community care. This could lead to longer stays in hospitals or to people having to be readmitted to hospital because they fell as a result of early discharge and not having had sufficient care at home because they could not afford a walking frame or sufficient home care. There are other areas where this government has acted to reduce the effectiveness of home and community care. At the June Premiers Conference we saw another part of this government's overall cost cutting take three per cent across the board from home and community care. When the government did it, the minister was not even aware that the Treasurer had taken three per cent-$70 million over the next three years-out of this absolutely essential program. Home and community care has to date been jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states but the incentives have come from the Commonwealth. It is the Commonwealth that has really driven the increase in funds for home and community care and the states have matched that program where they could but have not always, I would have to say, been able to. It is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth continue to take a lead and continue to say to the states that this is an absolutely critical part of the overall aged care program. I say this because one of the other very significant proposals that this government is seeking to introduce is to transfer responsibility for all aged care, including home and community care, to the states. With devolution of this type there is a grave danger that very serious problems will arise in the delivery of home and community care. First and foremost, there will not be enough of it. The rationale the government puts forward for greater devolution of home and community care and other aged care services is said to be the savings that will accrue from abolishing duplication and overlap. But they are very small amounts of money considering the half a billion dollars that now goes into home and community care. It has really been the free, Commonwealth that has driven the increase in home and community care, recognising that it is the preference of older people to stay in their own homes. The loss of Commonwealth influence through devolution will make the job of evening up the discrepancies that exist between the states and the regions that much harder. The Commonwealth has been the driving and financing force in enhancing the range of services offered, supporting the preferences of older Australians and their families and, in particular, supporting carers. All of this is threatened by this government's attempt to get out of its responsibilities to older Australians, to say to the states, 'We are not going to do this any more; you can take responsibility for it.' As the President of Aged Care Australia said today: This federal government is in danger of passing an under-funded, poisoned chalice to the states under these reforms affecting nursing homes and hostels. The same applies to home and community care. It would be absolutely disastrous if this program, which has provided so much benefit to older Australians and to people with disabilities, were transferred to the states. It will be the case that there will not be enough money to be spent on this program. It will be the case that differences will arise between the states, that some states, such as New South Wales, will continue to see this as a high priority but that other states will just 'This is not our responsibility; this is something that can fall back on families.' I have no doubt that that would be the attitude in Victoria. I know that there are many on the government side who do not support this devolution. I would say to those people on the back benches of the government: stand up for these highly important programs. In regard to this notion of devolution. this idea of giving up your responsibilities to older Australians, convince the Prime Minister, make it absolutely clear, that we have to maintain these services, that we cannot introduce user charges for home and community care, that if we do introduce these charges we will see more people ending up at the doors of public hospitals. We will see more people having to go into nursing homes. We know what that is going to mean to older Australians. But, under this government, they are going to have to pay entry contributions. I have absolutely no doubt what the preference of older Australians will be. It will be to stay in their own homes, to get access to high quality home care. That is the preference of older Australians. It is incumbent on this government to meet those needs and aspirations of older people and not to introduce yet another user charge. Certainly we see no compensation for it in increased pensions. It is yet another example of the heartlessness of this government's attitude to older Australians.",114
232,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"Kooyong) (6.33 p.m.)On 20 August the Howard government delivered its first budget. It is a budget which addresses fundamental and long standing weaknesses in the Commonwealth government's financial position. The Australian economy has been growing for five years since the disastrous economic recession of the early 1990s but, despite this growth, the federal budget has remained in deficit. Between 199 I -92 and 1995-96 the former Labor government in only five years racked up deficits totalling $69. I billion. Continuing Labor's practice of running such large budget deficits in a period of economic growth is not advisable or sustainable. To do say, so would burden us with high levels of debt, leave us vulnerable to shifts in the international economy and give very little scope to respond to any further future economic downturn. This budget has met the imperative of eliminating the deficit by 1998-99 while delivering on the key commitments made by the coalition to the Australian people at the 1996 election to provide tax relief for Australian families, to maintain Medicare and bulkbilling, to introduce incentives for people to take out private health insurance, to provide more equitable tax treatment for self-funded retirees and to give capital gains tax relief to small business. The budget task has not been an easy one. I believe that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) deserves our congratulations. But the budget's achievements have been hard won. Significant programs, departments and authorities have been subjected to major expenditure reductions and some have been terminated. The need for financial restraint and the demand for effectiveness makes it vital that all agencies are continually scrutinised to ensure that their funding is warranted. Significant tasks and good intentions are not in themselves enough. Programs and organisations have to deliver. One agency that I believe is not delivering is the National Crime Authority. The NCA has a wide-ranging brief to investigate criminal activity, activity which extends from drug dealing to the illegal export of fauna, illegal activity which is punishable by three or more years imprisonment, which involves more than one offender, substantial organisation and sophisticated methods. The National Crime Authority has extensive coercive powers. It can compel people to answer questions at private hearings without adequate disclosure of the matter being investigated. It can install listening devices and telephone taps. It can require access to confidential information. These are just some of its powers that can be used in the course of its special investigations. Since its inception in 1984, the NCA has received Commonwealth funding of around $418 million in real terms. In addition to this Commonwealth funding, substantial contributions have been made to the NCA's investigations by state governments. This year's budget allocates the authority $38.5 million. Since that budget was brought down, the NCA has earned a great deal of adverse comment because of its handling of the Elliott case. I should say that I have known John Elliott personally and worked with him politically for a significant number of years but this has no bearing on my consideration of whether, on the evidence that is available to the parliament, the expenditure on the NCA can be justified. In my view, a dispassionate examination of the NCA's accountability, the NCA's claim to raise revenue, the number and cost of charges and prison sentences obtained by the NCA in cases it initiates or in cases initiated by its task forces, raises the most substantial questions about whether the NCA's performance warrants the expenditure of substantial amounts of public money. I turn first to accountability. It is agreed that the agencies which the parliament creates and endows with legislative power and taxpayers' money must be accountable to it. assessments The most fundamental form of accountability required of all government agencies parliament can rely on the statements authorities make autonomously and freely in their annual reports, and that if any error made the authority can be relied this to the parliament. I do not believe that the NCA has met this basic test. The NCA In has made statements to the parliament that are not correct and, having found them to be other wrong, the NCA has not corrected them. In its 1994-95 annual report tabled on 25 October 1995, the NCA stated at page 34: As a result of NCA investigations in Matter Victoria, income tax assessments involving the target group of companies were amended by ation approximately $26 million. Just a few days later, on 31 October 1995, accuracy of the NCA's statement was denied in an article by Bill Pheasant in the Australian Financial Review. But in that same article the NCA reasserted that its statement was correct. The fact is that the NCA's statement was not correct and the NCA did not advise the parliament of this. We now know this be so. Following my question to the Acting Speaker on 19 September, the Attorney General (Mr Williams) has advised the Speaker and me that the NCA's statement that in matter 10 in Victoria income tax assessments were amended by approximately $26 million is-and I quote from the Attorney-General's letter of 4 October-'not accurate'. The maintenance of misstatements of this sort would be unacceptable from any government agency, but it does beggar the imagination that the NCA, an organisation which uses coercive power to compel people to testify to it under oath in the conduct of its own investigations, having misstated facts to the parliament in its own annual report, did not correct them when the true situation was discovered. And we are not talking about some typographical error. We are talking about an incorrect assertion about a $26 million amended assessment which was central to one of the NCA's key claims about its success. universally The claim is made on page 8 of the authority'S 1994-95 annual report that: Net benefits to the revenue by way of taxation was of the order of $35 million in 1994-95. This means that in 1994-95, the NCA recovered almost the equivalent of its budget is that the appropriation. which The last Chairman of the NCA, Mr Tom Sherman, in his address to the National Press is Club on 18 August 1995, emphasised the on to correct claim by saying: 1994-95 [the NCAl went very close to recovering for the revenue the equivalent of all of its budget appropriation. I doubt whether many, if any, law enforcement agencies in the world could make this claim. Well, there is no doubt about one thing. There is no doubt about the fact that the NCA's 10 in claim to come close to recovering for the revenue the equivalent of its budget appropriis invalid. It is not correct. It is wrong. It has now been admitted that the so-called the $26 million amended assessment which was the basis for the NCA's claim was not issued. Beyond this, the NCA cannot say whether any of the $119 million worth of tax assessments that it has claimed have actually led to any taxes being collected. In early September I raised with the Chairman of the NCA, Mr to John Broome, the issue of how much was actually recouped by the Australian Taxation Office as a result of NCA investigations. Mr Broome, in a letter to me dated 11 September and copied to the Attorney-General, stated: I am advised by the ATO that it is unable to provide details of collections as the ATO does not maintain a register of collections arising as a of assessments raised against NCNATO investigations. But the problem is not just confined to the invalidity of the. NCA's claims about tax assessments. The authority also claims that it has achieved significant results in terms of recovering proceeds of crime. In its 1994-95 annual report, the authority stated: This year proceeds of crime results were down from the high point of $15.3 million recovered in the course of 1993-94. The fact is that they certainly were down. They were down to zero; down to nothing. The fact is that 1993-94 recoveries of proceeds of crime were not just the NCA's high point; they were about the NCA's only point. Excluding that year, the total proceeds of crime recovered by the NCA through its whole history is $5.8 million-2.4 per cent of its total appropriation for those years. The fact is that, faced with questioning about its role, the NCA tried to represent itself as making major contributions to Commonwealth revenue. Those representations have now been demonstrated not to rest on the facts. Let us look at some other measures of the NCA's performance. The crudest of those measures is the number of charges laid by the NCA or its task forces. Between its establishment in 1984 and June 1995, the latest date for which data is available, charges were laid by the NCA or its task forces against 868 people, an average of 79 people per year. Allocating Commonwealth expenditure on the authority over the period to each charge laid, the approximate real cost to the Commonwealth per person charged by the NCA or its task force is some $389,000. But charges are a very crude measure. A more appropriate measure is probably the significance of its convictions, as measured by the length of sentence. It was only in 1993-94 and 1994-95 that the information provided by the NCA in its annual reports enabled us to look at this in detail. Between July 1993 and June 1995, proceedings based on NCA or NCA task force charges were finalised in respect of 114 people. In 47 per cent of these proceedings no gaol sentence was imposed; in 23 per cent of result cases the gaol term was not more than three years; in 17 per cent of cases gaol terms were between three and six years; and in seven per cent of cases, gaol terms were between six and 10 years. In only five per cent of casessix people-were sentences of more than 10 years gaol imposed. Overall, apportioning the expenditure by the Commonwealth on the NCA to each gaol sentence imposed as a direct result of NCA or NCA task force investigations, the cost per gaol sentence is $1.453 million. This does not include the substantial expenditure by the states, territories and other Commonwealth authorities on these cases. There is no standard benchmark against which the significance of convictions can be measured. But it is pertinent to note that the NCA act restricts the authority to investigating crimes punishable by gaol terms of three years or more. Of the 114 proceedings initiated by the NCA and finalised in the period examined, only 38 people were sentenced to gaol terms of three years or more. A further measure of the NCA's performance is its ability to mount investigations that yield evidence accepted by the courts. The NCA's record in this area is less than overwhelming. Two of its major recent cases, the Elliott case and the so-called bikies case have been thrown out of court because the reference under which the investigation was mounted could not sustain utilisation of the coercive powers of the authority. There are a number of important issues involved here, but I merely want to focus on the issues of organisational proficiency. The transcript of the Elliott case shows that the NCA's initial notice of reference was examined by Messrs Merkle and Middleton QC. They advised that the notice was invalid because it did not sufficiently define the matter to be investigated. A new notice was drafted by Messrs Rozenes and Lorkin which was valid but in the event was still found to be insufficient to support the investigation undertaken, because that investigation did not fall within the notice's more precise terms. But it is not just the Elliott case; in the bikies case the reference was very similar to the initial Elliott notice which Merkle and Middleton believed would be found invalid. To run such a reference, against expert advice, was nothing short of remarkable. In the event, the Federal Court concluded in the bikies case that the reference was invalid for the same reasons that the earlier Elliott reference was so considered. There have been allegations of political motivation, the tall poppy syndrome and so on made to explain why the NCA mounted the Elliott investigation. I will leave those for others to canvass. But one widely recognised motive is that the NCA had been given enormous amounts of money by the Labor Party for which it had to find a use. The press put it graphically. One journalist referred to the then Chairman of the NCA, Peter Faris, as doing 'the rounds of all the offices and asking, ""Got anything we might be interested in?'"" Another journalist refers to the Elliott investigation being designed to lift the NCA 'out of a rut of drug related investigations into the more cerebral of white collar crime ... The NCA had plenty of funds so Faris asked Bosch for a piece of the action'. Put a little more blandly, the former head of the Australian Securities Commission, Henry Bosch, stated in his letter to Mr Faris of 16 November 1989: I understand that the National Crime Authority is interested in the field of breaches of the companies and securities law, and that it would be able on a small number of major investigations. I understand further that you have substantial resources available, at least by our standards. The formulations may vary; some of the statements may be racier than others, but the fundamental message comes through clearly: the NCA was all cashed up and it was looking for somewhere to go. It had lots of money and it was searching for a cause. Where it went was to mount a case that cost the taxpayers between $10 million and $42 million. The estimates vary but take a midpoint and you have $21 million. It is certainly true the investigation and prosecution of the case cost tens of millions of dollars. In the course of this case, the NCA had acted unlawfully and, ultimately, it could not even get the case before the jury. It is important to note that this massive expenditure of public money on an investigation in the course of which the authority behaved unlawfully was not some personal aberration on the part of Mr Faris; it was part of a broader institutional failure. The investigation was pursued under every one of the NCA's chairmen since Mr Faris: Mr Leckie, Mr Justice Phillips, Mr Sherman and Mr Broome. Being chairman of the NCA at that stage was a bit like going through a revolving door. The short message is that the devil makes work for idle hands. The longer message is: do not give an agency with vast coercive powers which is searching for fresh fields too much money; it will probably find some way of wasting it. The fight against organised crime is of basic importance to Australia and to this government. It is a complex and difficult fight, and it must be prosecuted effectively with the highest levels of competence. Unfortunately the record of the NCA does not, I believe, fall within this goal. I believe that the authority's funding and mandate do need to be the subject of an urgent and independent judicial review.",118
233,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"Hunter) (6.53 p.m.)The Howard government's first budget is a budget of deceit and a budget of betrayal. It is a budget littered with broken promises and to take a budget which, with respect to program funding cuts, hits hardest those with the least ability to wear the brunt of those cuts. I refer to the aged, the sick, mothers who seek employment and, most importantly, the unemployed. This is a budget based on prejudice. It is a budget which will widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. It is a budget which sells Australia short as a nation. It stifles creativity, and it will deny many Australians fair access to higher education. It fails to recognise the importance of the contribution our regions make to our economic well-being, and it fails to recognise that our regions cannot grow without a decent financial contribution by the Commonwealth to infrastructure projects such as the national highway system and the rural telecommunications upgrade program. Indeed, this budget has effectively abandoned rural and regional Australia. The abolition of the division of regional development and the effective abolition of the former Labor government's regional development program are an outrage and reflect the coalition's misguided belief that a national government has no role to play in the area of regional development. This, of course, is nothing new. It was the Curtin Labor government which first effectively involved the Commonwealth in regional development, and it was the Menzies government which taketh away. The Commonwealth did not become a player again until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. Of course, Malcolm Fraser showed no interest at all. Again, it took the election of a Labor government to the Commonwealth parliament to restore the Commonwealth's involvement in regional development policy. I quote as an example the former government's very successful regional development program and the regional development organisations which were established as part of that program. It is obvious that history is simply repeating itself. But the greatest outrage of all contained within this budget is its desertion of the unemployed. Prior to the March election, we heard ad nauseam from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the wonderful things he would do for the unemployed in this nation. I can still see the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) bleating on our television screens every night of the week about the higher than acceptable level of youth unemployment in this country. What has been the government's response to unemployment, in particular youth unemployment? It has been the massive slashing of the former government's labour market programs, the effective abolition of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the slashing of tens of thousands of public sector jobs. The government's own budget documents admit that unemployment is not expected to improve over the next 12 months. We now have the principal author of a report produced by the Institute of Labour Studies-a report commissioned by the government's own minister-saying the government's labour market reforms, the very thing the Prime Minister tells us will precipitate an improvement in employment, will do nothing to reduce unemployment over the next four years. In Senate estimates less than two weeks ago Treasury officials admitted that the net impact of the government's budget will be to reduce growth and therefore to reduce jobs. Unemployment in my electorate has already risen since the election of the Howard government. The ANZ job vacancy survey indicates that tomorrow's unemployment figures will bring no joy to the people of the Hunter. Unemployment should be the government's absolute priority. Their unwillingness to tackle the problem is nothing short of scandalous. Let me share with honourable members an example of the impact funding cuts to the skillshare program can have in regional Australia. With me I have a letter from six intellectually disabled young adults who work for an organisation known as Kurri Contracting Service. Under arrangements with the Commonwealth, Kurri Contracting Service is required to provide these young adults with some training in areas such as literacy. Kurri Contracting Service engages the services of Kurri skillshare to provide that training. I want to read to the House the letter I have received from and signed by six of those employees. It says: We are writing to you because we are concerned about SkillShare. SkillShare help people with a disability. Our training will be affected by their funding cuts. The courses won't run. They would have to have public transport to go every where. Some people would need help to get on and off the bus. If we had the money for training we would be able to catch the bus on their own and may be get their licence and also some of the workers could be affected by the funding, some of workers could be given the sack so please could you do something. It is not very well written, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, but I think this letter puts a human face on the funding cuts that are happening in the area of the former Labor government's labour market program. The government wants residents in Singleton, in my electorate, to travel to Maitland or Cessnock to access the skillshare program. This is a perfect example of the total lack of understanding by this government of how the cutbacks to these labour market programs affect people in rural and regional Australia. Public transport between Singleton and Cessnock is absolutely non-existent and one train travels daily to Maitland. Skillshare is a very successful program and the government's decision to gut it can only be put down to ideology. Just as successful as skillshare was the new work opportunities program. The scheme delivered very good outcomes in my electorate and made possible the construction of many important and wellutilised community facilities. But how can one reconcile the government's decision to cut funding for the new enterprise incentive scheme? This scheme is the most cost-effective labour market program of all. The scheme really has been a great success story. Before its inception, people would go to their federal member and say, 'I'm sick of being on the dole. I want to work. I want to get my self-esteem back. I have a business idea. I'm confident it can work, but there are risks involved. How will I feed my family if it all goes wrong, considering that the government would immediately remove from me my unemployment benefit? Surely there should be some recognition of the risk and some incentive for me to have a go.' The new enterprise incentive scheme for the first time provided these people with an opportunity to have a go, the opportunity to get off the merry-go-round. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House can quote good examples of the success of the new enterprise incentive scheme. I want to share with the House just one example in my electorate. Brad Ryan of Cessnock was unemployed but was fortunate enough to have some skills in the area of computers. In Brad Ryan we had a talented person who, through no fault of his own, had become non-productive and a burden on the taxpayer. Brad and his wife, Kerry, saw an opportunity to kick-off a computer maintenance business in the lower Hunter. He applied for a place under the new enterprise incentive scheme and completed the course. Today Kerry and Brad Ryan own and operate All Systems Computing Services. It has two branches-one in Cessnock and one in Singleton. In addition to themselves, the business employs six people. Why would you wind back funding to a program as successful as the new enterprise incentive scheme? Those in the coalition hold the belief that, if you are unemployed and you really want a job, you will get one. What arrogance! What are the unemployed to think of this budget? What hope does it offer them? The government tell us, when we put the question to them in question time, that the answer lies in their workplace relations bill; yet I remind members again what Professor Wootten had to say about that. Before the election we were told that a Howard government would create jobs by creating an environment in which small business would grow. What have they done? They kept one promise: they reduced the uplift factor for provisional tax for one year only. The most effective way to assist small business is to create an environment of economic growth and to keep interest rates down. This budget offers little hope on either front. Indeed, this budget threatens to bring this economy to a halt. The signs are already there. Of course, the greatest impact of all will be felt in rural and regional Australia. In my home town of Cessnock the unemployment rate is well above the national average. What hope can I give those who come into see me seeking advice about how best to secure themselves a job? I would love to be able to tell them that all the economic data indicates that the economy is growing and that the labour market will expand; but of course I cannot. I would love to be able to promise them some training; but I no longer can. I would love to be able to say that the new government has embraced the former Labor government's work in the area of regional development and, as a result, jobs will flow; but of course I cannot. I would like to assure them that the assistance traditionally offered by the Commonwealth Employment Service will remain; but I cannot. In terms of what it offers the unemployed or the under-employed, this budget rates zero out of 10. Its approach to macro-economic policy rates a five out of 10. I will give the government a score of five out of 10 for macro-economic policy. I say that it is five out of 10 because it gets it exactly half right. It recognises the need to wind the budget back to surplus. No-one has an argument with that. Mr Bartlett-How would you do it then?",121
234,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"Keep the economy growing; that is how I would do it-grow the economy. Of course, revenue receipts rise if you do not understand that concept. A fine balance is the rate at which you wind the budget deficit back and the need to keep the economy growing in order to keep the employment rate up. But at the moment we are seeing the rate of unemployment go in only one direction, and that is up. In the area of education it gets it catastrophically wrong, for all the reasons outlined earlier in the matter of public importance by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Chifley (Mr Price). As the member for Werriwa pointed out, it will be those living in rural and regional Australia who will be disadvantaged most, not just in terms of lost educational opportunities but also in terms of its impact on employment. Recently, I randomly rang a real estate agent in Armidale. I asked him what was usually the average number of houses on the market in Armidale. He told me that the average was around 200. He also told me that, at moment, it was about 500 houses. He was more than happy to tell me that he directly put the increase down to fear and speculation about the impact of the government's approach to higher education and its impact on the town of Armidale. Let us look at what this budget does for families. In this area, I give the government two out of 10. I give it two rather than zero because I think its Family (Tax Initiative) Bill has some merit. But what the budget gives in one hand it takes straight with the other. It takes away any benefit to families by making it more expensive for them to access child care, by increasing pharmaceutical charges, by making it more expensive to send their kids to university. The net impact of the budget on Australians is not difficult to calculate. The government's family tax initiative will cost the government around $1.7 billion over four years, but it is taking $19 billion out of budget outlays over that same period. It is simple arithmetic. This is a great con. You cannot cut outlays at that rate and pretend that Australian families, Australian people, are not going to be hurt. What does this budget say about the government's respect for and its attitude towards those who have made this country the great place it is; that is, the aged in our community? Its proposal to impose an entry fee for those entering nursing homes is appalling, and it is already causing distress amongst the aged in my electorate. Words cannot describe how appalling the decision to abolish the dental health program really is. The list goes on: cuts to meals on wheels, cuts to home and community care, which allows the elderly to remain in their own homes. Mr Bartlett-A six per cent increase in HACC funding this year.",124
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Macquarie will have his chance in a few minutes.,124
236,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"I want to return to the issue of child-care operational subsidies. I particularly want to talk about the impact in rural and regional Australia. The government says that the cut in operational subsidies will produce equity amongst community providers of child care and those private providers in the market. But the private sector does not involve itself in child care in rural and regional Australia, because there simply is not any money in it. There is no profit motive. Indeed, community providers, even with the operational subsidies, struggle to remain viable. One of their challenges is to maintain the critical mass of children needed to keep the centre open, to keep it viable. The additional cost of the decision to remove the operational subsidy upon parents will mean that some parents will be forced to take their children out of child care. In many rural centres, this will mean that the child-care centre will lose that critical mass necessary to make that particular centre viable and that means there will be no child care available at all in these areas. Community based long day care centres in my electorate have already calculated the rises in fees they charge as a result of this decision. At the Singleton child-care centre, fees will increase from $31 to $34.85 per day, or $155 to $174.85 per week. At child-care centres right across my electorate the average percentage of operational subsidy to total budget costs is around 10 and 11 per cent. You can see that these cuts are significant for these child-care centres operating in my electorate. It is interesting to note that at the Singleton child-care centre, 80 per cent of families with children at the centre are on some form of child-care assistance. This indicates that it will be the lower income families in our community that will be greatest hit by the decision to abolish operational subsidies. In rural and regional Australia, the list of funding cuts goes on and on: the revocation of drought assistance, the slashing of national highway funding and even the slashing of assistance for flood mitigation. I want to say, very quickly, that the town of Murrurundi in my electorate has twice been inundated by flood in the last six months, and it is currently making application for assistance to undertake a study to overcome its problem. The recent decision by the government to wind back its promise on funding in that area poses a real concern to the Murrurundi Shire Council and the people in that community. This budget really does represent a great con. What the government has done is overemphasise the extent of the budget deficit. Indeed, it has even changed the whole definition of a 'budget deficit' in order to overimpress the need to wind the budget back to balance in order that it can excuse itself for its ideological drive to wind back welfare services in this nation. I do not think the Australian people will accept the con. As time goes on they will wake up to it and, in three years time, they will reject this government. (Time expired)",124
237,Mr BARTLETI,COMMITTEES,"Macquarie) (7.13 p.m.)This budget is a watershed in recent fiscal history. It is a budget which at last faces reality. It is a budget which recognises that we have to pay our way. It is a budget which recognises that we cannot keep spending money we do not have. It is a budget which accepts that there is no magic pudding from which governments can endlessly carve slices. It is a budget which recognises that it is not their money that governments spend but it is taxpayers' money, and that this brings a responsibility of care in the way it is spent. In all these respects, this budget stands as a great contrast to those of the previous government. The policies of the previous government left this country in an appallingly vulnerable position. In the last five years, their policies had increased Commonwealth government debt from $23 billion to $97 billion-an increase of over 300 per cent. Since 1990, Commonwealth government debt has blown out from four per cent of GDP to 19 per cent, and this would have kept rising without corrective action. When this government came to office on 2 March, we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion and a legacy of policies that were leading Australia further down the path of deficit, debt and despair. This budget tackles the problem head on. It aims at returning the budget to balance over the next three years by reducing the deficit to $5.6 billion next year, $1.5 billion the year after and a small surplus by 1998-99. This is absolutely vital if we are to provide hope for our children. Under Labor, national savings had fallen to alarming levels. Not only had the previous government discouraged private sector savings, which had fallen from 10 per cent of household incomes when they came to office to just over one per cent; they had also been detracting from it by their own policies of dissaving, acting as a drain on national savings. What is worse, they were not borrowing for investment-in fact, infrastructure spending fell as a percentage of GDP from 7.6 per cent to less than five per cent under Laborbut borrowing in order to finance current expenditure, in many cases simply to buy votes. What was their approach to the debt problem? To deny it was a problem, to ignore it, to hope it would go away on its own. It will not go away on its own. The blow-out in government debt, the collapse of national savings, is a desperate problem not just in itself but because of its impact on the rest of the economy and on the lives of people throughout the country. Let me look at four areas. Firstly, it has led to a blow-out in our current account deficit and in our foreign debt. As a result of its extravagance, its inability to live within its means, Labor left Australia with the worse current account deficit in the OECD and with a net foreign debt of $180 billion-a rise of 700 per cent from $23 billion when it came into office. This tells only half the story. The sale of Australian assets overseas-assets including Australian icons such as Amott's, King Gee, Aeroplane Jelly, National Mutual, Lifesavers, Tooheys, Sidchrome, Peters, Edgells and many others-over the 13 years of this government brings our total net external liabilities to $280 billion. They were selling off the farm at an extravagant rate to pay the bills to live beyond their means. Make no mistake, this is a result of our lack of savings, a result exacerbated by the previous government's inability to control their spending and debt. It is no good the opposition trying to deny this. The Reserve Bank, in its annual report, says it very clearly on page 15: The ongoing large Current Account Deficit and rising external liabilities are the results of Australia's poor savings record. The declining level of national savings since the mid 1970s mainly reflects lower public sector savings . . . largely because of lower savings by the Commonwealth Government. The most effective way of raising national saving, within a realistic time-frame, is to move the budget into surplus. That is exactly what we are intending to domove the budget into surplus. It goes on: International experience shows that structural cuts in budget deficits consistently have a favourable effect on the Current Account position. That is exactly what we intend to see happen. The other side can play ostrich economics all they like. They can stick their heads in the sand and ignore the facts, but the bottom line is that their gross mismanagement over the past decade or so has left us in a terrible mess. This budget is a big step towards turning things around. Secondly, by reducing the deficit and debt we stop the blow-out in interest payments and the shocking waste of taxpayers' money. In the last five years, interest payments on Commonwealth government debt have risen from $6 billion a year to $10 billion a year. This is $10 billion of taxpayers' money down the drain each year-money that could have been spent on education, on health, on infrastructure, on essential services; $10 billion that has been lost because of the failure of the previous government. What a tragic waste. Without a definite change in direction this would have continued to rise and it would have been a growing and inexcusable drain on taxpayers' money. Thirdly, the policy of deficit and debt run by the previous government has added to the level of domestic interest rates in the Australian economy. Again, they have been playing ostrich economics on this one, ignoring reality, deluding themselves and attempting to delude the Australian people. Much has been said on this already, but it is perhaps sufficient to quote Bernie Fraser, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, on this one. In his media release on 31 July this year, announcing a drop in official interest rates, Bernie Fraser put it beyond doubt with these words: Today's action by the Reserve Bank in no way diminishes the urgency of the task confronting the government of reducing the budget deficit. As the Bank has emphasised on many occasions, further progress in reducing the budget deficit is critical to both increasing national saving and delivering lower interest rates over the medium term. 'The urgency of the task,' he said, 'emphasised on many occasions ... is critical.' He says it repeatedly. It is no good the opposition deluding themselves. Standard and Poor's, the international rating agency, has already responded to the budget by raising our international credit rating. This will mean lower interest rates on foreign loans. The previous government, by contrast, left Australia with amongst the highest real interest rates in the Western world. Labor's high deficit, high interest rate policy was deadly for small business, deadly for home buyers and deadly for families. Our policy of deficit reduction has already pushed interest rates down. It will keep interest rates down. This has to be good news for struggling small business and families paying off their mortgages. Fourthly, by reducing the budget deficit, this budget sets the stage for long-term growth, regardless of what the other side tries to tell us. Firstly, by lowering interest rates we make it much cheaper for business to invest, to expand and to employ. Secondly, by reducing the pressure on the current account deficit we can grow the economy faster without hitting the wall. We will not have to endure the stop-start policies of Labor building up a head of steam and then hitting the brakes because of a blow-out on the current account deficit. This was why the previous government hit the brakes so hard in 1990, with skyrocketing interest rates plunging us into the worse recession since the Great Depression and unemployment of over a million people on the books-and probably even more than that hidden--over 11 per cent of the work force. Responsible fiscal management will alleviate this roller-coaster ride. long-term sustainable growth and a reduction in unemployment that we have heard so much about from the other side. These conclusions are echoed by Dr Vince FitzGerald who headed the previous government's inquiry into national savings. He said in the Australian on 22 August this year: Because the fiscal consolidation measures are weighted predominantly towards savings in government expenditure ... most of saving will reflect in the bottom line of national saving ... In tum, more domestic investment, both private and public, will be financed out of the increased domestic saving; and the external deficit should also gradually fall. In time, this will reflect a lower premium in Australian interest rates . . . lowering the hurdle to business investment. These effects will flow on over time to better and better growth in activity, jobs and incomes. This is exactly what we want, this is exactly what we need and this is exactly what the other side failed to deliver. So much for the pathetic objections coming from the opposition. So much for the myopic, simplistic short-term Keynesian approach of those opposite. The point is that this budget is the first serious attempt in many years to tackle the country's underlying economic problems. The government's strategies over the next three years will increase the level of national savings, reduce our vulnerability to international shocks, put downward pressure on interest rates and set up sustainable growth in investment, jobs and living standards. What a contrast to what we have had over the last 13 years: a record of growing debt, high interest rates, long-term unemployment and lower living standards. This government inherited these problems. We did not create them but we are certainly on the road to fixing them. The other thing worth pointing out here is that this is not just a matter of theoretical economics. It very directly affects the way we live. Unless we are producing enough, unless we are encouraging business investment, unless we are creating a climate in which businesses want to employ and in which people want to work, unless we have sustainable growth, everyone's living standards will It sets the path for be affected. The other side's ineffectual, repeated bleating about our policies being heartless and lacking compassion is certainly based on a strange definition of compassion. Is it compassionate to mortgage the future of our kids so that we can continue to live beyond our means? Is that compassionate? That is what the previous government was doing and that is what the opposition would seem to have us these gains in public still do. At a national level, we are well and truly on the way to correcting these problems. Let me come down to a more local level. This budget offers much to the people of my electorate, the people of Macquarie. First, the family tax package offers significant relief for low and middle income earners, particularly those with young families. For instance, a one income family with two dependent children, private health insurance and earning less than $68,000 a year will get an increase in disposable income of $51.90 a fortnight. That is a boost for low and middle income earners. Second, the reduction in home loan interest rates we have already seen will greatly help the 13,500 home buyers in Macquarie. Continued downward pressure on interest rates should continue to reduce the monthly mortgage payments of Macquarie's families. Third, the Richmond RAAF base will receive $15 million from this budget, including the construction of a $12.2 million health centre at Richmond and $3.6 million for the construction of live-in facilities, reflecting an ongoing commitment of the government to the Richmond RAAF base, which is so important to the economy of the Hawkesbury. Fourth, the funding of $189,000 for local landcare projects will assist committed local landcare groups working throughout the electorate on the local environment. Fifth, a number of initiatives will greatly assist the 4,000 small businesses in Macquarie, the chief generators of jobs. These initiatives include: the removal of the capital gains tax on business rollover and the reduction in the uplift factor provisional tax. In addition to other measures such as a reduction in business regulation and workplace relations reform, this will make it easier for small business to survive, to grow and to employ. Sixth, a more reasoned approach to job training will see real hope rather than the cover-up that we have had in the past. The previous government's labour market programs, which have cost taxpayers billions of dollars over the past few years, have achieved very little in creating full-time jobs. This government's increased spending on vocational education and training, up to $889 million for next year, and the introduction of the modem Australian apprenticeship and training scheme will greatly tackle the question of job readiness at its source. Seventh, the government's aged care structural reform package will do much to address some of the significant shortcomings in residential aged care, an area of significant need in Macquarie. In spite of the deceitful and shameful scaremongering by Labor, this provides the opportunity for a much needed injection of capital into nursing homes which will benefit all residents. It tackles a glaring capital crisis which the Gregory report highlighted but the previous government was unwilling to tackle. Our policy also removes the outdated and artificial separation between hostel and nursing home care which often caused heartrending separation between couples when one partner became increasingly frail and had to move from hostel accommodation to a nursing home. It is apparent that the opposition did not really care about this problem. They did nothing to try to solve it. Again, the courage of this government in tackling a difficult issue in an open and equitable way is in enormous contrast to the delusion, procrastination and deceit of the previous government. Other policies such as the expanded respite care strategy and an increase of over six per cent for the home and community care program will also help the aged people in my electorate. The second unique feature and outstanding strength of the government's approach to this budget is the charter of budget honesty. No longer will the real budget position be lost in a maze of creative accounting. There will be no more smoke and mirrors tricks and no more dishonest and deceitful assurances that all is well, only to find that, after years of asset sales, all we have left is a massive hole. A number of changes will make the budget reporting process and fiscal strategy more transparent, more open to public scrutiny and more honest. Stripped of all the cover-ups, the naked truth will be there for all to see-for better or worse. This budget is a watershed: firstly, because of the responsible, courageous and honest way in which it addresses our fundamental economic problems instead of trying to ignore them and, secondly, because of the direction it gives for the future transparency of fiscal policy in this country. Yet what sort of response have we seen from the minor parties? Cheap, political opportunism. And what would you expect? The opposition have targeted billions of dollars worth of our savings over the next four years that they may reject; yet they say they want to correct the deficit over three years. They cannot have it both ways. Where will they find the savings? Perhaps they will tell us where they would find the savings. Perhaps they would like to make some suggestions. Or maybe they will raise taxes instead? Perhaps they would like to tell us which ones they would like to raise. Perhaps the shadow Treasurer has a few suggestions here of where he might like to raise taxes. Or will they just go down the same old path of self-delusion, pretend there is no problem, pretend that deficit and debt do not matter, keep living on the never-never, spending like there is no tomorrow and leave the bankcard bill to our children-mortgage the future of our children so that we can continue to buy votes and continue to live beyond our means. The approach of the last 13 years was shameful, disgraceful and has come to an end. This budget and this government represent an honest and determined turnaround in the approach to fiscal management in this country. Debate interrupted. NA Former Member for Lindsay Member for Watson",125
238,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Before calling the first speaker-and I apologise to the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield)-I have two quite important announcements to make which I did not want to defer until tomorrow. One was addressed by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), who asked me in the House today a number of questions concerning the alleged purchase of a laptop computer by the House of Representatives from Southmark Computer Systems Pty Ltd in August this year. I have had this matter investigated and the answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: one, the Department of the House of Representatives does not have an account with Southmark Computer Systems Pty Ltd. Two, the Department of the House of Representatives has no record of purchasing a Highnote laptop computer and accessories valued at $2,765, or any other laptop computer, on or about 28 August 1996. Three, the Department of the House of Representatives has no record of placing an order on a tax exempt basis in relation to this matter. Four, the Department of the House of Representatives did not purchase a laptop computer for Miss J. Kelly. Five, whether the former member took possession of any computer prior to or after the legal proceedings referred to is not a matter which falls within my area of responsibility. I should also say that officers of the Department of the House of Representatives have checked with the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff who administer the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and they have confirmed that the office has made no such purchase. On the second matter, yesterday the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) asked for my advice as to whether the Chief Opposition Whip was in order in speaking from the dispatch box in his capacity as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business when the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) was in the chamber. His question apparently arose from proceedings in the House on 19 September. As has been indicated in the House previously, following my election as Speaker. I agreed that the Chief Opposition Whip could speak at the dispatch box when speaking in his capacity as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. The question asked yesterday raises a new dimension-that is, whether he should be able to speak from the dispatch box in that capacity when the Manager of Opposition Business is in the chamber. This is not an easy question but I have concluded that it would be inconsistent with the principle that the front benches on the Speaker's left are reserved for members of the opposition executive if the Chief Opposition Whip was allowed to occupy the front bench and speak from the dispatch box when the Manager of Opposition Business is actually present in the chamber. Accordingly, I have today informed the Chief Opposition Whip that, when he is speaking in his capacity as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, when the manager is not present, he can speak from the dispatch box. When the Manager of Opposition Business is present in the chamber and the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business is seconding a procedural motion moved by the manager or speaking at the direction of the manager on procedural matters, he may speak from the dispatch box. When he is speaking on matters which are not related to the duties of Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, the Chief Opposition Whip should speak from his usual place in the chamber. Ethnic Community",129
239,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the more enjoyable aspects of being a member of parliament is attending local community activities of schools, senior citizens, scouts and girl guides. High on the list of these activities that I have attended are various ethnic functions. In the last few weeks alone, my wife and I have attended functions as diverse as Kurdish, Italian and Tongan ones. Australia is built on the shoulders of people from every country. A majority of us have only been here for one or two generations. As members of federal parliament, we possibly see more of the contribution that ethnic Australians are making to the Australian way of life than would most other Australians. We are also more aware of the deep desire of these groups to fit into the Australian community. I am extremely proud to support these desires and I am doing all that I can to see that this really works. There are 3Y2 million Australians and their children who come from non-English speaking backgrounds. They are not going away. We cannot wish diversity away. We should accept our responsibilities. The question is whether we will have a tolerant diverse society or whether we let diversity become a point of division and weakness. I therefore believe we, as parliamentarians, all have a greater responsibility and a duty to assist in assimilating these groups into mainstream Australia. This is particularly important in an electorate such as Greenway where there are over 120 different ethnic groups and where over 25 per cent of the population were born overseas. In the six months that I have been the member for Greenway, I have attended four citizenship ceremonies. This has involved on each occasion something between 200 and 300 people. The number of countries of origin has varied from time to time but generally it has been up to 100 different backgrounds. All of these people have voluntarily determined to become Australian citizens and they have stood very proudly at the ceremonies as they stated their allegiance to Australia. We who were present and who were born in Australia cannot ever begin to understand what each of these wonderful new Australians must have been feeling as they tackled this important step of choosing to become citizens of another land. They are to be commended for their actions and I have regularly done so. One of the peak organisations operating locally that is assisting in the assimilation process is the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. This centre provides a range of services to our ethnic community such as counselling, advising on issues such as housing, employment and health, as well as referring clients to other organisations for assistance, such as AMES. With such a large diverse ethnic population in Greenway, it is important that there is a peak organisation, such as the Migrant Resource Centre, so that the ethnic community speaks as nearly as possible with one voice. One function that the Migrant Resource Centre organised most recently was Camivale. The City of Blacktown Camivale 1996 commenced on Saturday, 7 September and concluded on Sunday, 29 September. Carnivale was conducted on .. state-wide basis, with the Blacktown promotion being the second largest outside of central Sydney. The art and craft exhibition displayed artwork by western Sydney artists and groups. There were Aboriginal, multicultural, contemporary and traditional craftwork demonstrations. It was a fantastic array of cultural displays from around the world and these activities enabled the whole community to participate. I want to particularly thank Ellen Brown, who was the chairperson of the organisation committee, and her very hard working committee for the wonderful job they did in organising Carnivale 1996. On Saturday 14 September I also attended a tree planting and foundation stone laying ceremony at a site in Glendenning in western Sydney. The Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga in Australia intends to build a community centre on this site. Members of the Tongan royal family and several thousand members of the Tongan community attended the function. As is usual with many ethnic groups, the musical part of this function was most outstanding. One can see how we in Australia can benefit greatly from the cultural and musical input of ethnic Australians. I believe the building of community centres, as is envisaged by the Tongan community at Glendenning, also assists ethnic Australians, particularly older people, to assimilate into our country. Poverty",130
240,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I think this may be the first time. I have had the opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to your position. I wish to draw to the attention of House a very important program that we ran in the electorate of MCMillan, a Victorian country electorate. We asked the students of a number of schools to write an essay looking at the theme of the eradication of poverty. I would like to read the essays of the two winners-Andrew White, aged 11, from Grey Street Primary School, Traralgon, and Melanie Spencer from year 9.6 at Pakenham Secondary College. Andrew White writes: Dear Mr Russell Broadbent Less fortunate people can't afford basic necessities like food, clothes, services and shelter. These people are poor because they have no jobs, they might be paying too much tax and the bills are too expensive. Single parents with lots of responsibilities, and of course, gambling, are just some of the main problems which make people poor. To stop poverty we as a Community could start to make more Community Benefit Centres with basic necessities. Also unemployment cheques for the unemployed. We definitely need more training centres and cheaper fees for schools to get a better education. To help people find jobs they need training centres like C.E.S. They are doing their best but they need more funding. Closing C.E.S down wouldn't do much good. The Government needs to try and encourage industries to create jobs. The Government could lower taxes for the less fortunate people. The Government could also make more pension cards. The Government could up the pension and restrict gambling places. Businesses could help as well by putting little tins out and collect and give the money to the poor. But Australia will always have less fortunate people who can't control spending or gambling. But the Government doesn't have enough money to do all of these things and the Government can't keep printing money because what happened in Germany would eventually happen here. Unfortunately, businesses can't keep giving money away because they need money too. Money keeps them going-with out it they would go broke. We would like to get rid of poverty but we know it would be very hard to get rid of it altogether. Yours sincerely Andrew White. Melanie writes: ""How We As A Community Contribute Toward The Eradication Of Poverty In Australia"" It seems poverty has gone beyond the undeniable the stage, and it is now vital that it ought to be recognized and solved. The money invested in the solution for poverty seems to be focused on hiding the problem from the more affluent districts, while the dilemma still waits to be solved. People have nowhere to live or nothing to eat. Children and teenagers live alone on the unmerciful streets. Squatters find ""homes"" in vacant houses or deserted blocks. Drugs have gone beyond the junkie. Young families struggle to pay the bills. But what do we do about it? We offer some money, shelter, food and clothing, but not the necessities these unfortunate persons yearn for most: Humanity, friendship and future direction. We search for reasons for their predicament but what justification can there be for something so unfortunate, except the majority's easing of conscience? Poverty seems to circulate, like a food chain. It begins with a poor family who have lost hope. Children are raised with no family values, and do not strive for achievement. As these children grow older they do not aim to succeed, but turn to stealing, drugs and other violent acts. It is an entire moral breakdown. But where do we start to resolve the issue? A suggestion would be that we should look to the future and focus on the next generation. Instead of trying to correct the adult past use date, why not concentrate on the youth. Young people seem to have no values or will. Why not encourage them to achieve and then honor their acquirements. At my school, and others, children of poverty stricken families exist. These persons cannot afford school fees, uniforms or even stationary. This causes embarrassment that leads to low self-esteem. As children raised in poverty have had a restricted learning environment; rather than assessing them on their attained level of achievement, we ought to focus on their efforts and oversee their well being with full time student welfare teachers. This approach would provide encouragement and direction. The Australian Government supplies child welfare money for parents. In some cases, although, the parents waste this money by feeding their alcoholic desires or pumping it through poker machines. It may be possible to set up a system to be sure the children are benefitting from the money that they receive food, clothing and other necessities directly and objectively. As a country, we need to ensure there is employment available for everyone that wants a job and an effective welfare system for those who can't work or the dependents of those who won't. Poverty's evil does not penetrate just on the ""poor people's"" lives. We all suffer from it one way of another, through increased violence and vandalism. I feel sure that the massive expenditure used in fighting these crimes would be better spent if we started at the foundation of the problem and eliminated poverty. Australian Capital Territory",131
241,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to talk about the political and economic situation facing the ACT. I will just go back in history a little. We have a Chief Minister who came into power a year or so ago. At the time that she came into power in the ACT she made it very clear to the constituency in this territory that she believed the ACT should have a city council type government. Therefore, we could deduce from that that she probably pined to become mayor. We have a Chief Minister, despite her wish to be a mayor, whose party is now pushing for statehood for the ACT. Does the Chief Minister now want to be known as the premier? Does she want to cover every political angle within one term of government? The federal council of the Liberal Party has already received comment on this today. I would like to go a little further on that. I have seen a copy of the agenda, which was released to the media, for the forthcoming council of the Liberal Party meeting to be held in Hobart soon. Given the media attention today to the wish for the Liberal Party in the ACT to tum the ACT into a state, I looked very carefully at the issues that the Liberal Party of the ACT have put on the agenda for the forthcoming council. I have to commend them because they have six very important issues: electoral enrolment, ACT statehood, state and territorial jurisdictions, tax and welfare fraud, voluntary student unionism and the Centenary of Federation-all very riveting subjects when you talk about the health of the economy and the health of the community in this town. What about the things that really matter to the families of the ACT? The local economy, jobs and security for their future. Let me give this House some figures and a bit of a thumbnail sketch of the situation in which my constituents find themselves-a very serious situation despite the smirks opposite. The ABS August unemployment figures show a trend unemployment rate in the ACT of 8.9 per cent, which is above the national average for the first time ever. There are now 15,000 people looking for work in the ACT, up from 11,700 in March 1995. Youth unemployment is now 50 per cent. But the news gets worse. Job vacancies, measured by the ANZ job advertisement series, fell 10 per cent in September. There were only 274 jobs advertised in the ACT in September. Job vacancies have fallen for six of the seven months since this federal government was elected. These figures present a very bleak picture and come before school leavers even hit the job market in December, January and February coming. This federal Liberal government and the ACT Liberal government are responsible absolutely for the situation the ACT finds itself in. My constituents deserve better; they deserve to be treated fairly; and they deserve to be treated seriously. Their household price value is dropping at a rate that the real estate market cannot handle. We now have a federal housing policy which is going to allow the local government to dispose of housing currently owned by government at a rate unprecedented in this country. I am so depressed at hearing business people in the local economy-not Labor supporters-ome to me and say, 'My business turnover has dropped 30 per cent in the last six months. I don't know what to do to stop the downturn.' No wonder my constituency holds in total contempt the promise given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he said that he would govern for all Australians. Rubbish! He has totally and absolutely decided that he will not live here; he will travel to and fro; and he will create a huge bill to the VIP airline which he uses. In the meantime, he will totally disregard the ACT and hold in absolute contempt the people in this town. I can only repeat: when you represent a constituency where youth unemployment is 50 per cent, where unemployment figures are above the national average for the first time since records have been held, when you have 15,000 people looking for work, and where you have 274 jobs advertised in the ACT in September-someone has to wear responsibility, someone has to be made to be held to account. I personally and my constituency totally hold the federal and the ACT Liberal governments to full account. Former Member for Lindsay Telecommunications Towers Commonwealth Dental Health Program",132
242,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"-I am just going to speak very briefly about the matters raised before about the former member for Lindsay. If this turns out to be a grubby political stunt, then the Labor Party can be held very much to account not only by those on this side of the House but also, I can assure you, by the constituents of Lindsay. I want to speak very quickly about a matter of great importance to one of my constituents, Ms Danielle-France Laplace Spence from Daylesford: telecommunications towers. I will just read the letter that she wrote to me and asked that I raise it in the federal parliament: Dear Sir, Please find enclosed, for your information, copy of a letter sent to Mr Noel Harvey, Chairman of Commissioners at the Hepburn Shire Council, following an invitation to attend a meeting to consider sites for a proposed telecommunications tower in Daylesford. My husband and I are opposed to the installation of this mobile phone tower and would like this public issue of exposure to radio-frequency and microwave electromagnetic fields and radiation raised in Federal and State Parliaments. Why the telecommunications industry has the power to install this equipment without giving the community sufficient choice? We are calling for a greater percentage of the huge revenue generated by the telecommunications industry to be dedicated to research into health and safety. We are also calling for a moratorium on new installations until all these issues are adequately dealt with. Ms Danielle-France Laplace Spence and her husband Richard Spence have also written to Mr Noel Harvey, Chairman of Commissioners. As promised to her, I have raised this matter in the Australian parliament and I have expressed their very deep concern about the issue of telecommunications towers, the exposure to radio frequency, microwave electromagnetic fields and radiation. I would also like to talk about the Commonwealth dental health program. I very much supported some of the measures of the program, although it was done very much as a 1993 election push in an endeavour to get the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, re-elected and it was done without any real thought as to its implementation. It ended up resulting in the states withdrawing their funding from public dental health. The program had a four-year funding life span. By December of this year, the program would have reached the former government's target of providing assistance to 1.5 million people over four years and would have spent some $247 million. I was extremely concerned with a letter I received from a local dentist yesterday. He told me that this system has been open to the most extraordinary rorting. This should cause all members in this House very deep concern. My constituent dentist told me that the level of funding which was given for some fairly basic services was very low. It barely providIn ed enough to cover the costs of statutory infection controls that the dental board required in all dental practices. This constituent went on to tell me that he rang one of the local agencies that was dispensing this money on behalf of the state government and the Commonwealth complaining about the cost of extraction, and he was told that he should 'put down a surgical xtraction and add a few other numbers to get the maximum available fee'. There are two types of extractions, the simple extraction worth about $30-odd and a surgical extraction worth about $70. The voucher is for about $100. So my constituent dentist was told that to make it worth his while, he should top it up by putting down an item that was not there. These are extremely serious matters. The system has been rorted. The money should have been spread a lot further. Indeed, there is now a very clear indication that items have been put on these accounts to the Commonwealth government-put on the chit to the Australian taxpayer--either for work that was not done or, as I have also been told, for work that was done but which was not needed. It is a matter of great shame. (Time expired) Lend Lease-ADI Project  to talk about a Lend Lease ADI project in my electorate. Prior to its closure, the St Marys munitions factory was the largest employer in Chifley. It was ironic that its closure was announced the very day the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was to visit my electorate. So, in that regard, it was not a happy day. But I am pleased now to inform the House that recently on the site Lend Lease and ADI presented to the state minister, the Hon. Craig Knowles, their latest plans for the site of about 1,500 hectares. It is really great. Some 630 hectares will be preserved for open space. This is without parallel in any other development of which I am aware. In fact, 65 of those hectares will form wetlands. my electorate at Plumpton we have wetlands of one hectare which have won numerous awards. Imagine what wetlands of 65 hectares will do. In addition, the consortium have plans to link this green space of 630 hectares via a corridor through to the Richmond and Werrington campuses of the University of Western Sydney. They are proposing to set up a trust worth $100 million to manage and develop the conservation plan for this site. Indeed, the founder of Clean Up Australia will be the inaugural chairman and he was also out there on the site. In addition, there will be an Aboriginal cultural centre and an environment park-all exciting, unique parts of the development. The best thing, perhaps, is that the project will be worth $13.2 billion over 15 years. Each year, once the go-ahead is given-and the minister has indicated he will make a decision at the end of the year-there will be some 1,100 jobs during the construction. That is great news in an economy which, disappointingly, is in a downturn. But after it is finished, some 12,000 permanent jobs will be created as a result of this development, half on-site and half off-site. I can think of no development in recent time or even before where so much effort has been put into job creation, because in the western suburbs of Sydney the norm has been that they have been great dormitory suburbs with people leaving homes, leaving their area and finding employment outside. The project will create about 10,000 new homes. I have always been an advocate and a strong supporter of this proposal, and I think it is exciting and good news. Also I have beer. involved with the Lebanese Maronite Franciscan Missionaries, who are hoping to set up a parish and a school there. It was great that Father General of the order, the Most Reverend George Harb, has been out to Australia, and I have been able to meet with the good fathers at Orchard Hills and again at the feast this Monday at Rosehill Racecourse for the Feast of St John the Apostle. I know the go-ahead has not been given for the project and will not be given until the end of the year, but I welcome the opportunity of having the Lebanese Maronite Franciscan Missionaries establish in my electorate as part of this development. I know that they will serve the community very well and be an important focus for Maronites in my electorate and surrounding areas. I certainly hope that their dreams and their vision come to pass and they will be able to settle on the land that they have identified and develop as they sincerely hope to. Nursing Homes",133
243,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take a few moments to add to my comments earlier today on claims by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) that were factually inaccurate and the inference that I was not aware of what was going on in my electorate in relation to nursing homes. I would like to share with this House the very successful visit the minister and I made very recently to the Association for the Blind's George Vowell Centre in Mount Eliza. The centre has given the age care reforms that were announced in the budget a very generous tick. For the purposes of completeness, I would like to conclude my comments from earlier in the day and add the information of which I have subsequently been advised. There are two nursing homes in Mount Eliza, not one. My earlier remarks conveyed the information obtained from the operators that neither facility had residents in them with a child under 16, let alone the many the member for Isaacs claims. During my recent visit to the George Vowell centre I became aware that one particular resident in care has a sensory impairment and multiple disabilities. It has been pointed out to me that that person is also a non-custodial parent of a 13-year-old child. Notwithstanding that point, the visit did reinforce to me that the government's new instrument for classifying people in age care accommodation should take account of sensory impairment and multiple disabilities, given the additional care requirement placed on the operators of centres with such residents. It also highlights to me that, once again, not many residents in nursing homes in my electorate, or certainly Mount Eliza, have children under the age of 16 and also that centres like the George Vowell and the Association for the Blind are doing an excellent job for my community, and I commend their work to the House.

Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Financial Assistance to Employer and Other Organisations (Question No. 305) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Did the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approve or make available grants or other forms of financial assistance in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 NA (c) 1995-96 to (i) employer organisations or (ii) Inc. individual companies; if so, in each case, (A) what was the name and address of the recipient, (B) what sum was involved, (C) what was the purpose of the grant or payment, (D) under what program was it made, (E) who approved the payment, (F) what acquittal requirements applied to the grant or payment and (G) is acquittal outstanding. (2) Has the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approved or made available, or will it make available, grants or other forms of financial assistance in 1996-97 to (a) employer organisations or (b) individual companies; if so, in each case, (i) what is the name and address of the recipient or prospective recipient, (ii) what sum is involved, (iii) what is the purpose of the grant or payment, (iv) under what program is it being made, (v) who approved it and (vi) what acquittal requirements apply. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: To answer this question would involve a large amount of resources. I do not consider such extensive replies are an appropriate diversion of resources otherwise available to developing and providing services to the public. I am not prepared to authorise the use of these resources to provide the information you have requested on this occasion. Better Cities Program (Question No. 463) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: (1) Did the Commonwealth propose the (a) Perth Economic Gateway Study, (b) North-East Corridor Strategy, (c) Kwinana Rejuvenation Strategy and (d) South West Transit Strategy to the Western Australian Government during 1995: if so, in each case, on what date. (2) Did the Western Australian Government enter and into an agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the proposals referred to in part (1) before 27 January 1996; if not, is there still an opportunity for the Western Australian Government to enter into an agreement; if not, why not. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On the 16 February 1996 a meeting was held between the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Brian Howe and the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon Richard Court. It was during this meeting that possible projects were briefly canvassed in light of a potential second phase of the Better Cities Program. The Kwinana public housing redevelopment and South West Transit project were amongst those discussed at that time. As the principles of a new phase of the program were yet to be put to Cabinet within a budget context it was agreed that State and Commonwealth officers should meet to identify a number of proposals likely to be consistent with the themes discussed. Commonwealth and State Officials subsequently met and jointly identified a further North-East Corridor and the Perth Economic Gateway Study. A Steering Committee, chaired by the Western Australian Minister for Planning, the Hon Richard Lewis, and comprising representatives from Commonwealth, State and Local Governments, was formed to consider, prioritise and recommend suitable proposals. The four proposals aforementioned were recommended and further developed in tandem with the development of the wording for a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding. The Western Australian Minister endorsed these four projects for funding in correspondence to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. (2) No. The Western Australian Government did not enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the proposals referred to in part (1) before 27 January 1996. The Government is currently reviewing all of its administration and program expenditures with a view to achieving savings as a lead up to the August Budget. In this respect any funding for the 1996/97 financial year would therefore need to be considered in the context of that Budget and until its presentation to Parliament it is not appropriate to give any undertaking in regard to those monies. Computer Systems Modifications (Question No. 529) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What steps are being taken to ensure that all computer systems in the Minister's Department or any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility are modified so that they continue to operate after 1 January 2000. (2) What is the estimated cost of the modifications. (3) Will all systems be modified by 1 January 2000. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (1) The Department has two computer systems (Personnel Processing and Financial Management) at risk when the next millennium starts. These systems have been scheduled for replacement for some time and it is the Department's intention to replace these once the Office Of Government Information Technology has finalised the current evaluation of suitable systems. This will occur this financial year. The Department has tested all network based software in use in the Department and all of these will work as expected beyond 1 two projects, the January 2000. (2) No additional costs are estimated to be required to modify systems to operate after 1 January 2000. (3) Yes. Portfolio Agencies Australian Customs Service (ACS) (1) The Australian Customs Service is preparing a strategy to deal with the impact of the turn of the century on its computer systems. It is anticipated that the strategy should be in place in early December 1996, following consultation with relevant service providers and other government agencies. (2) The cost of the modifications is unknown at this stage. (3) Yes. Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO) (1) AIPO has three major in-house developed computer systems that have Year 2000 implications. Two of the systems (Patents and Designs) have been analysed and all relevant programs have been identified. Analysis of the third system (Trade Marks) is to begin shortly. A common solution has been developed and tested. Implementation of the solution has begun and will continue, on a staged basis, over the next three years. Other information technology used by AIPO includes desktop/office systems and system software. Formal examination is currently underway. Vendors of all software products are being approached to ascertain their capacity to cope with all appropriate year 2000 changes to meet AIPO's needs and time-frame. (2) The estimated cost over three years is $1,830,000. (3) Yes. Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) (1) Corporate systems are being built using the Oracle database system which accepts a four digit year number and has the facility to handle the year 2000 changeover. Dates that have previously been entered as two digit years will need to be expanded to explicit four digits before 1 January 2000. Any desktop software required for corporate applications at the tum of the century will be verified for date compliance when new versions undergo acceptance testing. Individual staff will be advised to verify other (non-corporate) desktop software required for their use only. (2) Most modifications will be carried out during progressive system at negligible extra cost. The estimated cost to update the database is approximately $900. (3) Yes. Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) (1) ANSTO has a Dosimetry system which makes extensive use of two digit dates and will need a significant re-write. Work has commenced on a review and implementation process to modify the system. New applications under development are taking the year 2000 problem into account in the design process. (2) The cost of the modifications is estimated to be between $100,000 and $200,000. (3) Yes. Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) (1) The Australian Tourist Commission has already looked into this issue and does not foresee any problems. The ATC only purchases ""off the shelf' software and most vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle have already introduced applications that are year 2000 compliant. The ATC is continuously monitoring the situation. (2) The cost of the modifications will be absorbed in the operational costs of the ongoing upgrades carried out each year on the computer systems. (3) Yes. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) (1) Third party application software is currently being reviewed for changes by the vendor. Applications developed by CSIRO have been reviewed and a project has been initiated to fix all date problems. Hardware vendors have been approached and are addressing the problem. New operating system releases that will rectify the problem are currently under test. These should be available by mid 1997. (2) The cost of modifications to application software is estimated to be $200,000. New operating system releases for computer hardware are covered under normal vendor maintenance. Older equipment will be replaced through the normal equipment replacement programs. The cost of the modifications will be absorbed in the ongoing upgrading and replacement of equipment. (3) Yes. Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC) (1) The computer system currently in use by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) uses a method of computing numbers that is capable of handling the year 2000 changeover. EFIC does not anticipate any problems with the proper operation of its computer systems after 1 January 2000. EFIC will audit operations and any new software to preserve the integrity of operations beyond 1 January 2000. Investigations will also be carried out on computer systems external to EFIC which may impact on EFIC's operations. (2) There is no cost of modification as existing systems deal with the issue. (3) No modifications are necessary. National Standards Commission (NSC) (1) The National Standards Commission information technology system was upgraded over the first six months of 1996. A requirement of the tender process was the facility to handle the year 2000 changeover. The decision to replace this system was taken because the existing technology had reached the end of its useful life in respect of both hardware and software with no effective support being provided after 30 June 1996. (2) There was no additional cost in incorporating the modifications for the year 2000. (3) Yes. The modifications have been in effect since 1 July 1996. Trade and Labour Standards (Question No. 555) Mr MCMullan asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Did he state in Singapore in April 1996 that the issue of exploitative child labour was one for the International Labour Organisation (ILO) rather than the World Trade Organisation (2) Does the Government intend to downgrade Australia's participation in the ILO; if so, is the decision compatible with the Government's position on exploitative child labour (3) Does the Government intend also to abandon Australian joint aid programs with the ILO in the Asia-Pacific region; if so, how does this decision contribute to the Government's agenda for dealing with exploitative child labour (4) When will the Government respond to the report of the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards which he released in April 1996 (5) Will the response be presented to Parliament (6) Has the Government formulated responses to recommendations 11, 13 and 14 of the report; if so, in each case, what is the response Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is a follows: (1) At the Singapore World Trade Congress in April 1996, while talking about the role of the World Trade Organisation I noted that there was already an appropriate forum for handling labour standards-namely, the International Labour Organisation. (2) No. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Hon Peter Reith MP, has advised that the Government does not intend to downgrade Australia's participation in the ILO. He clarified the Government's attitude to membership of the ILO in his response to a question without notice in the House of Representatives on 2 May 1996 (page 277 of Hansard), as follows: The government will, of course, retain its membership of the ILO. Australia has been a member of the ILO for many years. We have played a constructive role in the past; we will play a constructive role in the future . . . [however] against that background, the government is grappling with a significant problem in respect of the budget. Therefore, in order to respond to the current priority that the Government attaches to the need to make budgetary savings, the Government decided to send a smaller tripartite Australian delegation to the ILO's international Labour Conferences than has been usual in recent years. Nevertheless, the delegation remains in conformity with the requirements of the ILO Constitution, and Australia played an active role at the Conference in June 1996. The Government's decision not to stand for election to the Governing Body of the ILO in 1996 was partly prompted by the consideration that it was appropriate to allow other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to have their tum, given that Australia had held a seat on the Governing Body almost continuously since 1945 (with the exception of two terms in 1960-63 and 1969-72). In the light of this decision, the position of the Special Labour Adviser from the Australian Mission to the UN, Geneva was withdrawn. In relation to the Government's position on exploitative child labour in the ILO context, the annual International Labour Conference is due to hold discussions on child labour in 1998 and 1999, with a view to adopting new international labour standards on the subject. The Government will take an active role in the discussions. (3) AusAID has provided funding for a number of years for programs which are implemented in the Asia-Pacific region by the ILO. These are the Australian Support for ILO Programs in Asia (ASILO), the first phase (1993-1996) of which ended this year; and the Development of Departments of Labour in Countries of the South Pacific (PACLAB), the current phase of which will be completed in 1997. The Department of Industrial Relations has also supported these programs, by providing staff on a short-term basis. AusAID has decided not to go ahead with a proposal for Phase 2 of ASILO, in the light of current budgetary constraints. None of these the programs (past or proposed) have involved child labour projects. The previous Australian Government made a once-only grant of US$I00,OOO to the ILO's International Program for the Elimination of Child Labour (lPEC) in 1995, and these funds were applied to a child labour project in Nepal. Future aid projects concerning child labour will be considered in the light of the outcomes of the Simons Inquiry into the Australian Aid Program. (4) The report of the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards was released to assist public discussion of the key issues dealt with in the report. The Government is not required to respond to this report. (5) See answer (4). (6) See answer (4). Industry Commission Report: Response (Question No. 557) Mr MCMullan asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) When will the Government table a response to the Industry Commission report into Occupation-' al Health and Safety, entitled 'Work health and safety' handed to the previous Government in September 1995. (2) Will the Government ensure that national template legislation is adopted as recommended and in keeping with ILO Convention 155 on Occupational Health and Safety, to ensure a consistent, equitable approach to protecting the Australian workforce from workplace accidents and disease. (3) Is the Government reducing the resources applied to the response to work related accidents and illness; if so, why. (4) Will the Government ensure that adequate resources are made available to ensure appropriate enforcement staff, prosecution and penalties as recommended in the report. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Government officials recently concluded a round of consultations on the report with the States and Territories and other interested parties. The report will be discussed at the next Labour Ministers' Council meeting and the Government will give consideration to a response following the meeting. (2) The issue of template legislation will be discussed at the Labour Ministers' Council meeting together with other key recommendations of the Industry Commission Report. (3) Worksafe Australia has recently been restruc97 tured to ensure that its primary focus is on the business of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC), that is, developing nationally consistent occupational health and safety standards. The new structure will enable NOHSC to focus its resources in key areas where it can have an impact at the national level on improving occupational health and safety and reducing work related injury and disease. (4) This is primarily a matter for the States and Territories. Within its own jurisdiction the Commonwealth Government does not employ its own investigation staff. It contracts relevant State and Territory resources. The Commonwealth Government will continue to ensure that appropriate resources are made available within its own jurisdiction for enforcement, prosecution and penalties. New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (Question No. 572) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Did he state in response to my question without notice concerning the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NElS) (Hansard, 19 June 1996, page 2257) that the NElS process was on schedule and that there were no reasons for delays in NElS programs. (2) Did the Minister announce on 28 June 1996 that NElS funding was to be reduced by one third. (3) Did he know of the impending funding cut when he responded to my question without notice on 19 June 1996; if so, why did he not refer to it in his answer. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The reduction announced in the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' Press Release of 28 June 1996 was an interim measure to outline funding arrangements for the first three months of 1996-97. This decision was a part of the overall prudent financial management of labour market programs required in the period leading up to the Budget. At that time, the final funding options for NElS for the full 1996-97 financial year were still being considered as part of the Budget process. NElS funding for the full 1996financial year has been reduced by 17 per cent core to $86.456 million to assist around 7,000 participants to open new businesses. Holsworthy: National Estate (Question No. 580) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Since 1993 what recommendations have been made to his Department by the First Brigade at Holsworthy on the environmental/national estate significance of the Holsworthy site. (2) What action has been taken on those recommendations. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In 1993, the Commander 1st Brigade held discussions with representatives from the Liverpool City Council and the Campbelltown City Council on the possibility of nominating Holsworthy for listing on the Register of the National Estate. These discussions were informal and did not result in 1st Brigade making any representations to the Department regarding the nomination of a site at Holsworthy onto the Register of the National Estate. Since 1993, Departmental records reveal no approach by Headquarters 1st Brigade to the Department making recommendations on the environmental/national estate significance of Holsworthy. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (Question No. 582) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Is the Australian Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr R. G. Starr, representing Australia at negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty being conducted in Geneva. (2) Has Mr Starr played a key role in negotiating a workable text for a true zero threshold comprehensive test ban treaty which has been generally agreed to by most delegations to the negotiations; if so, will the Government make it a strong priority to continue that role in this and other future nuclear disarmament negotiations. (3) Did the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in a recent judgment, unanimously agree that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control; if so, (a) does the Government view this obligation as truly binding in view of the IC], s unanimous agreement on this matter and (b) what priority will the Government accord this objective, given on the one hand the emerging international consensus that nuclear weapons be eliminated and on the other hand the notions of nuclear deterrence held by Australia's allies. (4) Is the Government concerned that time appears to be running out for negotiating a viable comprehensive test ban treaty when the current text of the treaty seems to have entry-into-force provisions that require the signatures of 44 named countries, anyone of whom could in effect veto the treaty by refusing to sign it. (5) Has India indicated repeatedly that it will sign the treaty because it does not offer a timebound commitment to get rid of nuclear weapons by the major nuclear powers. (6) Will the Government support a comprehensive test ban treaty with an unviable entry-intoforce provision or will it attempt to negotiate a better entry-into-force provision; if so, (a) does Government favour a particular alternative entryinto-force provision and (b) is it possible to renegowill tiate the entry-into-force provision without opening up other issues. (7) Is the Government making representations to the UK and Russian governments to allow a more flexible entry-into-force provision. (8) How valuable will the treaty be if it proceeds with the current entryinto-force provision and India or other nations refuse to sign. (9) If the circumstances in part (8) prevailed, where does the Government see the issue going from that point. (10) If a comprehensive test ban treaty is signed containing all or much of what Australia advocates, what does the Government view as the next step toward the implementation of the IC], s unanimous call for good faith negotiations toward nuclear disarmament. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr Richard Starr, represented Australia at negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. (2) Yes. Ambassador Starr played a key role in negotiating a true zero threshold comprehensive test ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament. The Australian Government attaches a high priority to ensuring that Australia makes a practical and realistic contribution to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The Government has recently announced a successor to Ambassador Starr as Ambassador for Disarmament, who will be responsible for pursuing Australia's interests in the negotiation of arms control and disarmament agreements in the Conference on Disarmahlent, as well as other international fora. (3) In a recent advisory opinion, the ICJ unanimously agreed that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. (a) The Court was requested to give an advisory opinion, not a judgement. Advisory opinions delivered by the ICJ are not binding under international law. The Court itself has been explicit in not stating that advisory opinions are just thatadvisory-and have no binding force. However, advisory opinions are generally regarded as important judicial pronouncements on principles of international law. (b) The Government remains fully committed to the twin goals of preventing proliferation of nuclear the weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament, and continue to focus on practical, realistic steps to achieve this. The recent adoption and opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, in which Australia played a major role, is an important step in the nuclear disarmament process. (4) Australia was very concerned that time was running out for the international community to have a CTBT open for signature by September 1996, as had been called for unanimously by the UN General Assembly last year. That is why, when all avenues for consensus agreement on a CTBT text had been exhausted in the Conference on Disarmament, Australia acted promptly and initiated action which allowed the draft CTBT to be considered for adoption and opening for signature by the international community at the UN General Assembly. (5) Yes. (6) and (7) Australia's preferred position was that the CTBT enter into force simply after a certain number of countries had ratified the treaty. During the course of the negotiations we sought to promote that position with a range of countries, including the UK and Russia. Australia explored all possible avenues to secure a more flexible entry into force provision, but concluded that this was not possible. We recognise the importance, nonetheless, of as many countries as possible, especially the five nuclear weapon states, and the threshold states, signing and ratifying the treaty as soon as possible. (8) India's current position that it will not sign the treaty means that the CTBT may not come into force for some time. The CTBT will nevertheless have an indispensable normative value even before entry into force. Signature of the treaty will constitute a political and moral commitment to renounce nuclear testing. There is also a principle of international law that a state which has signed a treaty is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty even before its entry into force. Each of the five nuclear weapon states-the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China-signed the CTBT upon its opening for signature at the United Nations in New York on 24 September. By bringing nuclear testing to an end, the CTBT is a vital step in the nuclear disarmament process. (9) Australia is urging nations to sign and ratify the CTBT as soon as possible. If the CTBT has not entered into force within three years of its opening for signature, there will be a Conference of States Parties to consider and decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the treaty. This process will be repeated at subsequent anniversaries of the opening for signature of the treaty, until its entry into force. (10) The Government is committed to the twin goals of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament. Among the most immediate tasks will be to work for the early commencement of substantive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (known as a ""cut-off' convention). This is widely acknowledged as the next logical multilateral step after a CTBT and would be a major new addition to the process of nuclear disarmament and to strengthening barriers to nuclear proliferation. The nuclear weapon states will continue to bear the major responsibility for steps to reduce further their nuclear stockpiles, with a view to their ultimate elimination. Australia will continue to encourage the nuclear weapon states to maintain the good progress achieved over the past several years in bringing about significant reductions to their nuclear stockpiles/arsenals. The recently released report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, presented to the United Nations General Assembly on 30 September 1996 and which the Government will present to the Conference on Disarmament in January 1997, should make a significant contribution to new intemational thinking on nuclear disarmament. Hinchinbrook Island National Park (Question No. 585) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: (1) Has the (a) Minister's department, (b) Australian Nature Conservation Agency, (c) Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, or (d) Australian Heritage Commission advised the Minister that the Beach and Foreshores Management Plan and the dredging and development of a marina access channel for the Port Hinchinbrook resort is consistent with the protection, conservation and preservation of the World Heritage values of the proclaimed area and is in keeping with the Minister's responsibilities under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. (2) Did the Minister's Department, in earlier advice to the former Minister, state that (a) baseline information on the extent of seagrasses in the area proposed for dredging was required before a monitoring program could be put in place, and that the effects on sediment flows from sea wall impacts were not known and could not be determined without further hydrodynamic work, (b) the management plan for Hinchinbrook Island National Park was not yet finalised and until it was, the Department could not be satisfied that it would be an appropriate vehicle to control some of the concerns expressed by a Dr Valentine. (3) Has the Minister's Department now revised its advice referred to in part (2); if so, (a) what was the impetus for the revision and (b) on what scientific evidence was it based. (4) Will the Minister release the scientific evidence on which he has allowed the resort proposal to proceed; if not, why not. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) The key advices from my Department, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission were tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. I refer the honourable member to that advice. (2) and (3) I am not privy to all the advice to the former Minister. The key advices to me were tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. (4) The scientific evidence was tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. Port Hinchinbrook Development (Question No. 586) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Has the Minister received advice from any agencies within the Minister's department recommending that (a) the development of an integrated management plan to address the broader development issues facing the Hinchinbrook area should occur concurrently with the resort's construction, and (b) a sequential process where baseline studies, setting of standards and the monitoring program for the World Heritage area should occur before the Port Hinchinbrook development proposal is approved; if so, which departmental agencies have provided this advice. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b) The key advices provided by my portfolio have been tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. I refer the honourable member to that advice. Port Hinchinbrook Development Project (Question No. 587) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Has the (a) Minister's department, (b) Australian Nature Conservation Agency, (c) Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, or (d) Australian Heritage Commission advised the Minister that the Port Hinchinbrook development at Oyster Point would have a long term impact on the World Heritage values of the area. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The key advices to me, including advice from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Heritage Commission and my Department were tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government was also tabled. The regional planning process envisaged in this MOU will address potential regional impacts associated with all developments in the Hinchinbrook region. Port Hinchinbrook: World Heritage Areas Proposal (Question No. 588) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Does the Minister have responsibility for the protection of World Heritage areas; if so, why did the Deputy Prime Minister, rather than the Minister, make the announcement that the Port Hinchinbrook resort would proceed. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I administer the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. Accordingly, it was my responsibility to decide whether to consent to the activities associated with the Port Hinchinbrook resort. I made these decisions, having regard only to the relevant factors. Port Hinchinbrook Development Proposal (Question No. 589) Dr Lawrence asked the - Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Has the nature of the Port Hinchinbrook resort development changed in any way from the developer's original consent application for (a) construction of breakwaters, (b) dredging of the outer channel and (c) implementation of a beach and foreshore management plan; if so, in what ways. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I was only required to consider applications for consent in relation to dredging of a marina access channel and the implementation of a beach and foreshore management plan (not the resort as a whole). Details of these activities are given in the applicant's application for consent, subsequent variations to that application, my consent instrument and the Deed of Variation in relation to the development. These documents were tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. (a) The developers' final consent application did not include the construction of breakwaters. (b) Dredging of the outer channel included design variations to the dredged channel profile to compensate for the removal of the breakwaters. (c) The beach and foreshore management plan has changed to include, inter alia, the replanting of mangroves by both the Commonwealth and the proponent and to provide for natural regrowth to be left undisturbed for a period of four years. Port Hinchinbrook Development (Question No. 590) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Has the Minister received scientific or departmental advice that the Port Hinchinbrook beach and foreshore management plan's effect on the seagrass should assess the regional rather than the local impact and that many of the activities associated with the Oyster Point development have the potential to increase significantly local turbidity could pose a localised risk to seagrasses. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I received a number of submissions from scientists and from Departmental agencies which commented on the issues of seagrass and on potential regional and local impacts associated with the proposed development. I refer the honourable member to the advice from the Environment Portfolio to me tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996. Port Hinchinbrook: World Heritage (Question No. 591) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: What aspects of the proposed Port Hinchinbrook development require further baseline scientific data to be gathered before the full impact of the development on World Heritage values can be ascertained. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I consider that I had available sufficient information on which to consider any potential impact on world heritage values. Relevant advice was tabled in the Senate on 11 September 1996.

Belford Bends Project (Question No. 597) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 August 1996: Proposal When will he approve funding of the Belford Bends, NSW, deviation project. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I announced initial allocations for the Federal road program on 20 August. Funding for the construction of the proposed Belford Bends deviation on the New England Highway, was not included in those allocations. I am still considering various options for the and disposition of available unallocated funds. Consequently, I am unable at this stage to provide a date for a commitment to funding construction of this project. However, you may be assured that it is being considered in the context of wider National Highway priorities and the level of funds made available in the Federal Budget.

Kodak Australia (Question No. 630) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: Has his attention been drawn to (a) a recent announcement by Kodak Australia of a major new investment which will lift exports to $lb a year and (b) the statement by the Premier of Victoria that Labor's 1989 decision to back Kodak was a very good investment; if so, does he still maintain his 1989 belief that the decision represented the pinnacle of failure and bankruptcy of the then Government's industry policy (Hansard, 23 November 1989, page 2847).",146
253,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourreforms able member's question is as follows: While I join with the Premier of Victoria in welcoming the foreshadowed expansion of Kodak Australia's local production and exports, I do not resile from the position set out in my speech of 23 November 1989. The substance of my objection to the bounty paid to Kodak was that it was an ad hoc bail-out that set and undesirable precedents-a bandaid solution to a set of problems that required comprehensive solutions. It is a mark of the failure of the then Hawke Government and its Labor successors that the key problem I described then is still at the forefront of the problems my Government has been left to equalled address today. To quote from my speech: ""It is common ground that the greatest single economic problem which this country faces .... is the problem of our enormous overseas debt, which is a product of a huge and trade deficit, in tum fuelled by an excess of consumption over production..... We can only solve our debt problem, our trade problem, by improving our performance on two vital fronts. One of those fronts is the productivity front and the other is the savings front."" I went on to identify four headlands of sensible industry policy. They were: Australia should set its face unalterably against any return to its protectionist past; National savings should be increased; Australia should embrace, full-bloodedly and at an accelerated pace, a policy of microand economic reform, including reforming the industrial relations system and pursuing privatisation; and Industry policy should concentrate on those manufacturing industries in which Australia grants. enjoys a natural advantage. While I might change the emphasis somewhat I were making that speech today-in particular, I would indicate that a competitive advantage can arise not only from natural resources, accumulated capital and expertise, including in technology, management and workforce proficienment, cy-the fundamental points remain intact. It is a mark of the accuracy of my comments almost seven years ago that successive Labor Governments began to adopt the solutions I had proposed-but did too little too late. It has been left to my Government to finish today what should have been done in 1989-to get the business 1995 environment right, rather than try to assist ""right"" business. At the ceiling per year, the bounty assistance provided to Kodak Institution New South Wales Australian Catholic University Charles Sturt University Macquarie University Southern Cross University University of New England University of New South Wales University of Newcastle 2.5 per cent of Kodak Australia's expected 1989 sales. It is a matter for speCUlation how much better off Kodak might have been if, instead of receiving a bounty, it had been able to benefit from a set of comprehensive industry reforms along the unsustainable lines I outlined in 1989. Universities: Income (Question No. 635) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) Further to the answers to questions Nos. 1629 (Hansard, 10 November 1994, page 3160) and 1729 (Hansard, 8 December 1994, page 4618), what was the value of (a) endowments and private donations, (b) investment income, (c) current assets (d) non-current investment assets for each Australian university in (i) 1994 and (ii) 1995.

Council of Australian Governments (Question No. 654) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: To what extent and on what occasions has the Council of Australian Governments given consideration to co-ordinating the duties of Australia's diplomats and consuls and State's agents-general or like officials.",162
255,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The communiques which form the official record of meetings of the Council of Australian Governments and earlier Special Premiers' Conferences make no mention of consideration being given to co-ordinating the duties of Australia's diplomats and consuls and States' agents-general or like officials. Commonwealth Employment Service Offices (Question No. 663) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, authority, to meet on 11 September 1996: What is the Government's intentions with regard to the Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As announced in the Budget, there is to be a major reorganisation of labour market assistance arrangements. Under the new arrangements there will be: a new independent service delivery agency that will provide a single point of delivery for Commonwealth services (including income support, student assistance and employment assistance) to a wide range of clients and beneficiaries; a competitive employment placement market which will include private and community based employment placement enterprises, as well as a corporatised public enterprise; and a new way of delivering labour market assistance to jobseekers through these employment placement enterprises including intensive emp!oyment assistance and labour exchange services. The establishment of the new arrangements will provide opportunities to improve customer responsiveness and service quality, eliminate the inefficiencies and duplication resulting from the current separate Commonwealth Employment Services (CES) and Department of Social Security (DSS) delivery networks and will ensure that labour market assistance has a clear focus on real job outcomes. Full implementation of the proposed reforms is expected to be completed by November 1997. Existing servicing arrangements, including CES offices at Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook, will continue until November 1997. From December 1997 the DSS network of offices will form the basis of the service delivery agency network and the CES network of offices will form the basis of the public employment placement enterprise network.
