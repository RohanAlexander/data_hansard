None of the German prisoners from the Emden has come to Australia. The administrative officials from German New Guinea, who are not prisoners of war, receive sufficient money to meet the living expenses of themselves and their wives and families pending their departure from Australia. About 150 prisoners in all have arrived in Sydney from New Britain. Some of these are ordinary prisoners of war, and are in the concentration camp at Liverpool. The others are liigher civil officials, who were included in the terms of capitulation. Under the terms of capitulation, it was agreed that the higher officials were to receive three months' salary, and the paymaster has been making a percentage allowance of this three months' salary, which is being paid to the officials weekly. Dr Haber, the ex-Governor, fives in a boarding-house at Potts Point. One prisoner (Dr Steubel) stopped one night at the Australia Hotel. Six ladies (wives of officials) also stayed there one night.

Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr JENSEN) read a first time. CUSTOMS BLLL . Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. COMMONWEALTH BANKBILL . Debate resumed from 13th November (vide page 681), on motion by Mr . FISHERThat this Bill be now read a second time.",12
78,Mr FLEMING,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Eobertson) [3.45] The Commonwealth Bank Has not yet achieved the success' which its founders hoped for it , and this Bill , I take it , is designed to remedy that state of affairs. It seems to me, however, that the Bill proceeds in an entirely wrong direction, and that, if it becomes law, instead of helping the Bank and improving the financial affairs of Australia, it will tend only to damage them. I propose to put before the House my reasons for this view. During this debate, many comparisons have been made between the Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of England. In my opinion, there is no analogy between the two. They are built on entirely different lines. When the Bank of England was established, in 1694, it was given an absolute monopoly, and that monopoly was maintained for more than a century and a half. Our Bank, on the other hand, was established in competition with all the Associated Banks, and it is not, in the ordinary sense of the term, a true State Bank. It is my desire this afternoon to point out how, in my opinion, CONTRACT. the Commonwealth Bank may be developed in such a way as to make ib strong and virile and of real assistance to the Commonwealth. At the present time. I regard it as being merely an in strument of torture to the commercial community, whereas it ' could be made a tower of strength to not only the financial institutions and the business world of Australia, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. When the Bank of England was founded it was restricted absolutely in its note issue to the amount of its capital. This bank is in a different position. The Bank of England was not brought into close touch with the Government u n t i l about 1781-3. It was not u n t i l a good many years later that it became an in strument of the Government, and it is only since 1903 that it has been the centre of all the financial transactions of the Home Government. It will be seen, therefore, that the two institutions are on a wholly different footing. The Bank of England, founded carefully, as it was, and with an Act that was meant to buttress it up in every way, has more than once been landed in difficulties because of State SECOND BEADING . interference. In 1797 it suspended payment, and in 1847, 1857, and again in 1866 it was saved only by the Government suspending the limitation of the Bank Act passed in 1844. Thus the Bank of England has not been that buttress to the affairs of the Old Country that we are generally led to believe it has been. As recently as 1890 the Bank of France had to come to its rescue with 75,000,000 francs in gold. Again, in 1907, in respouse to a mere telegram, the Bank of France came once more to the help of the Bank of England with 80,000,000 francs in gold. There seems to be a strong in clination on the part of honourable members that this Bank-the Commonwealth Bank-shoul d develop along the very lines which the experience of the Bank of England has shown to be dangerous. It seems to me that we should endeavor to extend it along the lines followed by the Bank of France. It must be remembered that, wlien a crisis arises, we shall have no Bank of France, as the Bank of England has had, to f all back upon. The only way in which we can make the Commonwealth Bank a safe asset and a real support to the financial transactions of the Commonwealth is to follow the lines on which the Bank of France is moulded. To do that we must have a solid gold reserve. One of the most interesting problems of the financial world today is how the Bank of France retains its tremendous gold reserve, and at the same time maintains such a low rate of discount. That is a subject into which the Commonwealth Government would be well advised to make full inquiry. If we could find out the secret whereby the Bank of France can give such low rates of discounts, and at the same time maintain such a solid gold reserve as it does, we should have discovered the innermost secret of banking. The secret is. one that we need to discover in order that we may take this institution of ours away from lines that seem to me to be a menace to the stability of the States. If fostered in ignorance, it may become a menace to the financial integrity of the Commonwealth itself. W it h your permission, Mr Speaker, I propose to read one or two statements by good authorities regarding the Bank of France. That in stitution was established in 1800, on lines somewhat like those of the Commonwealth Bank. Although given monopoly by the revolutionary Government then in power, the Bank of France was also made a Savings Bank, paying at first 5 per cent, on the savings deposited with it , and afterwards 4 per cent. In 1805 its notes had depreciated from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent., and, in 1808, it abolished its Savings Bank department, and went straight ahead from that time. To my mind, that fact teaches us the first lesson to be learned in connection with the control of the Commonwealth Bank. Let me now read some excerpts from findings of the National Monetary Commission of the United States of America when dealing with the Bank of France:The Bank of France continued its role as a bank of issue in a prudent enough manner; it fortunately continued to be much more a bankers' bank than a State bank, although it had frequentrelations with the State, and rendered it real service But in this function, which it ought not to fulfil, which it does not fulfil, of entering as a silent partner into industries or of favouring their creation, other institutions are going to take its place. The Commonwealth Bank has entered into business of the kind which the Bank of France set itself sedulously to avoid. In another volume dealing with the Bank of France it is statedThus the banks of deposit have contributed to progress by gathering and giving life to sums until then lying scattered and idle. Tliey are valuable auxiliaries in the distribution of credit. For this reason they deserve help and protection. The bank, the mission of which is of wider and loftier scope, has shown on many occasions that its helpfulness is not a pretence; daily, in fact, it asserts them by rediscounting their bills. VVe have also seen that the prosperity of the financial institutions has continually increased. It is associated with the confidences and growing security of our times. But should a war or other calamity occur, quiet and security would disappear, and deposits would correspondingly decrease. At such a time tliese banks might give way. Or, again, should a lively competition develop, should the direction of opinion of affairs be changed, that alone might suffice, to cause fear of dejection among the auxiliaries of credit. Such a possibility is enough to impose upon the Bank of France the duty of foreseeing and providing for it. The bank must be ready to meet even improbable contingencies, in order to be in a position to recapture the market with a sure hand as soon, as danger threatens it. , v As in 1907, the Bank of France saved the financial situation of Great Britain , it seems evident that we, at a distance a from the Old Country, with nothing but our own resources and strength to rely on, should follow conservative lines in banking. Probably our most republican and democratic friends opposite do not object to conservatism in banking. A bank is a factory of credit. It is also a distributer of credit The Commonwealth Bank should be, uofc a hawker carrying its goods about, but a merchant of credit, to whom the big financial institutions and ventures of the country could go for support, that they could "" get the goods "" at any time. The Bill seems likely to prevent this. It makes provision for the taking over of certain Savings Banks by the Commonwealth Bank. To my mind, the business of the Commonwealth that of a Savings Bank compatible. Savings Banks small accounts, and in that are very useful, but a Savings Bank can only do' work which the State Savings Banks already in existence are doing well. wealth Bank, supported with the credit of the Commonwealth, and a proper gold reserve, should stand behind the financial institutions of the country, so that, in time of war, there may be a solid credit on which to work. Credit is the bridge over which business travels, and if allowed to become too slender break dowu and bring We can make our credit solid, and the Commonwealth Bank real value in a time of trouble and crisis only if it is so managed that it will have the support and confidence of the financial institutions and of the its operations being backed up by a solid gold reserve. I object to the position occupied by the Governor of the Bank. In no other part of the world does the Governor of a bank occupy such a position. The present Governor be oue of the best bankers in the world, but his position is too autocratic for a democratic community. The privileges and monopolies given to the Bank of France were given by a revolutionary ment. The world over, it is from the ultra-democratic movements get the most autocratic results. vernment has made the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank the most individual in the world. should limit the powers of the Governor in one direction, we should extend in another. The Bank would be much improved if a Board were created, of which the Commonwealth and the State Treasurers cr officio members, an equal ber of other members financial authorities selected State. To that Board I would give extensive powers. The Mr Fleming. Bank sliould have the sole control of the note issue, and, in Committee, I intend to move the insertion of a new clause proknowing viding for that. W it h the control of the note issue, the bank authorities would be aware of the exact financial position, and would know what note issue the gold reserve would maintain.",12
79,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Shoul d not the GovernBank and ment have control? are in- Mr FLEMING - In my opinion, it deal with would be better to leave the matter to a resptrct Board constituted as I have suggested. Commonwealth The proposal to buy out an existing banking corporation needs careful scrutiny. We do not know whether the Government The Common- has some particular corporation in mind. The Bank of England managed for nearly two centuries with a capital of Â£1,200,000, aud we are rather rushing things in increasing the credit of our bank to Â£10,000,000 when it has been in existence only about three years. It is almost certain that any private corporation would must object to having its affairs threshed out destruction. in Parliament before concluding any bargain with the Commonwealth. But I prowill be of test against the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, or any one else, entering into a big contract of this kind before the representatives of the people 'have an opcommunity, portunity of deciding whether it would be acceptable. Before any bargain is autocratic made, its terms should be threshed out by Parliament. There is good precedent for such a course. Only recently two of the great financial institutions in Ausmay tralia amalgamated, after an open public inquiry into their affairs. If it is proposed by the Government to buy up some particular organization, and that organization has nothing to fear, and is prepared Govern- to give the people a good bargain, why should not the terms of any proposed that you arrangement be laid before Parliament? This Go- We shall take a most dangerous course if we allow anything to be done behind our autocratic backs. I believe in the Commonwealth But while we Bank, which, I think, can be made a most worthy institution. Had the ideas of them the honourable member for Darwin been followed almost in their entirety the Commonwealth Bank would already have beTreasurer come an institution of great importance would be and value to the Commonwealth, whereas num- there is still a certain amount of prebeing leading judice against it . The proper way for in each the Bank to develop is for it to relinquish all savings bank business, not to seek Commonwealth after ordinary banking business, but to transact all Government business. The Commonwealth Bank should behind the private financial institutions of the country, and thus extend credit' throughout the community. Surely this Government has no f a u l t to find with the private banks. When the Commonwealth Bank was started, the last Labour Government took a forced loan from the private banks amounting to Â£6,500,000, by compelling them to accept Commonwealth notes. Tliose who supported what was done then are perhaps unaware that the method was first adopted by Charles I . , the tyrant of England, and at the present time it is being slightly extended by the Germans in the raising of what is termed their war loan. Furthermore, according to reports, the private banks have lent the Government Â£10,000,000, for a } >ar, free of interest. It would be well tc know whether this generosity, which is so remarkable in view of the treatment that the banks have received from the Government, was due to their own initiative or the result of some alight pressure. At any rate, the Labour party has little cause to jeer at the private banks. The only way in which the Commonwealth Bank can be made a real bulwark to the community, a real refuge in time of trouble, is to take from it pettifogging business, and the rivalry of the Savings Banks of the States. The Commonwealth Bank should be the bankers' bank, and the Government Bank in the true sense of the term, doing the big business of the Commonwealth and of the States. It would then make for a better spirit and influence with the financial institutions, which, after all, are the basis of true credit, and would cease to be a menace to the stability and the solvency of the States; and, with a solid gold reserve for building up the credit of the financial community, it would do much to sustain and invigorate the fabric of our whole commerce. This Bank, if it were developed on the broad lines which have made the Bank of France such a wonderf u l success, would be of enormous value; but, if it is reduced to small pettifogging business, it will become an absolute menace to the solvency and stability of the States, and a direct danger to the financial integrity of the Commonwealth.  pected to see all kinds of alterations made in the Commonwealth Bank Act, such as I think the country has been looking stand forward to for some time. For instance, I think there should have been an alteration in the management, in consonance with the wishes of the majority of the people, and also, I believe, in consonance with the will and wish of the members of the Government, if we could really learn the state of their mind on the subject. The Commonwealth Bank is unique, ' in the fact that, of all the financial institutions in the world, it is the only one of its magnitude controlled and managed by one individual.",14
80,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Is the Governor of the Bank not doing very well?  would do a great deal better if outside experience were introduced to assist him. A fte r all, a banker is only a banker; he understands the technicalities of banking, but he has not rubbed shoulders outside, and does not understand the roughand-tumble of business l if e ; and the more assistance he can get from the outside the better for the success of the institution. At all events, the fact remains that this is the only institution of such gigantic proportions that is practically controlled by one person; and I certainly thought we should have some amendment to remove this anomaly. I have looked rather closely into the question, and I find that there is a great similarity between the Bank of England at its foundation and the Commonwealth Bank when it was instituted. In the first place, the population of Great Britain , when the Bank of England was inaugurated by the Scotchman, Patterson, was rather more than 5,000,000, or just about the population of Australia when the Commonwealth Bank Act was passed. The Bank of England, for one reason, was established in the year 1694, in order to replenish a depleted war chest. England at that time had the responsibility of fighting three or four combined nations, and the Bank was used as a means of finding the necessary funds. It will be observed that both banks were instituted by Scotchmen, the only difference being that Andrew Fisher thinks the whole control should be in the hands of one man, whereas Patterson, who laid down the scheme afterwards adopted by the British Minister, Mr Montague, arranged for the representation of the debentureholders on a directorate. Debentures - were issued to the extent of Â£1,200,000, and, in consideration of this, the Bank was permitted to issue notes to a - like amount, and the money thus obtained was used for the resuscitation of our Navy. According to the charter of the Bank, the debenture-holders were permitted to elect their own directors and their general manager; and the result was that they appointed twenty-four directors. My contention is that if the Commonwealth Bank is to be made a success, it is only right and fair that the holders of the Â£10,000,000 worth of debentures, together with the depositors and the States, who are also interested, should be represented on a directorate. My suggestion is that the Bank Act should be amended so as to permit of these reforms being carried out, the debenture-holders electing, say, three directors, the depositors three directors, and each of the States one, making twelve altogether. Mr Denison Miller, the Governor, might make the thirteenth director. As I said before, the general manager of a bank has a mere academic knowledge of business beyond that of banking; and it would be of great advantage if the benefit of outside business experience could be obtained. For instance, there are nine or ten directors to advise Mr French, the general manager of the Bank of New South ""Wales, and those directors are all business men - in New South Wales the limit is",15
81,Mr FENTON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"All the same, the general manager ""runs the show.""  of New South Wales is a most successful .institution, due to the fact that the management has the benefit of the matured business experience and advice of outside men. I may mention that some six years ago a public trustee was appointed by the Imperial Government to control and invest moneys of intestate estates. That official broke down with the responsibility that was thus forced upon him; and he, of his own volition, applied for the assistance of five directors. It will be seen at once that the responsibility of such an official is quite small and inconsiderable when compared with that cast on the general manager of the Commonwealth Bank, and it is much more necessary in the case of the Bank that outside assistance and advice should' be made available. The Commonwealth Bank is at present only in its infancy. Ifc controls something like Â£9,000,000, and. this represents too much responsibility to be placed on one individual. A clause in the Bill authorizes the Governor of theBank and the Treasurer to purchase any other bank when they think fit. I find,, according to the figures given in thefinancial news of the Sydney Morning Herald, that the Bank of Australasia, the Commercial Bank of Sydney, the Bank of New South Wales, the Queensland National Bank, the Union Bank, the West Australian Bank, and the Australian! Bank of Commerce represent a total capital of Â£16,945,000, which, multiplied by 2-J per cent., shows a present value of Â£36,714,166. This amount, divided amongst the eight banks I have mentioned, gives an average value of Â£4,600,000; and I contend that it is not wise to permit the expenditure of such an amount to be at the discretion of any one or two men. With all due deference, I say that the Prime Minister's experience in financial matters is very limited; he cannot claim to be a financier in the sense in which we should like him to be one; and yet it is proposed to allow him and the Governor of the Bank to have discretionary power to expend Â£4,600,000 in the purchase of any bank. Under the recent Public Works Act there can be no expenditure above Â£25,000 without an inquiry Â£20,000-and yet it is proposed to permit this discretion to the extent of Â£4,600,000 on the part of two men. All expenditure of the kind should be sanctioned by this Parliament. There is another serious objection that I have to the Bill. I had been hoping that some amendment of the Act would have been introduced in order to carry out the proposals agreed to at the last Conference of Premiers.",16
82,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The Premiers were satisfied with the Bill as it is.  satisfied.,16
83,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I shall show that he was.  the honourable member would read the reports, as I have done, he would find that one of the greatest objectors to the Savings Bank clauses in the Commonwealth Banking Act was Mr Holman. A ll the State Treasurers, including Mr. Scaddan, the Labour Premier of Western Australia, voiced the same objection, and I cannot see how members of another place, who are supposed to represent State rights, can support this Bill, instead of protesting in conformity with public opinion in the various States, and insisting that a clause shall be inserted enacting that all Savings Bank business shall be left to the States. At considerable trouble, I have obtained some interesting statistics in regard to what the New South Wales Savings Bank has been doing. I find that that institution has 717,737 depositors, and total deposits amounting to Â£33,167,523, representing Â£46 4s. 2d. per depositor, or Â£17 17s. l d . per head of population. One of the most useful features of the bank's operations in New South Wales is the enormous amount advanced by way of loan to the primary producers. I find that in sums not exceeding Â£2,000, repayment of which extends over a period of thirty-one years, the bank has advanced to farmers the colossal amount of Â£3,070,754, and in sums of more than Â£2,000, Â£1,766,631. An interesting portion of the bank's work is that which comes under the heading of the Closer Settlement Promotion Act. TJnder the Statute, any two or three or more settlers may approach the owner of a large estate and ask him to put a price on his land. The price having been fixed by the owner, perhaps ten or fifteen would be settlers ask the Government to advance sufficient money to enable them to purchase the estate. Valuations are made, the estate is purchased, and those settlers are allowed to take up the land in areas not exceeding in value Â£2,000. The bank advances the requisite money to the settlers to the extent of 95 per cent, of the capital value.  good business?  to the bursting up of big estates. An estate of 100,000 acres, owned by one man, ance may employ perhaps two or three shepherds and a couple of boundary riders, but under this Closer Settlement Promotion Act two or three hundred human beings are settled on the land.  the bank has never been "" let in "" ?  tmnk been administered that during the five years this Closer Settlement Promotion Act has been in operation, only the small sum of Â£247 has been lost by the bank.  there any more land available on those terms?  bered that if a farmer takes up 700 or 800 acres, he puts into the land the whole of his energy, with the result that in two or three years he has probably increased the value of the property hy 25 or 30 per cent.  the bank advanced under that Act?  I obtained those figures from Mr Warden, the Commissioner of the Savings Bank, only last Tuesday, so they are right up to date. Then, in the Irrigation Department the btink has advanced Â£5,875, and in the Homes Department, for the building of workmen's homes and suburban residences, Â£44,330. Altogether the New South Wales Savings Bank has advanced on loan, under those various headings, Â£6,482,048. Of the total advances 20 per cent., or about Â£6,500,000, has been lent in country districts to encourage the primary producers. No country can prosper unless its primary producers are thriving, and the reason why Melbourne, Sydney, and the other capital cities are stagnant today is that the primary producers are stricken with drought. Therefore, I say that any Government which introduces a Banking Act by which the beneficial operations of the State Savings Banks will be destroyed, is not worthy of the name of a Government. Por that reason I protest against the introduction of this Bill, without the inclusion of the amendments I am suggesting. These are the various is headings under which advances are made by the Savings Bank of New South (a) Upon mortgage of an estate of inheritin fee-simple in any land in the State. (6) Upon mortgage, of(i) conditional purchases - with or without associated conditional leases; (ii) homestead grants; (iii) homestead selections; (iv) settlement leases; (v) settlement purchases; (vi) conditional purchase leases; (vii) additional conditional purchase leases; (viii)",16

Can the honorbanking. able member point to a single instance a farmer having received an advance from this Bank ? I have travelled far throughout the country, and I have not met one farmer who has benefited from that source.",18

That clap-trap emanated from the Worker office.

93,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"But compare another in its first two years of existence with the Commonwealth Bank.  I can point to the fact that the Commonwealth Bank can only find room for Â£1,392,000 by way of investment, though it has Â£9,000,000 of the people's money. Such a state of affairs is a travesty on It is not banking. The Comof monwealth Bank in this regard is an hallucination; it is a sham-worse , a and shadow of a sham. We are told by the* Treasurer that one amendment which he is submitting in the Bill will prove the great usefulness of the Commonwealth Bank. Transactions between the Motherland and Australia will be accomplished free of exchange. The right honourable gentleman told us that our soldiers who are going to the front will be able to pay money into the Commonwealth Bank, and - have it transferred free of exchange from the Mother Country. agree with the Prime Minister that every latitude should be extended by the Commonwealth Bank to those soldiers who are going to the front to battle for us while we remain ab home, but to lead honourable members to believe that this proposal is an innovation especially introduced by the Commonwealth Bank is wrong. The idea has been in existence for many years. If a person pays money into a Post-office Savings Bank in London he can have it transferred to any branch of a State Savings Bank in Australia free of exchange. This reciprocal arrangement has been in existence for years. The Savings Bank Commissioners in New South Wales, referring to this matter in their report, sayThe reciprocity arrangements with the PostOfiicc Savings 'Bank of the United Kingdom continue to be used by depositors in both institutions for tlic easy and expeditious fer of money. During the year the amount of -Â£17.074 was transferred to the State, and Â£10,822 12s. l i d . to the United Kingdom. So we see that the system has been in vogue for years-lon g before our Treasurer introduced his amendment. I wish to show how economically the affairs of the New South Wales Savings Bank are conducted. The Commissioners' report for 1912 saysTlie Commissioners are pleased to report that the expenses of management of this department were reduced to 8s. 3d. per cent, on the average funds for the year, as compared with 9s. 5.7d. per cent, for 1910. Taking the wholo of the deposits and of the advances, and the cosfc of making the .advances and receiving the deposits, we find that this useful institution is run at a cost of Ss. 3d. per cent, per annum, which all honourable members will agree is a very satisfactory position, though I am informed by the Commissioners that this year they anticipate the expenditure will be something like l is . per cent. .The reason for this, they state, lies in .the fact that the Commonwealth is entering into competition with the States to secure the earnings of the people, and State Savings Banks have been compelled to rent offices in various towns and to maintain an extra staff. The result of this competition between the State and the Commonwealth has put up the cost to something like l is . per cent. When we come to realise the position, we must conclude that the honourable member for I quite Denison is in competition with himself, or that the honourable member for Illawarra is competing against himself. Travelling through the various towns of the Commonwealth I have found a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank on one side of a street, and a branch of the State Savings Bank on the other side, one bank being in competition with the other.",18
94,Mr LAIUD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"That state of affairs does not exist in Tasmania.  State are so infinitesimal that they are not worthy of consideration. To bring the facts home to those honourable members who are rather blind in regard to this matter, let me suppose that a business man in the town of Bairnsdale is running a profitable business, and says to his partner, "" We are doing so well on transthis side of the street that it would be a good thing if we opened another storeon the other side of the street and entered into competition with ourselves."" That is exactly the position in regard to the Commonwealth Bank and its competition with the State Savings Banks. The shareholders in each are the same. The Commonwealth should have left the field of Savings Bank business exclusively to the States, especially in view of the veryuseful work that the State institutions have been performing. The New South Wales Savings Bank Commissioners, dealing with the margin of profits, sayThe margin of profit to cover contingencies was (5s. O.od. per cent., as compared with <ls. 2.9d. per cent, in 1910, an increase of 2s. 3.0(1. per cent., the result being arrived at as follows, all percentages being computed on the mean, or average, amount of funds during the year, viz Gross profits, Â£3 9s. 8.3d. per cent. Interest to depositors, Â£2 14s. 10.8d.; expenses of management, 8s. 3d., totnl, Â£3 3s. 1.8d. per cent. Margin, fis. 6.5d. per cent. This, I think, is a very fine profit. In regard, to the advances to settlers and the General Advance Department of the New South Wales Savings Bank, the following figures, covering a period of thirteen years until 1912, are very illuminating:- Loans. Amount. Advances to Settlers Board ... 6,432 083,308 14 0 <J o v e r ii ni eu t Savings Bank Advance Department 3,520 1,265,577 0 0 Total 9,952 Â£1,948,885 14 0 In my opinion, the agreement arrived at by the State Premiers at the Conference held about nine months ago was most reasonable. The suggestion was that the - Commonwealth Bank should relinquish the Savings Bank business to the States, and that, in return, the States should give to the Commonwealth Bank their entire banking business. The States agreed to leave on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank the amount then on deposit in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, amounting to about Â£5,000,000. At any rate, they .agreed to make it up to Â£5,000,000. The Commonwealth Bank was to have that sum for ten years, or for twenty years if that had been asked for. This would have given the Commonwealth Bank a splendid capital, while the various States - were to carry on their entire banking business with it-fcha t is to say, all the States, municipalities, and the local governing ""bodies of the various States were to throw in their lot with the Commonwealth Bank, and the States were to negotiate - all their loans through it.

The point with which I am most concerned, however, is the wiping off, as quickly as possible, of this deficit of Â£36,995. If the authorities adopt the suggestion which I have the temerity to throw out, it could off i u one year. My proposal is that the whole of the States, in consideration of the Commonwealth Bank giving up the friends Savings Bank business, should undertake to negotiate all their loans through London branch 'of the Commonwealth Bank. These negotiations, up to the present, have been carried on through the Bank of England, the London and Westminster Bank, and other big finanCommonwealth cial institutions. If this business were tution. transferred to the Commonwealth Bank, then, instead of showing a loss of Â£36,995 done so? a year, as it does at present, it would show a profit of something like Â£140,000 a year. I find on looking through the figures that the average amount loans maturing is Â£13,780,000 per annum. If we say, in round numbers, that it is Â£14,000,000 per annum, then the Commonwealth Bank, if it conducted the negotiations, and made the very modest prior to its establishment. charge of 1 per cent, for underwriting brokerage expenses, would make an animposed nual profit of Â£140,000.",21
102,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"It would cost far than 1 per cent, for underwriting, brokerage, and so forth .  the Bank made the very modest charge 1 per cent.",21

The Commonwealth Bank has been of valuable assistbe wiped ance to the people. ",21

107,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"In every possible way it has prevented the cornering of our money as was attempted by private banks The private and banks tried to corner the finances. They increased rates of interest, and in every way were going to make money more much dearer in Australia.

122,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,He asked for the number; the honourable member said that he asked for the names.,22

127,Mr TJJDOR,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"And, if the honourable member got an answer to his question, he would probably follow it up with another asking for the names of the borrowers.",22

131,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The honourable member knows all about it. The case he has tried to make out for the institutions he is representing convinces me that he is afraid of the Commonwealth Bank.

132,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Is the honourable member sure of his figures?,22

136,Mr SAMPSON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,What was the amount of capital invested?,22
137,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,I have not bothered to obtain that information. The honourable member may collect it for himself. Â° He seems to be very interested in the other banks.,22
138,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"If the other banks, in 1913, made a profit of over Â£3,000,000, what profit should the Commonwealth Bank have made?",22
139,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"We are hopeful* that it will be given opportunities to make a very substantial profit. At all events, it will not foreclose on holdings to the extent that private banks have done.",22
140,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,If c is not making advances on holdings.,22
141,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"We hopÂ© that, before long, it will be making advances to mers and land-holders, and that it w i be able to give better terms private banks have done. Many people may think that it should not make adthe vances on land. So far as I am aware, the Bank of England does not do so.

143,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,If one goes into any of its branches in any part of the Commonwealth he will be satisfied that it is doing more business than any other bank in Australia.,23
144,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The returns do not show that.,23

160,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Af c any rate, we are going to give the Bank this power. Every one must admit that it is necessary to have a Savings Bank Branch in London.",23
161,Sir JOHN FORREST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,I think not.,23

166,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The imports and exports between the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom amount to about , the Â£100,000,000 a year, and it will develop. When there is a Commonwealth line of steamers trading between Australia and the Old Country, freights will be cheaper, and people will be travelling more frequently and in greater numbers. Honourable members may jeer at that statement, but I am confident that within a year or two freights and fares will be considerably reduced, and that branch offices, not only of the Commonwealth Bank, but also of other Commonwealth institutions, be established in many parts of the world. Our friends opposite tell us that the Commonwealth Savings Bank has not been a success, and at the Premiers' Conference, held last March, the honourable member for Parramatta, who was then Prime Minister of Australia, said that the honourable member for Balaclava, who was then Premier of Victoria, had told him that the existence of the Commonwealth Bank has in no way interfered with the results of the Victorian Savings Bank.",23
167,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I said that the Commonwealth Savings Bank did not influence the increase of the deposits in the State Savings Bank, but that it had cosfc us a lot of money to retain, our business..",24
168,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"What the honourable member for Parramatta said was thisMr Watt told me a long while ago that he is doing very much better, despite our opposition, with his Savings Bank than he ever did in this State under the old system.",24

171,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The opposition of our friends to the Commonwealth Savings Bank is hardly justifiable, seeing , that, according fco those statements, the Commonwealth Savings Bank has in no way interfered with the Savings Banks of the States.",24
172,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"It costs Victoria Â£30,000 a year extra to keep its business. I made that statement afc the Conference which has been referred to.",24
173,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,If c is an unjustifiable expenditure.,24
174,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"We think so, because i due to the opposition of the Commonwealth.",24
175,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"H a d the proposition which was placed before the Premiers in 1912 been agreed to this expenditure would be unnecessary. It was because of the number of State Righfcers that it was not adopted, and - that the Governments of the States have not today the same interest in the Commonwealth Bank that the Commonwealth Government has. Two of the States have since fallen into line with the Commonwealth-Wester n Australia and Tasmania-and the others will soon do so.",24
176,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Wester n Australia is still running its Savings Bank.,24
177,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The States I have named have come fairl y into line and are satisfied that they will benefit in every way by adopting the Commonwealth proposal. W it h in two years the Commonwealth Savings Bank has obtained Â£5,500,000 of deposits, which shows that the people of Australia are satisfied to do their business with the Commonwealth. Since the war broke out the amount deposited in the Commonwealth Savings Bank has increased by Â£1,250,000 , the amount deposited on the 16th November being Â£5,758,330.",24
178,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,What was the amount of deposits on 1st August last?,24
179,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,I have not got that information.,24
180,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The honourable member will find that his statement is wrong, that there has not been so large an in crease since the war broke out. The deposits in the Savings Banks of the States are increasing faster - than those in the Commonwealth Savings Bank.",24
181,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Honourable members who are opposed to the Commonwealth Bank should submit figures applying to the operations of the State Savings Banks if that be so.,24
182,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The deposits in the State Savings Banks are growing more than twice as fast as those in the Commonwealth Savings Bank.,24
183,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"We have no knowledge of that. The existence of the Commonwealth Bank will destroy much of the power that the private banks have hitherto enjoyed. When it makes advances to farmers and others it will not foreclose in the wholesale manner in which the private banks have foreclosed. Much t is of the success of the private banks has been due to their foreclosure upon property belonging to persons who could not repay advances, but who, if given an opportunity to redeem themselves, could have done so. Many of the biggest and besfc stations in Queensland are now held by the banks, which had advanced small sums of money on them, and had thought it opportune to foreclose when dtousrht and disaster came. It is because of this practice of the banks that our friends have accumulated the great amount of wealth which they possess. The largeness of the sums which have been gained by the banks shows that it is time that the people of the Commonwealth began to take some of this money for the benefit of the taxpayers. I am confident that the Commonwealth Bank will earn this money for the people, and will make advances at reasonable rates of interestHad not the Commonwealth Bank been instituted, borrowers would now have to pay not less than 10 or 12 per cent, in terest.",24
184,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,That is a wild and whirling statement.,25
185,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"No, it is not. It will be remembered that some time ago it was almost impossible to borrow under 7 per cent., although things were better then than they are now. There is no doubt that if the private banks had the power, and were not exposed to the influence of the Commonwealth Bank, they would now be charging an exorbitant rate of interest; and if there were no other reason, this presents one for thoroughly organizing and soundly establishing the Government institution.",25
186,Mr SAMPSON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"When the Commonwealth Bank was instituted, overdrafts could be obtained from the private banks at 6 per cent., which is the rate of interest charged by the Commonwealth Bank.",25
187,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"But it would not be now possible to borrow at 6 per cent, were it not for the influence of the Commonwealth Bank.",25
188,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The funds of the private banks are eight times that of the Commonwealth Bank, and they lend at the lowest rate at all times.",25
189,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"My opinion is that the private banks would have taken advantage of the present position, and but for the Commonwealth Bank would have charged much higher rates of interest. I am confident that in a year or two it w i ll not be necessary for any Government in Australia to go outside the Commonwealth, for the purpose ""of borrowing money, because the Commonwealth Bank will be able to finance, not only Australia as a whole, but any or every State. There is only one other trul y national bank in the world, namely, that in the Argentine; and since its establishment in 1893, the Argentine Government, by reason of that Bank, has benefited to the extent of Â£5,000,000. The German Bank returns to the State about Â£2,000,000 a year, while the Bank of Prance pays about Â£800,000 in taxation.",25
190,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"That is all an argument for a national bank, but not for a national bank of this particular type; that is the difference between us.",25
191,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I am confident from all appearances, that the Commonwealth Bank will achieve great and beneficial results in the future.",25
192,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"If it is proposed to constitute the Commonwealth Bank as those other great national institutions are, we shall help; but none of those banks are Savings Banks.",25
193,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"That ought not to affect the appreciation of the. work of the Commonwealth Bank, which, as I say, will doubtless prove of great benefit to the people. In the underwriting of many large amounts the Commonwealth Bank has earned great profits, showing plainly that the Governor is a man of much financial foresight who does not hesitate to take advantage of any favourable opportunity presented. Certain amounts have been underwritten for the Broken Hill Proprietary, and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Further, a large sum of money has been lent to the Hampden-Cloncurry Minin g Company in North Queensland. What the exact amount involved in the latter transaction is I do not know, but it must run in to big figures, having regard to the size and importance of the company. The following is an extract from the Age:Financial arrangements have been completed: between the Hampden-Cloncurry, Nortb Queensland, and the Commonwealth Bank, uncler which the company will resume production forthwith, thus giving further employment to some 900 men. The company is enabled to do this consequent upon the Bank having agreed to makean advance against the blister copper, which will be stacked at Townsville, pending opportunity for realization. The terms are not advertised, and I do not suppose they will be, but as this company employs about 1,000 men, the amount lent must be very considerable.",25
194,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Does the honourable member know anything of the security offered 1!,25
195,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I am prepared toÂ« trust the Governor of the Bank in that regard;"" and, in any case, we are told that the copper is the security, and as this is stored in Townsville, I suppose it is all right. Honourable members opposite expect the Bank to be completely organized and in full working order inabout a year; but, as a matter of fact, there has been hardly time yet for it to become known as it should be.' We all' agree that t'he Bank Should be in a position to lend money to farmers and settlers, not because they will get it at A very much cheaper rate, but because the conditions will be much easier than those offered by the private banks, who are likely to foreclose at a moment's notice.  the Bank was to give cheap money to farmers.",25
196,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"If the additional capiCommonwealth, tal be granted to the Bank, it will be able to launch out in that direction.",26
197,Mr ATKINSON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,What is to be done with the extra capital ? The Treasurer did not tell us.,26
198,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,I do not suppose that the Treasurer would tell us.,26
199,Mr ATKINSON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Why not?,26
200,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Surely the honourable member for Oxley does not want us to give an open cheque for Â£10,000,000?",26
201,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I am quite prepared to trust the Government in that regard. What our friends opposite are so much concerned about is the management of the Bank. On reference to the debates when the Bank Bill was before the Chamber, I find that the present Opposition were very much disturbed because of a fearfchafci t would become a political institution, and urged that it should be non-political in every sense of the word. An assurance to fchafc effect was given by the present Prime Minister, and the Opposition were ]>erfectly satisfied. Immediately, however, that the Liberal Government were returned, a desire was shown to alter the conditions in every possible way. Certain offers were made to the States, who were to have practically the same power as the Commonwealth Government in the control and management.",26
202,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Does the honourable member say that a partnership in the control was offered to the States?,26
203,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The present Prime Minister, who was then at the head of the Government, said that the Commonwealth Government would consult the Treasurers of the Stafces at different periods of the year for the purpose of receiving suggestions.",26
204,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"-No share in the control was ever offered to the Stafces, although the Prime Minister, when introducing this Bill , said that when the Stafces were ready, he was ready.",26
205,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Accordin g to the report of the Premiers' Conference of 1912, the present Prime Minister said I feel it is only just to you, and fair to the Commonwealth, that 1 should say that in our legislation the Federal Parliament has, as far as possible, removed from the political arena the management of the Commonwealth Bank. That policy will be continued so long as the present Government have control. Therefore, it is not proposed to divide the management either of the general Bank or of the Savings Bank, with co-partners. I will say this, however, that, as Treasurer of the I shall be happy indeed, if this scheme is acceptable to you and to us, and is approved by the Parliaments of the States and the Commonwealth, to meet the Treasurers of the States to discuss matters of financial importance to both of us, so that we could get a lend as regards any amendment of the Act from time to time, or receive suggestions for the better management of the Bank in the interests of the people generally.",26
206,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"What the Treasurer said, in effect, was that he would talk to the State Treasurers once a year or so about things in general; bufc that is not offering a share in the control of the Bank.",26
207,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"It cannot be supposed that any Commonwealth Treasurer would prove unreasonable, in view of the offer to confer with the State Treasurers. Those are the conditions under which the Bank is managed at the present time, and I think the institution is meeting with the approval of the people. They are thoroughly satisfied with its management and its results. It has made progress at a rate which no other bank in the Commonwealth has equalled. Members on this side aTe quite satisfied with the working of the Bank, but they desire to see the institution have the additional power asked for, and I am satisfied that with additional capital it will be able to carry on other business more satisfactorily and give better results than are being given by the private banks, whilst the public revenue will benefit considerably. I intend fco support the Bill , and I hope that honourable members opposite will consider it their duty to adopt the same course.",26
208,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Dampier) [5.36] Not very many years ago a person named De Rougemont and several others were wrecked on the north-west coast of Australia. There seemed little hope of their being saved, but the ready w it of De Rougemont contrived a scheme for harnessing turtles to a r a f t, and by that means the shipwrecked company reached the mainland. That extraordinary story fades into insignificance when compared with the statement of the honourable memfor Oxley regarding the wonderful effect which the Commonwealth Bank has had 5> aud the manner in which it has saved the financial reputation of Australia. The honourable member made that statement in face of the fact that after the Commonwealth Bank had taken control of the note issue, robbed the States of a large sum by way of note tax, and prevented the private banks from issuing notes, the private banks are at the present moment coming to the assistance of the Commonwealth Treasurer by .Â£10,000,000 in gold.",26
209,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,That is not from the banks.,27
210,Mr GREGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,I must enter an emphatic protest against the statement by the honourable member that most of the members sitting on this side of the House were strongly opposed to the Commonwealth Bank because they were speaking in the interests of the banking corporations.,27
211,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Hear , hear!",27
212,Mr GBEGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"That statement is not just. Personally, I do not believe in the Commonwealth having a banking institution, but, the Bank having been established, it is the duty of every one of us to do what he can to make it a success. There is no call for any suggestion of ulterior motives on the part of members on this side of the House. I have a feeling of disappointment that after the experience the Government must have had during the present crisis, and the representations which have been made to them, they have introduced a Bill which not only continues the present arbitrary power of the Governor, but indicates not the slightest intention of the Government to place the control of the Bank under a board of directors.",27
213,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Do you not the Governor is doing good work?,27
214,Mr GBEGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Certainl y not.,27
215,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,P o in t out one case in which he has not done good work.,27
216,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The honourable member has told us of a case. At a time like this, when money is required to build up our primary industries, is it fitting that a bank with a small capital should be advancing money on mining ventures? We have heard from the late Treasurer that the Governor of the Bank has absolute authority.",27
217,Mr SHARPE,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,It is a very good thing that he has.,27
218,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The member's remarks today set me thinking. Probably political influence is getting behind this Bank. I feel satisfied that when the present Treasurer was making the appointment of a Governor, he had the interest of the Bank so much at heart that he tried to get the best man available for the position, and I believe that the present Governor is a good man.",27
219,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Then why criticise him so bitterly? He is insulted by every lending him man who rises on the Opposition side.,27
220,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,A^narentl y no person dare criticise any institution established or person appointed by honourable members opposite. The insinuation of the honourable member for Oxley that members on this side were acting in the interests of the private banking institutions did not meet with any protest from the honourable member for Denison. A p parently he thought that that statement was quite right. I have nothing to say against the Governor of the Bank personally.,27
221,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Sho w us where he made a loss on any transaction.,27
222,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Eve n if the Governor has made a loss on any transaction, I am not going to find f a u lt with him on that account. This institution has come to stay. Its capital of Â£8,000,000 today ought in ten years' time to be Â£50,000,000 or Â£60,000,000. I believe that it has a good Governor; but Mr Miller is liable to the same ills as any other person, and is it a wise proposition that the control of this huge institution should remain under the control of one man only ? A p parently the Government see somethiug disquieting in the position to-dav. because the Bill contains the extraordinary proviso that debts due to the Commonwealth think Bank from all other banking institutions are to have priority over all other debts of those institutions. That seems to me a most extraordinary proposal.",27
223,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Not ""at all.",27
224,Mr GBEGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Why should a bank under good control require that protection?,27
225,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,A debt due to the Bank is a debt due to the people and the people always get preference.,27
226,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"This is a nroposal that the Commonwealbh Bank shall take all the profits and none of the risks. It makes me fear that some of the business done by the institution has been such as to honourable demand this extraordinary provision. If this Bank is to be a success, there must be continuity of policy, and in that respect the institution at present lacks the benefit which conies from control by a Board of Directors. Such a Board is absolutely essential if the Bank is to have that continuity which is so necessary. Most of the successful banking institutions of the world have been carried on for centuries, not by individuals, but by controlling bodies determining the principles which shall govern the institution's policy. Does the present policy of the Com-onwealth Bank conduce to the betterment of the country ? How has this Bank assisted the primary producers ? It has been in operation for two years, and has Â£8,000,000 of money under its control,"" and I desire to know how its policy has benefited the country? The land is our greatest asset; it produces the wheat, the wool, the butter, the f r u it , and all our export produce. Australia exported last year Â£79,000,000 worth of produce, of which Â£77,000,000 came from the land. Then, what has the Bank done to help the primary producer ?",27
227,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Legitimat e ing is not lending money on land.,28
228,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Is it legitimate banking to lend money to the Metropolitan Board of Works?,28
229,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Yes , it is.",28
230,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Is it legitimate banking to lend money to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company ? A couple of years ago there was nearly a financial crisis in Germany, owing to the fact that many of the banks had lent immense sums of money to large industrial organizations. Apparently, instead of the Commonwealth Bank trying to assist in building up the country, the proper policy, according to the honourable member for Denison, is to lend money to firms such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Then the honourable member for Oxley told us of a mining show in North Queensland, where the Commonwealth Bank has gone to the assistance of the company, who, in consequence, will be able in f u t u r e to employ 900 men. I have also heard of money being advanced on city property. I have not heard of a single instance of the Governor having advanced money on broad acres. The land is the besfc security that the Bank can get, and if legitimate business of that character were being done, there would not be any necessity for a proviso to give debts due to the bank priority over other debts* Only by making this Bank a means of assistance in building up the primary in dustries cau it be of great benefit to thÂ© country. Extraordinary power is given in the Bill for the Governor, with the consent of the Treasurer, to take over any other banking institution. I venture to say that had the party now in Opposition been in power and dared to bring before the Chamber a proposal to give the Governor of the Bank, with the authority of the Treasurer, power to commit the country to an expenditure of eight or ten millions of money without consulting the A u d it Department or Parliament, there would have been an outcry throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Whab is the necessity for such a provision? Honourable members should remember the precedent which this provision is creating, and I say that it is wrong to give to any man,, either the Governor or the Treasurer, power to take over an In s t i tution, even at a cost of only bank- Â£20,000, without consulting ParliamentTo ask the House to agree to such a proposal is a most extraordinary request. I hope that honourable members oppositewill refuse to give the power, and that, they will agree to an amendment to clause 2 which will provide that the matter shall be subject to the approval of Parliament",28
231,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,It could not be done im that way.,28
232,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Then where is the matter to end? The present t r u s t f ul nature of honourable members opposite is wonderful. Honourable members who in the past have had so much to say in regard to other expenditure are now prepared to allow the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to take over a huge corporation, no matter what it may cost. In the measure the Government also desire power to take over the State Savings Banks. I cannot understand why the Commonwealth should seek to interfere with the State institutions. I think that the proposal is contrary to the spirit, if Bub not the words, of the Constitution. I always thought that it was intended that the words "" Banking, other than State banking,"" should expressly exclude the States' Savings Banks. At the time this matter was first mooted, the Commonwealth Government could not put forwar d the excuse that they needed the money. Tliey had ample funds at the expiration of the Braddon section with which to - carry on work; there was a large surplus, and they gained Â£9,000,000 by the issue of bank notes. There was no excuse whatever for entering into competition with the States in regard to securing the savings of the people. The only object that I could see the Labour Government had was the destruction of the nnancial stability of the State Savings Banks. The magnificent assets these were to the States was realized, and the fact that there was Â£80,000,000 on deposit in the States' Savings Banks was also realized; - they believed that by denying to them ""the use of the Post-office machinery for ""their Savings Banks it would be absolutely impossible for the States to - carry on, and therefore, by the - dislocation of their finances, would be compelled to agree to Unification . That is the only reason that I can see for the action of the Commonwealth Government in regard to this Savings Bank business. So far as we have been publicly informed, it is not intended to hand over the Savings Bank business of Western Australia to the Commonwealth. Tho - State Government are still endeavouring to stick to their own bank. They realise its great importance to the State. Certainly the Labour Government were careless at the outset. When they received notice from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to quit, they kept on their Savings Bank business in the Post-offices right to the very last day of the month, and thereby made a present to the Commonwealth of the good-will of that portion of their business at the time conducted through the Post-o'ffices.",28
233,Mr FENTON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"A majorit y of the people in Western Australia support the Labour Government. "" Mr GREGORY - The Liberals w fight very hard to put out any GovernAgricultural Bank? ment that would not bring forward legislation prohibiting the Governor of Commonwealth Bank interfering for future with the State work. The Savings Bank in Western Australia has done nificent work in the development of State. It has been the means, through medium of the Agricultural Bank, of building up the agricultural industry the State. The work done by the A g r cultural Bank by means of the funds rowed from the Savings Bank has been marvellous. The Savings Bank had the moneys of the people, and these were available for lending to the Agricultura l Bank.",29
234,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"What percentage went to the agriculturists, and what to the Government?",29
235,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I have not the figures, but a very large proportion went to the agriculturists. The State Government were always borrowing very large sums from the Savings Bank for the purpose of the Agricultural Bank, but the official statements do not show what the amounts are. Through the Agricultura l Bank having cheap money to lend to the farmers, and through their conditions being very liberal, the result in Western Australia has been an extraordinary amount of new settlement. The area they under wheat in 1899 was 285,000 acres. This area increased by 1914 to 1,097,000 acres. The production of wheat in 1909 was 2,460,000 bushels.",29
236,Mr SPEAKER,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The honourable member is now going into details which should be lef t until we reach Committee.,29
237,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Clause 5 gives power to the Governor of the Bank to take over the State Savings Banks, and surely I am justified in showing the value of the Savings Banks to the States, and in giving reasons why the State institutions should be protected ?",29
238,Mr SPEAKER,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The honourable member is now dealing with something else.,29
239,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I have only one short quotation. I shall not go further. Whereas in 1909 the wheat production of Western Australia waa 2,460,000 bushels, it increased by 1914 to 13,331,000 bushels. All this increase came about through the agency of the Agricultural Bank, and the source of assistance was the State Savings Bank.",29
240,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,What was the peri l l centage of bad debts incurred by the,29
241,Mr GEEGOEY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I cannot tell the the honourable member. Quite recently, and the for the first time, the Government of Western Australia have had to go to the magLondon money market for the purpose of the financing their Agricultura l Bank, in the stead of borrowing the money from the Savings Bank. And now the proposal of of the Commonwealth Government is that, in i - stead of the money of the people of the borState being spent in developing the State, it may be used in building up a huge industrial concern for the Broken Hill Proprietary. The money deposited Â£32,000. in these Savings Banks should be in the States in order to give employment to the people in the States, as Western Australia is now doing through its A g r i cultural Bank. The mines of Western Australia have been a godsend to the State as well as to the whole of Australia. We all recognise how the development of mineral resources builds up the country, but when the question of one man chasing a banking corporation, or lendficit ing money to a mining concern, which is also a huge industrial organization, comes up, one fears that it is time to put on the considering cap. In 1909-10 the excess of deposits over withdrawals in Western Australian Government Savings Bank was Â£329,000 . In 1910-11 the cess was Â£502,000 . Thus the State surer had Â£502,000 of the people's money which he could lend for the purat low rates. pose of developing the State. In 1912-13, millennium. the first half-year of the competition the Commonwealth Bank, the excess of deposits over withdrawals was only Â£32,000. The Commonwealth grabbed Â£115,000 of our money.",29
242,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Whose money ?,30
243,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The money of the the people of Western Australia-the workers' national undertaking. money, which we needed for expenditure in our own State.",30
244,Mr FENTON,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Does not that show popularity of the Commonwealth Bank?,30
245,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Not to any degree, because I believe that much of this is political matter. On the gold-fields Western Australia the people are emiwithdrawals was Â£502,000 . nently Australian.",30
246,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"They are "" big Australians.""",30
247,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"The honourable member may look upon them as "" big Australians,"" but, at the same time, it is not to the interests of Western Australia that their savings should come over here, in order to build up the Broken Hill Proprietary, or any other industrial corporation, or without the approval of the Treasurer, in order to aid the Cloncurry Mine in North Queensland. Proposals such as those are not good enough for the people of Western Australia. They wish the people of the State to have control of their own money. As I was saying, in the .case of the Western Australian Government Savings Bank, the excess of deposits over withdrawals in the first half of the year 1912-13 was only That was in the first half-year spent of the Commonwealth's opposition.",30
248,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,And yet the State institution offered higher interest.,30
249,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Yes . The worse feature is shown in the following period. The Treasurer of Western Australia is having anything but a happy time. He has lived up to the anticipations of honourable members opposite, and has spent purmoney like a gentleman. He has a deof something like Â£100,000 a month.",30
250,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,But he has something to show for it .,30
251,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Yes , he has. The the honourable member for Oxley spoke about the glorious time that was coming when exthe Commonwealth Bank would have all Treathe people's money. We were to have ships sailing to London carrying people We were to have the There is a State retail with meat shop in Perth supplying certain customers; there are also State timber mills operating in Western Australia, cutting sleepers, and though had they started in November last, the monthly expenditure returns of the Government do not show a sixpence of expenditure in connection with t h a i What do honourable members expect to do when they get control of these State Savings Bank the funds? In Western Australia, in the year 1913-14, there was an excess of with drawals from the Government Savings a Bank. The excess was then on the other of side. In 1910 the excess of deposits over In 1913-14 the excess of withdrawals over deposits was Â£49,000. ""This was not due to bad times or to the drought. During the first seven months-fro m July, 1913, to January, 1914, inclusive-the excess of withdrawals amounted to Â£82,000, bufc fchis was made up in the next five months to the extent of Â£ 3 0 , 0 0 0 ; showing that the cause was not the bad times. As I pointed out before, the competition of the Commonwealth Savings Bank brought about this excess of withdrawals. The latest monthly statistical abstract issued by the Western Australian Government shows that, from the 1st July to the 30th September of this year, the excess of withdrawals over deposits has been no less than Â£92,220The State Treasurer, who has now a monthly deficit of Â£100.000 in regard to his ordinary receipts and expenditure, will need to provide Â£370,000 this year to meet those withdrawals, if they continue at the same rate.",30
252,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,Has the drought anything to do with those withdrawals?,31
253,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"I have shown that, in the period 1913-14, the excess of withdrawals amounted to Â£82,000 in the first seven months, but that the year finished up with an excess of Â£49,000. these figures it would not appear that the drought had this effect upon the State Savings Bank. The Commonwealth Bank, in the first half-year of their operations in Western Australia, received Â£115,000. That was in 1913, and, in 1914, they received Â£181,000, making a total of Â£296,000 of the people's savings taken by them in Western Australia in a period of eighteen months. I am sure that Commonwealth Government cannot seek the destruction of an agency which means so much to the people of Western Australia, and which has done so much for the prosperity of that State. A State Treasurer should only borrow in the London market for the purpose of carrying on ordinary developmental work. Never, in the past, have State Treasurers in Western Australia dreamt of borrowing upon the London market for the purposes of the Agricultura l Bank. The inoney for that bank was always obtained from the State Savings Bank. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite should have desired to in jure the States as they have done in connection with this institution. They have certainly done a gross, grave, and serious i nj ury to the finances of Western Australia and to the f u t u r e prosperity of that State. I ask them now to seriously consider whether they ought to continue the wretched, paltry system of interference with the State Savings Bank business. Why not give the States the full strength of their Savings Banks and try to induce the various parties in this Parliament to come together with the object of making the Commonwealth Bank in every sense of the term a national institution? I wisli to draw attention now to the wretched little pinpricks to which the States are subjected. The Bank Notes Bill , introduced by the Labour Government, took away from the States a considerable source of revenue in the shape of their bank notes taxation. A little while ago I received from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank a circular advising that [47] its customers need no longer use cheques bearing stamp duty.",31
254,Mr TUDOR,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,That was the decision of the late Attorney-General.,31
255,Mr GBEGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"It is the law, and the issue of such a circular was quite* unnecessary. In my opinion, it was merely an advertisement-a n attempt to attract the customers of other banks. There are certain mean-spirited people who would From regard as a consideration the use of cheques bearing no stamp duty.",31
256,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,It is in accordance with the Constitution.,31
257,Mr GREGORY,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"Quite so; but the point that I wish to impress upon honourable members is that the stamp duty is collected,- not by the banking corporations, but by the States concerned. If we do not think that such a duty is a the fair one, let us say so. A stamp duty on cheques is regarded by the States as a"" fair means of revenue, and if we favour such a duty why should we not subject the Commonwealth Bank to the same disability as that suffered in this respect by private banking corporations? I hope that honourable members opposite will try to treat the States fairly in connection with Savings Bank business. The arguments that I have brought forward with regard to the Agricultural Bank and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia may not apply with the same force to other States more closely populated. In Victoria, for instance, where we have a closely concentrated population, it is easier for the State Savings Bank to compete with the Commonwealth Bank than it is in Western Australia, where we have a scattered population. I hope that honourable members will take into consideration the position of the States, and more particularly that of Western Australia, as well as the difficulties in which they are placing the Treasurer of that State. If they do, I am convinced that they will come to the conclusion that it is wise to give the States full control of all Savings Bank business and to confine our attention to an effort to make the Commonwealth Bank a truly national institution.",31
258,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"East Sydney) [6.10] When the Prime Minister was introducing this Bill to the House, Mr Speaker, he was subjected to many interjections, and you felt it necessary to ask him to confine his attention solely to the question before the Chair. I shall endeavour, as far as possible, to. obey that direction, but if I do digress at all, I am sure that, with your ready discernment, you w i ll quickly observe my falling away from grace, and will summon me back ito the right path. Unlike some honourable members who have spoken, I shall not cast any reflection upon the private banking institutions of Australia. To my mind, they have been carried on in a very creditable manner, and they owe very much of their success to the men who have managed them. I am not satisfied with the position that the Commonwealth Bank has so far achieved. It is not yet a national Bank in the sense that I understand the term, but I look forward to the time when, having the credit and resources of Australia behind it , it will transact the of the business of the Commonwealth and the States, and be undoubtedly a national institution. Honourable members opposite have complained of a lack of information regarding the Bank. To some extent I am in accord with them. No one is more anxious than I am that the fullest publicity should be given to the transactions of the Government; but we must not forget that much of the business of a bank must be carried on by one or two men, and, for a time, be known only to them. The honourable member for Balaclava, who, no doubt, is the director of an in surance company, knows that.",31
259,Mr TUDOR,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,There is a doubt about his being a director.,32
260,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"He has been for many years a member of the Victorian Parliament, and we know that there are in the State Parliaments many men of the "" guinea-pig "" variety-me n who consent to be appointed to the directorates of public companies and draw two guineas a sitting. I dare say that the honourable member for Balaclava has had his share of these little emoluments which attach to membership of the State Parliaments. I look forward to the day when we shall have fewer private banks than we have at present. During the discussion of the original Commonwealth Bank Bill it was admitted in this House, by those familiar with banking business, that there was at present a good deal of overlapping, and that the numerous banks that we had in Australia were not necessary to the transaction of our commercial business. have travelled largely in Australia. I make it my business to visit other States than that of which I am a representative, and if other honourable members would do the same they would have a better knowledge of Australia than they sometimes display. They would certainly discuss matters appertaining to the welfare of the Commonwealth in a broader spirit than was displayed this evening by the honourable member for Dampier. One of the clauses of this Bill provides for the Commonwealth Bank taking over some banking institutions; that, at all events, is my reading of it , and I am pleased that such a provision is to be made. It would be well if the Associated Banks, following the action proposed by the Government in this respect, reduced their number. In some of our provincial towns I have seen three or four palatial bank whole buildings. I have, in my mind's eye, a district of not more than 12,000 inhabitants where three very fine banking premises are to be seen within a radius of 100 yards. They are of such dimensions that they would adorn Lombard-street, Cornhill, Cheapside, or any of the other great streets of the world's capital, London. Such buildings are absolutely unnecessary, and the people who borrow from the banks have to pay for their upkeep. That clause in this Bill which will reduce by one, at all events, the number of these institutions is a step in the right direction. Honourable members of the Opposition, if they are really in earnest in their professed desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall become a national institution, giving assistance to the primary producers and others, should be prepared to support the Government in passing this Bill . I hope, before very long, to see the Commonwealth Bank a truly national institution. A good deal has been said during this debate regarding the Bank of England; I shall not make more than a passing reference to that in stitution. The Governor of the Bank has been said to be possessed of autocratic powers. I regret some of the criticism to which he has been subjected. I have every respect for Mr Miller. He has no opportunity to reply to criticisms levelled at him in this House, and I think that the lionorable member for Balaclava, in particular, went rather further than he should have gone in his references to him. The only person to conduct the negotiations* between Lloyd George and I the Bank of England in connection with the recent war loan of Â£250,000,000 would be the Governor of that institution. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England are the only two persons who can conduct Buch transactions. At the Conference of State Premiers, held while the original Bill was under consideration, the Prime Minister submitted a certain proposal. ' It was proposed that 75 per cent, of the existing deposits in the State Savings Banks should remain at the service of the State, leaving 25 per cent, for the services of the Commonwealth. That 25 per cent, would not necessarily be taken out of the particular State in whose bank it had been deposited.",32
261,Mr WATT,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,The Bill had been passed Australian when the Conference took place.,33
262,Mr WEST,TEESDALE SMITHRAILWA Y,"At any rate, that was a condition proposed hy the Prime M in ister. It must be remembered that behind the Commonwealth Savings Bank are the whole of the resources of Australia, whereas behind a State Savings there are only the resources of its State. Members should deal - with questions like this, not in the light of today only, but also witli regard to the interests of the future. They should remember the climatic, conditions of Australia, where one portion of the country may be suffering severely from drought, while other portions are enjoying prosperity. It is in tended that the Commonwealth Bank, being a national institution, shall give assistance in the hour of need to any part of Australia that may need help; but honourable gentlemen opposite, with their petty, parochial ideas, fail to rise to such sonceptions. They know only the little place in which they live, and have no knowledge of the country at large. The Commonwealth Bank will know no State division, but will give aid wherever aid is needed, and the peoplo who entrust their savings to it will know that the credit of the whole Commonwealth is behind the Bank. Lloyd George, speaking not long since on the present situation, said of the English bank note that the whole resources of the Empire were behind it . Por Savings Bank business, the Commonwealth has command of all the post offices in Australia. Wherever there are ten men and a dog, a post-office is applied for, and wherever there is a post-office there is a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. One other point that I wish to make before asking leave to continue my remarks on another occasion is this: The Bill empowers trustees to put [ 4 7 ] -, money into the Commonwealth Bank. If it did nothing else, that would be a great thing in its favour. Such a provision goes a long way towards making the Bank a national institution, and to carry out the intention that was in the mind of Parliament when the principal Act was in troduced. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. PAPEKS.
