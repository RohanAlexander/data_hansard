1,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister any .official information about the action of German officials towards British miners PAPUA . BOUNDARYAPin Papua, reported in today's newspapers, and will he inform' the House if any arrangement has teen made by his Depart-, ment for the survey of the boundary line between German and British New Guinea?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have no official information, but .that from unofficial sources Is quite credible. British miners, working in territory beyond the Papuan border,, when asked by German officials for dues required of persons mining in German Kew Guinea, have paid them. As to the statement that a constable had heen taken capfive, the fact appears to be that he offered himself as a guide.' In neither case has there been friction or aggression. As I informed the House a few weeks ago, we have sent a letter to the Colonial Office requesting it to ask the German Government to authorize the local Administration of German New Guinea to meet our representatives with a view to a final determination of the boundary.",15
3,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister-i . Has his attention been called to a cablegram in this morning's papers, stating that the attention of the Imperial Government had been called byquestion in the House of Commons to the '-' unsatisfactory state of affairs existing Papua""? 2. Has his attention been called to an article in today's Age dealing with the need for administrative reforms in I'apua, and setting out the position thus : -(Â« ) The Minister for External Affairs knows "" little oinothing of the doings of 'the local nominee Legislative Council; (i) Efforts have been made to secure the passing of Ordinances in Council favouring the - compulsory acquisition of native lands, and :the taxation of natives for enforced labour - purposes? 3. Have the issues raised in - this article received attention yet? What steps have been taken to place the Public Service and administration generally of Papua on a proper basis; and can the Prime Minister say when an Administrator will be appointed?",15
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am not aware of anything justifying the allusion in the House of Commons to Papuan affairs, because, apart from the difficulty which' arose in connection with the application for land-By certain officials, there has been nothing to call for attention. Probably some exaggerated newspaper statement has given rise to the question. Administrative difficulties existed at the time of the land difficulty, to which T propose to make allusion at an early date, in view of a statement from the Director of Agriculture, which should be taken into account. There is no administrative friction now, so far as I know.",15
5,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The friction is as great now as it was before.,15
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So far as I can learn, it is only those to whose .views effect has not been given who are dissatisfied. Even where there are not representative assemblies there are parties and the statements of neither side in regard to its opponents is to be received without qualification. In my opinion, the present administration of the Territory is satisfactory. What was proposed in regard to the native lands is a comparatively old story. The Government of Papua submitted a land ordinance, one of whose clauses contained ambiguous, terms as to the mariner in which land might - be acquired from the natives. As the wording did not satisfy me, I sent back the ordinance, so that the clause' might be expressed in terms which would put it beyond doubt that the native lands are not to be trenched upon. The proposal emanated from non-official members of the Council, selected to temporarily represent the white settlers; but I hope that settlement'will proceed so fast that, the popuin lation will soon become large enough to justify some form of representative government. This will enable the views of the people, which are entitled to be taken into consideration, to be clearly expressed. I hope to provide for the appointment of Administrator in the course of the next three or four months.",15
7,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, in replying to the question put by the honourable member for Calare, said that the opinion that friction now existed in the Public Service of Papua was held only by what might he called the ""opposition party"" in the Territory. Does he regard the Anglican Bishop of New Guinea-who , when in Melbourne - recently, made strong statements bearing out the contention that friction does exist-as being numbered amongst the opposition in Papua, and will he take care that the appointment of an Administrator is made whilst this House is sitting and not during arecess ?",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am not aware on which side the Bishop of New Guinea is to be ranked, but should suppose that he could not be properly classed with either. Without knowing the source of his information, I am unable to say whether he shares the view that friction exists. As to the. second question put by the honourable member, - I have t already said that I hope that an Administrator will be appointed three or four months hence, and Parliament is not likely then to be in recess.",15
9,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Is it. not a fact that alers most the whole of the white population of Papua desire that the present Acting Administrator shall be permanently appointed, and has not that fact been conveyed to the Prime Minister by a member of the Legislative Council of the Territory?",16
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Subjec t to my former doubt whether the present nominee members of theCouncil-wh o are not Government officials, but were nominated after inquiry on the recommendation of the late Administrator-reall y do on all questions represent the exact opinions of those whom they were appointed to represent, I reply that they have made a recommendation in that behalf.",16
11,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Bu, t has not the white population by petition urged the appointment of the present Acting Administrator to the permanent office ?",16
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have no means of ascertaining whether the nominee members speak on behalf of the whole white population, or merely express their individual opinions. As experienced members of the Council, their opinion, apart from any other consideration, is entitled to weight; but I am unable to say how far they Speak on behalf of the people outside oh that particular point.",16
13,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that, although, certain gentlemen claimed to voice the opinions of the white residents of Papua in reference to the permanent appointment of the present Acting Administrator, their action has since been repudiated by other white residents of the Territory?",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have had communications, both commendatory of, and in opposition to, the proposition of those gentlemen. In each case individual opinions only were expressed. QUEENSLAND SUGAR INDUSTRY . Further,",16
15,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I desire to elicit from the Minister of Trade and Customs some information about the sugar industry. Referring to the deputation from the Queensland sugar growers who waited on him yesterday with a view to secure his consent to a reduction of wages on the plantations, was a shorthand note taken of what transpired at the interview ? If so, will he cause a transcript of the proceedings to be laid on the library table ? Is it true that one of the deputation contended that 3s. c-d. per day was adequate payment for white workon the plantations, or that the planters could not afford to pay more? Did the deputation deny the Minister's contention that the rate of payment for day work should be higher than when the worker is engaged by the week? What is the substance of the regulation to which the deputation took exception? .Does he intend to comply with the wishes of the deputation by so altering the regulation as to bring about a reduction of the wages of the workers engaged in this industry ?",16
16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Without notice it would be difficult, as requested by the honourable member, to deal seriatim with the questions that he has put to me. A deputation waited on me yesterday, and as I had a shorthand writer present I shall be able to make available to honourable members a report of the proceedings. It was contended that the new rate for casual labourers fixed under the order issued this month-namely , 5s. per day and keep-wa s too high, and that the industry could not stand it . I felt that the evidence on which the order was issued was sufficient to warrant it, and I shall be pleased to furnish honourable members with a full report of what took place at the deputation, so that they may learn for themselves what representations were made and what answer was given. DECIMAL COINAGE.",16
17,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Has the Treasurer noticed the resolution passed by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, now sitting in Brisbane, to the effect that as the Commonwealth is arranging to mint its own silver, it is desirable that the decimal system of coinage should be simultaneously adopted? Is he also aware that a Commonwealth Committee on coinage and weights and measures reported in favour of the decimal system, and that its report was adopted by this House? will he take that report into caref u l consideration when arranging for the coinage of silver by the Commonwealth ?",16
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not seen the resolution to which the honourable member has referred, but the whole question has been brought prominently before me on several occasions. The matter requires careful consideration, and probably joint action by Australia in regard to the decimal system should be concurrent with that taken by other parts of the Empire. The matter is being looked into in connection with the question of silver coinage. I have given it consideration, and intend to discuss it with the Prime Minister before making any definite promise as to what is - likely to be done.",16
19,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that the Committee did consider the question of whether the Commonwealth - should await the adoption by the Empire of decimal coinage and of the metric system, or whether it should anticipate that adoption, and that this House also had that question before it when it adopted the report of the Committee ? When be is considering this matter will he refer fo the Committee's recommendations in that regard ?",17
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I certainly will do so, and I shall obtain all the information that I can if any records are available as to how the Committee discussed the question. That will be considered as well as any other phase which may present itself. In replying to a previous question by the 'honourable member I said that the-point 'was whether it was desirable that we should wait t ill this matter had Been dealt with throughout the Empire before taking action - desirabl NEW HEBRIDES .",17
21,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"H as the Prime Minister any further information to give the House regarding his urgent representations to the Home Government as to the necessitv for the appointment of a Commissioner to the New Hebrides? Mr DEAKIN ' - I have no further reply, but have either in the office or expect to receive within the next day or two representations from a recent gathering in this' city connected with mission work in the New Hebrides, which will probably give me an opportunity, of which I propose to take advantage, to revive the question. TARIFF REFERENDUM.",17
22,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Is the Prime Minthe ister in favour of the Tariff being submitted to a referendum of the people at the next general election?,17
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In any circumstances, at the next general election the Tariff will be submitted to the criticism of the electors by all candidates who choose to express their views upon it . I do not know that the interests of the Commonwealth would be served by submitting the Tariff to a referendum, which, after all, would have a merely negative effect. We could receixe a direction to alter the Tariff without any ciear indication of what alteration should bo made. '",17
24,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I desire to ast the Prime Minister whether, in view of the urgent need of securing an expression of opinion, from the electors upon the Tariff-especiall y in the absence of any legislation in regard to the new protection - h e will hurry on the general elections when such an expression of opinion may be obtained? ",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am sure that the honourable member realizes that the first part of his question is to be taken seriously, because any proposition in regard to an existing Tariff would require to be accompanied by alternatives. Otherwise, a merely negative resolution might be affirmed, the effect of which would be to dislocate the business of the whole of the next Parliament.",17
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It would take some time to think out the questions to be submitted.,17
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The next portion of the honourable member's question divides itself into two parts, namely, the means e or undesirable-of hurrying on a general election, and the grave and serious risk indicated by the interjection by the honourable member for West Sydney, that : the question might be submitted in such a way as to prejudice the public interest unless all the alternatives were presented to the. electors. NA INCO ME TAX .  tion of the Prime Minister to a question of Commonwealth rights. In a letter dated 74th instant, published in the Argus, the writer saysI wish to bring before the Argus the following facts :-Severa l of my fellow-officers in the Federal Service forwarded sums of money for payment of income tax year by year,. holding view, though now erroneous, that they were liable to pay, stipulating at the same time that should the final Court of Appeal decide to the contrary the sums in question would be duly paid back. The writer goes on to state that applications for refunds addressed to the Commissioner  have been refused, and his action is described as "" repudiation pure and simple."" Does the Prime Minister think that these men have been fairly treated, and will the Government take action with a view of securing the recognition of their rights?",17
28,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"Any action by public servants of the Commonwealth .was taken on their own judgment, and they must BOW take the consequences of that action. I should - not be inclined to express an opinion, even if I held one, as to the course to be followed by them, except that, having taken a certain action, each public servant must be the judge of the best procedure to adopt for asserting any right that he deems to have been violated.",18
29,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will look into the question of the extent to which these payments have been made by Commonwealth officers under protest, and whether-if a large amount has been paid in the aggregate-h e will seek to amend the Commonwealth Salaries Act of last year so as to provide that any sums thus paid shall be credited against the taxation for which Commonwealth servants may be liable in future years? Mr 'DEAKIN - As the honourable member suggests, I will lopk into the matter. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.",18
30,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I wish, to ask the Prime Minister whether any airangements have yet been made for establishing comr munication between the mainland and Papua by means of wireless telegraphy, and, if so, when the work will be proceeded with?",18
31,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,We are expecting to ceive tenders in that connection. ELECTORAL ROLLS.,18
32,Mr HUME COOK,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"Yesterday a State number of questions were put to me, havsame. ing reference to the compilation of the electoral rolls-question s t'o which mised an answeito-day. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked whether an official had been instructed by the Department to deliver forms of applicathe tion for enrolment in his electorate. The reply with which I have been furnished isThe Department has no knowledge of the son referred to by Mr Mathews. The honourable member for Kennedy asked what steps were being taken in respect of the compilation of new rolls. The official reply is- Action is being taken in all States with a view subsequently to the preparation of new rolls at an early and every endeavour is being made to secure the co-operation of the Governments of the several States in the matter. The honourable member for .Melbourne Ports also asked whether orders had been issued to returning officers to hold themselves in readiness for a general election. The reply with which I have been furnished isNo orders have been issued. The Returning Officers are expected to be in readiness to hold an election at a reasonably short notice whenever required. The honourable member for Boothby asked a question having reference to the removal of names from the electoral rolls, and the answer with which I have been furnished reads- The officers are well informed as to their duties under the Act in relation to the purification of roils. If Mr Batcnelor will submit any names said to have been improperly removed from the rolls, the matter will be investigated.",18
33,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"Referring to the Minister's reply that the Commonwealth rolls are being compiled with the assistance of State officials, I desire to ask whether the Department is confining itself to the information given by those officials, seeing that the franchise for the Commonwealth is of a more liberal character that the franchise for some of the States. I need scarcely point out that if the Commonwealth officials are confining themselves to the information supplied by State officials, many persons will be disfranchised?",18
34,Mr HUME COOK,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"The answer which reI gave was not that the Commonwealth officials were relying upon the State officials, but that they were acting in co-operation with them. So that wherever they could be so used, the rolls for both. the. and the Commonwealth would be the Of course, in Victoria where adult suffrage does not prevail, the rolls must I pronecessarily be different. '",18
35,Mr GLYNN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I desire to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to fact that when speaking on the Electoral Bill, in 1902, I said that the States should be consulted witha view, if possible, to getting the State franchises aspersimilated with the Commonwealth, franchise so that there could be one set of rolls for all the Parliaments. The only objection then urged to that suggestion had reference to the State of Victoria. I wish to ask the Minister whether he recollects also that two reports were predate, sented by Committees in the same direction.",18
36,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I point out that on the notice-paper there is a question, No. 4, which, I am afraid, covers the same ground, and in such case the question cannot be anticipated. FINANCIALRELATIONS OF tomorrow STATE S TO COMMONWEALTH .",19
37,Mr WH IRVINE,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister when we may expect the promised statement in reference to the readjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth to the States, and whether honourable members will be afforded an opportunity of hearing that statement before we are called upon to deal with the Surplus Revenue Bill ?",19
38,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,The outline of the Government's scheme has already been laid upon the table of the House. Mr W. H. IRVINE - That was scheme outlined before the Conference of Premiers ?,19
39,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,Yes .,19
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"But Minister told that Conference that he would submit his proposals to this Parliament. M.r. DEAKIN - The full report of the proceedings of that Conference, in further exposition of the .Government scheme, is expected to be laid upon the table of the House. But the consideration of those proposals - in further detail, which I apprehend will be undertaken by 'this House, cannot be undertaken upon this side of the recess Mr WH IRVINE.^-We cannot deal with the Surplus Revenue Bill until we have considered those proposals.",19
41,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I think so. The Surplus Revenue Bill stands upon a perfectly independent footing. It is associated-as every financial proposal must be associated - wit h all propositions which affect the financial position of the Commonwealth. But the Bill is, so to speak, a separable part so far as our financial proposals are concerned.",19
42,Mr CROUCH,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,Onl y up to PRIVILEGE : SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE.,19
43,Sir JOHN QUICK,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"I have the honour to report that the Select Committee upon Parliamentary privilege met today, and adjourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. It appears, however, that there is a standing order which prevents the Committee from sitting coincidentally with the House.. As honourable senators will be leaving for their homes tomorrow afternoon, we shall, unless we sit tomorrow, probably be unable to get a quorum before Thursday next. With the permission of ths House, I , therefore, desire to move That leave be granted to the Committee to sit during the sitting of the House.",19
44,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"As the Committee is a joint Committee of both Houses it will be necessary to obtain the consent of both Houses. If this House consents to the honourable member doing so it will be quite competent for him to submit his motion. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member should be permitted lo move the motion he has indicated ? Honourable Members - Hear, ' hear. Question resolved in the affirmative. the PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papersthe Prime Australian Bureau of Agriculture-Memoran dum on the Establishment of, by the Hon. 1... E. Groom, M.P. Defence Department-Memorandu m by the Minister of State for Defence on the Estimates of the Defence Department for the Financial Year 1907-8.",19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,It is very unfortunate that we have these memoranda placed on the table at such a time that they are utterly useless for the purpose of public discussion.,19
46,Mr EWING,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,Honourable members were in possession of the papers six months ago.,19

48,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,When does the Prime Minister intend introducing a Bill for the purpose of establishing a Bureau of Agriculture?,19
49,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL SERVANTS AN D,"If the honourable member is suggesting that a Bill should be introduced this session, I must say no, but. if he is suggesting next session, f may sayyes. NA",19
50,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH CORDITE,"A m I right in assuming that the cordite factory, for which provision is made on the Additional Estimates, will not be established merely on the passing of the vote, but that a Bill will be introduced for the purpose?",20
51,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH CORDITE,"When the vote of, I think, ^10,000 is passed, thus showing the approval of Parliament of the principle, the Government will take steps in the direction of establishing a factory. I previously informed honourable members that the House would be given all information they desired on the subject before final action was taken by the Government. When the Additional Estimates are under consideration to-night, I shall be glad to give that information. NA BUCKETS: ALLEGED COMBINE.",20
52,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRTCE OF FRUIT AND FRUIT,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. WhetlieT he is aware that in 1905, 1906, and IQ07 the price of raspberries' at Monbulk ranged from 3d. to 3id. per lb. ? 2. Does he. know that in 1908 the representatives of the jam factories buying at Monbulk reduced the price of raspberries by mutual consent to i^d. per lb - a price absolutely ruinous to the growers? 3. Is he aware that it costs the growers _at Monbulk iÂ£d. per lb. to pick, cart, and deliver their raspberries'? 4. Has it come to his knowledge that the factories in question offered the growers in 1908 l i d . per lb. for three-fourths of their crop, and endeavoured to buy the remaining fourth at the price of i d . per lb. ?. 5. Is he aware that last year the jam factories bought raspberries, delivered in Melbourne in pails, at l i d . per lb - that is, at the money it cost the growers to pick, cart, and deliver them? 6. Will he, if the officers of the Department have not produced proof by'their inquiries to show that a Combine does not exist, employ experts armed with power to thorough)}' investigate (a), the business relations between the firms alleged to constitute the Combine, and (i) the business relations between the representatives of the jam firms and the Monbulk raspberry growers ? 7. If it be a fact that inquiry has proved that a certain Melbourne produce merchant did in restraint of trade corner the whole of the available raspberry buckets to be procured at Melbourne, Hallarat, and Geelong, and did retail thesaid buckets to the growers at an enormous profit, will the Minister'not proceed against him under .the section of the Anti-Trust Act which provides that any person who monopolizes or attempts to monopolize, or combines or conspires with any person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce with other countries or among the Slates, with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or FACTORY. price of any service, merchandise or commodity, is guilty of an offence?",20
53,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRTCE OF FRUIT AND FRUIT,"In reply to the honourable member, I beg to state that some of the matters referred to seem to be outside the scope of the Commonwealth legislation, but further inquiries will be made. DRAWBACK ON RE-EXPORTED MATERIAL.",20
54,Mr KELLY,PRTCE OF FRUIT AND FRUIT,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether, ' under the following Regulation, drawback will be allowed upon goods, the raw materials of Australian manufacturers, when reexported either in' a more lightly manufactured state or as an ingredient of a locally manufactured article :Regulation No. 130 of the Regulations made under the Customs Act 1901 (Statutory Rules 1904, No. 25), dated 16th June, 1904, is hereby amended to read as follows :130. Drawback of the full amount of duty paid, not exceeding the import duty then payable, shall be allowed on all goods other than spirits, wine, beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, and opium, on the due exportation thereof, either in the original packages or in packages packed in the presence of an officer, provided that goods shipped for drawback in other than original packages are exported within three years from date of importation?",20
55,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRTCE OF FRUIT AND FRUIT,"The ' answer to the honourable member's quest:on is as follows: Drawback is at the present time allowed, under the circumstances mentioned, not under the regulation quoted, but under the following regulation, viz. :Regulation No. 131 of the regulations under . the Customs Act 1901 (Statutory Rules 1904, No. 25), dated 16th June, 1904, which reads- "" As to manufactured articles, a drawback may be allowed on the actual quantity of imported material used in such manufacture to the extent of the duty paid on original importation. Drawback under this regulation shall only be allowed in respect of such material as the Minister may specify by order in the Gazette, and under, such conditions and restrictions as the Minister prescribes in each case."" NA AUSTRALASIA.",20
56,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"the Prime Minister, upon noticer. With reference to previous questions relating to the immigration schemes of Dr Arthur, M.L.A., is it a fact that Dr Arthur has publicly admitted having entered into negotiations to bring about large, separate, and exclusive settlein ments of non-English speaking Russian and Italian aliens in the Commonwealth? 2. Has Dr Arthur, on his own behalf, or as President of the Immigration League .of Australasia, approached his Government in connection with these schemes; and, if so, is there any objection to placing all correspondence relating thereto on the Table of the House? 3. Has any money been granted to Dr Arthur or the Immigration League of Australasia for immigration purposes since the ist November, 1907? 4. In view of the experiences of London and the United States of America in respect of the class of immigrants sought to be brought here, will he state whether his Government favours the . introduction and establishment of non-English speaking settlements in the Commonwealth of the character sought to be promoted by Dr Arthur as disclosed in his published correspondence and public utterances? Mr DEAKIN:-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. I am not aware of any statements made by Dr Arthur on this subject. 2. No. 3. Yes. The Government have paid Â£100 for over-sea work, subject to the production of vouchers showing this expenditure. 4.

57,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"the Minister"" be left representing the Minister of Home upon notice What progress has been made in the negotiations with the States Governments, with a view to preventing duplication of the electoral ma-. chinery of the Commonwealth and States?",21
58,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsArrangements for co-operative action are w e l l ' advanced in the case of Tasmania and Western Australia-negotiation s are proceeding in Queensland-and the Governments of the States of New South Wales and South Australia have been invited to appoint representatives to confer with the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth with a view(a) to considering proposals which will secure the fullest measure of co-operation practicable under the existing State Electoral Acts in the preparation, maintenance, and printing of Rolls; (b) to ascertaining the nature of the legislative action necessary to secure the adoption of joint Rolls. The State of Victoria, in common with the other States, has been subdivided for Commonwealth registration purposes with due regard to State electoral boundaries, and whatever action is practicable on the part of the Commonwealth the furtherance of co-operation will be taken. COMMONWEALTH GAZETTE. Motion (by Mr Webster) agreed toThat there be laid upon the table a Return giving the following information :1. What is the amount spent annually on the production of the Commonwealth Government Gazette t 2. What sum did the Commonwealth expend on Government advertisements and announcements during the .years 1905-7? 3. The amounts paid to the metropolitannewspapers circulating in and .around the several capital cities of the Commonwealthduring the years 1905-7. 4. The amount paid to newspapers circulating in the Commonwealth, other than those named in paragraph 3, during the same years. 5. What is the cost of circulating the CommonwealthGovernment Gazette for the three years named ? 6. What revenue has been received for the sale of the said Gazette during the years 1905-7? SUPPLY (Formal). PROHIBITED CORRESPONDENCE : MESSRS. FREEMAN AND WALLACE. Question-That Mr Speaker do now the chair, and that the House resolve in the itself into Committee of Supply-pro posed. Mr CHANTER ' (Riverina) [3.7] - I move That all the words after the word "" That "" out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof Affairs, the following words :""-1. A Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the statements made to the Postmaster-General, particularly . in connection with the Butts and Short charges against the medical firm. of Freeman and Wallace, and the reasons which caused the Postmaster - General to issue, through the Commonwealth Gazette, instructions addressed to all postal' officials not to deliver any correspondence addressed through the post to the Freeman and Wallace Medical Institute. ' 2. That such Committee have power to send for persons, papers, and records, to take evidence upon oath, to have leave to report the minutes of evidence from time to time, and move from place' to place if found necessary. 3. That such Committee consist of Mr. Archer, Mr Foster, Mr Frazer, Mr. Fuller, and the Mover. I do not think I ought to apologize to the Committee for submitting this amendment, nor do I think an apology is expected. I have previously attempted to bring this matter under the notice of honourable members, but, through unforeseen circumstances, was prevented from doing so. The session is drawing to a close, or so it is believed, and the time at our disposal is limited; and my only object is to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the facts and mete out justice. It is not necessary, nor is it proper, that I should go into the whole of the facts, seeing that I am asking for an inquiry in order that steps may be taken to have justice done to those concerned. my duty, however, to advance some reasons for my opinion that justice has not been done, and to suggest a remedy. When Parliament passed the Post and Telegraph Act, giving the Postmaster General power to act on his own initiative, honourable members thought that an action of such gravity as one involving interference with the liberty of the subject by preventing a business firm from receiving the correspondence of its clients, would not be taken unless approved by the whole Cabinet. Had the action of which I complain been the result of an Executive act, the position would be very different; but I believe that the House, like every other British Assembly, will declare that no punishment shall be meted out to an accused person until he has been given an opportunity to refute the charges brought against him. Quite recently Mr Justice Hood, of the Victorian Bench, laid it down as a principle of law that no person should be punished without trial, and the honourable member for Flinders, in dealing professionally with the case of the Rev. Mr. Gladstone, made a similar statement. Dr Rentoul, too, as recently as yesterday, laid down the dictum that trial should precede punishment. But the Minister has not acted on that maxim. He has been content to act on the statements of one side without giving the firm affected an opportunity to reply to the charges brought against it .",21
59,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Has he difmake ferentiated between this firm and others? M!r. MAUGER - No .,22
60,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,He has stopped itssale correspondence without hearing its reply to the charges made against it.,22
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Has he with it differently from the way in which he has dealt with other firms whose correspondence has been stopped?. - Mr CHANTER - I do not know what has been clone in regard to other firms, though I understand that a number are under the Postmaster-General's review. He acted on statements made to him by the Victorian police. A trap was laid for the firm by certain officials, and. the results put before the Crown Law authorities of Victoria; but, although the State Attorney General and Solicitor-General went carefully into the evidence submitted to them, they found that there was nothing in it to warrant the bringing of a charge of fraudulent practices against the firm. It is Mr Mauger - My honourable friend has not looked at the papers in the case.",22
62,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am prepared to prove what I am saying. If the Minister is always ready to act on ex parte statements, any business firm may be severely injured, if not ruined, through the action of evil-minded persons in making Serious charges against, it . During the .past five months, I , and others, have repeatedlyasked for an inquiry before any tribunal which the Ministermay'appoint, the members of the firm being convinced that such inquiry must lead to the granting of redress. The Minister has refused to grant an inquiry, or to give the firm an opportunity to get relief by going into the law courts ",22
63,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The papers in' the case were laid on the table of the Senate directly that House met after the Christmas adjournment, and the. representative of the Government there said that a motion for the appointment of a committee of inquiry would not be opposed.",22
64,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"This House represents the people, and will see that justice is done to those on the lowest rungs of the ladder as well as to those on the highest. A charge was brought against the firm, twelve or eighteen months ago, by a detective in the ^employment of the Victorian authorities. The - papers in the case were left with him, and he was allowed to take them to his own house-a n unheard-of and unofficial proceeding, I am authorized to the statement that before these papers were submitted to the Postmaster-General, through the police, they were offered for to the firm in a manner amounting to an attempt to levy blackmail-the promise being made that if they were bought the dealt whole matter would be hushed up.",22
65,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,B y whom were the papers offered ?,22
66,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,B y an individual whom the firm is prepared to bring before of cases a committee of inquiry. ,22
67,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No . When the firm refused to be blackmailed, the papers-o n which the Crown Law authorities of Victoria had refused to take action-were sent to the Postmaster-General. I shall not go into the merits of the case, resting my claim for an inquiry upon the position that redress should not be refused to any one claiming it from the highest Court in the land. I shall not refer to what was behind the application to the Postmaster-General. v may know nothing about it, though I know something of the facts. I merely ask that justice shall be done. I am sorry that, the leader of the Opposition is not present today, because he is with me in this matter, and would have supported the motion for a committee of inquiry. All I ask is . that a committee be appointed to take evidence from all parties, and to report to the House. If such a report is made, and the firm is freed of the charges brought against it, so much the better; while if it is proved that the charges were justified, I shall not attempt to shield it from punishment. I hope honourable members will recognise the justice of my plea. A decision of the High Court prevents the firm from going to law for redress, and, therefore, Parliament should give it an opportunity to vindicate itself. Postmaster-General took action, he has had the opinion of three medical experts- Mr ' Wilkinson, the public analyst of Victoria; Mr Churchill, the President of the Analysts' Society; and Dr Amess, recently house surgeon to the Melbourne Hospital ; while three great legal luminariesMessrs. Purves, Coldham, and Duffy-hav e expressed the opinion that he acted wrongly, and that the firm should not have been punished as it has been. In the light of this evidence there will be no loss of dignity if the Minister retires from his position, and I hope that he will do so, and permit a full and exhaustive inquiry by a committee of the House. Mr THOMAS BROW N [3.35] - The matter which the honourable member for Riverina has brought forward is so. important that the House should be taken,, to some extent, into the confidence of the Postmaster-General. The Minister should inform honourable members of the grounds on which he took this drastic action. It must be recognised that in clothing the Postmaster-General with these extensive powers, Parliament intended that they should be exercised only when regard for the public welfare absolutely rendered it necessary to do so. They certainly ought not to be indiscriminately employedj because of some complaint against persons trading in the Commonwealth. The Postmaster-General, in dealing with such cases, should exercise the greatest caution, and satisfy himself before using his far-reaching powers that he will be able to present to the House reasons that are amply sufficient to justify his action. I He do not propose to discuss the merits of this case; but I hold that' if the Postmaster-General took action on what he believed were sufficient grounds, the House should be so informed, in order that it may be able to deal fairly wifh the complaints of this firm. Possibly there lies behind the question a very grave issue. We know that the business in which this firm is engaged is of a peculiarly delicate character, involving the private domestic concerns of various sections of the community. It may treat its, clients in a proper wav, and conduct its business on the 1 ines indicated by the honourable member for Riverina; but, on the other hand, in connection with such a business, unprincipled men could blackmail those having relations with them. If the Postmaster-General took action after mature Since the consideration, he must' have had submitted to him evidence showing that this firm was not conducting a clean, honest business, and that it was not' in the interests of the community that it should be permitted to utilize the postal conveniences of the Commonwealth to forward its interests. If that is so, then the tribunal which the honourable member for Riverina desires to be appointed could not properly sift out the facts. Mr CHANTER. - The Government will not let this firm go to the Court. It desired to do so.",23
68,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"In connection with some businesses of this description there is, unquestionably, a state of affairs (Calare) that should not be tolerated. I am not prepared to say whether, in this case, the Postmaster-General was right or wrong, but I am satisfied that a Select Committee of this House would not be competent to thoroughly investigate the issues involved, and to place the whole of the facts clearly and properly before this House.",23
69,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,There is no other tribunal to which the matter could be submitted.,23
70,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am not sure that there is no other tribunal to which this investigation could be delegated. a, Select Committee be appointed, it will be prepared to receive evidence on both sides. The fact that the persons primarily concerned do a . large business through the Post Office, implies that their clients are distributed all over the Commonwealth. Whilst' the members of that firm would be able to place their case in a most plausible way before the Committee, how would it be possible to bring before that Committee evidence as to any injury or injustice done by it? It seems to me that the case for the firm would go by default if the Committee were unable to thoroughly investigate the facts, and that a grave injustice might be done to a very large section of the community. result of its findings, this firm, as well as others, might be licensed to inflict an injustice upon many people. It is in this regard that I think that the honourable member for Riverina's proposals are weak. He must recognise how difficult it would be to obtain evidence on the other side, so as to place the House in a position to judge this case, and others of a similar kind,' upon their merits. At the same time, I should not deny a fair investigation to the firm. Every individual against whom' a charge is made should have an opportunity to meet and repudiate that charge. is a sacred right.",23
71,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is all that is asked for.,24
72,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"To that' extent, I am with the honourable member, unless the Postmaster-General can show that a thorough investigation has been made, and that the persons concerned have been given facilities to meet the charges made against them. The firm should certainly - have an opportunity to clear its reputation. At the same time, I desire to avoid' the[ possibility of a tribunal being appointed of such a character, that instead of arriving at a true understanding of the position it might, unconsciously, lead to a big injustice being done to the community generally, and to unprincipled firms being allowed to continue, a business which is absolutely disgraceful.",24
73,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No one desires to hold such firms.,24
74,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am sure that the honourable member would not. To get at the true inwardness of the matter we need to appoint a Commission! with power to take evidence wherever it may be If offered, and to make a searching investigation. If in order, - I should like to move an amendment providing, that the words ""Select Committee"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Royal Commission."" The matter is of such importance that a Commission consisting of one individual, or of several, thoroughly competent to deal with it, should be appointed in the interests of those who complain, as well as of the general public, who are liable to be subjected to injustice and blackmail by persons carrying on a business of this very delicate description.",24
75,Mr MATHEWS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Would the honourable member say that the Commission'should As the consist only of medical men?,24
76,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I should throw upon the Government the responsibility of determining the number and the qualifications of the Commissioners. They are responsible. They initiated this trouble by taking the action which - they have taken. If they are justified in resisting the proposal of the honourable member for Riverina they should be prepared to grant, not a partial investigation, which might lead to a serious miscarriage of justice, but an inquiry which would sift this matter to the very bottom. I desire to' That move That the words "" Select Committee"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""Royal Commission.""",24
77,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I would remind the honourable member that the question now before the Chair is that the words that the ! t Speaker do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply "" be left out of the motion. Until that matter has been decided no other proposal can be made.",24
78,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Hunter) [3.41] - I confess that I find myself in a difficult position in regard to the attitude which I should adopt towards the motion of the honourable member for Riverina. Here is a firm which professes to treat persons medically. As the result of certain evidence which has been brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General, he has decided that an embargo shall be placed upon all correup- spondence addressed to that firm.  Commonwealth upon whose correspondence a prohibition has-been imposed?",24
79,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am surprised that the honourable member should endeavour to throw me off the track. I may tell him that I hold no brief for either side. I am merely anxious to see that justice is done in this particular case. Mr ""PAGE - Is the honourable member unbiased ?",24
80,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am, as far as it is possible for any person to be unbiased who has had a similar experience to my own. Only the other day I heard a legal luminary declare that it was very difficult for any man' to be unbiased, because his experience naturally inclined him either one way or the other. In the present instance, the action of a particular firm has been called into question by the Postmaster-General. The course which he has pursued may be either right or wrong. The honourable member for Riverina has submitted a motion with a view to righting the injustice to which he considers the firm in question has been subjected. I have nothing to say as to the conduct of that firm. I know nothing concerning it beyond that which I have gleaned from advertisements which I have read in the newspapers. It is true that'a member of the firm endeavoured to interview me upon one or two occasions, but I declined to see him, because I desired to be able to deal with this question without any bias whatever - I am quite prepared - to support any inquiry into the action of the Postmaster-General which is likely to be a thorough and satisfactory one. But I ask honourable members to consider whether the proposal of trie honourable member for Riverina, if adopted, is likely to result in such an inquiry? In the first place, he merely proposes the appointment of a Select Committee, which has no powei to take evidence upon oath.",25
81,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Committee can empowered by the House to take evidence upon oath.,25
82,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the Committee cannot put witnesses upon their oath, it will be of no value whatever.",25
83,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"-That is what'I think. . Further, the business carried on by this particular firm is of such a character that it would be very difficult to induce witnesses to come forward and give evidence which might bring disgrace upon themselves, upon their wives and families. Mr THOMAS BRowN.^That is the great safeguard of blackmailers in this business.",25
84,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I - do not know tives whether the honourable member alludes to this particular firm in that way. Mr THOMAS BROWN.:- I do not.,25
85,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I repeat that I know nothing of the firm beyond the fact that it has advertised in a certain way. A firm which would advertise in that way is not one with which I should care to be associated. - Mr WILSON - It is not one with, which the honourable member would be connected.",25
86,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is not one with which I could be connected and still consider myself a member of an honourable profession. I do not think it necessary to go into details in respect of the nature of the business which this firm apparently carries on. No medical men with any experience can be ignorant of the fact that persons have suffered untold injury as the result of illegitimate practice of the character suggested. Another ' objection which I would urge to the proposal under consideration relates to the personnel of the Committee which the honourable member for Riverina desires. That Committee includes the names of the honourable member for Illawarra and the honourable member' for Capricornia-bot h of whom sit upon this side of the House-the honourable member for . Kalgoorlie, the honourable member for New England, and the honourable member for Riverina, who sit upon' the opposite sideof the Chamber. I do not think that such a Committee constitutes a well-balanced selection of the members of this House. Personally, I should like to see a somewhat larger Committee appointed, and I think that it ought to include the names of one-or two members of the medical profession who are also members of the House. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Riverina did be not include members of the medical profession in his proposal. Quite recently, when the City Coroner proposed to sit alone upon an inquest into the Sunshine railway accident, we know 'that public feeling was aroused to such an extent - that persons with technical knowledge were selected as a jury to assist him in his investigations.",25
87,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"In that case, the jury is composed of business men, and persons or with expert knowledge are being called to give evidence.",25
88,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is a specially selected jury, comprising the representaof various parties. I think it strange that the honourable member for Riverina did not select at least one medical man as a member of his proposed Committee.",25
89,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I asked the leader of the honourable member's party to nominate two honourable members from the opposite side of the House.,26
90,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Ha d the honourable member been earnest in his request, he would not have experienced any difficulty in that connection. I was never given the option of refusing a seat upon the Committee.  would not support any Committee appointed from this side of the Chamber.",26
91,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I am not for a moment opposing an investigation into this particular matter. It is only right that the firm accused should be given fair play.,26
92,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is all that we ask.,26
93,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the complaint of this firm were properly investigated, I think that it would effectively settle a great many other similar cases. At the same time, I cannot support a Committee of the character' proposed.",26
94,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Would the honourable member support the appointment of a Royal Commission?,26
95,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Government'will not appoint a Royal Commission.,26
96,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"To a certain extent, my sympathies are with the Postmaster General. He has to administer the Act, and I desire to extend to him all the support that I reasonably can.",26
97,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This is no party question in that sense.,26
98,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is no party question, but it is a question which has been brought to such a stage by the action of the honourable member for Riverina that it ought to be investigated. As I say, however, I am altogether opposed to the method of investigation suggested. . Mr Mauger (Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3.56]-- I shall avoid as far as possible traversing my previous remarks, and confine my reply to the observations made this afternoon by the - honourable member for Riverina. In the first place, I desire the House to distinctly understand, once and for all, that I have in no way discriminated. Up to the time the prohibition was made, this was the first case of the kind brought under my notice. Let me 'say, in passing, that during - last week a considerable number of cases came up, and are now awaiting my consideration and decision; and I take it that, if a Select Committee be now appointed, there will be demands for a .Committee on each of the other prohibitions. Next, I desire to make it clear that neither in this case nor in any other case of prohibitionand there have been man)'-hav e I taken any initial steps to seek them out, or to have them sought out for me; they have been brought under my notice in such a way that they had to be dealt with, and I dealt with them, as I believed, conscientiously. . As I say, I have been charged with discriminating, but every case has been dealt with in order, and has beenbrought under my notice by the officials.  dealt with, except the gambling cases?",26
99,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Othe r cases of a similar kind are waiting to be dealt with, but this was the first of its nature - brought under my notice.",26
100,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Are those othercases to have the benefit of special committees of inquiry ?,26
101,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That will depend on Parliament.,26
102,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They show the greater need for the 'appointment of a Royal Commission.,26
103,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Government under the Postal Act has been' intrusted with certain powers.,26
104,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The Minister, not the Government, and there is too much power.",26
105,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That may be. I am not discussing the merits or demerits of the particular power, but merely stating the fact that the Minister has been intrusted with it.",26
106,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is a dangerous - power. Mr Mauger.'- I shall admit that for the sake of argument, but I think the honourable member will agree that the Minister, having been intrusted with the administration of the Act, would be unworthy of his position unless he did what he believed to be right.",26
107,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But I think he might take the precaution of hearing evidence on the other side before giving his judgment.,26
108,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That is a. matter of opinion, and I am so satisfied that my action was warranted, that I am prepared to take all responsibility for it.",26
109,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Still , the Postmaster General heard one side only.",26
110,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That is a statement that I am not prepared to either deny or affirm at this juncture. I . submit that the step I took was, in my judgment, fully warranted. The papers were submitted to me through the Chief Commissioner of Police, on the minuted recommendation of the Crown Prosecutor, who stated that he could not recommend the State authorities to prosecute, not because he did not consider there was a strong case, but because it was necessary to prosecute an individual, as he could not prosecute a firm.",26
111,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"For what? M!r. MAUGER - For fraudulent practices; and, hot being able to find out the individual, the Crown Law authorities recommended that what they considered a strong case should be sent on to the Federal authorities to be dealt with under the powers of the Postal Act. I sent all the papers to the Commonwealth Crown Law officers, and got their opinion; and after considering the. matter over and over again, and fortifying my opinion by consultation with the Prime Minister, I arrived at the decision which is now under discussion. But the House should remember that I showed plainly I had nothing to hide. Immediately another place commenced its sittings I placed the whole of the papers on the table there; and every opportunity has been afforded from then t i ll now for the appointment of a Select Committee if so desired. Moreover, every opportunity has been taken by the firm interested to endeavour to get a Select Committee appointed* but without success. However, I do not propose to go into the merits or the demerits of the case, but mere!)' to state that my action was in accordance with my judgment and conscience.",27
112,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Does the Postmaster-General approve of the appointment of a Select Committee?,27
113,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I shall deal with that matter presently. It would have been much easier for me to put the papers on one side and pigeon-hole them; that would have saved me no end of personal worry and trouble with letters, interviews, and threatenings of boycotting, such as, I am sure, it would be difficult for honourable members to realise.",27
114,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If that be so, it . on the papers. only proves that the matter requires thorough investigation.",27
115,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That is a matter of opinion. Honourable, members should bear in mind that this is not the first time that similar action has been taken against this firm, because, as a matter of fact, their correspondence is prohibited in New Zealand.",27
116,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Not on a charge of this kind.,27
117,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The prohibition in New Zealand is on account of the character of their general business.,27
118,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No .,27
119,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Does the honourable member deny the fact that this firm's correspondence is prohibited in - New Zealand ?,27
120,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is prohibited, as that of every other medical institute' is there, for advertising.",27
121,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I say that the correspondence of this firrii is prohibited in New Zealand on account of the character of its business.,27
122,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Every i other advertising firm of the kind is prohibited in New Zealand.,27
123,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I have been urged to prohibit the correspondence of every other similar firm, and I have pointed out that as soon as similar papers are placed before me, and I am satisfied in the same way as in this case, I shall prohibit the correspondence, leaving the House to deal with me as they think fit.",27
124,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,It would be doing a lasting good to the community.,27
125,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member for Riverina quoted Mr Duffy and some other gentlemen very high in the legal profession. But the honourable member might have quoted another gentleman who has also given an opinion, and, further, he should have stated that the opinions he did quote were formed on a case submitted by the people interested. .",27
126,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,It was formed on the papers with which the Postmaster-General clealt.,27
127,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No ; it was formed on a case submitted by the people interested- a case which I read and re-read and submitted to the Crown Law authorities, and I am confirmed by our legal officers in the' opinion that it was not relevant to the matter.",27
128,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The opinion was founded,27
129,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It was founded on ex parte statements by the people ir .^rested, and hence was of no value whatc ir. The attitude of the Government in rega d to the matter is that if.the House choose* to take the responsibility of appointing i Select Committee, and thus opening the door to claims for Select Committees in m: ny other similar cases-whic h must arise ir I continue to hold office, because I shall i^eal with every one as quickly and conscient ously as I can-if the House chooses to accept the motion with the amendment which has been indicated, the Government will abide by that decision.",27
130,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But this motion is a direct attack on the honourable gentleman's administration.,28
131,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Undoubtedl y it is.,28
132,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Then surely the Government will not accept it with or without, an amendment ?",28
133,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am now stating the position. The Prime Minister is strongly of opinion that this House, which is the only tribunal that can review this particular action, should not ha denied the right, if it thinks fit, to review it .",28
134,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Surely we have not altogether jettisoned responsible government ?,28
135,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Prime Minister is apparently inviting the House to pass a vote of want of confidence in the Postmaster General.,28
136,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I have stated the position taken up by the Government. I certainly shall not vote for the appointment of the proposed Committee.,28
137,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Can master-General say whether the Government are supporting this motion?,28
138,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"In a previous discussion the Prime Minister said he'certainly would not support such a motion, but I cannot say whether or not any individual member of the Government intends to support it.",28
139,Mr THOMAS BROW,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What is the Postmaster-General going to do?,28
140,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am not going to support the proposal. The Government leave the matter entirely to the House. Mr W. H - IRVINE (Flinders) [4.7] I was prepared to agree entirely with the Postmaster-General until I heard the extraordinary announcement he made at the close of his remarks. We have a Minister of the Crown stating that, when a motion of this sort is proposed, asking the House to appoint a Select Committee to investigate the performance of a purely administrative act-a n act of discretionby him, the - Government have practically decided to accept it, if it be coupled with a slight amendment that somewhat. enlarges its scope. have not yet, I think, arrived at the stage of adopting a system of elective Ministries, or any system, other than that on which we, and every other British community, have hitherto carried on responsible government. I have always hitherto understood that one of the essential elements of the .system of government under which we live, and under which our political life has been evolved, it that when there is an attack on the administration of any Minister, not only can the Minister not lie. clown under it , or accept it, with or without an amendment, but the Government are absolutely obliged to support the Minister, or to tell him that his administration is such that he cannot be supported, and decline to accept the proposal irrespective of any amendment. - Mr DEAKIN - Does the honourable member call this a matter of administration?",28
141,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Absolutely ; and that is the point to which I propose to direct attention. This Parliament made provision in the Postal Act-whethe r wisely or unwisely it is not for us now to discuss or determine-vestin g in the Postmaster General a discretion. In my opinion, it was'a very wise discretion, whereby, without having any trial, if he laecame convinced that the machinery of the Post Office was being used for immoral, improper, or scandalous purposes, he could step in and, without inflicting any ptinishment, refuse to the Postallow the Department to be so used.",28
142,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is very different from the pleading of the honourable member in the Gladstone case the other day in court.,28
143,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am not now dealing with the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Riverina. Those arguments have been sufficiently answered, and I have nothing to do with them; so far as that aspect of the case'is concerned, my "" withers are unwrung."" I am now dealing with the amazing position taken, up by the Postmaster-General, who says that when his act is challenged the Government are prepared to accept the motion provided there be an amendment which somewhat enlarges its scope. The Prime> Minister asked me whether this was an act of administration. When a Minister of the Crown is given by Parliament discretion in the ordinary control and management of his Department,' and allowed to say how its services may be used, is not the exercise of that discretion, by prohibiting their use for the spreading We of .scandalous matter, in all respects an administrative act similar to any other?",28
144,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Distinctl y no.,28
145,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,How is it suggested that such an act differs from any other administrative act?,28
146,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"This is an act of adjudimaster-General, cation which carries with it no right, on the part of an aggrieved party to appeal.",29
147,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"There is the right to appeal to Parliament against the administrative act of any Minister, and Parliament can say that it does not approve of what has been, done. That is the only appeal.",29
148,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then every case must be tried on the floor of the House.,29
149,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No ; but when the action of a Minister intrusted with the responsibility of administering a Department is questioned, the challenge cannot be made in the courts of law. Unless you do away with the whole basis of responsible government, it must be made in Parliament. The only appeal is to Parliament, when wrong is alleged to have been done by an act of administration. I am not aware, in any community under responsible government, of any other appeal, from the exercise of his discretion by a .Minister which has done wrong to an individual, than that provided in the right of every member of Parliament to ask the House to condemn the Minister's action. I challenge the Prime Minister to bring forward any case to the contrary. For. my part, I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General's action was justified by the facts of the case, and I was entirely with him until I heard his extraordinary statement, which showed his attitude and that of the Ministry to be subversive of the very principle of responsible government.",29
150,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"(Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.14] - On this question I hold an opinion quite opposed td that just expressed by the honourable and learned member for Flinders. When Parliament conferred upon a Minister charged with the control of a Department power, without consulting the Cabinet, to take action which may affect the prosperitv, and even the solvency of any private business or private citizen, it took an unusual step, and one difficult to parallel, though it might be to some extent illustrated by the powers conferred in other Acts. A decision such as that of the Postmaster-General can be taken at any time, whether Parliament is or is in session, and it is in its essence judicial.",29
151,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then is it not to responsibility ? be exercised until both parties have been heard ?,29
152,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It may be so exercised. A number of judicial acts are done on cx parte representations,' and the PostCommittee under certain circumstances, might have to act upon practically ex parte representation. But the fact that the act is really judicial place's on the Minister the responsibility of hearing both sides, whenever that is possible. In this case he has done so, and I , being acquainted with all the facts, agree that he has acted rightly.",29
153,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"How does.it differ from an ordinary administrative act? Mr DEAKIN,-The contention of the honourable and learned member for Flinders, who endorses the action of the Postmaster General, seems to be that when a citizen of this country who considers that he has been wronged by that action comes to this House, which is the only tribunal available to him",29
154,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If,wronge d by administrative act.",29
155,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable and learned member declines to make a distinction between this and other administrative acts. But I draw a broad distinction. There have been numerous cases in which a House recognising the impossibility, without undue expenditure of time, of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion, has appointed Committees or Boards to inquire for it into matters with which 'it was competent to deal without such reference.",29
156,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Does the honourable' member speak of inquiries as to the right or wrong of an administrative act?,29
157,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Yes ; especially when the consequences of such an act may have been to deprive of one of the greatest necessities of civilization the humblest citizen in the land, or to strike a blow at the founda- tions of one of its greatest commercial institutions, by cutting it off from post and telegraph communication. .",29
158,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Would not the Minister wha did such a thing be cut off from the Ministry ?,29
159,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The Minister must take that course when he thinks it right to do so. The question . is whether there is an appeal, and, if so, to what court? The only appeal is to Parliament.",29
160,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,May we have a Committee to inquire into every act of adnot judication by. the Minister of Trade and Customs without imperilling his position or,29
161,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I do not recognise the analogy as complete.,29
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Would the Prime. Minister allow the appointment of a Selectto inquire into the case of every person who alleged that he had been aggrieved by the action of the Postmaster General ?,29
163,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I cannot answer more than one question at a time. Replying to the honourable and learned member for Flinders, I say that while there have been important Customs cases in which the transactions challenged have stretched over long periods, in everv such instance there is a right to appeal to the courts of law. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - There is no appeal from the determination of the, Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to matters left to his discretion.",30
164,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"They are minor matters ; every decision of consequenceis subj e c t to appeal to the courts. case the appeal must be to Parliament. The courts are closed to the complaint. the proposition of the honourable member for Riverina impugned the authority of Parliament or the responsibility of the Ministry, no one would be more prompt than I to resent it. The Postmaster-General in no way withdraws from his position. He states that he is satisfied'that he has acted justly.",30
165,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The motion is deliberate attack upon him.,30
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is he'personally in favour of the appointment of a Committee?,30
167,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the amendment which has been suggested is made, he will be content to leave the case to the adjudication of his fellow members, who by reading the papers and calling evidence, will have an opportunity to satisfy themselves whether he has done justice between the citizen and the State:",30
168,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Postmaster-General says that he will vote against the proposal for a Committee. Mr Mauger.:-No .,30
169,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"-He stated that would not vote for it , and that he would not vote against it.",30

172,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is he going to walk of the Chamber when the vote is taken ?,30
173,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Yes . I said so when the question came before the House last side. night.,30
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,He will not vote for the Committee?,30
175,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Certainl y not. I am prepared to justify his position. If any one be at fault in this matter, it is I . I - was suddenly appealed to by the honourable member for Riverina to grant a Select Committee. As the case could not be tried on the floor of the House, since details must be entered into which should not be published in Hansard, or made the subject of general report, and questions dealt with on the evidence of experts",30
176,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The Prime Minister's argument is leading to this: that whenever the administration of the Government is attacked, a Select Committee must be appointed.",30
177,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I fail to see that that But in this statement contains more than the soupcon of truth necessary to justify its utterance If In unnumbered cases, it does not apply. I ask the House to consider whether this great power, gravely affecting the commercial stability of any of our citizens, ought to be exercised by a Minister without a right of appeal.",30
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Then , should not provision be made in the Act for an appeal ? a",30
179,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That is another matter. We have to deal with the position, as it exists. At. present there is no right of appeal except to Parliament.",30
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I take it that the Prime Minister will propose later on to give the right of appeal in these cases.,30
181,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No other right of appeal is needed today, since Parliament can * select members, who can take evidence-if necessary in private-and report, so that it may take advised action. What will be the position of this House when a Committee of its members has reported on this case? If the report discloses that the Postmaster General has acted unjustly, he and the Government are prepared to answer for it. he If the. Committee find that the inquiry which the Postmaster-General undertook in this connection was not sufficient to justify Posthis action - In what way?",30
182,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Committee will,30
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No charge has out been made against the Postmaster-General from this side of the House.,30
184,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No r from any other,30
185,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,A.direc t charge of unfairness against the Minister is the basis of this proposal.,30
186,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The charge against the Minister is that he has committed an error of judgment.,31
187,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Hear , hear.",31
188,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I listened to the opening remarks of the honourable member for Riverina, and did not hear any charge of unfairness.",31
189,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I make no such charge against the Postmaster-General. say that there has been an error of judgnient on his part.,31
190,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The charge is that an error of judgment of the most serious consequence to the persons concerned has been committed by the Postmaster-General. Even if persons stepped from a prison to be tried, who were known to have been guilty of nefarious practices for which they had already been punished, they would be entitled to a fair trial.",31
191,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,And if there has been an error of judgment on the part of the Postmaster-General the Ministry are to get off.,31
192,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They deserve to get off if the error of judgment is shown to be an honest one.,31
193,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What ! Are they to be relieved of their responsibility to this House by saying that they have simply been guilty of an error of judgment?,31
194,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No .,31
195,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Has the honourable member for Flinders ever made a mistake?,31
196,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I have, and have taken the consequences.",31
197,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am just showingand apparently Ghowing too clearly to please some honourable members-that no reduction of Government responsibility is involved in this, regard. What has the Government done ? It has said that the decision of this question rests with the Parliament - We are so fearless of consequences, so satisfied that the action taken by the Postmaster-General will be upheld, that - we offer no opposition to the appoint-^ ment of a Select Committee upon such terms and conditions as will permit of a thorough examination of all the facts.",31
198,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then why not vote for the appointment of a Select Committee?.,31
199,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Because I think it best for the Government to take no part whatever. We have come to a conclusion and are prepared to take the consequencesplained of .our action.,31
200,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Do the Government intend not to vote, but to walk out of the House when we proceed to a division?",31
201,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Certainly . I said io on the last occasion.,31
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then I think we. shall all walk out with the honourable member.,31
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"And the House I simply will be counted out. - Mr DEAKIN - The honourable member may regard this as a fit subject for merriment, but I feel it to be a very serious problem. If the course taken by the Government is not fair and reasonable, we wait for it to be impugned. Will any honourable member venture to say that, a judicial and severely punitive action having been taken, the Government could deal with the case more frankly, fairly, and openly than by trusting to the judgment of the House to appoint, or to decline to . appoint, a Committee to review the action of the Minister and to report?",31
204,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Do I understand that all the members of the Government will retire when the vote is taken ?,31
205,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is my proposal.,31
206,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Let us all go.,31
207,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Certainl y not.,31
208,Mr ARCHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Supposin g the Select Committee condemns the action of the Postmaster-General ? ',31
209,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,We shall be prepared to accept the responsibility. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Then we are to have a want of confidence motion suspended until the Committee reports its findings ?,31
210,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"My honourable friend is - introducing into the discussion technicalities that are almost trifling, which make neither for justice nor for constitutional principle.",31
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The firm have at their disposal today every avenue of justice.,31
212,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They have none except that which this House chooses to grant.,31
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Government by its own action could remove the suspension tomorrow if it chose to do so.,31
214,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We do not choose to do so. We say that our action has been properly taken. When it is challenged, instead of making an appeal to honourable members to support us, whether we are right or wrong, ,we say .that since the act comof was a judicial one from' which there is no appeal, except to Parliament, we are prepared to submit to the judgment of Parliament in this regard when honourable members shall have qualified themselves, as my honourable colleague has done, by a full and searching examination into all the circumstances, to deal with the case.",31
215,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is the Prime Minister satisfied with the personnel of the proposed Select Committee?,32
216,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I have nothing to do with its composition. It will be for the House to satisfy itself oh that point before appointing the Committee.,32
217,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am not satisfied with - Mr DEAKIN - So far as the Government are concerned the members of the proposed Committee may be selected by ballot. The Government has no interest in the personnel of the Committee. Its only desire is that it shall be such as will satisfy the House that a just and complete inquiry will lie made. The nature of the charges is such that they cannot be debated in this House, and evidence upon them should not be taken in public. They require to be dealt with in an exceptional fashion.",32
218,Mr ARCHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,And provision should have been made for the investigation of such charges in some other wav.,32
219,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If it had, I should have been saved the personal responsibility of improvising this means of'dealing with what is, at all events in my political experience, an entirely novel situation.",32
220,Mr ARCHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The case is to be dealt with in a sketchy sort of way. just as other matters have been dealt with ?,32
221,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is to be dealt with in the only way possible to meet the emergency, and when there is no time to do anything else. I concur that this power should be vested in the Postmaster-General and with his exercise of it, but I certainly cannot concur in a proposal to shut the door to a reasonable appeal on the part Of a citizen of the Commonwealth who believes that by the exercise of that power the Postmaster-General has done him a serious wrong. There should be a reasonable appeal against a decision that might involve the person concerned in heavy pecuniary loss. The case not being one that can be debated in this House, nor one that should be debated here even with closed doors, it must, like many others, be referred to a Select Committee, in whom the House has confidence, with a view to evidence being taken privately, and a report upon the merits being presented. But this Committee [403] will not merely report on the merits of the case. If it were to stop there it would be insufficient. In reporting on the merits of the case it will criticise, either directly or indirectly, the action of the Minister concerned, and I - repeat that for that action the Government accepts entire responsibility.",32
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the Select Committee decides that the suspension must ""be lifted, will the Postmaster-General and his colleagues allow the firm in question .to continue to avail itself of the postal service for the purposes of its business, although they it. believe as they do now that their action was justified? Are the Government goirig to surrender their judgment to the Select Committee ?",32
223,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the Committee recommends that the suspension be removed it will be the duty of the Postmaster-General to advise his colleagues regarding the new evidence laid before them. If that evidence satisfies him that the suspension should be removed he will make'a recommendation to that effect to the Cabinet. If it does not satisfy him he will make the opposite recommendation, and the Government takes the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the finding of the Select Committee. Although the Committee will be appointed as a Court of Appeal from the decision of the Minister, the responsibility of accepting or rejecting its finding will rest first Upon Ministers and then upon the House.",32
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,How can this Committee be a Court of Appeal if there is to be no finality ?,32
225,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,There will be finality.,32
226,Mr ARCHER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then its finding may or may not be a motion of want of confidence.,32
227,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I have leplied to that point.,32
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is the Committee to be a Court of Appeal whose decision can be reviewed by Ministers?,32
229,Mr DEAKTN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Yes. We cannot and ought not, according to constitutional principle, to escape responsibility for our action, and we are not escaping responsibility for action in this matter by accepting a Committee revision.",32
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Select Committee is to be not a Court of Appeal but merely a Court of Inquiry.,32
231,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,We can never have constituted by Parliament a Court of Appeal in the full and final judicial sense. The hcnorable member has correctly described the Committee as a Court of Inquiry.,32
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Why should not the Government support their own decision by voting against the appointment of a Select Committee ?,33
233,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Because we should then be voting in our own case as judges of our own cause. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Then the Minister recognises that the Government are being attacked in this matter? ,33
234,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It seems to me that in an important matter of this kind, a citizen of the Commonwealth ought to be entitled to challenge the action of the responsible Minister without at the same, time com [Del ling the Government to shut the door against' an inquiry by members of Parliament, to whom he can appeal, liecause the finding might affect their political position. - Sir JOHN FORREST - Is this not a new and a dangerous proposal on the part of the Government ?",33
235,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is a new development of an .old principle. The right honourable member may say that it is dangerous, but every new development is to some extent.",33
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Why should not the Government defend themselves?,33
237,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,We have nothing defend.,33
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Government should vote against this motion.,33
239,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If we did, we should possibly prevent an inquiry.",33
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Has there been no inquiry by Ministers?,33
241,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Yes ; there has been an not want one? inquiry by the Postmaster-General, who recommended a certain course of action. He took the responsibility of his act, and we were satisfied with his judgment.",33
242,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then the Ministry support the action of the Postmaster-General?,33
243,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I have said so.',33
244,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Has the Ministry no confidence in its own decision?,33
245,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,It has absolute consponsibility fidence in it.,33

247,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I ask the honourable member, if he has not parted' with his elemotion was submitted. mentary sense of justice, to say whether it would be fair for us, because we have .that his quip ,does not apply. formed an opinion in this case, to use whatever power and influence we possess to prevent a further inquiry?",33
248,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Certainly . Mr W. H. IRVINE - The Government, should certainly support their own decision.",33
249,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They should either oppose or support the proposal to appoint a Select Committee. Prime,33
250,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member may think so.; I hold a different view. We should never close the door to the complaint of any citizen who believes that he has been done an injury under an Act of Parliament. When such a complaint is made, it appears to me to be magnanimous, and outside of politics would be at once treated as magnanimous-althoug h I hesitate to apply that word to any action .of' the Ministry-for the Government to step aside and to say, "" We throw open to you a Court of Justice. We do not even appear to plead against you. We are content with the papers disclosing the facts on which we took action, and are prepared to leave them to the judgment of the House."" - Mr SAMPSON - It is a magnanimity that is calculated to destroy the principle of responsible government.",33

253,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,At once.,33
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Supposin g we do,33
255,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Then the right honourable member should vote against the motion.,33

257,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"On the contrary, by its action, the Government leaves the refor its action where it is content that it should rest, with the Governnot ment itself. No vote of the House refusan inquiry will relieve my honourable colleague from the responsibility of the action taken - by him months before this In the circumstances, my right - honourable friend will see We have taken the responsibility for our action. thing that we can do will relieve us of that responsibility.",33

I admit that the course which we propose to take is a new one; but, so far from being unconstitutional, it is within the bounds of constitutionality, since it does not reduce our ultimate responsibility one iota. leaves this House free to appoint any Select Committee that it may choose to inquire into a Ministerial action into which we are not only willing to permit inquiry, but actually invite it . Although it is a new departure, and one which I was called upon to take upon the spur of the moment, when this matter was brought forward, upon further consideration, I see no other course open to us. We have either to refuse an inquiry altogether or to postpone it indefinitely until the Post and Telegraph Act has been amended, or to take [403]- 2 Nothe course that we propose. Of the only three courses open to us, that which I have outlined is the least objectionable. It cer-' is one which exposes us to the greatest risk of independent criticism",34
269,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"What risk is there? TVIr. DEAKIN - The risk of having an inquiry made by honourable members whom this House may select who will look into this case, and make any recommendations enor comment upon Ministerial action that they may choose. Sir JOHN FORREST.^-We need not adopt their recommendations.",34

271,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We must ""be content to act right, no ' matter how our action may be viewed. Of the three courses available, I ask honourable members to point me to a fairer one than to allow Parliament-whic h is the high court of justice in this, country to which every citizen has the right of appeal-to decide this matter, and for the Ministry to put what it considers to be right first, and what it regards as constitutionally a new departure, second. 1 do not think that this is the best means that can be devised for dealing with such cases. I am of opinion that subsequently the House should be invited to supplement its own machinery in this connection. That ought not to be dealt with as a party matter.",34
272,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"But , by his action, the It Prime Minister, is making this a party matter,",34
273,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I am merely pointing out that the Government are content to allow this matter to be decided by the House. Surely that is not making the question a party one.,34
274,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Government are not taking up a proper attitude when they decline to record their votes upon this proposal.,34
275,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We take a proper part when we abstain from voting upon it , see-' ing thatour votes might prove the determining factor in refusing a hearing to a firm which in the absence of our votes would be accorded that hearing.",34
276,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What about the opinions of the people outside ?,35
277,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They are reflected in this House.,35
278,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I am referring to opinion of the Prime Minister's constituents.,35
279,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am perfectly prepared to answer to my constituents. The step proposed to be taken by the Government is new. I know of no case in my parliamentary experience which has presented similar features' or demanded similar action. In order to meet the position at once we have improvised a course of action which I believe to be essentially just to the person complaining, and also just to those who are inclined upon the facts known to uphold the action of the Government. Jt is unjust to no person, and is not unconstitutional in any sense. Ministers are prepared to welcome the appointment of any Committee of Inquiry, no matter how searching it may be, and when that Committee reports they will accept full responsibility for dealing with its recommendations as they have accepted it for their past actions.",35
280,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Parkes) [4.48]. - I had no intention of speaking upon this matter until it assumed a very grave aspect in respect of the practice of this House. The extraordinary announcement of the Prime Minister, however, has elevated it from a simple protest against the action of the Postmaster-General into a high constitutional question. The honourable member for Flinders has very properly pointed out that the course proposed by the Government is a complete departure from constitutional practice. The Prime Minister has admitted that he knows of no precedent for such a course, and that 'the whole movement has been improvised by the Government to escape from a situation which has no parallel in our Australian history.",35
281,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The occasion has previously arisen when a man was denied the right of appeal to a Court.,35
282,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I desire to deal with the points connected with this case in my own way. The Prime Minister has affirmed that no similar case has arisen or could have arisen. But that does not get rid of the charge made by the honourable member for Flinders, that the Government proposal is a complete abrogation of their obligation to deal exclusively with matters of administration. Everybody with an elementary knowledge of constitutional practice knows that legislation is a matter for the Parliament and administration a matter for the Executive. As soon as the Government are unable to satisfy the House by their methods of administration they the are called upon to take the opinion of honourable members as to their fitness to retain their positions. I am entirely in accord with the honourable member for Flinders in regard to the constitutional aspect of this question. But after sitting here for seven years I begin to look upon a regard for constitutional practice as being 'somewhat archaic. We have not had responsible government - since 1901. Can honourable members say that we had an exhibition of responsible government last night when the Treasurer",35
283,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The honourable member must not refer to another debate.,35
284,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We have become so accustomed to this loose view of constitutional practice that even the Prime 'Minister begins to forget the guiding principles of that branch of knowledge. He now tells us not only that it is constitutional for the Postmaster-General to admit that his action should be the subject of independent inquiry by the House, but that when the proposal for an inquiry is about to be put from the Chair, he and the whole of his colleagues will leave the .House and express no opinion one way. or the other. Surely, if the Prime Minister thinks that the decision of the Postmaster-General is a just one, he and his colleagues should remain in the Chamber and assist to negative the proposal of the honourable member. If , on the other hand, they think it just to have his decision reviewed, they should support the motion. Certainly they ought not to run away. I agree with the Prime Minister that the occasion is somewhat unique, because under the Post and Telegraph Act we have placed unusually arbitrary powers in the hands of the Postnot master-General-power s which have never previously been vested in a Minister.",35
285,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Ye s they have-in - Queensland.,35
286,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"They are powers which ought not to be placed in the hands of any Minister; because the way in which they will be exercised will depend entirely upon his moral outlook. I do not wish to say anything in reference to the Postmaster-General, except that when he is .in the country as a Minister he never loses an opportunity of delivering "" goody goody "" homilies to the people as to the way they should conduct their lives.",35
287,Mr MCDOUGALL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The honourable member does the same thing himself.,36
288,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"How can we expect the Postmaster-General' to take the view that a man of the world would take upon a question of this sort in the administration of his Department? He alone, knows the whole of the details which prompted him to take action. I have never seen the papers relating to this matter.",36
289,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They were laid upon the table of the Senate.,36
290,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We have permitted the Postmaster-General practically to stop the whole business of a firm which has no appeal. I charge the Government with moral cowardice in running away from this 1 motion. 1I have always contended that this Parliament has nothing whatever to do with the morality of the contents of letters. If those contents touch the security of the King or of the Commonwealth, the Government have a perfect right to interfere. But, as carriers of letters, we have no more right to interfere in regard to the moral contents of letters than have the Railways Commissioners to inquire into the object of a man or a woman in travelling from Sydney to Melbourne. But since we have conferred this arbitrarypower upon the Postmaster-General there must be somesafety valve in cases of injustice^-otherwisee we have created and perpetuate a veritable Star Chamber. It is a monstrous proposition that a Postmaster General with ""goody goody"" notions such as are possessed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, should be invested with the arbitrary ppwer to place an-embargo upon the whole correspondence of a business firm without a right of appeal. I do not care what the letters may contain - ther e must in all fairness be a right of appeal on the part of that firm. All that is proposed now is that there shall be an inquiry, and the proper course for the Government, if the Prime Minister was so anxious to do justice, was to say to the people concerned, "" It is true that the Minister has decided against.you, but, if you will name certain persons whom we ap' prove, we are perfectly willing to have an inquiry by an impartial tribunal, in order that we may ascertain in what way, if any,' the Minister has gone beyond a reasonable exercise of his powers."" To come to the House and say that they will allow this motion to be carried, but that they are not going to support it, because they do not care whether the Committee be appointed or not, is to take up, not only an unconstitutional, but a cowardly, attitude. If the Government believe it just to have a Committee of inquiry, they ought to support the motion; or, if they think the motion un-just, they ought to oppose it. But I am beginning to be inured to breaches of constitutional practice.",36
291,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This goes further than any breach we have seen hitherto.,36
292,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I do not think so. Only yesterday, there was a greater breach of constitutional and parliamentary practice, when the leader of the Labour Party peremptorily denied the Government the right to arrange the business of the House; and, if the honourable member for Flinders did not observe the incident, he missed a spectacle of importance. But constitutional practice is what we like to make it. We may carry on Parliament for years and make so many and constant inroads on recognised constitutional practice that at last the inroads become a part of our constitutional practice. I am perfectly satisfied to see an arbitrary power of the kind under discussion to some extent mitigated by the appointment of a Select Committee, in order that there may be an impartial inquiry as to whether those concerned have or have not received justice at the hands of the Postmaster-General.",36
293,Mr FRAZ ER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Kalgoorlie) [5.0] - I agree in the. main with the reasoning of the honourable member for Parkes. The position of the Government, as disclosed in the speech of the Prime Minister, is certainly the most extraordinary 1I have witnessed since I entered Parliament. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General had sufficient evidence to.justify the action he took; but I think that the Government, now that action has been taken, should know whether or not it is one which requires review, and they ought to have the courage to either support or oppose the motion. That appears to me to be the' straightforward attitude that the Government ought to adopt. I do not agree with the placing of such extraordinary powers without appeal in the hands of the Postmaster-General, who on ex parte evidence might absolutely ruin the business of an institution or firm in. Australia.",36

The personnel of the Committee is a matter for the consideration of the House; and there should be no hesitation striking out the name man whom honourable members may deem incapable of forming a correct judgment in accordance with the evidence. I think it would be most unjust to refuse to grant an inquiry, seeingthat that is the only means by which it can be hibition; ascertained whether the persons accused the Postmaster-General be. right or wrong.

Is not a Select Committee a body? Are its members to be deof barred from voting upon any report that - they may submit to Parliament? Ministers must have a very weak case when they seek to shelter themselves behind such an argurement. They are here to do their duty as members of the House, and ought not to the Chamber when a proposal affecting their position is being considered.",42

388,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The acts of the Government have been frequently questioned, but they have always taken manly course of supporting their their votes.

Or are honourable members posed to vote upon this motion and thus relieve Ministers of a responsibility which oiling. they decline to accept? We want to see a little more backbone evidenced in our polithat tics. Ministers may be right upon some occasions and wrong upon others; but ther right or wrong, if they are prepared fight for their cause and to accept the sequences of their actions we can respect them, even if we assist to defeat them. But is amazing. it was not anticipated that there was thing in the way of a reflection upon - Postmaster-General or upon the Governmethods, ment likely to result from this motion.

If the Government consider that the final power, resting, with the Postmaster-General, is unfair, and they desire to amend the law, which affects not only this firm, but many others, the same portunity of appeal should be afforded all. But the Government support ' Postmaster-General on the ground that fie has acted quite rightly. What could weaker than the position of Ministers, while they do not object to an inquiry, clare that they will not vote for or against the motion? Such an attitude abrogates their' position in Parliament, where they ought to be the leaders; and it is an tude which they would absolutely refuse to adopt in other cases where their action wasattacked. Does it make , ference from which side of the House the attack comes? We, as the attack the Government frequently, but they do not then propose to take any such as that which hasÂ°been indicated by the Prime Minister.

On the 20th June, 1901, when he was a member of the Ministry, he, with others of his colleagues, deliberately walked out of the House, and attiallowed honourable members to wote on a question, thus creating a precedent com1 pletely new to me.

Honourable members in the Opposition corner seem willing to wound, but afraid to strike; they are anxious to grasp at every opportunity of weakening the position of the Government, and of giving rise to a motion of want of confidence.",46
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The member is a voting machine.,46
445,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The right, honourable member for Swan is one who acknowledged that, for months and months, he had been a voting machine at the call of the Labour Party; and he did not discover the fact until he found it convenient to cross to the other side of the House.",46
446,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Will the honourable member discuss, the question now before the Chair?",46
447,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I only desire to point out that I am not a voting machine, that at no time have I voted against my convictions, and to show the inconsistency between the words of the right honourable member for Swan - to-night and his - action in i90i._ The honourable member for North "" Sydney told us that he was surprised at the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, and then the honourable member for Flinders, in that tone of sarcasm which distinguishes him, exclaimed, "" They call this a iudicial matter."" Fortunately, however, we have the words of the Chief Justice, in giving judgment in the case of-Freeman and Wallace, who appealed to the ""High Court in reference to this very matter. In the course of his remarks, reported in 12 A..L.R;, the Chief Justice saidBut it is clear that this is not merely a Ministerial duty; it is a duty involving the exercise of discretion, and upon which he must form his own independent judgment, and he may form a conclusion in one way'or the other; and this Court cannot revise his judgment in a case where he is called upon to exercise, his discretion. And after saying that this was not purely a delijudicial proceeding, the Chief Justice it was a It is quasi-judicial in this sense, that it is to be made upon evidence. That is admitted right through the judgment. It is said that this is not a judicial proceeding, because the parties cannot be heard; but I point out that it would be simply impossible in many of the cases for the parties to be heard prior to the prohibition. For instance, if it were desired that the promoters of a German lottery should be prohibited from sending circulars throughout Australia, the Postmaster General could not wait until they had been heard, because, :n the meantime, the country would be swamped with the circulars, the replies, and the lottery money sent, and the proper administration of the Act rendered impossible - The prohibition honourable should be declared, followed by an in (mediate demand on the parties to show cause why it should not be continued. Amongst the affidavits in the case I have just mentioned there is one from the present Minis- ter of Trade and Customs, showing that he, as Postmaster-General, called on the people concerned to show cause; and, although tha present Postmaster-General stated that he had the evidence before him, and considered the matter time after time,"" we are told that this is not a judicial proceeding.",46
448,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Was not the whole result of the case that the writ of prohibition was not issued because it was not a judicial proceeding?,46
449,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Yes , in the Courts.",46
450,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The prohibition could not be issued, not because it was not a judicial proceeding, but because there was the large discretion of the Minister, and it had to be considered whether by certiorari, or mandamus, or prohibition was a proper thing.",46
451,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If it be judicial, the only judge is the Postmaster General. The other Ministers, who are not going to vote, cannot be spoken of as judges.",46
452,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The Government has been attacked because it is willing to allow this case to be brought on appeal from the decision of the Postmaster-General to a higher Court, that of Parliament. But is not the position virtually what it would be if the decision had been given, not by the Postmaster-General, but by a singlte Judge, and the Ministry, when asked to appeal to the F u ll Court, said, "" We have no wish to appeal, but if you think that there should be an appeal, we are willing to allow it to be made?'' 1 the action of Ministers in abstaining from voting on a previous occasion, and I spoke against it ; but the honourable member for North Sydney made no protest, notwithstanding that he took part in the debate on the main question.",46
453,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"On that occasion, Ministers abstained from voting because they were pecuniarily interested.",47
454,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It will be long before the honourable member is similarly interested. I object to the insinuations of members of the Opposition that the Government is trying to placate a supporter. In my opinion, the Prime Minister is too generous, and has too fine and over punctilious a sense of honour - Mr. I should have liked him to say that he would vote, as I shall' vote, against the amendment for the appointment of a Committee. In my opinion, the Postmaster-General has given to the case all necessary consideration. If the amendment for the appointment of a Committee be carried, I hope six honourable members will support me in a request for a ballot, so that the case may be investigated by an impartial and independent Committee.",47

456,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,We missed the last two Thursdays.,47
457,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The Prime Minister seems to wish to miss this too, because he tells us that he is not going to vote on the amendment. The machine which he has devised flies back and strikes him like a boomerang. Now we are in this-burlesque situation, .that the Government endorses the action of the Postmaster-General, but refuses to vote for or against a motion to investigate it. The policy of the Prime Minister is a policy of "" skedaddle, scuttle away and vamoose; do anything _rather than vote."" ' We were returned to vote on the questions, coming before Parliament. The Prime Minister is introducing a new idea in suggesting that when inconvenient questions are brought forward, honourable members should leave the Chamber without recording their votes. What electorate would choose a candidate who announced that he would shirk his responsibility in that way ? I have known members to get I did not like out of voting; but no one respected them for doing so; and, personally, I would rather have a vote cast against .me than no vole registered. ' Am I to understand that the Prime Minister and the Postmaster General are not going to vote, but that remaining Ministers and their supporters are to stay behind and do what they will not do? It has been hinted that it would be well for honourable members on this side not to record their votes; but I shall record mine. I shall take the part of the Postmaster-General, although he himself mayrun away.",47
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Then the honourable member will be doing what the Postmaster-General wishes him to do. WILKS - If the Postmaster General shirks his responsibility as a Minister and a member, that is no reason why I should shirk mine. I told the honourable member for Riverina, months ago, that I should oppose the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this case. If the Postmaster-General exceeds his powers, Parliament should punish him. The friends of the honourable member for Riverina-Messrs . Freeman and . Wallace M.r.

462,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Parliamen t should at all times be .ready to remedy grievances, however humble the sufferer may be.",47
463,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,In this case it is the Postmaster-General who is humble. He Is making himself the accused perspn.,47
464,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"We cannot humble the Postmaster-General; but he is humbling himself beyond measure, and other Ministers are humbling him. The papers relating to this case were laid on the table of the Senate, and are now public property, so that the firm could prosecute for conspiracy those who gave the evidence upon which the Postmaster-General based his action.",47
465,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The firm has asked that a charge may be brought against it , so that the case may be tried in the Courts. The statements in the papers are protected privilege. M.r. DUGALD THOMSON - The Prims Minister has said that that is not so.'",47

467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,He did not mention the matter to me.,48
468,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"There is too great a* tendency in Australian Parliaments to allow the appointment of Select Committees of inquiry, and I cannot understand how Minister who thinks that he has acted rightly can agree to such an investigation. If it is thought that the Minister has done wrong, a motion of censure should be moved. The charge of maladministration brought against the Postmaster-General by the honourable member for Riverina is practaken tically a motion of censure. If other orable members followed the example which is going to be set by the Prime .Minister, and refused to vote on it , the House be counted out, which would be a conveniof ence to those who wish to go to the theatre, though not tending to the advancement of cult business. The Prime Minister, who should lead the House, refuses to act on this octhe casion. There are many Questions to come before us upon which it will be inconvenient to vote; but those who tried to avoid repected sponsibility by abstaining from voting would soon be drummed out of public life. The Prime Minister says that he believes that the Postmaster-General had, good ground for acting as he did, and the Posttile master-General has stated that he heard defence of Messrs. Freeman ""and Wallace. Therefore, the case has been dealt with on its merits. He says that he heard counsel, and is still of opinion that justrce. has been clone. Therefore, I am astonished that the Prime Minister should justify his inaction by the plea that every one should have his grievances rectified by Parliament. I do not care much for party warfare, nor do I indulge in mud 'throwing. Ministers are. bedaubing themselves with mud more thickly than the Opposition could plaster them,'and Parliament would be a laughing stock if members generally, by .refusing to ; Â£ 8 , 2 . vote, tried, as Ministers are doing, to escape their parliamentary responsibility. by I could understand honourable members availing themselves of this opportunity to give notice of the most severe motion of censure that could be tabled against a Government. T could well understand the leader of the Labour Party, who wishes to speak to this question, concluding his rewhat marks by moving a further amendment which would have the effect of a motion of censure - If I were a member of his party I should certainly avail myself of the opportunity to do so. l f the Labour Party ever .gets into power and refuses to accept responsibility for its administrative acts, the newspapers of the Commonwealth will quickly endeavour to hound them out of public life. They have now a splendid opportunity to table .a most effective motion of censure that will, have the effect, so far a as the Commonwealth is concerned, of placing responsible government for all time upon its proper pedestal. If a motion of censure be tabled, I shall strongly support it. I cannot understand the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, unless he is riding for a ' f all . The stand which he has upon this question, considered in honconjunction with his attitude on another motion a few days ago, seems to suggest that that is what he is doing. Having rewould gard to the Prime Minister's knowledge parliamentary procedure and of the principles of responsible government, it is diffito account in any other way for his action in inviting his colleagues to walk out of House when.this question goes to a vote. Seeing that he has endorsed the action of the Postmaster-General, one would have exhim to strongly support him on this occasion and. to fight for rather than to go back upon him. I know that the honourable member for Riverina is a solid supporter of the Government, and had no hosintentions towards them, in submitting the this amendment; but I repeat that we ought to avail ourselves of this splendid opportunity to assert the principles of retheir sponsible government..

But, so far, we have had no proposition from those formerly engaged in this trade, nor, so far as we are aware, is there any other.boat that can immediately take it up. I have already indicated that we are prepared to consider proposals for an additional service between the ports named. ,",52

533,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Yes ; but we shall have . to come to the House for authority first.,52
534,Mr TOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Parramatta) [8.10] - Is the item of Â£ 5 5 5 for the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference intended to cover the expenses of the Prime Minister when in London ?,52
535,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Ballarat-Minister of External' Affairs) [ 8 . n ] - This amount consists of small items of expenditure in London, such as a portion of my steamer fare on my return from England, but the chief part of it is for the employment of clerks. The total cost of my visit to London was less than the amount here stated.",52
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Parramatta) [8.12] - I did not seek any of .those particulars. I admit that the' amount is very small, and I did not wish to question in any way the expenditure on the Prime Minister's visit to London. Notwithstanding the magnificent service, which he rendered to the Commonwealth when there-as to the quality of that service there will be no two opinions in the House- I am not sure that he would not have employed his time much better if , instead of delivering political addresses as he did on several occasions, he had confined himself to the settlement of some of those outstanding questions that are pressing for finality. For instance, I may ' mention the matter of the site on which we are to erect those palatial residential quarters for Australians when in London. We. were told some time ago by the Treasurer that this was a very urgent and pressing matter. The Prime Minister, when in London, might have taken an opportunity of'clearing the matter up and settling once for all the question of the acquirement of that site.",52
537,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Order ! I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that question.,52
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Do you rule, sir, that I am not to discuss the Prime Minister's actions in London ?",52
539,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member will see that he is merely trying to evade my ruling. If I allowed him to discuss that question in the way he is doing, he could immediately turn round and say that the Prime Minister, when irr London, might have employed his time better in arranging for some better newspaper . in which to advertise than, say, the Daily Mail or the Standard. By that means he could evade my ruling just as effectively as he is trying to do in regard to the question of the site of the Commonwealth offices-. in London.",52
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I wish to get my full right to discuss the . Minister's actions. I hope I may do so without being charged with trying to evade your ruling. All the Prime Minister's actions in connection with his visit to London are under review, and anything connected with him when"" in London is a fair subject for debate when we' are voting the expenses of his trip.",52
541,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable , member will not be in order in discussing the question of acquiring the site of the Commonwealth offices' in London. There was a special sum in the Estimates-in-Chief for that object. That was the time when the honourable member should have dealt with it.",52
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That may be, but I claim that I may, if I wish, complain of the Prime Minister's action in connection with any matter when he was in London, and for which this vote is specially set down. If you rule that I may nof do that, I do not see why these items are submitted unless it is for us to vote them in silence. The Prime Minister went to London; here is a sum to cover his expenses whilst in London, and therefore anything he did, or failed to do when there, is a proper subject of debate., I am unwilling to dissent from your' ruling, but I think - it is an extraordinary one.",52
543,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Lang) [8.14] - The sum of Â£555 does not represent the total cost of the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference. It is in addition to .Â£670 already voted, bringing the total up to Â£1,225. I merely mention that, as perhaps some of the pre-' vious vote was not used for purposes which the Prime Minister mentioned.",53
544,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"There were the expenses of Dr Wollaston, Mr Hunt, my colleague, and myself, and the cost of the five or six temporary clerks engaged hi London and working extra hours.",53
545,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I take no exception ""to the item. I propose later to move the omission of the item of Â£ 4 patriation of distressed Australians from - South Africa."" That is in addition to Â£9,862 voted on the Estimates in Chief, making a total of Â£10,286 for that purpose.",53
546,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This is the last of it.,53
547,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"This money is not - being wisely expendedI t has come to the knowledge of several honourable members, and, I think, to the knowledge of the Government, that some of it has been utilized, not for repatriating Australians who went from here to South Africa, but for sending to Australia persons of undesirable character who were never here before. I think I myself have drawn attention to the statements appearing in the press in regard to that matter. Some of those undesirables have already come under the official notice of magistrates in this country 'in a not too - creditable way. It is about time we put a stop to this kind of thing, especially as is now proposed to spenct.another sum for the repatriation of other Australians who have gone to New' Caledonia and other places: There does not appear to have been a careful watch kept over this expenditure, in order to see that it was applied only to thepurposes for which it was voted, and that the necessitous people who wished to be brought here had actually been residents previously of Australia. We ought not to vote this sum.",53
548,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Dalley) [8.19] - During the general discussion on these Estimates last night, I observed that as most of the money had been expended, any attempt to reduce a vote would be only so much wasted time. All we can do now is to avoid occupying the time of the Committee longer than is necessary. I rise to make sugges- . tions to the Prime Minister as to matters which he may have overlooked in regard to External Affairs. We start on . this page with ""other printing,"" and end with "" Shackleton."" It is difficult to get anything out of .those items, but I know that the Prime Minister is only too glad of suggestions, no matter how humble the quarter they come from, for the improvement of his Department. The Department of External Affairs is one which is not usually very much in evidence at question time, but it controlsmatters of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. I find that there is a vote of ,Â£20 put down for a paying officer in London. I assume that the salary of this officer was really passed 2 4 for "" rein the General Estimates.",53
549,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Yes .,53
550,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I am compelled in the interests of economy to ask why we.should pay Â£ 2 0 to a paying officer.if we are not to be told what he has to do. The honourable member for Parramatta endeavoured to raise a question as to the-work done by the officer who is called upon to pay for advertising by the Commonwealth. I should like to know whether the vote of Â£ 2 6 to which I refer is required to compensate some officer for seeing that our advertisements appear in the right newspapers.,53
551,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Order . I ask the honourable member not to discuss that question.,53
552,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am sorry that you will not stand that, Mr Chairman, as I should like to have said a few words on the matter, and I know that the honourable member it for Parramatta has something of import- , ance to say in connection with it. I shall, however, strictly obey your ruling, especially as I know you will not permit me to go any further in that direction. I notice a vote of Â£49 0 to cover the refund of .fines under the Immigration Restriction Act. I should like to know why these fines are to be refunded, and how it is that fines are imposed in connection with the administration of that Act?",53
553,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Fine s may be inflicted upon those in charge of steamers for permitting the landing of members of their crews who come under the description of prohibited immigrants.,54
554,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am afraid that the Prime Minister is assisting the Chairman, and not the honourable member for Dalley. I am anxious to obey the Chairman's ruling, though I may appear to be trying to evade it. We have passed no better legislation than that covered by the Immigration Restriction Act if it is properly administered, and none that will be more freely canvassed if the Act is not properly administered.. The reverse of immigration restriction is immigration encourgement, and whilst it is the duty of the Department of External Affairs to prevent the introduction of undesirable immigrants, I am afraid that the Department is not as active as it might be in encouraging the immigration of desirable immigrants. We know that at the present time there is a vast stream of emigration from Great Britain to other parts of the world.",54
555,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,^-Order. I ask the honourable member not to discuss that question.,54
556,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am sure that the Prime Minister sees the difficulty in which the honourable member for Parramatta and I are placed. The honourable gentleman's well known affability is of great advantage to him in the passing of the Estimates of Departments of which he has charge, and I trust that he will find a means in replying to the observations which have been made to afford information on the matters which have been referred to, both with respect to immigration and the course to be adopted in the future in making arrangements for advertising the Commonwealth. The sum of Â£550 is set down in connection with the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference in London, and I am sure that if the amount were increased by another .Â£500 it would not be considered too much to pay for the services 'which the Prime Minister performed for Australia during his recent .visit to the Old Country. It is not often that it is possible for men to pay compliments of this character to political opponents, but that is all the more reason why, where they are deserved, they should be paid to men who have satisfactorily performed a public duty. I recognise the value of the services which the Prime Minister rendered to Australia at the recent Conference, and also during his visit to watch the passing of the Commonwealth Constitution.. The Bill submitted by the honourable gentleman for expenses was about the lowest submitted by any representative of Australia. I think that should be said, although I do not suppose the honourable gentleman will thank me for putting it on record. The services rendered by the honourable gentleman at the Imperial Conference cannot be estimated in pounds, shillings, and pence. The ' important work which he did during his visit was really surprising, and must have left him neither time nor energy to do work of a kind which would have claimed the attention of smaller men.",54
557,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This is eulogy.,54
558,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Because one is politically opposed to the Prime Minister that is no reason why he should always be pouring out vitriol. A political oppo- ' nent does not lose his independence by recognising good work done by any public man holding different, political views. The honourable member for Parramatta and I have been very anxious to discuss certain matters, the discussion of which apparently is not in order on these Estimates. I regret very much that I have been unable to discuss the stream of fresh blood that is flowing at the present time from the United Kingdom to other parts of the world, and the desirability of some effort being made to divert some of the stream to Australia.",54
559,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Wentworth) [8.29] - In dealing with the Estimates-in-Chief honourable members can freely criticise,' not only the items, but the general policy of the various Departments. ' We are discussing now, not the EstimateS-in-Chief, but Additional Estimates, and are being asked to .vote sums of money to give effect to a policy additional to the general administration policy of the year.",54
560,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the items.,54
561,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I propose to do so; but I should like to say that if we are not permitted to discuss the policy underlying these Additional Estimates it is a waste of time to submit them, and Ministers might just as well take the money and say no more about it. I understand from the Prime Minister that the vote of Â£555 is the only vote in which his own expenses in connection with the visit to London are dealt with.",54
562,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No ; this vote for the most part covers expenses in .connection with the employment of clerks. I """"believe that the greater portion of the amount paid to me for expenses was included in the vote which appears on the Estimatesin-Chief.",55
563,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This vote covers some expenses in connection with the Prime Minitesr's visit to London which' do not appear in the Estimates-in-Chief?,55
564,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is so. that all the vouchers had not been received when the Estimates-in-Chief were made up.,55
565,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,^I can quite understand that. I assume that if anything trolled by the Department of External fairs and connected with the visit of the Prime Minister to England transpired since the passage of the Estimates-in-Chief is the proper occasion on which to refer to it.,55
566,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No j that would not be in order.,55
567,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I shall not question ruling, sir, but I record my regret that matter of greal public importance in nexion with the. administration of the Deof partment of External Affairs, and the adto vertising of the Commonwealth, cannot be tralians. ventilated in this Committee in such that we may let the public of Australia know exactly what has been done in their agent. name.",55

583,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Calare) [8.42] - I wish to direct attention to the item, "" Cost of Commonwealth elections, I do not know whether this amount is intended to be devoted to general purposes, but if so, I wish to impress - upon the Minister the urgent necessity exists for revising our electoral rolls. our population is of a shiftThat statement is just as The true of the metropolitan as it is of the country districts. When an elector repromoves from the division for which his",56
584,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter. I would point out that, by the gene - ral consent of the Committee, a general discussion took place upon the first item of. these Estimates. Strictly speaking, that was out of order, but, with the consent of the Committee, it was allowed to proceed, it being understood that honourable members would subsequently be conto the particular items included in the division under consideration. I am not this course of my own initiative, but I am supported in it by no less an authority than May. Upon page 621 of the eleventh Â£10 0 to edition it is laid downDebate on supplementary and excess grants restricted to the particulars contained in the on which those grants are sought, and to the application of the items which compose those grants; and the debate cannot touch the policy or the expenditure sanctioned, on other heads, by the estimate on which the original grant was obtained, except so far as such policy or expenditure is brought before the Committee by the items contained in the supplementary or excess Estimates. Mr. JOSEPH.COOK - I rise to a point of order. If you, sir, will read a note which appears at the bottom of the page to which you have directed attention, I think you I de- will see that the. honourable member for Calare is quite in order. The note in question refers to a ruling given by a Speaker of the House of Commons. Exception seems to have been taken to a ruling of the Chairman restricting debate, and, upon reference to Mr Speaker on the following day, the latter, while expressly dissociating himself from the question then under re-, view, went on to sayI think, however, that I ought to state that items of supplementary Estimates may raise in themselves questions of policy, but the interpretation whether they do raise questions of policy, or not, must clearly be left to the Chairman o i Committees. If I may be allowed to illustrate what I mean, I would say the. question of the draining of Constantinople would clearly not raise the whole question of foreign embassies. But, on the other hand, . a vote which would - largely increase a vote for a' railway to Uganda .might raise the whole question of the policy involved in the original vote for Uganda. - In the'present instance, an excess grant is needed for electoral purposes, and, according to the decision which I have quoted, that item raises the whole question of the original grant for those purposes.",56
585,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But in this instance the proposed grant is for a specific purpose- in connection with the Echuca election and the disputed Senate election.,57
586,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What Speaker the decision which the deputy leader the Opposition has quoted?,57
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I cannot say. matter was raised by Mr W. H . Smith. It - appears to me that there is a clear parallel between the two cases.,57
588,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"- T he item to which I have directed attention relates an expenditure upon Commonwealth elecany tions, and I take it that the proposed propriation is intended to enable the Department to carry on electoral work generally.",57

591,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I must ask the honnot orable member not to pursue that line of argument. Mr THOMAS BROWN. - Then I such should like to hear what this particular item covers.,57
592,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Lang) [8.49] - When he is replying, the Minister might also form the Committee what steps are being taken in the compilation of the electoral rolls in view of possible contingencies.'",57
593,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I should like a direction from the Chair as to the extent to which we may discuss Commonwealth elections under this item. The proposed vote is put in the baldest possible way. It reads, "" Cost of Commonwealth elections, Â£ 3 , 4 5 0 . "" We are being, asked to vote a large sum to defray the cost of Commonwealth elections, and you,. Mr Chairman, rule that we cannot discuss the subject.",57
594,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No . I have ruled that it is not in order to discuss the policy of the Department. Honourable members had an opportunity to do that on the. Estimates-in-Chief, and .during the general discussion last night. If I were to allow the matter to be again debated now, the consideration of these Estimates would never end.",57
595,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [8.51] - The sum here set clown is to cover the cost of the second'election for the Senate in the State of South Australia and for Echuca in the State of Victoria.,57
596,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The cost seems very great, though, of course, a Senate elecgave tion is expensive. But, as the complaint of has been made that enormous sums are being asked for on Additional Estimates, The which should have been asked for on the Estimates-in-Chief, I ask whether it . was not known when the latter were being prepared that this sum would be required.",57
597,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Estimates-into Chief were framed long before there was knowledge of the complications which apcaused the South 'Australian election.,57
598,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"They should have been brought up-to-date before presentation to Parliament. - Mr HUME COOK - As the honourable admits, a Senate election is not a for any specific .cheap affair.",57
599,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What.wa s the cost In that of the Senate election ?,57
600,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Speaking from the memory, and subject to correction, about Â£2,900. .",57
601,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Wentworth) [8.54] - I do propose to canvass the policy of the Government in regard to elections, because I know that their main object is to avoid things. I rise to ask whether it is proposed to obtain in advance authority from Parliament for the payment of money for the celebrations in connection with the invisit of the American Fleet, or to ask Parliament to ratify the expenditure in the next Estimates, after the money has been disbursed? Mr FRAZE R' (Kalgoorlie) [8.55] Yesterday I asked the Treasurer whether an increase ,in the allowance of officials located in the interior of Western Australia, .similar to the 5 per cent, allowance now being paid to those in the coastal districts) is to be given. The expense of living in the interior is much greater than that of living in Perth or Fremantle.",57
602,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,How 'does that arise 1 in connection with these Estimates?,58
603,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"At the bottom of page 14 there is an item which allows me to mention the subject. It has been shown that the cost of living in Perth and the coastal districts of Western Australia isÂ» sufficiently high to warrant an allowance of 5 per cent, to the public servants living there. The allowance paid to those on the gold-fields, however, was fixed on the assumption - that the cost of living in Perth was the same as it is in Melbourne. I have got the Postmaster-General to acknowledge that .there is justice in the claim that the living allowance of those in the interior should be correspondingly increased, though he has not promised to do anything.",58
604,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I said last night that I would confer with the Public Service Commissioner.,58
605,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the Minister proposes to do that, with the object of obtaining more consideration for the officers living in the interior of the State, I can hope for little more at this stage of the financial year; but I should like to know whether the Treasurer, with whom I have discussed the matter, is in accord with him. I have risen also to ask for information regarding the proposed expenditure of Â£ 1 , 7 9 2 on repairs and maintenance for the Thursday Island Defences. In every part Estimates one finds expenditure in connection with the Defence Department - On the last page Â£ 2 6 0 , 0 0 0 is provided as New Special Defence expenditure.",58
606,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That is for the .new scheme..,58
607,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Yes . The Government have adopted a new Defence policy.,58
608,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But Parliament has not approved of it .,58
609,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No;.though I think that this House will be compelled to recognise our Defence necessities.,58
610,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But not necessarily to endorse the Government policy.,58
611,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"At all events, we should have some explanation as to why the expenditure of this money has become necessarysince the framing of the Estimatesin-Chief. There seems to have been a very poor appreciation of the necessities of the case, or great recklessness in connection with the public expenditure.",58
612,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Wimmera) [ p . p ] - I , too, should like some information in regard to the proposed expenditure of Â£ 1 , 7 9 2 011 the repairs and maintenance of the Thursday Island Defences. What is the character of the work to be undertaken there ? When I visited Thursday Island some time ago, its defences seemed very antiquated, and I know that there is great difference of opinion amongst those who have studied the question as to whether that is the best place.for a fortified coaling station.",58
613,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Lang) [9,2] - I wish to know why officers living in Western Australia should be treated more favourably than officers living in the other States. Is living dearer in Perth or Albany than in "" Wilcannia or Bourke, or the back-blocks of Queensland ?",58
614,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,O r in the Northern Territory ?,58
615,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Where transit is difficult, the tost of living is always higher than where there is train and steamer communication.",58
616,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,This allowance is not paid to men living in the interior.  at all ?,58
617,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is granted because the Public Service Commissioner recognises that it costs 10 per cent, more to live in Perth than to live in Melbourne.",58
618,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"On e can get as cheap hotel accommodation or board and residence of . the in Perth as in' Sydney or Melbourne, and that being so, what justification is there for this extra allowance?",58
619,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Dalley) [9.5] - There are many important items under the Department Â«of Home Affairswhich might well be discussed, but you, Mr Chairman, are holding the reins pretty tightly. The grant of a special living allowance should not lie confined to certain officers in Western' Australia, for, as the honourable member for Lang has pointed out, there are places in New South Wales,. such as Bourke and Brewarrina, where it is difficult to obtain board and residence at the rates prevailing in populous centres.",58
620,Colonel FOXTON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But this item relates only to officers who are not in receipt of a district allowance.,58
621,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No doubt the Minister will explain the matter later on. I wish now to refer to a question more closely touching ourselves, namely, the item of Â£1,125 for repairs to and the maintenance of this building. I do not wish it to be thought that I am cavilling at the proposed expenditure, because no honourable member recognises more fully than I do the generosity of Victoria in allowing us the use of this building.",59
622,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,And their willingness to keep us here for all time.,59
623,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Quite so. We are not very payable tenants, and Victoria is a generous landlord. I should like us to be in our own House. I wish to know whether the item relates to expenditure to be incurred in sewering Parliament House and providing a perfect system of ventilation which is urgently required. - buildings are of Oriental splendour Mr.'W. H . IRVINE - And Oriental sanitation.",59
624,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member has aptly described the sanitary arrangements of Parliament House. I trust that this amount is to be used in the direction I have indicated. I also desire to obtain from the Minister some information in regard to items under the heading of "" Home Affairs (New South Wales)"" providing for a sum of ,Â£200 in respect of rent, and Â£ 1 0 0 for repairs and maintenance. Is the money designed to provide for repairs to buildings temporarily occupied by us? It seems to show a want of ordinary business management, to say nothing of Scottish caution, to propose to effect repairs at a cost of Â£10 0 to a building the yearly rental of which amounts to only Â£200. I understood that the Customs House, Sydney, was to be altered for the purposes of the Home Affairs offices.",59
625,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,So did I .,59
626,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Then the honourable member, like myself, has been misleS.",59
627,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I have not been misled. I think that the alterations have not been made for the reason that the whole building has not yet been given up by the State Government.,59
628,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Then the item for repairs relates to premises temporarily occupied by us. I hope that the Minister will give us an explanation with respect to these matters. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [9.12] - I desire to obtain from the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs some information regarding the proposed expenditure of Â£1,792 on repairs and maintenance in connection with the defences of Thursday Island. I understand that the population of that island consists of about 2,000 Japanese and 61 white men . Colonel FOXTON - No . The white and coloured populations are about equally divided. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is this money to be expended to encourage Japanese immigration ? I understand from militarymen that Thursday Island is not important, as a strategical point, for the defence - of Australia.",59
629,Colonel FOXTON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Who told the honourable member that? Mr KING; O'MALLEY - I received the information not from local colonels, These but from real military men. I dd not wish the Commonwealth to be military mad; but the whole country seems now to be talking fight. Is this money to be expended in repairing the forts at Thursday Island, and is the work to be carried out by white men or Japanese? I wish to know whether the hard earnings of the workers are to be paid out for the encouragement of an alien race and to maintain settlement on Thursday Island, which is absolutely useless for the defence pf this country.",59
630,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is said that alien races run the whole show there, and are allowed to inspect the forts. Mr KING O'MALLEY - So I am told. I understand that the Japanese fleet which visited Australia a few years' ago made a survey of - these waters, and that the Japanese and the Germans are the only, two nations that are absolutely familiar with every inlet and outlet of this country. Such. information was obtained by the Germans, not because of any desire on their part to take Australia, but for the safety of their merchant shipping in Australian waters. TheJapanese, however,"" did not make a survey for the same reason. They have no commerce with this country.",59
631,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They . have. Japanese steamers trade regularly with these ports. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Japanese surveyed these waters after the nation had entered into an alliance with Great Britain.,59
632,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is not the honourable member aware that any one can purchase Admiralty charts for nearly all these seas?,59
633,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"1 know that the honourable member for Wentworth is a recognised military authority, but I was not aware that he was also a naval expert. I am opposed to anything, in the ""shape of military - madness. The debts of the world, due to military madness, amount to Â£7,000,000,000, and the world is paying Â£625,000,000 a year to keep military roosters on horseback.",60
634,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Hindmarsh) [9.16]. - The honourable member for Darwin certainly needs to obtain some information regarding the defences of Thursday Island. I have inspected them, and think that there is room for a much larger expenditure upon them. I doubt, however, whether any further expenditure should be incurred on fortifications as we saw them on the last occasion of the parliamentary visit of inspection. I rather think that it would: be wise to obtain from the Minister the fullest information before we pass the item in question. I may inform the honourable member for Darwin that the Japanese did not succeed in inspecting the fortifications on the island, and did not obtain' the information they desired. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I American newspaper that they did.",60
635,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member must not take notice of every statement he sees in the press. I am satisfied that the Japanese did not get an opportunity to ascertain the strength of the defences on Thursday Island. were allowed to visit the forts, they could not make drawings of them. . solut'ely necessary that the Island should be fortified, since it commands a very important waterway. It is necessary that our fortifications there strengthened, but some military authorities hold the view that the forts are now wrongly placed. Before we expend .Â£1,792 on their maintenance, we should obtain, from experts, reports dealing with that phase of the question. pend our money on defence's properly placed. I do not think that we ought to express opinions in this House regarding the defences at different ports of the Commonwealth, but I certainly think that we have not spent nearly sufficient upon the fortification of our important points of which Thursday Island is one.",60
636,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,H as the honourable member also got the military fever?,60
637,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No , but I have always held that to insure peace, it is is useless? necessary to be ready for war. No one is more opposed to militarism than I am'; but I am not so foolish as to believe that by refusing to keep a rifle at hand, and to learn how to use it, we are likely to enjoy immunity from aggression on the part of other nations. I have no desire that the Commonwealth should trespass upon 1 the domains of other countries, but I think that we should take care to have adequate defences. I am glad to see that the Minister of Defence has returned to the chamber. If he can convince the Committee that it is wise to expend further sums on the fort at Thursday Island as it stands, I shall be quite prepared to allow the item to pass. But if he shares the idea which seems to be entertained by military experts - that the defence of Torres Strait should be transferred to another point- I think that the sooner we stop spending money on Thursday Island, and set about fortifying the proper place, the better it will be.",60
638,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Richmond-Minister of Defence) [9.21] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh has certainly raised an important point, because it involves the quesread in an tion of what is the proper place for fortifications in Torres Strait. That has been a very debatable question for a considerable time, and when it is determined whether Goode Island or Thursday Island is the proper place, it will mean an expenditure of not Â£ 1 , 7 0 0 , but very many thousand Unless they pounds. With regard to the defence of Australia that is one of the points yet unI t is ab- decided. I do not desire to speak more f u l ly in that regard. Recognising that the question was under consideration and must be decided, I presume in the course of two should be or three years, and seeing that it was possible that the main fortifications would be at Goode Island, it was regarded as an unwise thing to expend any considerable amount upon the fortifications at Thursday Island, and so things went on for two Let us ex- or three years, until' the fortifications fell into such a state of disrepair that it became absolutely necessary, unless they were to be abandoned at once, to put them into something like order. The Department came to the conclusion that it was not possible to abandon-the .defence of Torres Strait altogether, and that the best course was in the cheapest possible way to put the fortifications into something like fighting efficiency as far as the money would go.  t . Mr EWING - I do riot say that it is useless.",60
639,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Is that a fair question to put?,61
640,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I think that a.person in any part of the world, if he desires to know, could learn the number and character of the guns in Sydney, Melbourne, and Thursday Island.",61
641,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Is an inefficient defence of that description of any use? Mr EWING. - It is of just about the same use to the Commonwealth as is a bullock dray to a man who has not felt justified in obtaining a buggy. The same question arises continually in connection with defence. Some modern authorities would rather have some other defence than the mines. They say, "" Not exactly what we want; not quite up-to-date; but keep what we have-till better can be done, as it is a deterrent for the time being.""",61
642,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Something like the second-hand torpedoes.,61
643,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,No ; they were obtained at cheap rates for practice. The question is whether we are prepared to abandon the defence of Torres Strait?  the Minister to put. a fort on Thursday. Island;,61
644,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"That is prehistoric; action, if any, was taken many years ago. The defence of Torres Strait maybe eventually moved from Thursday Island to Goode Island. In the meantime the best is being done with what we have until something better is obtained. Some representations were made to me in regard to the employment of aliens by officers and others and undue access to our forts, and I directed inquiries to be made. I am informed that in no part of Australia now is an alien employed in connection with the . Defence Force in any way. Mr J. H. CATTS - There was Thursday Island a good while ago.",61
645,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am speaking of only the present time, and honourable members may rest satisfied that no alien ployedin connection with our forts.",61
646,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,But are they allowed free access to the forts?,61
647,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No . One hears a large number of statements made, some of them being correct and others perhaps not quite correct. A considerable time ago I came to the conclusion that the access and publicity in connection with our forts were deplorable. ""Every commandant has now very special instructions that there shall be no such publicity or possibility of obtaining information concerning the forts. It ceased, I understand, some months ago.",61
648,Mr LIDDELL,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I walked all over a fort at Newcastle about a month ago,- and no one said a word to.me.",61
649,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If any honourable member will inform me of access being permitted to forts or places contiguous thereto the responsible officer will hear something very definite, .and I know that honourable members will sustain my action.",61
650,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"The honourable member for Hunter has just said that the other day he walked over a fort at Newcastle, and that he was not troubled by a soul.",61
651,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They would allow members of Parliament to go over-the forts.,61
652,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am surprised not at the officers allowing the honourable member for Hunter to enter the fort, but allowing him to go out. ' A' reference has been made to a recent explosion on Thursday Island. The military authorities and the police are working together, and so soon as definite information is received, honourable members will be informed.",61
653,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Wentworth) [9.28] - I wish to tender a feeling tribute to the Minister of Defence for his earnest effort to preserve a little more secrecy in the affairs of his Department than has unfortunatelybeen the case.,61
654,Mr JH CATTS,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If proper secrecy were maintained, the honourable member would not get information which he very often has.",61
655,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"If the honourable member "" cares to come with me and pay a visit which I have not yet paid-to wit, to the editorial room of the Melbourne Age-he . will probably find out more information about this Department than the Minister on holds. The information I get is obtained from public records. I have not had any improper dealings with members of the Defence Forces in any way, as honourable will be em- members should know. Mr KING O'MALLEy - VThat shows that the Age is an enterprising newspaper.",61
656,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is an enterprising newspaper. If the Minister wishes to maintain - a reasonable degree of common caution and ordinary secrecy in his Department, he should start at the fountain head. He should deal with the newspapers, especially with one newspaper which can always get any military news prematurely if it so desires, and he should cut off the leakage a.t its source-at head-quarters.",61
657,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF, Order ! In these Estimates there is. no item for military news.,62
658,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"No , sir; but I am grateful for the opportunity of being able to draw attention to the absence of an item. for that purpose. I want to know how much longer the Minister of Defence proposes to wait before he brings the defences of Australia-the fortifications on Thursday Island, with the others-up to the standard prescribed by the Imperial Defence Committee?",62
659,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"To make our forts fairly effective will take something ,Â£320,000 ; but the Ministry has not felt inclined to ask the House to vote so much money in one year for the purpose.",62
660,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,That was the first thing we were told about it. The Government . sought what they were pleased to call the highest expert opinion in the Empire with respect to the defences of Australia.,62
661,Mr EWING,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,They accepted opinion..,62
662,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"They got a verdict, and accepted it .",62
663,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF, The honourable member must not pursue that line of argument.,62
664,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I shall not do so,' but will ask the Minister definitely when it is intended by the Government to re-arm Thursday Island, which, I presume, will iiot be taken in hand before other places, in accordance with the verdict of the I m perial Defence Committee ? Mr EWING"" -Â£50,00 0 a year is to be spent for the purpose.",62
665,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Coolgardie) [9.30] Some information ought to-be given to the Committee about the item, in regard to the extra allowance to public officers in Western Australia. Up to the present time, officers on the gold-fields have,been given a. special, allowance owing to the excessive cost of living there as compared with the coastal districts. Some time ago, the Public Service Commissioner came to the conclusion ' that the cost of living, even in Perth, was higher than the cost of living in the eastern States, .and consequently he allowed an increase of 5 per cent, to the officers living] there. But the officers on the gold-fields have not received a corresponding increase. The disparity which prevailed before the Commissioner made the increase does not now exist. What I want' to know is whether the Treasurer can see his way to promise to pay the allowance, so as to put the goldfields, officers in relatively the same position as the coastal officers?",62
666,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.32] - This matter does not relate to my Department, but to the Postmaster General's Department. In the first instance, it is under the control of the Public Service Commissioner.",62
667,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"It is under the honourable gentleman's control, because he has to find, the money.",62
668,Sir WILLJAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Yes , that is where I come in. Senator Needham came to me on this subject, and I think that like several members of Parliament wrote to me. I am not quite sure if the honourable member came to me, probably he did.",62
669,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,I spoke to the honourable member nearly a year ago.,62
670,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I think that the honourable member did. I was approached to 'ascertain whether I would find 1 the money - for this extra payment to the the officers. A deputation waited upon me in, I think, one of the Senate rooms. I referred the matter' to the Public Service Commissioner, in order t'o know exactly the position, and he declined to recommend a further allowance. I asked him to furnish me with a statement as to the position. He saysDistrict allowances are granted to officers in remote localities' ranging from 10 to 50 per cent, on salaries, with a sliding scale of allowance after the first Â£100 of salary. These allowances have been in operation since the classification of 1904. I hold in my hand, the scale of allowances. These have all been published.",62
671,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The Commissioner's reasons have not been published.,62
672,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I will read them- As an outcome of the Commissioner's visit to Western Australia last year,""and his investigations into cost of living in Perth, it was decided to recommend that officers stationed in Perth, and at all localities in Western Australia not already subject to District Allowance,-should be granted a special District Allowance of 5 per cent, on their salaries. The officers on the jjold-fields who have drawn their District Allowance since 1904 now urge that if Perth officers are to draw. 5 per cent, allowance, the allowances already paid on the gold-fields should be augmented by an additional 5 per cent., and this demand is supported by the argument that as the gold-fields allowances were originally based on a comparison of cost of living at Perth, and as Perth salaries are being increased by 5 per cent., the gold-fields salaries should be similarly increased. The original District Allowances were not based on a comparison between Perth and the gold-fields",62
673,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Does he produce any evidence that he said so in 1904?,63

These gentlemen came to me because the money is not voted, and they wanted me to advance it if it was to be given at all.

702,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Coolgardie) [9.55] - The statement of the Public Service Commissioner quoted by the Treasurer is somewhat disingenuous. I find that he says The original district allowances were not based on a comparison between Perth and the gold-fields, but between the cost of living on the gold-fields and the eastern States. ' I have searched through the Public Service Commissioner's original classification scheme, and have been - unable to find a sentence in it to support that assertion. My opinion is that this excuse is merely an after thought. The basis of comparison actually used must have been the costof living in Perth. Moreover, there is extrinsic evidence that it was so based, because the district allowances paid to officers on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of Western Australia prior to Federation were practically the same as those which the Public Service Commissioner recommended. And those allowances were fixed by the State Governmentof Western Australia upon the basis of the difference between the cost' of living on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of the State, and' the cost of living in-and around Perth. That is at least corroborative evidence that the district allowances recommended by the Public Service Commissioner were not based upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields with the cost of living in the eastern States. In anv case, as the honourable member for Brisbane has pointed out, it is but justice thatofficers employed at remote stations should have their allowances relatively increased. I suggest that the Treasurer obtain another statement from the Public Service Commissioner. He should ask that officer where in his original classification scheme he has said that he based the district allowances upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields and in the eastern States.",65

704,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"He cannot deny that, when the State Government fixed these district allowances they had regard entirely to the difference in the cost of living, in various parts of Western Australia, and not the cost in the other States.

I suppose it is useless to expect to produce much effect on the mind of the Treasurer just now. But I may remind him that the matterto which I have, directed attention has given rise to a sense of injustice amongstofficers stationed in the remoter parts, not only of Western Australia, but of Queensland and New South.Wales.

[10.0] - I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a matter to which I have already referred, and which I do not intend to raise again on these Estimates. I referto the increase in the amounts asked for incidental expenses. I notice that the increase in his own Department is not as large in proportion to the original vote as the increase in connection with some other Departments. Although the original Estimates showed a large increase 'as .compared with last year's expenditure on these bread-and-butter items, - I find that in some cases the Additional"" .Estimates submitted provide for votes which are'actually in excess of those included in the original Estimates. I do not wish to move any reduction, because I recognise that that is a very unsatisfactory way of testing the opinion of the Committee. I have already shown that, taking all the Departments except the new. Departments, the votes . for incidental expenses on the Estimates-in-Chief exceed by Â£ 1 4 , 0 0 0 the expenditure on this account for last year; and' yet the Additional Estimates provide for a further increase of expenditure amounting to many thousands of pounds. In the circumstances, I feel that I am justified in asking the Treasurer to give special attention to the matter, in order, if possible, to prevent the continual increase of these votes for incidental expenses. Mr THOMAS BROWN [ TO . 4 ] - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether the small vote of Â£ 1 8 appearing under the heading of "" Miscellaneous "" for the Royal Commission on Papua represents the final payment in connection with the expenses of that Commission? In this connection, if I remember rightly, the Commission referred to made some recommendation in the direction of enforcing native labour by means of a hut tax. I notice that today a statement has been made that ordinances are to. be introduced, to give effect to the. proposal, and so bring about a condition of enforced labour in Papua. I should like the Treasurer to give the Committee some undertaking that before any ordinances of that kind are approved, this House will be given an opportunity to discuss the policy of enforcing labour upon natives of Papua.",65

724,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"In some States, if not in all, that is now being done.",67
725,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Dissatisfactio n naturally arises - where officers. are not treated alike. The officers located in almost every remote portion of Australia naturally think that they' labour under special disabilities. But I know that there is a strong feeling amongst South Australian officersparticularly amongst the linemen employed between Port Augusta and Western Australia-that they are very badly treated in the matter of these district allowances. In some cases they, were very much better off when they were under State control. For instance, one of the heavy items of expenditure with them is the cost which - they have to incur for the conveyance of rations and other goods. Owing to the extremely high cost of conveying goods to these distant parts, the South Australian Government used periodically to send up goods upon being requisitioned to do so, and to pay the cost of carriage. But under the present system the officers themselves have to pay that cost, and the district allowances do not nearly cover the-extra expenditure which they have to incur. I have been informed that no district allowances are paid to the linemen to whom I have referred. They feel that they labour under a special disability as compared with the Western Australian officers at Eucla. Whether this is so or not, I am not in a position to say, but certainly the complaint ought to be investigated. 1 know that there is a strong belief that the South Australian officers at Eucla are treated worse than are the Western Australian officers at .that place. While both technically receive the same district allowances, the fact is that all theWestern Australian officers have been placed in the senior positions. No doubt this is due to the fact that prior to Federation the Western Australian officers received higher salaries than did the. South Australian officers. But I desire to impress upon the Public Service ' Commissioner the necessity of dealing out even-handed justice in' this matter. I wish also to emphasize the objection urged by the honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the large amounts involved in these Additional Estimates. He referred particularly to the amounts set down for contingencies. In my opinion, there is a great deal in his complaints. It seems to me that the Estimates-in-Chief should have provided more fully for the probable expenditure of the year, and the large sums appearing in the Additional Estimates are not evidence of foresight on the part of those responsible for their preparation.

Does the amount cover the total expense. incurred by the Government, or will further accounts be presented later on, and has finality been reached in connection with the experiments ? I should be glad if the Treasurer would make a general statement as to the position of affairs. Some New South Wales pastoralists spent a large sum of money in bringing out Dr Danysz, and when he returned to Europe strong efforts were made, by circularizing pastures,protection boards,' local government boards, progress committees, pastoralists' unions, and farmers and settlers' associations, to bring pressure on the Government to allow the dissemination of the virus on the mainland. Apparently that effort failed; but the public should know what view the Government take in regard to the request. At one time' it seemed that the difference of opinion as to the advisability of allowing experiments on the mainland would be a casus belli between the State and the Commonwealth; but feeling has since cooled off. . No doubt, however, the interests at stake are sufficiently strong to cause further efforts to be made to secure the end aimed at, namely, the free distribution of disease for the extermination of the rabbit pest.",67

It was agreed that experiments should be made on Broughton Island, and we contributed towards the cost of erecting premises and obtaining animals for the purposes of the experiments - I saw Dr Tidswell in Sydney last week, and as the assistant left behind by Dr Danysz had complained that we intended to keep the virus and use it , taking credit for the destruction of the rabbits, which should be given to him, after consultation with the Prime Minister I wired to Dr Tidswell to send it back, which he has done.

As a justification for these items, I may mention that last year the revenue amounted to ,Â£9,753,000, and that this year it is estimated that it will be Â£11,931,000 The. cost of collecting the ""Customs and Excise revenue last year was Â£ 2 13s. 3d. per cent., and the cost this year is estimated at .Â£2 7s. 6d. per' cent. It will be seen that the cost is decreasing. Considering ""the tremendous increase in the work, that messages relating to the Tariff have been passing between the Houses, and that whenever a - Tariff item has been dealt with a telegram has had to be despatched to every Customs House in the Commonwealth, honourable members tan easily understand that,, not only do we require a lot of temporary assistance, but also that our account for telegrams must be very large.",69
744,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,What is the telephones ? - .,70
745,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I understand that the honourable member dealt with that question on the Estimates for the ""Treasurer's Department. This item for temporary assistance is not required in - connection with the service of which the honourable member for Coolgardie' has spoken. The question ' of sending the ""Kanakas back to their islands comes under dis- the Department of the Prime Minister, to whom I shall convey his representations.",70
746,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Order !- I ask the .Minister not to refer to that matter.,70
747,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I thought (Eden- that it was only fair to the honourable member for Coolgardie to say that in ' these Estimates there is no item covering that service. I take it that my answers to the inquiries are satisfactory. I hope that honourable members, recognising that the Department is well administered, will allow the Estimates to pass, especially asit is getting late.",70
748,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Wentworth) [10.45] - The Minister has talked about the care - exercised in keeping down the expenses of his Department - I desire to know how much of this ' ' temporary assistance ' ' is called into interpret the regulations which were referred to at.question time today, and'which enable persons to claim drawback on imports which have passed out of the country in another form. I can quite understand the expense to which the Department has been put in connection with the Tariff, but my information is to the effect that a good'deal of this extra assistance has been called in in order to follow up goods, for instance, sugar, which is imported and then exported as an ingredient of jam.",70
749,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the Estimates. \ Mr KELLY - Exactly , sir. I am.dealing with the item for temporary assistance, which is specially called into follow up imported"" sugar. - The CHAIRMAN - Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in discussing that matter.",70
750,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I do not wish in any way to transgress your ruling, sfr, although it seems particularly hard, especially in view of the fact that a large number, of persons have to be engaged for the special purpose of following up commodities and ascertaincost for ing what has happened' to them.",70
751,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Order . ! .,70
752,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Can the Minister-tell us how .many, clerks are employed in the Department in registering Ministerial decisions to deem imports other than what they are, . and so to-let them in free when they' are the imports of the Bulletin or the Lone Hand?",70
753,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Order. ! I point out to the honourable ""member that this continued attempt on his"" part .""-to-evade; my ruling can only lead to certain steps being taken by the Chair. He should not pursue that course.",70
754,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I think, sir, that your remark is unnecessarily severe.",71
755,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,The honourable member has not referred to clerks taking down telephone messages from Sydney.,71
756,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I have given that up as hopeless, because I have taken it for granted that the Minister is the only man who has sent a message by telephone for the purpose of gaining secrecy.",71
757,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Order !,71
758,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"You r remark, sir, was unnecessarily severe, because you know me well enough to be aware that I would not attempt to evade .your ruling. I ask the Minister, in, all seriousness, how much of that temporary assistance has been due to the action of Ministers in deeming things to be other than what they'really are when imported ?",71
759,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Eden Monaro-^Minister of Trade and Customs) [16.51] - I cannot give the honourable member the exact amount, but, already in connection with the present' Tariff, over 10,000 decisions hare been given, and I can quite .understand! that the registering and recording of them has cost a considerable sum. I am not in a position to say exactly what t|he cost has been, but if - the honourable member wishes, I will endeavour to ascertain the approximate amount.",71
760,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"Parramatta) [16.52] - I had intended to make reference to the question of experiments with the rabbit virus. I should like to ask the Minister' whether the Commonwealth Government have completely obliterated the whole question of rabbit extermination from their minds, because, in my opinion, there is no more serious question to Australia. It' seems to me peculiarly a function for the Federal Government. I will not press the matter now,, but it ought to be seriously raised' in this House at an early date, with - a view of obtaining from! the Government a statement of what they propose to do further whh regard to the grave national peril that is threatening our pas toral industry. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL. Bill returned from the Senate,. with a message intimating that that House had considered the messages of the House' of Representatives with regard to it, and did not now request the House to make certain amendments originally requested, and had agreed to modifications made by the House with regard to certain requests, had agreed to certain consequential amendments made by. the House, had resolved to further press requests for certain amend- * ments, and again requested the House to make such amendments. The Senate also requested the House of Representatives to further amend the Bill as indicated in regard to requested amendments not made, or partly made, or modified by the .House of - Representatives. Motion (by Sir William LYNE) proposed - That the consideration of the foregoing message in Committee of the whole House be made an order of the day for Tuesday next.",71
761,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I rise to a point of order. I desire your ruling, sir, as to whether the Senate has power to return a second time to this House, with requests for amendments, any proposed law, appropriating - revenue or imposing taxation, which the Senate cannot amend. The Constitution lays down that. The Senate may at any stage return to . the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate - may not amend, requesting by message the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein, and the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make an 5of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. I submit for your ruling the question whether, having done that,- the Senate has not complied to the full with the provisions of the Constitution, and ' whether, 1 when this House has dealt with the requested omissions or amendments, with or without modifications, and returnedthe Bill to the Senate, the power of the Senate has not ceased. I . submit that it has ceased, and that the Senate cannot cavil further at the decision arrived at by this House in regard' to its requests'. '",71
762,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"What does the honourable member say is the meaning of the 7 words "" at any stage"" ?",71
763,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I submit that the words "" at any stage"" mean only once""; and that it-is not a continuous.power,..and that the Senate has fulfilled all its powers, and that when we have dealt with its requests, the matter has reached finality.",71
764,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,"I am not prepared to give a ruling on the question, but on' being asked so to do, I ought to give the House such information as I am possessed of. In the first' place, it is impossible to look anywhere for precedents, because I know of no other Constitution which so distributes the financial power between the. respective Houses as does ours. We must therefore be guided wholly by our own Constitution, and by the practice which we have set up. Precisely the same point arose on the consideration of the first Tariff, and it was agreed by the then House that whether or not the message which was sent, as this message has been sent, from another place to us, should 'be received, was entirely a matter to be determined by the House itself. There were not then, there are not now, any joint Standing Orders dealing with the matter, - so that when this question is_ again called on on the day for which it may be set down, it will ' be for the House either to proceed, with the. consideration of the message, or to deal with it as itmay* think fit, or to refuse to consider it, precisely as the House at that moment pleases. I may.remind the House that, on the last occasion, it was decided to take the message into consideration', but' the following resolution was adoptedThat, having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early . enactment of a Federal Tariff, and pending. the adoption of joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect to this. message, and resolves to receive and consider it forthwith. That is the course that was followed on that occasion', and that may, or may not, be followed on this occasion, as the House, led' by the Government, decide. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) posedThat the House do now adjourn.",72
765,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Parramatta) [10.59] - May we take it that the Minister intends definitely to proceed with the Tariff on Tuesday ?,72
766,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION LEAGUE OF,Yes . Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at n.o p.m. U05] pro,72
