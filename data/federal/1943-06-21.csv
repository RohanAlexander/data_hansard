3,Mr CURTIN,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR," It is with deep regret that I inform honourable members of the death of the Honourable John MCNeill, a former member of the House of Representatives and a Minister of the Crown, which occurred in Sydney on the 14th June, 1943. This sad event has removed from his family, and from a wide circle of friends, a man who, due to his personal nf tt|c &txte?ntt| parliament. (NINTH PERIOD.) adjourned to a date and hour to be fixed Representatives to meet on the 21st June, integrity and outstanding qualities, was held in the highest esteem by his fellows. Mr MCNeill was first elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Wannon, Victoria, at the general election in 1922. He was defeated at the genera] election in 1925, but again successfully contested the Wannon seat at the general election in 1929. He was appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Eepatriation on the 3rd March, 1931, and held that portfolio until the resignation of the Government on the 6th January, 1932. He was defeated at the general election in December, 1931. The late honourable gentleman was a member of the Central Wool Committee, which arranges for the acquisition in Australia by the United Kingdom Government of the Australian wool clip during the war. He was also a representative of the Australian Workers Union on the Trade Unions Advisory Panel, which was to advise the Government on industrial matters in relation to the war. The experience which Mr MCNeill had gained in the industrial field fitted him to take an honoured place in this Parliament, and his occupancy of the position of Minister for Health in the Labour Government led by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was marked by sound administration. The name of John MCNeill will, however, be remembered most by the workers of this country for his zealous and untiring labours on behalf of the principles and ideals of the trade union movement, of which he was both a pioneer and a leader. He gave his life to this work, and the results of his efforts still live on. To the Australian Workers Union, of which he was general president and also secretary of the New South Wales branch, he gave almost .a lifetime of service, and to it, as well as to the nation generally, his death is a severe loss. We extend to his widow and family our deepest sympathy in the irreparable loss of one who, by his sterling character, won the affection of all who knew him. John MCNeill was a most lovable as well as a most capable man. He was characterized by the highest degree of integrity, and I venture to - believe that his name will endure in the industrial history of this country for many decades. He played a foundational part in the development of the great Labour movement of Australia. He championed always the rights of ""the bottom dog"", but he stood loyally by the principle of conciliation and arbitration, believing that if just claims were fairly stated the impartial consideration of them would result in an increasing measure of justice being accorded to the masses on whose behalf he pleaded. It was my humble privilege, at the first conference that I attended in .any capacity in my association with the Labour movement, to sit next to John MCNeill. At the time, I was very young; in fact, I was not quite 21 years of age. He helped me very greatly on that day, and all through the years that have .since - elapsed I have been his debtor. I pay tribute to the* work of a great Australian, in the belief that his memory will endure. As a tribute to the service which he rendered to the 'Commonwealth of Australia as a Minister of the Crown, the honourable gentleman was accorded a State funeral. I move That this House - records its sincere - ait the death of the Honourable John MCNeill, former member of the House of 'Representatives for the Division of Wannon and a merits, I moveMinister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and .tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and. family in their bereavement. Mr Ourtin.",12
4,Mr FADDEN,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR," I endorse the sentiments that have been so reverently - expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curitih), and also associate with them the - Opposition as a whole. I was not privileged to know very intimately the late Mr MCNeill, but I had some slight association with him. His death may well be described as a national loss. I extend to those who are left to mourn his passing the heartfelt sympathy of those on whose behalf I speak.",13
5,Mr MARTENS,DISTINGUISHED VISITOR," I , too, .support the motion. I was privileged to know the late John MCNeill for a very long time; as a matterof fact, he and I worked (together as officials of the Australian Workers Union, in days when the task of a union official was indeed a hard one. There was no job of which he was afraid, and no man whom he could not meet. He was courteous, clean living, and a good worker.. If all of us, at our death, have consciences as clean as his, then we shall have done no wrong. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ASSENT TO BILLS. Assent to the following bills - reported :War-time (Company) Tax Assessment 'Bill 1943. Australian Soldiers' - Repatriation Bill 1943. NA CONFIDENCE. .
