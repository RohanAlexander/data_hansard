1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements",12
2,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. He has said that reforming Federal-State relations would require 'a commitment of leadership'. Exactly what new financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States is the Prime Minister committed to? MIt HAWKE-As the Leader of the Opposition has gone to this whole question that has been raised by the interchange with the Premiers, I think it appropriate that I should take this opportunity of bringing the House up to date with the latest discussions that I have had with them. Let me preface my answer by indicating that, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to raise the question of leadership and whether appropriate leadership has been given in this matter, I recommend that he read the communique issued at the end of the last Premiers Conference, where the Premiers indicated their view about the quality of the leadership that has been provided and the outcomes for permanent benefit to the Australian people that have come from that leadership. Indeed, I will go to what those benefits have been in elaborating on this answer to the Leader of the Opposition and, through him, to the House on what the latest position is. I had a telephone hook-up with all the Premiers and Chief Ministers shortly after 11 o'clock this morning, and the discussion lasted about 50 minutes. Premiers Goss and Lawrence had to leave before that discussion was concluded. The Premiers and Chief Ministers are to have a further discussion amQngst themselves before making a decision about the Perth conference. During the discussion I had with the Premiers and Chief Ministers I made the following points: I said believed it made sense for the Perth conference to proceed as planned; Australia, as I pointed out, had already gained very much from the Special Premiers Conference process which I had initiated last year. I remind the House again-and I hope even those opposite will concede that these are very significant and continuing benefits for the people of Australia-that we now have established the National Rail Corporation, the National Road Transport Commission and the National Electricity Grid Management Council; we have major progress and regulatory reform; and we have significant progress in reviewing functional areas of government activity.",12

4,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Mr Hawker-They have not happened yet.,12
5,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members are so unacquainted with reform that they are frightened when they see it. I was saying, finally, that there has been significant progress in reviewing functional areas of government activity to avoid, as far as possible, duplication of waste with the aim of improving the quality of services. All those things are runs on the board which will be, as I say, of continuing benefit to the people of this country. In my viewwhich is consistent with the very best advice available to my Government-the proposal for a national income tax sharing arrangement agreed between Premiers and Chief Ministers is, for all practical purposes, a State income tax. I pointed out that my Government did not support the imposition of such a tax; nor did I believe that the Australian people would want that burden. May I say that last week honourable members opposite were yelling out and screaming that the Premiers' proposal was not for a State income tax, so they share the Premiers' view. I said that the details of the States' proposal and of the Commonwealth's position were, however, properly a matter for discussion in Perth. While rejecting any concept containing the elements of a State income tax, my Government, as I pointed out to them, is that I conscious of the States' understandable concern to achieve a greater degree of certainty in the financial resources available to them, and was considering means by which more certainty in Commonwealth disbursements might in fact be achieved. I said I believed that there was a strong case for the meeting in Perth to proceed, even if in the event it did not prove possible to make much progress on the question of vertical fiscal imbalance. It was difficult to believe that the States would not emerge from Perth with at least some improvement in financial arrangements. I pointed out that, as leaders, we had a collective responsibility to the Australian community to progress the many issues on what was a far-reaching and wide-ranging agenda. Items on the agenda, at their request, included employment, the environment, community violence and gun control, education, health and aged care. I pointed out that it seemed to me that, in a situation where they could not do worse-if we put the worse case scenario where they could not do worse in regard to their financial relations situation, and inevitably, I would have thought1 would do better-we had an overriding responsibility to the people that we represent at the Commonwealth and State levels to deal with that wide range of matters. Let me say that it is my sincere hope that the States and Territories will see the common sense in continuing to pursue such matters in a cooperative and constructive manner consistent with the best interests of all Australians. But let me repeat to this House what I said to my Caucus this morning: I am not, however, prepared to have the whole of the Special Premiers Conference process held to ransom for a State tax. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Third Runway,",12
6,Mr DUBOIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. What is the current position on the environmental impact statement on the proposed third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport?",13
7,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for his continuing interest in this issue on behalf of his constituents. I am sure that Parliament is aware that on 21 March 1989 the Cabinet agreed to a three-part decision in relation to Kingsford-Smith Airport. The first part was to establish a review of traffic management arrangements at Sydney Airport to be undertaken in consultation with the airlines, the State Government and other interested parties. The second part was to commence the production of an environmental impact statement on the construction of a third, medium spaced, parallel runway at Sydney AirpOlt on the basis that construction would proceed if there was a satisfactory outcome on the EIS. The third part was to proceed with the staged development of Badgerys Creek as Sydney's second major airport. The issue that I dealt with, of course, was the second of those three components. On 20 September 1990, the draft EIS was released by the Federal Airports Corporation. There was a three-month period then for public comment. On 3 January 1991, almost 1,900 submissions were received and passed to the Federal Airports Corporation for consideration in the preparation of its supplement to the draft EIS. The supplement was then submitted to my Department and made available on 2 October 1991. Today, according to the timetable that I had under my statutory obligations, I forwarded to the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, my recommendations following consideration of my Depattment's comments on the environmental assessment report. A preliminary copy of my Department's report has also been made available to the Prime Minister. I consider that the environmental impact process has identified and assessed important environmental issues associated with the third runway proposal. It is now proposed to have the third runway proposal considered by the Cabinet and the Caucus, and that will be considered tomorrow. Commonwealth-State Financial AITangements",13
8,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister, and follows his answer to the first question. Is the Prime Minister aware of a letter from the honourable member for Blaxland circulated to MPs last night calling for a new Commonwealth proposal offering the States guaranteed real increases in their Commonwealth grants over a three-year period? Is the Government considering this proposal, and has it asked the honourable member for Blaxland for more details of his plan?",13
9,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I intend no disrespect to the honourable member for Blaxland when I say that I have not read his letter. From his previous experience as Treasurer, he would agree with me that we cannot always get around to reading these sorts of letters. Mr MCGauran-lunk mail, is it?",14
10,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will certainly do him the credit that he deserves and, as soon as possible-I have been somewhat diverted by phone calls and so on-I will get around to reading his letter. From a reading of the report of what is contained in that letter, it goes to some issues which have been in the minds of my colleagues. I have pointed out in my discussions with the Premiers that last year, when the honourable member for Blaxland was Treasurer, we were conscious of the very real concern that Premiers and Chief Ministers have about what certainty is available to them in regard to their financial resources. That is a perfectly understandable position. The former Treasurer and I addressed that last year when we gave the States a commitment to a real terms guarantee for three years. To us that seemed a very sensible thing to do to meet, at least in some respect, the concerns which they felt. I have said-we talked about it in the Cabinet and I have said it to the Premiersthat it is possible to look at some elaboration of that idea which may go even further in giving them some greater degree of certainty in this matter. No-one has any argument about their concern. The question is how we address that concern, because at all points we have to guarantee that the Federal Government will not in any way take any action which will militate against the responsibility it must exercise with the macro-economic management of the Australian economy. Within that constraint we have indicated a preparedness to look at ways in which we may be able to improve the certitude which they have in these matters. That is why in this fairly lengthy hook-up this morning I attempted to say to the Premiers that I think they are not behaving sensibly in terms of their own interests. Opposition members-Oh!",14
11,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not saying anything here that I have not said to them. To me it seems impossible to come to the conclusion that, if we have the conference in Perth and discuss this issue, they are not in one way or another going to come out with some improvement in their financial position. That being the case, on that score it seems sensible that they should have the meeting; but, overwhelmingly, it seems that we together have the responsibility to address that broad agenda which covers so many issues of intrinsic importance to the people of this country. Disability Support Pension",14
12,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Can the Minister outline the benefits for people with a disability of the new disability support pension, which comes into effect today?",14
13,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question, which goes to the establishment of the new disability support pension, today being the first day of its operation. We have had essentially the same payment since the invalid pension was introduced in this country in 1904 in New South Wales and 1908 in the rest of Australia. The change not only in the name but also in the essential criteria for assessment of pensions for those with disabilities represents a very historic change. It is historic essentially because it throws the emphasis more on the capacities of people with disabilities than on their incapacities, more on their abilities than on their disabilities; that is, in the assessment of people for payments for social security, the level of impairment needs to be assessed and is very important. But also, as part of this reform, we have introduced a panel assessment process which will mean that, where people are able to play any part in the work force or undertake training or rehabilitation, there will be a comprehensive assessment so that people are encouraged to take those steps. The reform that commences today looks at people's potential, at what they can achieve and what they can do, and not at those factors which in the past have excluded them from activity and participation in the community. There are few reforms as significant as this reform which commences today in the form of this income security payment. Of course, it would not be right to introduce a reform of this kind and not associate with it increased opportunities for rehabilitation and for people to participate in the work force. In the Budget, we announced an additional 4,000 new employment places for younger people with disabilities, a very significant increase in the number of places in terms of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, and additional places in terms of Jobtrain, Jobstart and Job Search. This new payment will be associated with specific opportunities which should considerably advance the situation of people with disabilities and give them the chance, increasingly, to get the wherewithal, the training or the rehabilitation that they need to participate more fully within the community. A characteristic of this Government, in areas such as income security, social policy, education and training, health and so on, has been to look for comprehensive reforms so that links are drawn between one department and another and between one level of government and another. At the last Premiers Conference, we linked these reforms to a reshaping and a clarification of the role of the Commonwealth and the States. One of the differences between the Government and the Opposition is that, when we make changes and propose reform, we look at the broader implications to try to ensure not only that the reform is in the interests of people in the short term but also that it has longer term implications. That is something of the worry about Opposition taxation policy and its implications for groups such as this. One of the tests, one of the questions we are entitled to ask, is whether that policy, undercut as it will be by very substantial cuts in the welfare area, is essentially about restoring people to the community, ensuring that people have greater opportunities and ensuring that people are able to build on their capacities, or whether it is about the reverse. Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements",14
14,Mr CHANEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I refer to the Minister's statement yesterday morning that there was not very much right with the plan of the States and Territories for a guaranteed share of income tax revenue. When she made that statement, was she just innocently pre-empting a Cabinet announcement or was she doing the dirty work of the honourable member for Blaxland?",15
15,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not want to make any comment on the Cabinet decision; the Prime Minister answered that question yesterday. But I would like to refer to an issue that the shadow Minister for the environment never refers to, and that is the issue of the environment. Opposition members-Oh! Oh! Oh!",15
16,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Oh! Oh! Oh! The reality of it isMr MCGauran interjecting,15
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.,15
18,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this House over the last 20 months this man has never saidMr Chaney-I raise a point of order. My point of order is quite simple. If there is any requirement of relevance at all, this Minister is clearly breaching it. I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to just note the words that she used. She moved straight from the question into something which had nothing to do with the question that was asked.",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Neither the honourable member for Pearce nor I are aware of what decisions the Cabinet made. The Minister might be going to tell us.,15

23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable members on my left will cease interjecting. The House will come to order. Mr Broadbent interjecting,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Corinella will cease interjecting.,16
25,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point that I was making was that it is about time that the shadow Minister for the envirorunent actually asked me some questions on the environment. In the last 20 months this man has not asked me one question of substance on the envirorunent. The reason for that is that he has no credible policies, he has no issues on which he can or does ever make a statement, and when he starts to ask me some relevant questions about the envirorunent, I will answer them. Mr MCGauran-Is this another blonde joke? Is she one of the brains trust?",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Gippsland interjects again, I will name him. Taxation  Minister: what information is he able to provide on the implications of a flatter income tax scale for income distribution, and is it the Government's intention to introduce such an income tax scale?",16
27,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to a very, very important issue which I assure him, as I think he knows, will become of increasing importance with each passing month after the election in 1993. The Treasurer has referred, as you will recall, Mr Speaker, to IMF paper on the value added tax. As the Treasurer said yesterday, the inherent regressivity of a value added tax is, of course, as the honourable member for Shortland knows, one of the reasons why we on this side of the House profoundly and unanimously reject such a tax. Interestingly, the IMF paper attempts to counter that argument about the inherent regressivity of such a tax, and it attempts to do so by referring to the impact of the entire tax system on the distribution of income. This is what the IMF argued on this point in the IMF paper: VAT is not designed to correct for income or wealth inequalities. Other parts of the tax system are supposed to do that, most obviously the progressive personal income tax. So one looks at the tax system as a whole, and if one is trying to argue against the admitted regressivity of the VAT type tax, then one looks for the correction of that in the entire tax system. That should be corrected, says the IMF, by a progressive income tax. Interestingly the Leader of the Opposition is committed to a flatter income tax scalenot a more progressive income tax scale, but a flatter tax scale. Let people understand fully what that means. The IMF is saying, 'Yes, that is regressive, but one looks at the whole tax system and one has a progressive income tax system to offset the regressivity of the VAT system'. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'No, we won't have a more progressive tax system; we will have a flatter income tax scale'. In fact, as is a matter of record, he will not even rule out a flat income tax. The IMF paper goes on to say: Combined with the introduction of VAT, income tax collections should be strengthened to ensure that the progressive rates legislated are actually collected. Here again we come to the fundamental weakness in the Leader of the Opposition's position. As we all know, he would emasculate the capital gains tax so that, once again, as occurred under the previous conservative regime, high income earners in this country could convert income into capital and thereby avoid income tax. They did so before, and the they would again under the proposals being talked about by those opposite. So, instead of strengthening the income tax base, the Leader of the Opposition would fundamentally weaken the base and thereby compound yet again the regressivity of the package about which he is speaking. In sum, the impact of the Leader of the Opposition's proposal is profoundly regressive. Firstly, the Opposition would introduce a tax which is in itself inherently regressive. The goods and services tax is itself profoundly regressive. The Opposition would then - ke services away from the poor-not provide better services. It would be committed to a flatter, that is, more regressive, income tax scale, and it would weaken the income tax base by emasculating the capital gains tax. We on this side of the House cannot wait for the introduction of this package-we think it will be next week-because we will tear those opposite to pieces, and the people of Australia will reject them. Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements",16
28,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It follows on the non-answer by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to the previous question by the honourable member for Pearce. Does the Prime Minister believe that the revelation by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that Cabinet had rejected the States' proposal for a guaranteed share of income taxes was the straw that broke the Special Premiers Conference back? Did the Minister's comments needlessly complicate sensitive negotiations with the States-yes or no? Was the Minister's pre-emption of these negotiations an innocent transgression or was it another example of the Keating camp's attempt to undermine the Government? WiII the Prime Minister discipline this Minister?",17
29,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there is any question of real political interest about who may have changed their position with regard to the States' proposal for an income tax, it is with those opposite. I ask honourable members to recall what happened in this House last week. When the proposal of the Premiers was put out those opposite said, 'It is not a State income tax', and they embraced it. They said it was a great idea, and that we were wrong in calling it a State income tax. But I have noticed that, since last week, they seem to have changed their position. They do not seem to have been embracing with such enthusiasm today or yesterday the States' proposal. I wonder why that is. Perhaps I can offer an explanation of the real change that has taken place between their position last week and what appears to be their position today.",17
30,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is still the same. Mr HAWKEIt is still the same. Thank you very much.,17
31,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has never changed.,17
32,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-It has never moved. Now we know that the Leader of the Opposition is going to go to the Australian people with this lovely proposition. He is going to say, 'Have I got a bargain for you, and let me tell you good people what that bargain is'. Firstly, he is going to say, 'I am going to whack a great goods and services tax on you which is going to be on all your goods and services. Isn't that good news for you?'. Secondly, he will say to the good people of Australia, 'Having whacked you around the ears with a whopping great goods and services tax, I am going to reduce Commonwealth income taxes. Isn't that good news?'. Thirdly, he will say, 'I support giving the States power to impose their income tax'. What a lovely package! What a lovely bargain the Leader of the Opposition has for the Australian people. No wonder the Queensland branch of the National Party is looking so glum.",17

35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo!,17
36,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not often in the history of Australian politics that the Queensland Nationals are first. They will be first off the starting blocks in running away from that bargain. They would not want to be selling that bill of goods. They will quickly be followed by the rest of the National Party. Tim will desert him. It is as sure as night follows day that the National Party will desert him. Opposition members-Oh!,17
37,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Andrew is not always wrong. Just occasionally in his political career he came up with a memorable line. He thought it was that good that he even called one of his horses after it. It did not do much good either. As far as I am concerned-I speak for every member on this side of the House-we hope,17

40,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I also speak for some people on the Opposition side of politics. There is nothing in politics I would look forward to more than the Leader of the Opposition going around the towns, the cities, the hamlets and the shopping malls of this country saying, 'Boy have I got a bargain for you-a goods and services tax, a reduction of Commonwealth tax, but a great increase in State income taxes'. I say to him, 'Good luck to you, mate. We will meet you and thrash you'. Australian National",18

54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister might get on with it.,18
55,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I met with a very representative group of railway employees this morning. They represented the concerns of their members very well. Honourable members would generally be aware of the fact that with the amount of restructuring that is taking place in the railway industry at present, that has necessarily been accompanied by redundancies. The question for AN has been whether it would be able to maintain a policy which it had maintained up until fairly recently, as the honourable member for Grey would be aware because he not only encouraged the adoption of that particular policy but defended it to the extent that anyone could have defended it. The policy which AN had pursued in relation to redundancy was that there would be no forced redundancies and there would be no forced relocation. In the context of that, it was possible, as the honourable member for was Grey knows, for AN to reduce its work force from something like 13,000 at the time that AN started to exist in 1977 to 6,000. That means that the work force of AN was reduced by more than 50 per cent in an industrial context of no forced retrenchments and no forced relocations. That, of course, reflects very great credit on the management of AN, which was able, together with the unions and the employees, to bring about what in anyone's terms must be seen as a very significant improvement in the manning levels within any type of industrial operation. In addition, because of the acceleration of restructuring more recently, it became necessary for AN in the first place to abandon the no forced relocation policy. It has now reached the point where it has found it necessary as well to abandon the no forced retrenchments policy. I regret that, I know the honourable member for Grey regrets that, and people who are involved in any way with the rail industry, rail employees and the future of rail also regret that. But the unions have indicated that, in the context of all of this restructuring and proving the capacity of rail to lock itself into the land transport industry generally, they do accept and understand that it will be necessary for rail to become a leaner operation. That is one of the basic tenets of our concern in the approach that we have taken to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. What the unions were concerned about doing today was to seek some assurances in connection with the processes which are presently under way. The AN management indicated that it would have been necessary for it to issue retrenchment notices to about 160 employees of Tasrail tomorrow. It is expected that there will be a reduction in AN's 6,000 work force, to which I have made reference, of about 1,800, perhaps even 2,000, in the future, which means that that 13,000 that I referred to would, in effect, be reduced to 4,000. As a result of that, AN would become a much leaner, more efficient and more competitive and profitable rail operation. I want to emphasise to the honourable member for Grey who asked this question because of his concernMr TIm Fischer interjecting",18
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I The honourable member for Farrer will resume his seat or I will deal with him. Mr Fife-I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the length of the Minister's question.,19

69,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition needs to be put back on a leash as well.,20
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,20
71,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Cabinet was prepared to adopt for those employees an enhanced redundancy package that would have the effect of ensuring that after 20 years of dedicated commitment to the railway industry, the Australian community and the public sector, those employees would finish up with about $37,000 or $38,000 instead of about $19,500, which would have been miserable in the extreme under those circumstances. That is a significant improvement. Let me say in conclusion that I appreciate the way in which Cabinet responded to those representations that I made to it. I know that people-like the honourable member for Grey-who represent railway areas and railway employees, were pleased to see the extent to which that improvement was brought about. Those people who are here will be able to report back to their work mates and represent very clearly the contrasting attitudes of the Government, which endorses that proposal, and those of Opposition members who would drag them down. Solicitor-General  to the Attorney-General. Could the Attorney confirm that while Dr Gavan Griffith is in private practice at the Melbourne and Sydney Bars, he will retain the title of Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Australia? Is there any precedent for persons to retain their Commonwealth titles of office while engaged in private business? Does this new precedent mean that Commonwealth public servants may take time off to improve their financial position while continuing to use their Commonwealth title of office? If so, could we take it from this that, for example, General Gration could take 12 months off to find other gainful employment with someone requiring the advice of a professional soldier while rejoicing in the title of Chief of the Defence Force? Where will the precedent end?",20
72,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the rather long question-it is a bit difficult to remember all of the points-firstly, it is true that, as has been aired in this place over the last several days, the Solicitor-General applied for leave. That leave was granted and he intends to return to private practice for part of that leave. During that period, however, he will still be acting in various cases for the Commonwealth. Those particular cases will be in connection with the special committee of Solicitors-Genera1. He will also be acting for Australia in the International Court of Justice. In relation to those matters-I think it came out the other day-he will be available to give advice to the Government when and if required. Certain conditions were involved in granting leave to the Solicitor-General to allow him to engage in private practice. Those conditions related, of course, to concerns about what work he would be doing. They were: firstly, that he would not engage in practice on behalf of interests in connict with those of the Commonwealth, Ministers and statutory authorities, including cases in which the Commonwealth had an interest; secondly, that he would not accept marked briefs from the Australian Government Solicitor; that he would not use briefs and mark them himself?",20

79,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether it would be more pleasing to the Opposition if one of the conditions were that he was able to use them; those opposite cannot have it both ways. We are saying that they cannot be used in private practice. Finally, he would reimburse the Commonwealth for the cost of any Commonwealth property that he used whilst in private practice. For example, if he continued to use the mobile phone he would be expected to pay for it.",21
80,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order!,21
82,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, those opposite might prefer that that not be the case; that, in fact, the Commonwealth pay for those facilities. I can assure honourable members that this is not on. Finally, the honourable member loves to drag other people into these matters; what relevance it has, I am not quite sure. In relation to what other public servants may do-he mentioned someone of the stature of General Gration in the Defence Force-that question should be directed to the relevant Minister. I have no idea of the reference to General Gration. I do not know why, in this obsessive and continuing attack on the Solicitor-General, those opposite want to drag General Gration into the matter-but that is a matter for them. What will be done in the future is not for me to decide. As I have said to those opposite over and over again, various factors were involved here. The power to grant leave is quite clear. The power to grant the right of private practice whilst on leave, subject to certain conditions, is also clear. What will happen in relation to other statutory officers is a matter for the Minister concerned, not for me. The Opposition's great concern for what people, as office holders, do does not necessarily extend to its side of the House. What was the attitude of the honourable member for Kooyong and those others opposite mouthing sanctimonious utterances at the time a Speaker of this House represented employers against workers in the Arbitration Commission? Interest Rates: Housing",21
83,Mrs JAKOBSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services whether he would inform the House of the effect of falling interest rates on the home buyers of Australia and the housing industry.",21
84,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her question. The further reduction in cash rates announced last week by the Treasurer means that home loan interest rates have fallen by more than five percentage points over the last 18 months. Falls in interest rates will continue the trend of lower mortgage interest rates for home buyers and higher levels of activity for the building industry. The most recent Housing Industry Association and Commonwealth Bank affordability index shows that lower interest rates have improved housing affordability to its best rate for three years. Housing affordability has improved to its best level since June 1988. Average mortgage repayments have fallen to just over 28 per cent of average household income compared with a peak of around 30 per cent in the September quarter 1989. We can expect more families to be able to buy their first home. Many home buyers are taking advantage of lower interest rates to bridge the deposit gap. The latest ABS figures on housing approvals increased by 15 per cent over the September quarter and by over 18 per cent on the same quarter last year. The same pattern has been reflected in housing starts. The Indicative Planning Council's reliable forecast of 137,000 housing starts this financial year will be met. This is an increase of 13 per cent on last year and will have a significant impact on employment. We estimate that this increase in housing starts will add over 10,000 jobs to the housing construction iridustry. Lower interest rates also have the effect of stabilising rent levels in the private rental market, and moderate to high vacancy rates in almost all capital cities coupled with reduced costs for investors should see rents generally fall in real terms. There was an opportunity yesterday for me to comment on these and other matters before the Housing Industry Association meeting here in Canberra. I noticed this morning that apparently the Opposition spokesperson for the Treasury, the honourable member for Flinders, also made an appearance at the Housing Industry Association meeting. The questioning seemed to go to the prospects for the industry, and I think generally speaking people felt reasonably optimistic, but there was real concern in the questions answered by Mr Reith on behalf of the Opposition about the impact of a goods and services tax on the housing industry. People felt there would be, for a house valued at $100,000 with a 12.5 per cent tax, perhaps a $10,000 additional cost for new home buyers. The figures previously quoted in the House seemed to confirm this view. We hear a great deal from those jocular gents on the other side of the House about what they might do, what they could do, when they will announce it and what it might be composed of, but on the first occasion when the honourable member for FlindersMr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 and relevance. The question from the honourable member for Cowan was very specific. It asked for information regarding the effect of the of interest rates on first home buyers and the housing industry. At the moment the Minister is getting into very hypothetical areas about consumption taxes, and I would ask you to request him to either get back to the question or draw his answer to a close.",21
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister was answering a question on the housing industry. The Minister is in order.,22
86,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of affordability, I would have thought that a prospective impost of 12.5 per cent or $10,000 at a critical stage in the life cycle of new home buyers would deserve an answer. Frankly, the honourable member for Flinders could not give a precise answer; he could not stand up to any questioning. The best we see from the Leader of the Opposition is his capacity to do various jumbles and laughs, while essentially failing to defend or advance his arguments in relation to the goods and services tax",22

91,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I went to the Housing Industry meeting yesterday and I answered the questions as honestly and as clearly as I could. But when the Opposition is questioned on its proposition in terms of a consumption tax it has not got the guts to put forward a straightforward answer. Mr Reith interjecting,22
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition continues to interject I will name him.,22
93,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the reality. What we get in terms of policy from this Opposition is obfuscation. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition is asked a specific question he runs away. He has been running away from the date of announcement for weeks and months because he cannot answer hard questions. That is what happened at the Housing fall Industry Association meeting yesterday-the Leader of the Opposition copped one or two hard questions and he could not answer them. So the improvement in the housing industry, which I think most honourable members would we1come-137,000 starts-the improvement in affordability and the fact that people can look for some stability in this industry. But that is going to be threatened by honourable members opposite who are essentially going to put an impost on people and cannot in fact provide",22
94,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
95,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact of the matter is that, if one is asked about compensation, one has to answer. When we considered the possibility of a tax in 1985, we looked at the question of compensation, and it required very, very rigorous analysis. And if there is one thing about this Opposition, it is that it does not stand up to rigorous analysis, which is why this idiot over here has to keep talking about relevance. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",22
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister will withdraw that remark.,23
97,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Solicitor-General  to the Attorney-General, and it flows from the answer that he gave a short time ago wherein, amongst the remarks that he passed, he s-id that the Solicitor-General would not receIve marked briefs-which presupposes that the other sort, unmarked briefs, or ones that enable him to mark his own fee, will be provided. I ask him to confirm that the Solicitor-General will receive some brief other payments for the services to which he, the Attorney, referred in his answer. Also, what is the Attorney's estimate of the total cost of this extraordinary deal, which will cover I assume, travel, accommodation, and cars, 'together with the costs of the Acting Solicitor-General?",23
98,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I never assume any particular knowledge on the part of the honourable member for Kooyong, but I would have thought he knew what an unmarked brief was. H is the sort of brief that he would have had a few of I would have thought. All I am saying is that any work done by the Solicitor General in relation to any matters he may receive from the Australian Government Solicitor will be unmarked; that is, it will be a brief marked with a fee. In relation to the other matters that the honourable member raised, the Solicitoraspects General, as I indicated earlier, will be called upon from time to time to do work for the Commonwealth. During that time he will be on leave. That is the point. ",23

101,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Solicitor-General has been granted leave of absence for 12 months. He will not be paid for 12 months leave of because of the fact that his entitlements will be less than that. There will be, as I said earlier, times when he will return to do work for the Commonwealth, both in the courts-particularly internationally-and also in relation to the committee of SolicitorsGeneral. Mr Bradford interjecting",23
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I warn the honourfees or able member for MCPherson. Mr Dl.JFFY - In respect of matters that he is called back to undertake, he will not be on leave. I do not know whether there is some tremendous difficulty in understanding that, but I will repeat it: when the Solicitor-General is working for the Commonwealth, he is not on leave. Retail Sales Figures",23
103,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Treasurer can he tell the House whether today's retail sales figures are consistent with the assessment that the economy has begun to emerge from the recession.,23
104,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The September figures were released this morning, and they confirm that not we are coming out of recession. Let me first of all note that the monthly retail sales figures, like any monthly figures, are inhere-t1y volatile. That said, there are many pleasmg to the figures. First, retail sales in the September quarter grew strongly-by 2.9 per cent in seasonally adjusted constant dollar not terms. That is the first rise since the September quarter of 1990. Retail sales also rose by 3.3 per cent in seasonally adjusted current dollar terms. This result indicates that private consumption expenditure' for the September quarter is likely to have grown strongly. On the aspect of degree of balance in the recovery, it is also pleasing to see that Western Australia and Victoria have been amongst the States with the most pronounced turnaround in retail trade in recent months. Secondly, the trend rate of growth in retail sales is now 0.6 per cent per quarter, or double the trend rate of growth estimated for the 12 months to September. This means that we are likely to continue to see a recovery in consumption expenditure. I must say that today's results are consistent with the Budget forecast for the recovery. The Budget forecast had the major source of growth as a turnaround in the stock cycle, dwelling investment and growth in private consumption. The latest data indicate that stock decumulation has virtually ceased, which will remove a factor detracting from growth. Finance approval for new homes, the sector relevant for economic activity, has grown by almost 17 per cent in the 17 months to August, while private residential building approvals have grown by almost 15 per cent in the three months to September. Also, business surveys indicate improved expectations for sales and profits. More importantly for sustained job growth, expectations of investment have improved. All this points to the fact that the economy is coming out of the recession and that the Budget forecasts are basically on track. Better Cities Program",23
105,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister described a report by a senior journalist, Mr Glen Milne, as 'an absolutely furphy'. Today Mr Milne repeats his claims and quotes from a Cabinet document to support his case that the Government considered committing $650m to the so-called better cities program, usually referred to as the 'mad cities fantasy', in the current financial year for spending over the life of the program. Does the Prime Minister now admit that he misled the Parliament yesterday? If not, in order to clarify who is telling the truth, will he table the already leaked Cabinet submission entitled 'Building Better CitiesState Proposals and Progress'?",24
106,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore very much for this question. The clear implication of the report in yesterday'S Australian is that spending under the building better cities program would be brought forward as part of an employment creation program. This is simply not true. The proposal taken to Cabinet by Minister Howe did not seek to vary the Forward Estimates set out in the Budget. Many of the proposals put forward by the States for funding under the better cities program will take longer than one year to complete. It is reasonable, therefore, to provide the States with certainty of Commonwealth funding by making commitments on out-year funding in line with the proposal and with Forward Estimates. The report, in suggesting that the Government is considering bringing forward 80 per cent of the proposed funding under the better cities program, to increase employment, is a furphy, and I will confirm it, as I did yesterday, with the journalist in question. Mr Snowdon interjecting",24
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory will cease interjecting. Education: TAFE Funding,24
108,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Minister for Employment, Education and Training advise the House of the progress of discussions with the States in addressing the current crisis in TAFE and TAFE's longer term funding needs? What are the funding requirements if governments are to meet the target set in the Finn Committee report on post-year 12 education and training?",24
109,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Petrie and, no doubt, other honourable members will be aware of the excellent work of the Finn Committee and the excellent program which was proposed to Commonwealth and State governments in that context, designed to improve vocational skills opportunities for those aged 15 to 19 particularly and for those in older age groups. It involved the establishment of a so-called education and training guarantee to ensure that 95 per cent of 19-year-olds will have completed either year 12 or an equivalent qualification within TAFE and also that 50 per cent of young people proceeding from school to the work force will do it by way of the so-called vocational skills pathway. This matter was put before the States-after all, the State officials had been the most important authors of the Finn Committee report-and it was discussed by us at a meeting about a month ago. To get some more precision in the costings of these proposals, a special working group was set up under Dr Ramsey, the General Manager of New South Wales TAFE. That report was presented to Ministers last week and we had it before us when we met in Melbourne on Friday. There are some differences in the estimates of the Ramsey group and the estimates of the Finn Committee. However, the Commonwealth has not changed its view about the accuracy of the Finn Committee estimates. I will, for the information of the House, table a document my Department has prepared which tries to reconcile the Finn committee estimates with those of the Ramsey working party. Suffice to say that the adoption of the Finn Committee targets does involve a huge commitment of additional financial resources to schools, the TAPE sector and the higher education sector when we look at it collectively. I am delighted that the States have essentially embraced the Finn targets. We were dealing in Melbourne on Friday not only with a consideration of that matter but also with what to do in the immediate future in 1992, because the Ramsey committee did reveal that the States in their TAFE systems would have the capacity to accommodate 50,000 additional students next year if they had the financial resources to do so. In other words, the capital accommodation of TAPE could accommodate 50,000 additional students, but the recurrent resources were so inadequate that they could not do so. What the Ramsey committee revealed-again, a committee essentially of State officials-was that there was a huge deficit in the funding of TAFE at the State level. All of this means that only the Commonwealth is in a position to respond to the immediate crisis confronting TAPE because, disappointingly, the States said they were unable to make any additional resources available to accommodate the increasing queues of young people wanting to go into the TAPE system. Also revealed from that was that only the Commonwealth is in a position to respond to the longer term needs of TAPE between now and the turn of the century. Only the Commonwealth could respond in the form of secure training or funding for that TAFE system, and only the Commonwealth could establish an arrangement where we would have sensible policy arrangements made between the TAFE system, the higher education system and the rest of the vocational skills area. Of course, I was naturally disappointed that the States did not respond more graciously to the Commonwealth's proposals; nevertheless, the Commonwealth is prepared to talk to them, whether in the SPC context or in some other context, about both the immediate demands of TAFE and the long term funding of TAFE. I am sure the Prime Minister will have something to say about this when he makes his statement later this week. But this does provide us, the Commonwealth and the States, with a real opportunity to work cooperatively in order to provide better and more opportunities for our young people as they proceed from the school system into the work force. Mr Hawke Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum",24

NA",26
115,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,A paper is tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the paper will be recorded in Hansard and the Votes and Proceedings. The schedule read as follows1. NATIONAL SAFEGUARDS OFFICEAnnual Report 1990-91 of the Director of Safeguards-section 51 of the Nuclear NonProliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. (18 October 1991/6 November 1991) ATTORNEY-GENERAL Suspension of Standing and Sessional  move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Kooyong moving forthwith that this House censures the Attorney-General for failing to account to the Parliament the true nature and the reasons the Government's financial deal with the Solicitor General and for the Attorney-General's failure to uphold the letter and spirit of the law.,26
116,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"Is that on the Notice Paper?  No.7, page 3664: 'That this House censures the Attorney-General for failing to account to the Parliament'.",26
117,Mr SPEAKER,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Andrews-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion of Censure  move: That this House censures the Attorney-General for failing to account to the Parliament the true nature and the reasons for the Government's financial deal with the Solicitor-General and for the Attorney-General's failure to uphold the letter and spirit of the law. I move this motion because, after several days of questions addressed to the Attorney General (Mr Duffy), we still do not know why this extraordinary deal has been done, we still do not know how it was done and we still do not know its cost, or estimated cost. No application for leave has been tabled in this House; there has been no tabling of the Attorney's formal granting of leave in this House. When we asked the Attorney why he granted leave, we were told, 'Well, the Solicitor-General put some matters to me; they were personal, and I am not going to tell you about it'. That is a fairly novel approach to ministerial accountability. Henceforth people can do any deal with this Minister. So long as they reckon it is personal the Minister will not tell the people or the Parliament why, and he will not tell people the cost of the deal. To say, 'It is simply personal, and that is it', is the most alien concept of ministerial responsibility that I have heard. Orders The fact is that this will cost well over $100,000 a year just to look after, seemingly, a mate of the Attorney. I remind the House that this is not the first deal that has been done for the Solicitor-General. Before this, the Attorney argued publicly for the abandonment for of the notion that the Chief Justice ought to be the highest paid civil servant in the land and advocated that the Solicitor-General, the second law officer of the Commonwealth, ought be paid more than the Chief Justice. He made applications to the Remuneration Tribunal that the Solicitor-General should receive more. The Remuneration Tribunal turned that down, and-for what reasons we know not, after the Tribunal, an independent body, said no to any increment in salary or allowancethis Attorney, cosseted in his office, does a deal with the Solicitor-General and refuses to tell the nation about it. It is grubby at the very least and it may even be corrupt. I am forced to say it may even be corrupt because all this Attorney has done is come in and stroked his platitudes until they purred, called me a clot or a sleaze or produced whatever other poor forms of ratty invective he could. But at no stage did he say why or how or tell us the cost. Honourable members should bear in mind that there is a history of this Attorney campaigning for this particular Solicitor-General, who will end up practising at the Sydney and Melbourne bars-and here if need be-taking his salary and his allowances. Not one to miss an overseas trip, the Solicitor-General will do a couple of cases overseas. We do not know what the travelling allowance will be; we do not know what the cost of the travel will be; we do not know what the cost of the accommodation will be or who will travel with him. We assume that there are already ongoing costs to consultants and others handling this matter. Meanwhile, while the Solicitor General is making money for himself at the expense of the taxpayers, we have an acting Solicitor-General, so he can be added to the cost as well. The Attorney-General says that this is a pretty normal deal. Some of his colleagues have been saying, 'Why should someone not earn a quid while he is on holiday?,. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is your money and the money of those opposite. More importantly, all the people in the gallery are contributing to this deal. The authority for this proposition that the Attorney-General puts forward as granted under section 9 of the Law Officers Act makes an interesting bit of reading. The heading to section 9 of the Law Officers Act, which the Attorney-General says is the validating law for what he has just done, reads 'Solicitor-General not to undertake other work'. It goes on in the section to say 'except with the Attorney-General's consent'. It is obvious that the intention of this section was that if something should just pop up and the Solicitor-General had to handle it, if he could get the Attorney-General's consent, he could do that. But the clear intent of the section is that this be the exception rather than the rule, and that an effluxion of a 12month period on full pay and allowances ought never be entered into at law. We should think of what this might do-maybe not to this Solicitor-General-but to a Solicitor General in this instance. It is very clear that the following section of this Act is very well aware that the Solicitor-General, being the second law officer of the Commonwealth, ought not be compromised in any way. We do not want him doing deals or arrangements. We have to have him as a shining example to the law. Section 10 deals with vacation of office. It says: The Governor General shall remove the Solicitor General from office if the Solicitor-General: (a) except by reason of temporary illness, becomes incapable of performing the duties of his office; (b) is guilty of misbehaviour; or (c) becomes bankrupt or insolvent, applies to take the benefit of any law for the relief of bankrupt or insolvent debtorsinterestingly enough, it goes on to say: - compounds with his creditorsthose of us who have practised in this arena will know that means entering into some arrangement with creditorsor makes an assignment of his remuneration for their benefit. It is not just talking about bankruptcy, it is talking about arrangements with creditors and the like. Why? Because we do not want a person compromised who is the second law officer of the land. It may well be that Dr Griffith is one of the more objective and honest of the SolicitorGenerals but it would appear to me, prima facie, to be a very dangerous precedent indeed to give someone well in excess of 100 grand and say, 'Go to it. Make as much money as you like', and not assume that the man might not be compromised in terms of the advice he gives the Government. For this money, a lot of people would feel compromised and feel that they have to advise the Government in terms that might suit the government of the day. This particular piece of legislation sought to ensur- by its provisions not only that this deal not Ibe done but that there be no compromise for someone in this situation. Well over $100,000 is totally unexplained-with a full year's holiday, cars, and offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The Attorney General says that they cannot be used for his professional purposes, which presupposes that they can be used for personal reasons. Is the Solicitor-General going to hold a party there? If he cannot use the offices for professional reasons, why are they available to him? He gets all the money he can earn elsewhere, which the Attorney-General estimates at $600,000. Go out and tell that to the more than one million unemployed in the community today. The Attorney-General has cooked up a secret deal which he will not explain-what the Attorney-General is paying for him could be worth three quarters of a million dollarsand the Solicitor-General is being given time off just to suit him because it is a personal arrangement. I have got news for the Attorney-General: he cannot go around conducting public affairs on this sort of quiet personal deal. He just cannot do it. If he tries to do it, it is going to be exposed-as it ought to be exposed. My office has been inundated with people who have felt nothing but disgust at the sort of deal being done here. Is it not symptomatic of the attitude of this Government? It is actually in a world of its own. I believe the Attorney-General when he stands up here and expresses absolute amazement that I am even questioning him on this subject. He thinks it is reasonable to enter into some situation like this. He cannot comprehend why people would either be disgusted, appalled, or, at the very least, see that it is opposed basically at law-both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. The Attorney's behaviour has been aberrant on this matter. He misled the House. Firstly, he told us that the leave would be for 12 months. Then it became nine months leave. Honourable members will recall that the first day I started asking about this, he said he would refer to documents in front of him. When he was asked to table them, he started pulling out from his pocket what looked like betting slips, as if he could read what was in his pocket through his coat. The documents that were in front of him never appeared. The next day a clutch of documents appeared, and he had to get up after Question Time to explain away that he was wrong in his description of them. From the moment this matter emerged, events have followed a tortuous path. The Attorney said, 'Well, look, the bottom line is this: apart from being personal, this man is only being treated the same as any judge'. How many judges go back to the Bar and make a quid when they are on leave? This Solicitor-General is evidently being treated on the same basis as a Federal Court judge, and that is provided for at law. Every five years a Federal Court judge can take six months leave. Generally they cogitate, meditate, think of things legal and, I am sure, improve their lot. But this Solicitor-General takes not six months, but a year. He gets travel overseas, an allowance, accommodation, access to his officers and he can make all the money he likes. Mr Beale-And he has his job. MI' PEACOCK-And he retains his job.",26
118,Dr HEWSON,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"And title.  this title, which I asked the Attorney about today-and again he evaded it and did not answer today-is that the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth is available to a solicitor who is going to brief a barrister. The Solicitor-General is on leave and available to make as much money as anyone wants to pay him to take that person's case. If one were fighting for a decision on an important matter, one would be pretty tempted. Where does this place the whole question of the misuse of Commonwealth titles? Thus the relevance of the question today. It was not put down; there was no relinquishing of title during this period. It really is the most extraordinary deal that has been done. Apart from the Attorney's desire to improve the lot of the Solicitor-General earlier this year with applications to the Remuneration Tribunal, I have to say in terms of special deals that the Attorney introduced a Bill in August titled the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. I was a bit worried about this Bill. It was an omnibus Bill. It covered 12 areas of reform. I said in my speech, 'I don't understand what you're doing for the Solicitor-General here. Why is the Solicitor General being pulled out for special mention here? Why are you giving him access to a pension if he goes bankrupt?'. I said, 'I thought I would oppose this'. The Attorney had an apoplexy. The advisers crowded around and explained to me in great detail that everybody at this level in the Commonwealth was able to take a pension if he was bankrupt. After they showed me the number of officers who were affected, I said, 'Okay, we'll go along with it'. I have to say that I think there was a touch of non-disclosure, if the newspaper reports are correct that the Solicitor-General has some pecuniary difficulties. I do not know whether they are true or not. The Attorney will not confirm them; he will not put them down. I should have been told a couple of months ago whether that was a relevant factor. It is yet another process of stitching up a deal and it is another process of non-disclosure and lack of honesty with and lack of faithfulness to the Australian people with their money. The Solicitor-General obtained this position in 1984 and this pension was payable after seven years. That raises another point. If it was so important to the Solicitor-General that he have this time off, why did he enter into the new contract less than 12 months ago? Why did he sign an agreement with the Commonwealth to serve another seven years as Solicitor-General? This is a definite matter of public interest. It calls into question the of the Solicitor-General now because if one cannot handle the task, one ought not take the job and certainly ought not take the money. I therefore pose the question: if the Solicitor-General is unable to execute his functions, why does he not retire? Why does he not go to the bar-we wish him well-and make a great deal of money? Why is he subsidised by the taxpayers? No-one else could get this deal. I have a few slow-moving horses around which the Attorney knows about. I would not mind being compensated for them. Do honourable members think that the taxpayers would look after me during the period of time. I sought to improve my lot in that area? There is no end to the sorts of precedents that could be set. The bottom line is that the Attorney has not been frank on this issue, that there is beginning to be a stench about this deal. What the Attorney has tried to do so frivolously is against public policy, and it is against the whole Westminster system for him simply to assume that he can brush it off as some personal arrangement. As I say, it is a pretty novel approach to ministerial accountability to just wander in here and say, 'Yeah. a hundred-odd grand, cars, offices, travel, accommodation, pension entitlements-but it is personal; I am not telling any of you about it'. It is the most novel approach I have ever seen. When we consider the intent of the law laid down under the Law Officers Act, legislation that was introduced in 1964 and has governed the performances of Solicitors-General since then, it is quite clear that when the heading says 'Solicitor-General not to undertake other work' the intent was that if he did, with the consent of the Attorney, it would be a one-off and, in terms of not being compromised in his task, the sort of compromise that the law would clearly set out would be there. That is why we seek to bring this debate on today. The Attorney has been a very responsible Minister and has answered my questions in the past. From the moment this got out, he has ducked and weaved and abused and engaged in sloppy rhetoric, none of which befits him but, more importantly, none of tenure which befits the office-and none of which provides any information as to why and how this arrangement was entered into. I say to the Attorney: give the Opposition a statement as to why this was done, and what the total cost will be. While the Attorney is at it, it would be reasonable for me to ask, bearing in mind that senior civil servants have to deliver pecuniary interest statements and that this matter revolves around what we appear to think is the misuse of taxpayers' money, whether he might table the pecuniary interest statement of the Solicitor-General so that we can be absolutely clear that there is no compromise in any way at all and that there is no transgressing of section 10 of the Law Officers Act. The Attorney might be frank and say that in fact the Solicitor-General's treatment is not the same as that for judges. They do not go to the bar. He might be frank and indicate to us the sort of personal access to facilities that he is approving for the Solicitor-General. He might recognise that he has not tabled the documents that we have been asking for, and at root he might simply tell us why it is that he has entered into a deal which the overwhelming majority of Australians could not comprehend. Certainly those outside who are up against it at the moment and those nearly one million unemployed will never comprehend why the Attorney can sell them out but look after a wealthy lawyer.",28
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,Is the motion seconded?,30
120,Mr ANDREWS,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"I second the motion. This debate is one of the most important issues to come before this Parliament in this session because we are dealing with the second legal officer of the Commonwealth of Australia in circumstances where the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has continually run away, and he even did so today at Question Time, from providing the Parliament with answers about this deal which he has entered into with Dr Gavan Griffith. All that we on this side of the House have been seeking are some decent answers to questions which have been put to the Attorney-General about the conduct of this arrangement between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General. I am reminded of the quote from John F. Kennedy, who once said: 'I can evade questions without help; what I need is answers'. That is what we are not getting from the Attorney-General. In fact, it reminds me of the old saying that the only way to get to the top is by not asking any questions and the only way to stay there is by not answering any. That is what we have seen over the last few days from the Attorney-General in this debate about the Solicitor-General. Let us remember the importance of the Solicitor-General in the Commonwealth. As the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  indicated, the position of Solicitor-General was established under Commonwealth legislation in 1964. In 1968, when that legislation was amended the Bill was linked in a cognate debate-indicating the importance of this position-with a Bill about the pensions and entitlements of Federal Court judges in this country. So we are talking about an officer of the Commonwealth of Australia who is linked for all intents and purposes with judges of the Federal Court in this nation. Is this the way that we would expect judges of the Federal Court to be treated-to enter into shabby types of deals such as this one about which the Attorney-General does not even have the courage to answer the questions that have been put to him day after day. Let us remember, too, that this legislation was first introduced by the then Attorney General, Mr Snedden, who said: The tenn of a Solicitor-General's appointment is to be a fixed tenn, not exceeding seven years, but he is to be eligible for re-appointment. So what the Parliament was contemplating then was a fixed term-not this mickey mouse stuff with a sort of flexi leave for the Solicitor-General, who can, presumably, go back home at the weekend and work up a bit of a brief for the Attorney-General and send it back, presumably, on Monday morning. If we are to believe what the Attorney-General says, the Solicitor-General could then mark his fee as any other barrister does, and then, presumably, go back to his private practice at the bar where he can earn the $500,000 or $600,000 that the Attorney-General seemed to be supporting at some time in the past. This is the mickey mouse sort of arrangement that has been entered into by the Attorney-General with the Solicitor-General. Mr Snedden went on to say in 1964: His pension rights are to be the same as those of a judge under the Judges' Pensions Act. The Bill provides for some financial compensation in the event that he is not re-appointed at the end of his tenn and has to re-establish himself in private practice before he has qualified for pension. In this way the Bill gives proper security to the Solicitor General who will give up a greater income in private practice to become a non-political officer, outside the Public Service, serving different ments in succession. The Attorney now seeks to hide behind the Act saying, 'Well, on the face of it the law says that I can give my consent'. But, whatever the letter of the law, if one has read the debates at the time it is quite clear, as the head note shows and as the shadow Attorney has read out this afternoon, that it was intended that the Solicitor-General, while in that position, should not take other work. Quite clearly, this arrangement which has been entered into is contrary to the spirit of that intention at the time. If criticism from our side of the House is not enough, I remind the House of what Mr Whitlam said when he spoke on similar legislation in 1968. Again, that legislation in 1968 was linked with legislation for the pension entitlements of Federal Court judges-not the pension entitlements of a grade 8 clerk in the Public Service, but the pension entitlements of Federal Court judges. Again recognising that the Solicitor-General would be giving up some of the usual earnings that he might get at the bar in order to take up this position of some considerable status in the Commonwealth, Mr Whitlam said: ... many people still believe that the pensions are lavish, according to ordinary standards, for people who have retired from an active life. I therefore think it proper to say that while a judge in retirement might often enjoy a higher income than a barrister who has retired, nevertheless, a judge in service, in general, enjoys a lower income than a barrister in practice. He went on to defend the situation in the Bill of providing an adequate income-as I have said, in a debate about the pension entitlements of not only judges but also the Solicitor-General. He then went on to defend why the Solicitor-General ought to get a decent pension, which of course is provided in the legislation. That points again to the fact that this shabby arrangement ought not tl? have been entered into by the Attorney-General. What has the Attorney-General got to say about this? What excuses have we had? What explanation have we had? He has had an opportunity to give answers in Question Time not only today but also last week. He had an opportunity last week to debate this motion, govern- but, of course, was not ready to debate it then. We thought that perhaps it was because he did not have the answers or was not on top of his brief. But he has come in today and has no more answers and is no further on top of his brief. It is just as well that the Attorney General is not the Solicitor-General! What answers do we get today? We are told only that personal reasons are being provided by the Solicitor-General to the Attorney. When asked about the personal reasonsremembering we are talking about the second legal officer of the Commonwealth-we get no further explanation at all. It has been reported in the press that the Solicitor-General has had some financial problems. It has been reported that he was an investor in Lloyds of London and that, in order to meet his payments to Lloyds of London, because of the difficulties it is facing, he needs to earn a substantially greater income than he earns at present-a substantially greater income, of course, than is required to keep his house in Melbourne, his house in Sydney and possibly his house anywhere else. What income is the Solicitor-General getting? The Solicitor-General is getting about $140,000 a year as a base salary. On top of that, he has entitlements: to an office, to a car, and no doubt to staff, et cetera. No doubt the Solicitor-General actually gets way in advance of $140,000 a year. What would the 800,000 officially unemployed say about the $140,000 a year that the Solicitor-General gets? Let me remind honourable members what single people over 21 get on Newstart: $277.70 a fortnight. If we were to add up how many people could get unemployment benefits with this salary that the Solicitor-General will continue to earn next year, we could see not only the reason why the Attorney-General is running away from this but also the obscenity of this whole arrangement that has been entered into. The Attorney-General is a reasonable bloke. He comes in here and gives the appearance of being reasonable. He might be half asleep in most Question Times, but he is stilI a reasonable, sincere bloke. This reminds me of what Charles Kettering once said, which is that one can be sincere and still stupid; that is what characterises this arrangement which the Attomey-General has entered into. I would not say that the Attorney is stupid, but what other characterisation could one give to an arrangement where a man who is eaming in excess of $140,000 a year is allowed to go back to private practice at the bar to eam about $600,000 as a silk? If he were any sort of silk he would be earning a hell of a lot more than $600,000; he would probably earn about a million dollars at the Melbourne or Sydney bar. And, if he cannot earn that amount of money, he ought not to be the Solicitor-General in the first place. We, the people of the Commonwealth of Australia, are allowing a man to earn $140,000-plus-out of the purse that every one of the taxpayers in this House and elsewhere in the country pays into-so that he can go back to the bar, probably to earn about a million dollars a year. It would certainly be in excess of the $600,000 that the Attorney quoted. In answer to a question today, the Attorney said, 'Other members of parliament go back'. He even quoted the case of a former Speaker who represented someone at the bar whilst he was still a member of parliament. That is just a furphy and we ought to dismiss it right now as such. Many members of the Federal Parliament carry on other businesses; many members of the Federal Parliament go back and do other work. Probably the greatest example in the history of this Commonwealth has been a former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Evatt, who on numerous occasions appeared before the High Court. So there is an example of a member of parliament going back. Government members should not give us that nonsense about members of parliament. We are talking about a completely different situation.",30
121,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,Why don't you talk about,32
122,Mr ANDREWS,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"We hear some chattering from the Leader of the House. He comes in here every day as the huff and puff of the Government: the Thomas the Tank Engine of Federal Parliament, huffing and puffing away as though this were a grown-up play school. If that is how those opposite treat the Federal Parliament, which they do, because of the way they place this unnecessary guillotine on Bills day after day-not only in this session but also in other sessions that this Government has had control of-and if that is what the Leader of the House has to say about matters generally and about a motion as serious as this, we can dismiss the Government with all the due dismissal that it warrants. We are talking about an officer, the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth. Let me remind honourable members of some of his powers. Section 17 of the Law Officers Act 1964 states: (1) The Attorney-General may... delegate to the Solicitor-General all or any of his powers and functions under all or any of the laws of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, except this power of delegation. Here we have an officer of the Commonwealth who can be delegated, under the hand of the Attorney-General, all and every power except the power of delegation itself that the Attorney-General himself has. We have one of the most important, powerful people in terms of the way in which the administration of justice is conducted in this country, who can be delegated the powers of the Attorney-General himself, and this is the sort of shabby deal that we enter into. Not only do we have this shabby deal, but also we do not get an explanation about it. If there were a good explanation for why the Solicitor-General had to take some time off and the consent of the Attomey was given-and there might be some circumstances; the Solicitor General might have run under a bus and not be capable of performing his duties as Solicitor-General-it might be reasonable, for example, that he do some paperwork privately. If the Attorney-General came to the Parliament and said, 'These are the special circumstances that pertain to the Solicitor General', we would not be standing up pointing out this absurd obscenity we have to deal with; we would be saying, 'That is a reasonable exercise of powers'. But the Attorney General will not even provide a reason to the House as to why this arrangement has been entered into. We do not know even the details of the arrangement. The Attorney-General ought to table the conditions of this particular arrangement entered into. He comes in here and says, 'The Solicitor-General has accepted certain conditions'. He tells us that he can work some of the time and then he tells us he is going, presumably, to the Hague to appear before the International Court of Justice. Perhaps I will apply for the Solicitor-General's job! It is quite obvious that we will have a Solicitor-General who, whilst he is not officially on leave at the bar in Melbourne or Sydney, will be flitting around the world appearing for the Commonwealth-at no little expense no doubt-at the International Court of Justice and elsewhere. Mr Downer-Via Tuscany.",32
123,Mr ANDREWS,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"Yes, obviously. They say a person cannot have his cake and eat it but, by golly, this is the closest we will ever get to it. The Opposition brings on this motion of censure not simply to take the time of Parliament; this motion raises real issues about the way in which the administration of justice in Australia is carried out. For the Attorney-General simply to continue to filibuster, to provide non-answers to real questions which are put to him, and to simply say that this is some sort of personal arrangeissue ment between the two highest ranking legal officers of the Commonwealth as if the rest of the 17 million people in Australia did not matter, is simply not good enough. This arrangement shows, at best, a complete lack of wisdom on the part of the Attorney General, and, at the worse, nothing more than pure avarice on the part of the Solicitor General. They ought to be censured for that.",33
124,Mr DUFFY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"In answering this censure motion, I go through some history of what has happened. There has been an absence of that in the two contributions to date. Dr Griffith, the Commonwealth Solicitor General, applied for and was granted leave of absence for one year commencing on 1 January 1992. I do not think the honourable  one opposite has questioned the fact that the Solicitor-General is entitled to whatever accrued leave he may have, so I will not take up the time of the House on that. The period of leave will be taken from Dr Griffith's leave entitlement. If he is on leave for any period beyond that, of course he does not receive any payment for that. That matter is not in dispute because the shadow Attorney-General and honourable  first public utterance on this matter, in a press release on 6 November, went straight to what he referred to today over and over again. I think it was mentioned once by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who then moved away from such an extreme position. The shadow Attorney is obsessed with talking about deals-deals, he says, for a mate. That is something I want to deal with briefly. It is an extraordinary allegation. Whatever view he may have of this arrangement is one matter, but I want to refute completely and absolutely the accusations that I made a deal, as he said, for a mate, and that it was not the first deal with the Solicitor General. I know it is a bit of a drama and all the rest of it, but as to whether the Solicitor General happened to be a mate of the Attorney-General is not a matter relevant to this if in fact what has been done is legal and is able to be done. To suggest that the Solicitor-General is some sort of mate of mine is extraordinary. I think I met him once before I became Attorney-General and that was at a dinner or a lunch at the National Gallery-I cannot remember which now; it was not the sort of invigorating occasion that one remembers all that clearly. That is the only time. I have ever met him, and since then I have found him an excellent Solicitor-General to work with. Other than that I know very little about him, and to suggest that I have cooked up some deal for a mate is appallingly stupid. I do not think that even the shadow Attorney can believe what he has said in that regard. As to the leave entitlement, as I said a moment ago he was granted leave of absence for one year commencing on 1 January 1992, and the period of leave will be taken from his current leave entitlements. Let us get that clear. So, there is no deal on behalf of any mate. The next point I want to move to immediately is the suggestion that this was the second deal; that there was some other deal that was done some time ago on behalf of the Solicitor-General. I find that another extraprovisions ordinary statement. That was a matter which the honourable member for Kooyong raised in August this year but, having listened to learned speech on that occasion by the honAct ourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) in which he explained what had happened in goes on to say: respect of that legislation-that is, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill-the shadow Attorney did not pursue that point office because there was no point pursuing it. The the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill employment. was before this House in August 1991 in order to correct a mistake that was made the legislation in 1988. We were not terribly happy coming here and saying that we had come back with legislation in order to correct a mistake made in 1988. The honourable tor-General member for Banks said that, and I said that. The first element of the Bill's intention in 1988 set the qualifications for a pension and, secondly, established the security of payment. The 1988 amendments were intended to give effect to those intentions. They did not properly ensure the second element and we are now rectifying that matter. That is what I said during that debate and that is the fact of the matter. I was not withholding some sort of information, as the honourable member for Kooyong was suggesting. It did not achieve in 1988 the intention that the Government intended; it was necessary to come back and correct a mistake in that Bill. A further point which particularly concerns me about the allegations made-and I supis pose reasonably enough should-concerns the allegation by the honourable member for to Kooyong and supported by the honourable member for Menzies that there was not proper legal basis for granting the right of private practice to the Solicitor-General. The very little. other night in this House the honourable member for Menzies said very much the same thing as was said today by the honourable member for Kooyong, but mercifully he did not repeat it again today-though the honourable member for Kooyong did. The honourable member for Kooyong is now alleging that in fact there is no entitlement for me to give to the Solicitor-General the right of private practice in relation to the of the Law Officers Act. He says that because there was a heading to that legislation which the shadow Attorneya General now relies on, and that is where the says that the Solicitor-General is not to undertake other work. Section 9 of the Act Except in the performance of the duties of his or with the consent of the Attorney-General, Solicitor-General shall not engage in the practice of a barrister or solicitor or engage in paid in For some reason, which I find extremely difficult to understand, there is an argument being run that somehow or other that legislation does not allow me to grant to the Solicithe right of private practice. As I said, the shadow Attorney relies on the heading of section 9. The heading of section 9 states, 'Solicitor-General not to undertake other work'. That is correct. But the honourable member comes in here and makes what is a very serious allegation against a Minister, and particularly against an Attorney-General, and he has questioned the legality-not whether the honourable member thinks it is a good idea-of the right that I have under the Law Officers Act to grant to the Solicitor General the right of private practice. Whether he agrees or whether he thinks it is a good idea is another matter; he has now questioned the legality of it. I think it is about time the honourable member had a look at that, because it is really the sort of allegation which appallingly serious if he is not able to substantiate it. The honourable member ought think about what is the status in a statuteand for that matter the honourable member for a Menzies should, too-of headings, marginal notes and sections of Acts, because they mean I notice that the honourable member for Menzies is nodding his head. That was not a view that he was expressing the other night. It would not have been difficult for the honourable member to look at what section 13 of the Acts Interpretation Act says before he started accusing me of illegality. That section deals with the status of headings, schedules, marginal notes, footnotes, and end notes. In relation to marginal notes, it states: No marginal note, footnote, or endnote to an Act, and no heading to a section of an Act, shall be taken to be part of the Act. It does not really surprise me that the honourable member did not bother to have a look at some primary sources. That might have been a bit difficult for him. In relation to those research skills, the honourable member for Menzies might have done the same thing instead of coming in here and picking up an Act and saying that, because it has a heading 'Solicitor-General not to undertake other work' - and under the actual section of the Act, with my consent he can; and that consent I have given-it is illegal. The honourable member should go back to the primary The source-the Acts Interpretation Act-and behalf have a look at that, and then go to a seconCommonwealth ... dary source and have a look at the third edition of Statutory Interpretation by Pearce and Geddes, which refers to this matter in detail. I suggest that the honourable ... member should have a good look at that talities reference before he accuses people of acting illegally. I will now comment in relation to the basic points which honourable members opposite made. I dealt a moment ago with the Opposition's concern about the Solicitormember for Kooyong! General taking leave, and that does not seem to be an issue in dispute. But, in fact, when he takes leave he does not decide at that stage that he is not going to do anything. He did request-there is no doubt about that-the right to go into private practice during part, if not all, of the period for which he was leave. I granted that. Other people in the circumstances-when it is put that someone has leave to which he or she is entitled-may or may not want to do something during that period of leave. The Solicitor-General then requested the right of private practice, which earlier the Opposition said was illegally granted. I have just dealt with that. It was not illegally granted. There is no question that, once that request was made, if I was disposed to grant him that leave under section 9 of the Law Officers Act, he was fully entitled to it. So he was entitled to long service leave. Then he was entitled, if he wanted to, to request the right of private practice during that period. ",33
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong.,35
126,Mr DUFFY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"He may not spend all of that period in private practice, but he may spend some of it in private practice. I granted the request that he put to me. The Opposition then had concerns-and at Question Time today honourable members opposite seemed to treat the thing as if it were some sort of a joke-as to what conditions were put on that employment. Those conditions were theseand I will just give them to honourable members opposite word for word: Solicitor would not engage in practice on of interests in conflict with those of the The Opposition would agree with that. Further in Australia conditions are: its Ministers, statutory authorities or instrumenor corporations wholly owned by the Commonwealth, including many cases where the Commonwealth's interests were the responsibility of persons such as the Commissioner of Taxation, the Comptroller-General of Customs.

128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,Order! The member for Kooyong will not defy the Chair.,35
129,Mr DUFFY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"There are three more conditions which are applied to the limitations on on what the Solicitor-General has to do while he same is in private practice. The humbug opposite came in here today and said that I had not made known those conditions and that they should be tabled. We see how seriously the honourable member for Kooyong takes it when I try to put them on the record today. He has them in front of him and he just keeps re-reading them. Those were the conditions. I will not go through them now, because the honourable member has them; he is not prepared to listen to what they are. He is not prepared to listen to the fact that, when that request was made for the right of private practice during part of the leave of absence, very strict conditions were laid down. Honourable members opposite talk about what some people can do and what other people cannot do. Of course, they always love to attack public servants. That is not the position of the Solicitor-General, who is, of course, a statutory officer-not a member of the Defence Force. But it amazes me that the honourable member for Kooyong accuses me of acting illegally, without any basis at all; then, in a question today, he drags General Gration into this debate which, again, was in appallingly bad taste, as was the incident the other day when the Opposition attempted to list property that it alleged to be owned by the Solicitor-General. What business of the Opposition the property of the Solicitor General is in this regard, I do not know, but the Opposition raised that issue, not me. (Extension of time granted) Both the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Menzies have floated various ideas today about press reports as to why the Solicitor-General might want to go back to the bar during part of the period that he had been granted leave of absence. They have been floating press reports around. As I said the other day-and I will repeat it today-the personal circumstances, financial or otherwise, of the Solicitor-General, conveyed to me, are not a matter that I am obliged to tell honourable members opposite about. If the Solicitor-General says something to me for personal reasons, I will not disclose it to honourable members opposite. They can say that that is a quaint view of accountability if they want to. The fact of the matter is that, on the basis of what was put to me by the Solicitor-General, I made three decisions. The first one was to allow him leave of absence for one year, commencing on 1 January 1992. Having done that, I then looked at the question of private practice. Extraordinary allegations were made by the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Menzies that that was illegal. Neither of them can even read an Act. That is why they thought it was illegal. What they did was go to a heading in an Act which says, 'Solicitor-General not to undertake other work', and they therefore decided that it could not be done. I have been through the matter of the honourable members' lack of statutory interpretation powers. They should read that carefully in Hansard and make sure that they do not make that sort of mistake again, because it is pretty fundamental, and it is a good early lesson for the honourable member for Menzies. The Solicitor-General then put to me, as I said, why he wanted to go back to the bar in Melbourne, and probably Sydney too, for some time during the period that he had leave of absence. I have said to the honourable member before that he, the honourable member for Menzies and anyone else can come in here and say, if they want to, that the Solicitor-General has an investment in Lloyds which has gone bad, which is the innuendo that they have been making. By all means, they can say that if they want to. But, if they want me to confirm it or deny it, they will find that I will not do so. In essence, once reasons were put to me why the Solicitor General did not want to spend the whole of the year for which he was granted leave of absence sitting around reading or fishing, that was the end of it as far as I was concerned. The honourable member for Kooyong thinks that I should come in here and say to him in almost absolute detail, 'This is what the Solicitor-General told me about why he wanted to go back to the bar', but I am not prepared to do that. It is not a question of accountability. The Solicitor-General told me why he wanted to go back to the bar, and he is entitled to do that, despite the honourable member's stupidity today. He is quite entitled to go back to the bar. Another point about this particularly important position was, I think, made well by the honourable member for Menzies. I refer to the point concerning the significance of the role of the Solicitor-General. Some State Solicitors-General are granted the right of private practice on an ongoing basis. At least one is at the bar and is granted the right of private practice. ",35
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,Order! The member for Kooyong will not interject.,37
131,Mr DUFFY,PRESENTATION OF A PAPER,"I do not think that, under that Act, that is something that I would want to do-that is, have a Solicitor-General acting as a Solicitor-General and, on an ongoing basis, having the right of private practice. The honourable member for Menzies did point out the importance of a Solicitor-General, and nobody disputes that, of course. But the fact of the matter is that granting a Solicitor General the right of private practice can be done in two ways. One way that it can be done is on an ongoing basis, which I do not think is a particularly good idea, because I think we need more continuity in the role of the Solicitor-General than that. That is not what I did. What I did do was, after a discussion in some detail with the Solicitor General-a matter which, as far as I am concerned, was confidential between the Solicitor-General and myself-determine under section 9 that he was entitled to go back to private practice for part of the period for which he was granted leave of absence.

141,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.32 p.m.)I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Special Broadcasting Service Bill establishes the SBS as a statutory authority with appropriate powers and operational structures to carry out its functions, which are set out in its charter. The Bill has been returned from the Senate with some amendments. Amendments Nos 1, 3,4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 provide for the establishment of a permanent community advisory committee. The main amendment for this purpose is amendment No.4; the others are consequential. The SBS Bill, which the House has passed, did not set out specific community consultation measures. Instead, it required that the SBS board be responsible to community need and opinion and develop appropriate community consultative measures. The Bill requires the SBS board to be aware of and responsive to community needs and opinions on matters relevant to the charter, and to develop community consultative measures to achieve the objective. As part of its annual reporting requirements, the board will have to provide particulars of how its programming activities during the year are related to the SBS charter obligations and particulars of the measures taken by the board during the year to ensure that the board is aware of and responsive to community needs and opinions on matters relevant to its charter. The obligations are underpinned by a range of accountability measures in clauses 47, 49 and 72. For example, if not satisfied with the board's consultative measures, the Minister could have directed the establishment of a community advisory committee. The Bill provided for the establishment of an interim community advisory committee to advise the board on appropriate consultation measures for inclusion in its first corporate plan, and after that it would have been up to the board to develop appropriate measures. The amendments moved by the Government and passed in the Senate will strengthen this network of provisions by requiring the SBS board to establish a permanent community advisory committee to provide advice to the board on community needs and opinions, including the needs and opinions of small or newly arrived ethnic groups, on matters relevant to the charter. These contrast with the Opposition's proposed provisions, which would have limited the scope of the permanent committee to advise basically on how to consult. There was no mandate in the proposals moved by the Opposition to advise the board of what the community attitudes were. In .that sense it rather appeared to be more a case of windowdressing than absolutely addressing the crucial question of consultation. This committee to be established by the SBS board under the amendments would represent a key consultative mechanism for ensuring that the board is aware of and responsive to community needs and opinions. The board, however, will have the flexibility to deVelop supplementary community consultative measures it deems appropriate, and it will set these out in the SBS corporate plan, as I said previously. Amendment No.2 moved by the Opposition will require the SBS board to develop and publicise guidelines on the kinds of community information or community promotional material that it is prepared to broadcast. These announcements are also protected by being exempt from the five minute per hour limit on advertising and sponsorship announcements. Amendment No. 10 is a technical amendment to the staffing provisions. The SBS Bill provides that the SBS will employ staff under the current legislation rather than under the Public Service Act. The intention is to provide the SBS with a flexible staffing regime that can accommodate a range of employment arrangements. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that SBS officers who have been appointed to the SBS under the Public Service Act but who will compulsorily become officers employed under the SBS Act are covered by the second tier of the officers' mobility rights under division 3 of part IV of the Public Service Act. The second tier coverage provides that, when the staff involved cease to be APS officers, they retain certain rights, including the right to apply for promotion and transfer"" to APS vacancies. They also have certain rights in relation to reappointment to the APS if certain conditions have been fulfilled. The amendment is consistent with those put in place when establishing other statutory authorities such as the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation.",40
142,Mr SMITH,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I have only just had a chance to look at these amendments to the Special Broadcasting Service Bill, although they appear to be the same amendments as those that were being discussed in the Senate last night. I would indicate, on behalf of the Opposition, that we will be allowing these amendments to pass, as we did in the Senate. Some comment needs to be made about some of the matters that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) just raised, relating particularly to the community advisory committee. It is interesting that the original Bill that came to the House provided that the community advisory committee would be an interim advisory committee and would only pertain to seeking that broader advice for the purposes of completing the corporate plan of the SBS under its new charter in the new Act. We felt on that occasion that perhaps there ought to be an ongoing commitment to an advisory committee and that there ought to be a permanent advisory committee, partly as a response to the issues that were raised during the rescheduling of radio programming on SBS, which became the topic for great debate within the ethnic community. It was clear that there is a need for alternative advice to the board and management advising the board, so it was felt that an ongoing community advisory committee was the appropriate way to go. We moved that amendment in the House, and we divided on it because many members on the Labor side indicated that they also felt that a community advisory committee of an enduring nature was necessary. However, noone joined us on that occasion. Without referring to the Hansard, I do not recall the Government saying at any stage during the debate that it felt a permanent community advisory committee would be appropriate. Then, last night, at five past eight, I was called to the Senate to have a look at these amendments and to witness confusing debate, but at the end of the day we finished up with this amendment. The intriguing thing about that debate was the acceptance of a need for a permanent advisory committee. But in the arguments put by Senator Collins in the Senate, he specifically said, 'We do not believe we want to have a permanent advisory committee for a number of reasons'. It was partly because it was an indication of large government and partly because it was duplicating other measures. I hesitate because the next Bill is guillotined at 4.45. It shows the stupidity of the system that we have got here. Senator Collins argued against a community advisory committee but then proceeded to put the amendment. Really, those opposite cannot have it both ways. It was a hypocritical performance. It was not edifying for anyone to watch, and it was really a somersault by those opposite. With those few remarks, and given that we have got the guillotine-which we should not have-I will have to conclude there.",42
143,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"Northern Territory-' Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.36 p.m.)The fact of the matter isMr Smith- Mr Deputy Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I asked the honourable member for the Northern Territory before I spoke whether he had finished. Now that we are under the guillotine",42
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE, There is no point of order.,42
145,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The fact of the matter is that we are talking about a charade. The charade happened in the Senate last evening-that is absolutely correct. It happened over dinnertime when Senator Alston agreed with Senator Collins that certain things should take place. We got back into the debate, and what did we see? We saw the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), scurrying across King's Hall. What did he do? After he scurried across to the Senate and sat in the advisers box, he called over Senator Alston and said to him, 'Look, you will have to change your tactics'. The fact of the matter is that the Government recognised the importance of a permanent advisory committee, saw the need, and strengthened the proposition that we had in the original Bill. The fact is that the propositions that were put by the Opposition added up almost to nothing. Mr Smith-It was a principle that was put in for you to amend.",42
146,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The Ruddock amendment. The principle was to provide an advisory committee to advise SBS on how to appoint a board, not to immediately advise the board on what the community attitude was. Mr Smith-You did not know what you were doing over there.",43
147,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"The fact is that those opposite have been caught short again. They did not know what act to pull in the SenateMr Smith- Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. I have not been caught. The advisers of those opposite, SBS, Senator Collins, and the Minister for Transport and Communications did not consult with us for one moment about matters which they usually consult us on. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has come in here this afternoon again. He has brought it in at a time of the guillotine. He is a disgrace. This is not a democracy. All that those opposite are trying to do",43

151,Mr SNOWDON,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I have no need to continue this charade being carried on by the honourable member for Bass. He has proven what an incompetent person he is and how incompetent his representative was in the Senate last night. Mr Smith- Mr Deputy Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I require that the word 'incompetent' be withdrawn. It is unparliamentary.",43
152,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,There is no point of order.,43
153,Mr NEHL,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak very briefly in this committee debate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) stressed on several occasions the need for SBS to respond to community needs and opinions. For some years I have taken every opportunity to put before this Parliament the community needs of the north coast of New South Wales in relation to SBS services. I note that the current Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), sitting at the table, was the appropriate Minister, and I raised that with him years ago. At that time it was suggested that it would take only the flicking of a switch to get that sort of service to the north coast of New South Wales. If we look at the test pattern on SBS now, we can see it welcomes viewers to Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley",43

If he rises speaks for three minutes, I will have to interrupt him.",44
159,Mr COSTELLO,SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE,"This is an absolute disgrace. It is now 4.42 p.m. The Government will allow just three minutes to discuss in Parliament of this country a Bill which has frozen $6 billion of Australian citizens' money. This is an indictment of this tion Government's attitude to this Parliament, I am afraid it is an indictment of the way which it has callously treated the people who hold units in unlisted property trusts. On 23 July 1991, the Attorney-General Duffy) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) anplace nounced that, as from that time, people who had money in unlisted property trusts would have the right to redeem that money frozen for 12 months. The legislation to implement that came into this House on 7 November 1991. In other words, they said, 'We froze your money. We took four months to bring the Bill into the House to enact it, and we are going to allow three minutes for it to be discussed and for the people of Australia to hear what the attitude of their parliamentary representatives is on that. We have frozen your money for 12 months. We will allow three minutes for the discussion of it' . It took the Government four months to get the legislation into the Parliament. It allowed two days for the Opposition to look at it, and is allowing three minutes to discuss it. There has been no proper time to evaluate this particular Bill. So far as it goes, all we can say is that, at this stage, with the unlisted property trusts in the condition they are, the BILL 1991 real concern is that the underlying assets behind those unlisted property trusts are not suffIcient to enable an orderly distribution of the entitlements of those who hold the units. With the Government having already frozen them, we believe that the legislation has to be put in place. Let me make this clear: this money has frozen for the last four months with no legislative warrant at all. Unless this legislation goes through, there would in fact be out court cases agains·t all of those unlisted property trusts, asking managers and trustees I why it is that they have failed to disgorge and moneys in accordance with the trust deeds when there was no legislation in place to authorise them to deal with those moneys. In .those very sad and sorry circumstances we can do no more than indicate that we will the support this BilL We will make it very clear that this problem has arisen because of gross incompetence. The way in which this legislacomes into the Parliament is an indicaand tion of that. We have seen two elements of in gross incompetence: firstly, a high interest rate policy which crushed asset values in the trust; and, secondly, regulatory mismanage(Mr ment which led to the problem in the first and which we are now trying to undo with no solution in sight. This Bill tries to come to grips with it and must be supported for that reason.",44

Again, the way in which this legislation has been brought on is tragic. The Bill was read a second time by the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) on Thursday last week and is being debated today. The Bill is fixing up existing errors in the corporations law, which came about because the Government previously mismanaged its legislative proposals in relation to this issue. The Bill implementing the corporations law first came on for debate on Wednesday, 14 November 1990. That Bin was guillotined through the Parliament with 39 others, and 60 minutes was allowed for debate. I said then that there would be errors. The whole saga since has proved that I was right. That law had to be amended in June of this year and the Government did exactly the same thing. It introduced a Bill on Wednesday, 29 May, declared 33 Bills urgent, guillotined them through the Parliament and brought the matter back on for debate on the Wednesday. On that occasion it allotted 40 minutes for debate. This Bill was introduced on Thursday last week and is being debated today---Tuesday. It is being guillotined through with 22 other Bills, and I think this time we have 45 minutes in which to debate it. There are still outstanding matters in relation to the corporations law that have not been attended to. The reason why these errors are not being attended to is that this Government's legislative program is an absolute disgrace. The Attorney-General can take some personal responsibility for this because he rejoices in the title of Chairman of the Cabinet legislative subcommittee. It is his personal responsibility to ensure that legislation matches Cabinet decisions. It is his personal responsibility to get legislation into this Parliament for debate. In his own area he has proved himself totally incompetent at getting legislation into this House on time to allow considered and mature reflection, to allow full and proper debate and to allow for the possibility of amendment in order to get corporation law right. Every time the Attorney-General moves an amendment, he says, 'We, on behalf of the Government, are terribly concerned at the abuse which occurred in the corporate markets during the 1980s, during the period that we were responsible for corporations law and now we are going to fix it'. The Government brings in these Bills, piecemeal, without adequate notice, without time for debate and without amendment. His words ring hollow when they are matched against his performance. When we were debating amendments to the corporations law in June I said that there were two parts of the corporations law that particularly concerned me. I was concerned about the Australian company number requirements. I raised that issue when the legislation first came in. I said that the corporations law had gone too far in requiring the nine-digit number on all business letters, statements of account, invoices, receipts, orders for goods, official notices or publications. I said that they were an overkill and it was ridiculous that, under this law, retail operations would have to put a nine-digit Australian company number on a receipt when one went down to Safeway to buy a carton of milk. I said it was ridiculous that we were enacting a law which meant that real estate agents-companies which advertised houses for sale-would have to put a nine-digit Australian company number on their advertisement. The Government has finally come in with this amendment. Because it deals with those matters, it is a good amendment and we will support it. No longer will cash register receipts be required to display the Australian company number, no longer will the Australian company number be required on advertisements or other promotional material and no longer will the Australian company number be required on State labelling laws. This is a sensible amendment; it is something that should have been right in November of last year. It is a particular tragedy that it has taken 12 months to get it right. When we were last debating this matter in June 1991 I also raised the concerns I had with the fundraising provisions. Under the new corporations law the definition of what was regarded as something to which a prospectus was required was widened. Also under the new corporations law we did not have the comfort zone that we used to have when issuing a prospectus-taking it down to the Corporate Affairs Commission and having matters checked off. The system was fundamentally changed so that prospectuses had a wider application, the issuers took a greater liability on the prospectuses and those who were issuing undertook a much greater responsibility in relation to fundraising procedures. It turns out that the law went too far-a matter which I have raised before. There was considerable doubt as to whether a prospectus was required for secondary trading on the SEAT system, the stock exchange automatic transaction system. This Bill is good in so far as it clarifies that and takes it out. It also clarifies how the prospectus provisions will apply to secondary trading and extends the operation of the defence in relation to liability on prospectuses. At the moment, if one makes a material omission from a prospectus one does not have that defence, which will be added by this Bill; that is, providing one has taken reasonable steps and has reasonable grounds to believe that there is no material omission, the defence will apply. I believe that although we should expect those who are fundraising to take liability on their documents, we do not want to unduly inhibit fundraising on the Australian domestic market. One of the ways we can unduly inhibit fundraising on the Australian domestic market is by not adequately balancing the offences and the defences that are put into the corporations law. In so far as we are now fixing the balance, this is welcome and we will support it. There are also provisions in this Bill which will facilitate trading of new products such as share warrants. I am terribly concerned about fundraising. One thing we have to do in this country is encourage people to invest. If a person has a new product or if he wants to set up a new business and needs some capital, there are a couple of ways he can go about it. He can borrow from a bank or he can go out to the market and say, 'I have this idea. I'm going to float a company. This is the way it is going to operate. Why don't you come and invest?'. If we can facilitate fundraising in the domestic market on that kind of basis, we facilitate new companies starting up, new products being developed and new jobs being created. If we make our fundraising provisions too difficult, too tight or too onerous, people either will be inhibited from developing new businesses altogether or they may be forced into debt rather than equity. Where that debt comes from overseas, we know that it has the capacity to add to the national foreign debt, which is already a millstone around the shoulders of our nation. So we ought to be encouraging domestic equity fundraising. We ought to pay a lot of attention to it. We ought to make sure that, when we protect investors, we do not go too far to the other extreme and inhibit legitimate fundraising activity. Let me make it also clear, as we in the Opposition have made it clear in this place over a very long period, that we want to protect investors, we want to encourage people to invest in companies. Investing in companies is going to be the basis for developing Australian business. If we want people to invest, they have to know what the rules are, the rules have to be enforced and they have to be clear. People have to be sure that it is safe to go out into the market again. During the whole sad and sorry saga of the 1980s, I think a lot of people came to the conclusion that it was not safe to be out there in the market. We will SUppOlt laws that protect genuine investors. We will support laws that encourage people to know that they will not be ripped off by basic fraud, that they will be protected against rule breaking, but at the same time there is an urgent and pressing need to ensure that those rules do genuinely enhance the fundraising capacity in the Australian market. There are also reforms in this Bill to facilitate faster settlement on securities transactions over a standard period of five days, which will accord with international standards approved by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. This is intended to improve the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange by reducing delays, risks and costs .. This raises an interesting point that I think is sometimes not adequately understood in Australia. The Australian stock market competes with markets all round the world. If one wanted to buy shares, one could buy them in some Australian companies in New York, in some Australian companies in London, or in Sydney or Melbourne on the Australian Stock Exchange. It is very much in our interests that our market be competitive with those round the world. We would prefer people to trade the shares of Australiafl companies on Australian markets. If they are trading those shares on Australian markets, it is Australians who will be employed in the businesses of buying and selling and settling and Australians who will be employed in the business of analysing and dealing with clients. This will be, if you like, an industry all of its own, with all of that wealth generating and employment generating facility. I really do think that we need to encourage our own domestic markets, which are in competition with international markets, to adopt international best practice and to compete aggressively for that business. I look forward to the time when the Australian Stock Exchange is able to introduce the final stage in this, which will be automatic settlement. I know that it is developing procedures for that at the moment. Those reforms are welcome. They are good reforms. I think the Stock Exchange ought to be commended for the steps that it has taken to bring its practice into accord with best international practice. The legislative underpinning of this is also welcomed because it will extend the provisions of the national guarantee fund to cover failures on borrowed scrip, which will be very much a part of the five-day settlement procedure. So, in those significant respects, this Bill is welcomed and we will support it. As I said, we will support any improvements in our corporate law which protects investors and creditors and the public, and at the same time facilitates competition and efficiency in our own domestic and financial arrangements. I would like to bring myself to one matter of real concern to the Opposition in this regulatory area, and that is the unlisted property trusts. Unlisted property trusts constitute an area of the market in which billions of dollars has been invested. At the moment, redemptions in relation to unlisted property trusts are frozen. They were frozen as a result of the announcement by the Attorney-General and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on 23 July 1991. This House has just passed legislation-about fifteen minutes ago-to implement that legislative freeze, but do not think for a moment that we have solved the problem. An we have done is give legislative backing to a freeze which says that people cannot either have their units bought back or have their units redeemed in a shorter period than 12 months unless various meetings occur at which the unit holders vote to shorten the provisions. How did this situation arise? How was it that this Parliament was put in the position of having to freeze people's investments? Let me make one thing clear: when unit holders bought units in unlisted property trusts, they bought on terms and conditions which were set out in a trust deed. Almost universally those terms and conditions said that they would be entitled to have their money back on certain periods of notice, whether it be 30 days or 60 days. They invested under an established regime which has now been changed. I think anybody who has been put in that position is entitled to be concerned. Suppose that someone puts his money into a bank account, an at-call account. If when that person goes down to get his money back, the bank says that all at-call accounts have now been converted to 90-day accounts, that person might be legitimately concerned, and would be entitled to be legitimately concerned. It would only be if there were overriding and pressing circumstances that this Parliament would change the terms and conditions of a particular investment. It does happen. If there is a run on a bank, sometimes a bank closes and all of those at-call accounts are in fact frozen. So it does happen. It can be justified in certain circumstances. But why was it that the problem arose in relation to the unlisted property trusts? The first reason was the high interest rate policy of the Hawke Government, which deliberately pumped up interest rates in 1988-89 in order to bring back the growth of monetary supply and in order to bring back the growth in the economy which was unsustainable. The then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), told us that. He has made it absolutely and abundantly clear that he pumped up interest rates. He did it deliberately. He even said that this was the recession that we had to have, and he brought it on. Once interest rates were pumped up and that recession was brought on, as could be expected in a recessionary climate asset values fell. So people who had invested in property, on certain assumptions as to what the value of the property would be, were caught by the high interest rate policy of the Hawke-Keating Government. They found that the assets underlying those unlisted property trusts were not sufficient to justify valuations which had been factored in at an earlier period. Many people started to try to redeem their units. The number of redemptions and buy-back requests meant that the unlisted property trusts were not liquid enough to pay the money back, and that is how the problem arose. The other cause of the problem, I must say, was a regulatory failure. In order to set up an unlisted property trust, it is necessary to have the trust deed approved by the regulatory authority. The National Companies and Securities Commission had various conditions that it required to be put into trust deeds before it would allow those trust deeds to be approved. One of the requirements that was made effective by a policy statement release of 7 March 1988 was that there had to be a term in these deeds that would enable unit holders to get their money back within 60 days. The NCSC said that the trust deed had to permit the money to be paid back within 60 days. One could not get unlisted property trust deeds set up after 7 March 1988 without complying with that condition. So the regulator was saying that, in relation to this kind of investment where the unlisted property trusts were going to take money from the public and invest it long, the unlisted property trusts had to guarantee to the public that they could give the money back short. They set up a fundamentally unstable form of investment-a form of investment which borrowed from the holders of units on a short term basis but invested their funds on a long term basis. The predictable happened: when the investors sought to get the money out, the assets of those unlisted property trusts could not be liquidated in time to satisfy them and we had the first round of the crisis in July 1990. The NCSC responded to that-this was at the time of the NCSC-ASC changeover-and it started saying that it would prefer 180-day redemption periods. It brought in some guidelines, which I welcomed and which would enable there to be more backing to the unlisted property trust industry. It put forward a whole raft of requirements as to redemption period, liquidity requirements, valuations and licensing of trust managers. That was put in place for the future, but the first round of the crisis concerned the independent unlisted property trusts, which began holding meetings, calling in the unit holders, explaining the problem and varying trust deeds. That was the way that they coped with it-and, may I say, I think they coped with it by and large very well. It looked as though the crisis had passed, but it had not. Some of the major financial institutions and banks, at the time of the first crisis, had said, 'Well, whatever the problem with the independent unlisted property trusts, we are large financial institutions and we will continue to redeem units on the hitherto same basis'. Although they had said that in July 1990, it became clear by April of 1991 that they were in trouble and a delegation came to see the then Treasurer and the AttomeyGeneral and said to them, 'Look, there is a real problem here. We are going to have trouble coping with all the redemption requests that we have'. The problem was put into the lap of the Treasurer and the AttomeyGeneral. One of the features that really concerns me about this is that some of those institutions that went to see the Government on 11 April 1991, to warn the Government of the problem, continued taking money after that date. Even though they had warned the Government that there was a problem with redemptions, some of these institutions continued to take money after that date. I know that there is a provision in this Bill, in proposed new section 1076N, for institutions that took money after 11 April 1991 to pay back such money. From my point of view, I believe that they are morally obliged to do that. I notice that the Bill does not make it mandatory. It does not say that they shall pay it back; it is permissive; it says that they may pay it back. But 1 believe that they are ,morally obliged to pay back money that they took after they had been to see the Government to warn the Government about this problem and, as I understand it, to request effectively a freeze. A freeze came on 23 July. We did not see the legislation, of course, until 7 November. There was great urgency about the freeze-a 4.50 p.m. announcement in a joint press conference between the Treasurer and the Attorney-General which said, 'As from this minute anybody whose request has not been received will have their money frozen for 12 months'. Then it took the Government four months to bring in the legislation. The announcement was right. The point I am making to the Attorney is that the announcement was not sufficient; what was needed was legislation. It was four months before legislation was brought to the Parliament. The Government should have been ready to whack legislation into the Parliament immediately because this freeze had no basis without legislation. 1 raised the point before: in the interim, between July and November, or between July and whenever this legislation comes into force-if it does come into force-there was no legal basis whatsoever for the freezing of the money. Anybody could have taken any one of those funds to court saying, 'I invested my money under a trust deed and the law as at this moment says that I am entitled to get it back with so much notice'. The court would have been entitled to say, 'That is right; we will enforce the trust deed'. The only legislative backing is this Bill-and it has not even been passed. This Bill will be backdated to 23 July to try to right that situation. Of course, we know that this Bill is not the answer because all this Bill does in relation to the unlisted property trusts is to freeze redemptions for 12 months. I know that there are other, good features of it. For example, the time period can be shortened with the approval of 75 per cent of unit holders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25 per cent of unit holders eligible to vote do so. Even if they vote to shorten the time period, the trustee or the manager can apply to the Australian Securities Commission to override that on the grounds that it will threaten the liquidity of the trust. I also know that there are hardship provisions which enable early withdrawal at a discount not exceeding 7.5 per cent. Those features are to be commended. But we know that this Bill is no answer to the problem because all it has done is to freeze redemptions. The real question is: what happens on 23 July 1992 when the freeze thaws, as it were? That is the real question. The best proposal that has been put forward is for, these unlisted property trusts to be listed. 1 know that there have been regulatory problems in ensuring that everybody's interests are protected, but this is the best solution as far as I can see-getting these property trusts onto the stock market so that there is a liquidity in the interim. One has to observe that, if the property trust were listed and one were trying to sell a unit which was frozen, that would be discounted back into the price. But at least there would be some kind of facility to try to liquidate that asset and to get money. That is, I hope, going to be the best solution. Of course, the long term hope is that asset values will recover. We all hope that asset values will recover. We hope that this recession that we had to have-brought on deliberately by this Government-ends. We hope that dearly. We hope it for the $6 billion of assets that are tied up in unlisted property trusts-another feature of this recession. That is the best prospect that these people have of getting their money back and we dearly hope that the recession will end, although one cannot hope in vain and one must say that the Government, divided as it is, with the economy as it is, with the significant problems that are facing Australia, with no coherent direction and no coherent economic policy, is not doing as much as it could or should be doing to bring Australia out of recession. If by the time the redemptions come into play after the freeze has thawed the underlying asset values are not sufficient to entitle unit holders to all that they expect, what will happen is that they will get back pro rata or proportionately less than they otherwise might have expected. Effectively, by the use of updated valuations, it will be an administration of an orderly distribution according to current assets at that time rather than expectations as they might have been 12 months earlier. I suppose that the unfairness is that, if one anticipated this problem and had made one's request early, one might have done better by getting one's money out early than did those who waited until later. I suppose one could justify the freeze on the basis that, although some people will not do as well as they probably would have done otherwise, other people who put their redemption requests in late will not do as badly as they would otherwise have done. In that respect, it is an orderly distribution, much as we would expect, on a liquidation or under a scheme of arrangement. The history of this issue is littered with incompetence-economic incompetence, regulatory failure and legislative delay. We have said that we were for the changes in relation to the unlisted property trust because it was a dreadful situation and a dreadful choice. But we do not want to pretend that the problem has been solved. This Bill will amend the Australian company number requirements, fundraising provisions and will facilitate faster settlements, which are improvements. They are to be welcomed and should be part of an ongoing program to improve corporate law in this country.",45
163,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991. People listening to this debate need to be reminded that the Opposition has a history in relation to Australian company law. I begin by saying to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that under the Opposition's much beloved cooperative scheme, this whole question of unlisted property trusts would have been churning around in the ministerial council. Members of the Opposition did not have a mechanism and had to go to the lowest common denominator of legislative arrangements. They have to face that. I recognise that the honourable member for Higgins has changed his position since he has been in this Parliament. His Party is stuck with the fact that it was not prepared to go ahead with the Australian Securities Commission. In the past it supported the old cooperative scheme, which, quite frankly, was a draft horse in a modem era. It found that some of the geniuses that it had at the State level were opposing the new Australian Securities Commission right up until Christmas time last year. These manoeuvrings have been going on within the Liberal and National parties-particularly at the State level, but even within the Federal Parliament - which have opposed these important regulatory reforms. Mr Costello-When did I oppose them?",50
164,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member was not listening when I said that he has changed his position in recent times, but he is stuck with the history of some of his colleagues. Basically, by dragging the chain, they have left it open for some of the more extraordinary corporate practices that have gone on. I will take the honourable member back: the old cooperative scheme did not have the capacity to deal with matters quickly and that is why we wanted the Australian Securities Commission. I will move to another issue-the honourable member for Higgins might like to talk to his colleagues in the Senate about this-that is, the self-incrimination procedures of the ASC. This is where we get what I call the limp wrists of the civil libertarians. Some of the honourable member's colleagues in the Senate will be there, limp wrists and all, saying that they are really concerned that one could be self-incriminated through a hearing of the Australian Securities Commission. With the benefit of previous committee procedures, I was able to look at some of the evidence of the NCSC. Let us look at what the Opposition will open up if, as I anticipate, these limp wristed civil libertarians in the Senate say, 'This is a terrible denial Let us look at rights. I agree with the honourable member for Higgins about the rights of the ordinary shareholder. What would happen if someone such as Connell, Skase, Bruce Judge or other geniuses of the corporate world were to go into the ASC and simply dump all their documents? They could not be acted upon. That is basically it. If they dump all the documents in the hearing, they could not be acted upon later on. That is really what is at issue. I say to those honourable members who are serious about protecting investors that they had better talk to their colleagues in the Senate. We know what they will do: they will cop out, like many of their State colleagues copped out with the new ASC. Derek Tomlinson in Western Australia has a lot to answer for. There was a sitting of the State Parliament between Christmas and the New Year in an attempt to get this launched. What sort of company does the honourable member for Higgins keep? He is not a bad sort of bloke, but the trouble is that some of his fellow travellers are not up to it. He should talk to his colleagues in the Senate to see whether they are prepared to come good on this. I am not anticipating the report of a committee that will come to this House, but I am saying that unless we are prepared to get really serious on this question of self-incrimination procedures, we are leaving open the opportunity for the corporate crooks-Western Australia has had more than its fair share-to simply go into a hearing of the ASC, dump all of their documents and claim privilege later. There are enough claims of privilege before the WA Inc. royal commission without inflicting this upon the ASC. I hope the honourable member for Higgins talks to his colleagues in the Senate and firms them up about it, because then we will pick him up on the question of supporting investors. If history is true, they will go to water on it because they went to water on the ASC. We support laws that protect genuine investors. I welcome the comments of the honourable member for Higgins on this matter. We had difficulty getting a meeting of minds both here and in the States. We are of rights' . finally beginning to get that. I warmly applaud the sensible moves taken by the Australian Securities Commission to relax the requirements on Australian company numbers. A number of sensible matters have been raised by people in the business worldmatters which have been taken to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and to the Australian Securities Commission. There has been a sensible recognition of difficulties. This legislation deals with the effect of the amendments proposed to the ACN and ARBN provisions. It states: · cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine and which set out information which is stored in the machine will not be required to contain the ACN or ARBN of the company or body issuing the receipt; · alternative abbreviations for ACN and ARBN (without full stops) will be available for use by companies and bodies in all official documents; · an advdrtising documentthis is very importantissued by a company which is not also used as a document for undertaking some form of transaction with a person will not be required to contain the company's ACN or ARBN... The honourable member for Higgins should go back and look at some of the misrepresentations of some of his State colleagues. We had this in Western Australia. This ACN was going to be the newall-powerful data collection basis which would stop business in its tracks. I ask: are we supporting genuine investors? Are we restoring confidence in the business world and in the stock market? That is what this system is about. There was a link to, what I might call, the new world order geniuses. They picked this one up as well and ran. This is just another way of trying to control the world. I know that the honourable member for Higgins does not associate with that kind of thinking, but he has to go and cleanse the minds of some of his people. Some of his Senate colleagues are on the record as misrepresenting the ACN when it came in. They were protecting the same shonky attitudes and practices of the past. None of us on this side were in favour of those practices. Some of them are currently being investigated before royal commissions. We ought to make that very clear. Another issiIe that needs to be clearly addressed is the question of shield of the Crown. We on this side of the House have a very strong view on the question of the shield of the Crown and Crown statutory authorities. I am very concerned that it still exists in some States. It limits the ability of the ASC to conduct proper investigations. It is still a concern that I have. If one looks at the problems in Western Australia, one sees that some of those problems are traceable to the fact that we are dealing with Crown statutory authorities in respect of which the then NCSC-now the ASC-would have limits on its investigatory procedures. I acknowledge that there was a High Court decision in relation to the Swan Brewery which removed Crown privilege. I am concerned that there will be a move to restore Crown privilege. The only way one could make these statutory authorities accountable is to remove their Crown privilege and make them trade on a level playing field. The next issue that has to be addressed-we continue to see this-is the question of directors fees. There are extraordinary levels of directors fees being taken out. We recently had a problem with the Permanent Building Society in Western Australia. I advise all members of the public to have a look at the size of the fees that were simply skimmed off that company by those directors. Interestingly, if it was based upon performance-given that they have sent the show broke-investors ought to get some of the money paid back from the directors. That is how good they are. One could go through Skase, Rothwells and the Bond Corporation. Another little outfit in Western Australia called Australian Industrial Investment sent the debenture holders brokeit took out massive directors fees. I have raised that matter with Mr Hartnell. It is an issue that those in the community have to pursue with great vigour. While we have had sensible wage restraint across the community, what I call 'the scandal of directors fees' continues. The settlement of share transfers and the five day arrangement has been addressed very sensibly in this legislation. That is very necessary. When we look at the slow processes that occurred in the past, it really was a disgrace that it took so long to have a proper settlement of share transfers. I want to leave some time for the AttomeyGeneral to speak. I close by saying that these are important reforms. We hope that the Opposition persuades its Senate colleagues to be as open-minded as they need to be in this area.",51
165,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"in reply-There are a couple of matters to which I wish to refer in the brief time available, in relation to the comments by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and unlisted property trusts, although I suppose one cannot complain to the Opposition about the time available. The shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was aware the day before of what was going to be announced by the Government. The Opposition remained absolutely tight on the issue, as it should have, and this is the first opportunity I have had of indicating that the Government appreciated the fact that that confidence was held and that the Opposition understood the problems. So does the honourable member for Higgins, but of course then he tells us that it is not the end; there is still a lot more to be done. One of the most interesting aspects of the honourable member for Higgins is that he has a problem. On the one hand, he likes legislation to come in quickly-and his complaint here is that it took four months to get the Corporations (Unlisted Property Trusts) Amendment Bill into Parliament, the announcement having been made, of course, late in July. On the other hand, if we bring legislation in too quickly he complains bitterly that he has not had time to look at it. For example, that comment applies in relation to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. An exposure draft went out in August, and we have the bitter complaint that he has not had time to look at it. He is going to have to make up his mind about how long he needs to examine legislation which has been around since August. The announcement in relation to the unlisted property trusts was made in July and he knew all about it. I do not pretend-and never have-that the imposition of the 12-month notice period is of itself going to resolve all the difficulties of unlisted property trusts. We know that. I said that in my second reading speech, if the honourable member would like to have a look at it. The unlisted property trust industry has recognised the difficulties and many of its members are pursuing the various options and going through the restructuring, which we always knew was then part of the statement and is spelt out in the legislacourse tion. In respect of the second matter before usCorporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)-one of the problems the honourable member for Higgins is going to have is this knowledge that he always has that he is right. I mentioned the other day that in respect of the Copyright Amendment Bill he came in here one night saying, 'If you had moved the Costello amendments, all would have been well'. Mr Costello-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. That is a complete misrepresentation. It was in fact the Credit Reporting Bill. I came in and said that if the Attorney-General had moved the Costello amendments he would have been right. Perhaps the Attorney-General did not even know what Bill we were debating that night. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SulIivan)-There is no point of order.",52
166,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"On that basis he was a knowall on another matter, not in respect of the Copyright Bill. ",53
167,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"He is a know-all on most matters, as the honourable member for Chifley interjects. When I first looked at the ACN matter in April 1990, a lot of the provisions that we have now decided to deal with in relation to the ACN did not appeal to me particularly either, but at that stage I was not prepared to say that I was possessed of the omnipotent knowledge, like the honourable member for Higgins, and it took a while to get all the feedback necessary. Now we have dealt with it. By and large, however, he agrees with the legislation, which is merciful and sensible. Having regard to the record on the Opposition side in relation to corporate regulation, I suppose we ought to be grateful for small mercies. I want briefly to touch on the continuing criticism in relation to the prospectus provisions. Those involved in preparing prospectuses are required to assume an appropriate degree of responsibility for any loss they suffer, subject to the fact that there is of that defence which is spelt out at page 9 of the second reading speech, which was not there before and which I think was necessary. One of the things that is heard about the prospectus provision is that it is forcing companies offshore; it is causing difficulties in domestic investment. In relation to the latter point, there is certainly concern about discouragement of investment. There is a very split view on that. I note that John Green, a leading' corporate lawyer and partner at Freehill Hollingdale and Page, is reported to have said that capital raising by public companies in the future will be 'much faster, much more efficient and much more honest and probably much cheaper'. People are feeling their way. I agree with the honourable member in respect of the new requirements, but I get very tired of that sort of continual carping criticism and I do not think it is justified. In respect of the idea of companies being forced offshore and all that nonsense, I just note that the Australian Financial Review editorial of 5 November put it in perspective by saying that there was $3m since 30 JuneMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SuIIivan)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the afftrmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the afftrmative. Bill read a third time. NA BILL (No.3) 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 November, on motion by Mr Free: That the Bill be now read a second time.",53
168,Mr DOWNER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"We have waited eight months for this piece of legislation to finally come before the House, and after that wait the guillotine has been applied to it and we get one hour for debate. That sort of lack of respect for the parliamentary process profoundly disappoints most members of this Parliament. Once the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) is enacted it will have been the twenty-ninth sales tax Act passed through this Parliament since 1930 when the wholesale sales tax system-which the Labor Party still applauds and still loves-was introduced in Australia. It was legislation that was introduced by the Scullin Labor Government, with a rate of 2112 per cent. There were only about a dozen exemptions to the wholesale sales tax when the Scullin Labor Government introduced it and since then there has been an almost constant move, through amendments to the legislation-something like 28 amendments and two volumes of regulations-to change the original Act and provide a whole range of different exemptions. Mr Jull-A broad-based consumption tax.",54
169,Mr DOWNER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Indeed, we started with a broad-based consumption tax, and through a rather curious and elongated process we have reached a more narrowly based consumption tax which is shrouded in confusion. The objective of this legislation is to extend the exemptions that currently exist in the sales tax legislation to more comprehensively cover business inputs. The legislation will extend those exemptions at a full year's cost in 199293 of $445m, but it is interesting to reflect on why the Government wants to extend exemptions from the wholesale sales tax for business inputs. It really is important to reflect on that, particularly in the context of the current and very interesting debate in Australia about whether we should join the rest of the world with a goods and services tax or whether we should continue with this 1930s age-old consumption tax-what I believe is the oldest living consumption tax in the world today. It will be interesting to see whether any of the officials from the Australian Taxation Office are able to discover an older living consumption tax regime than the one we have in Australia. When we look at the March industry statement we learn why the Government want'> to introduce this whole range of additional exemptions to the wholesale sales tax. I want the House to reflect on the words that were used: The measures reduce the cost burden of wholesale sales tax on inputs for goods producers (and subcontractors performing eligible activities) and thereby reduce the cascading of the cost through the production chain. Production costs will therefore be reduced by significantly more than the revenue cost of the measures. In particular, the competitiveness of Australia's export and importcompeting industries will be enhanced by the new wholesale sales tax exemptions. It is funny that from time to time we hear from the Labor Party that the wholesale sales tax does not add to the cost of exports, yet the industry statement speech says that 'the competitiveness of Australia's export and import competing industries will be enhanced by the new wholesale sales tax exemptions'. The industry statement went on to say: Many inputs to goods production are already exempt from WST. The existing exemptions include the aids to manufacture provisions, tions for goods used in mining activities and for agricultural and fishing equipment. The extensions announced in this statement will significantly reduce the remaining elements of input taxation facing goods producers. Note that it said 'significantly reduce', not eliminate. So, in the first place, we have a clear recognition by the Government that its age old wholesale sales tax regime is one that imposes costs on the business community. It is incontestable, on the basis of the words used in the industry statement, the second reading speech and this legislation, that the wholesale sales tax imposes costs on the Australian business community, on the mining sector and on the farming community which reduce their capacity to compete. The Government recognises that.. It knows that these exemptions will help reduce those costs. I accept that. That is why we are happy to support the legislation. But they will not eliminate those costs. The Government knows that as well, because its words mean that the exemptions will not eliminate those costs. The Government knows-as is implied in the introduction of this legislation and in the words that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Senator Button used in the March industry statement-that the wholesale sales tax adds to the price of our exports. It reduces our capacity to compete internationally. Very interestingly, we know from both the industry statement and from the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) that the wholesale sales tax has what is sometimes called a cascading effect. The Government always hopes when it makes these types of statements that a quicJ<: pass over the concept of the cascading effect of a tax will mean that it is something that people will not recognise, understand or care about. But what does the cascading effect mean? It means that the wholesale sales tax is a tax which in many instances-something like 40 per cent of instances according to leading accountants in Sydney-applies to goods which have already had some element of tax applied to them. It is a tax upon a tax. That is what a cascading effect is, and that is why, by providing in this Bill $445m worth of exemptions, the Government claims that the exemp- business community will get a benefit of something in the vicinity of $1 billion. The Australian Taxation Office does not actually know whether those figures are right; they are guesstimates. In any case, the point is a very clear one: the cascading effect on the business community of these taxes where exemptions will now be provided is about double the actual impact of the taxes. That is a very important point to understand when looking at the workings of the wholesale sales tax system. The fourth point that I want to make in relation to the anomalies that this legislation addresses but obviously, by definition, does not eliminate is that the wholesale sales tax actually militates against local manufacturers competing in the Australian market with importers, because the products which are imported typically come from countries which have GST regimes. Consequently, there is no element of sales tax at all in respect of those goods at the time they arrive on the Australian waterfront. After they leave the Australian waterfrontif they ever do, weeks, months or years later-they eventually have the wholesale sales tax applied to them, assuming that they are taxable goods. The Australian competing product, up to the equivalent point of the imported product reaching the waterfront in Australia, has inevitably been subject to the incidental impact of the wholesale sales tax. Consequently, the basic cost structure of the Australian product is higher than the basic cost structure of the imported product; and, because o,f the existence of the wholesale sales tax system in Australia, we are giving imports a competitive advantage over domestically produced products. We have one of the greatest balance of payments crises we have ever had as a country. We have the largest foreign debt that we, as a country, have ever had. Yet one of the things that we are doing is adding to the price of our exports with a wholesale sales tax; and another thing that we are doing is giving a lot of imports a competitive advantage over domestically produced goods within the Australian market, again because of the wholesale sales tax. This legislation concedes philosophicallynot, of course, in detail but philosophicallythat there is an overwhelming case for the introduction of a goods and services tax in Australia. As I make my next few points in relation to the legislation, honourable members will see why a goods and services tax would not only address the issues that this legislation addresses but do so in a comprehensive way which would ensure that, effectively, at the end of the day, no business inputs are subject to sales tax, that the price of exports actually declines and that there is no cascading effect from the tax, because with a goods and services tax one cannot have a cascading effect. Even in the Labor Party's scare campaign document on the goods and services tax which we released to everybody today-'if this tax is introduced the sky will fall in' point is made that the goods and services tax has no cascading effect, unlike its own wholesale sales tax. I wonder whether the Government thinks that the cascading effect is a good thing. That is something that we all ought to reflect on. This legislation still leaves a range of probtems because there are still business inputs, as the Government readily concedes in both the March industry statement and in the Treasurer's second reading speech, which will not be subject to exemptions from the wholesale sales tax. What is more, this legislation will just add to the confusion that already exists with the complex classification and administration regime for the business community flowing from the wholesale sales tax. One of the arguments that we hear in support of the wholesale sales tax-and I believe this is an argument in support of the wholesale sales tax; I am objective in this debate-is that for the Australian Taxation Office it is relatively cheap to administer. I think it spends something like $23m on salaries for the 760 or so people in the Australian Taxation Office who administer the wholesale sales tax. The trouble is that those who bear the inordinate cost of administering this taxation system are the 75,000 businesses that actually have to pay it. According to the accountancy profession, those businesses spend something like $50m a year on accountancy fees just trying to get goods that have been produced subject to the wholesale sales tax properly classified and to deal with the administration of the tax. They spend approximately another $50m on lawyers' fees, and they spend something like $400m all up on the costs of employing people within those businesses to administer the wholesale sales tax system. That is a total figure of $500m. When it is claimed that the wholesale sales tax is cheap to administer, we should keep in mind that, sure, it is cheap for the Australian Taxation Office, but it is a massive impost on the business community just in terms of administration costs. The reason for that, which this legislation really just illustrates, is - the that one always has problems of definitions when one has over 650 exemptions, which is what we have with a wholesale sales tax, and when one has three different rates-IO, 20 and 30 per cent. In this legislation we have definitions of eligible goods, eligible products and so on. As one works through the legislation and thinks through the different goods that could be exempted, one realises that there are a lot of grey areas and a lot of questions. Indeed, whilst the legislation intends to create a lot more exemptions-and that is fair enough-it raises as many questions as it actually answers. I have taken the opportunity of speaking to accountants about this legislation and how they view it. They say that they are very pleased about the legislation. I am surprised to hear that they are so pleased about it because most chartered accountants in Australia support-in fact, I do not think I have ever met one who does not-the goods and services tax, for obvious reasons. But the reason that accountants are pleased about it is that they see a lot of work for them flowing from this legislation. Members of the House might remember the fiasco a month or so ago when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was trying to answer questions about the new exemptions that were going to apply to farmers under the sales tax regime. There is no question that this legislation does extend exemptions to farmers. But without going back over that debate again, it was the confusion with which he handled the issue that simply underlined the complexity of trying to have accurate definitions. What is an on-farm vehicle? What percentage of time does that vehicle have to spend on-farm? Is there a complete 100 per cent sales tax exemption on a vehicle that is not really used as an on-farm vehicle but is used to take the children to school, for shopping or whatever? Well, it depends. All those things have to be worked out. That is an example. But the complexity of it all and the question of definitions which flows from differential rates and exemptions mean that it is very expensive for the business community to administer, even if it is not for the Australian Taxation Office. This legislation in particular applies to manufacturers, mineral producers and primary producers, but there is a whole range of inputs-incontestably business inputs-that it does not apply to. An example is goods in the hands of a manufacturer. The manufacturing machinery is exempt now and will be exempt under this legislation; tax on manufacturing machinery is fully refunded with the GST as well-so the effect is pretty much the same. But in many circumstances the fax machines and the photocopiers used by manufacturers will still be subject to the 20 per cent sales tax. The computers for general accounting will still be subject to the 20 per cent sales tax, unless those computers are used specifically for the purpose of manufacturing. There is a grey area that might have to be resolved, and it depends on how the Tax Office administers this legislation. But as accountants read it at the moment, it appears that computers for general accounting will still be subject to a 20 per cent sales tax. I hasten to add that with a GST the wholesale sales tax will be abolished and consumers will not have that impost thrust upon them. Salesmen's cars will be taxed at 20 or 30 per cent, despite this legislation. Despite what the legislation says, in certain circumstances some staff amenities equipment can still be subject to 10 or 20 per cent wholesale sales tax. This legislation does not guarantee an exemption from 20 per cent sales tax on advertising videos, brochures and so on. Australia is a big country-everyone in Australia ought to know that-and transport is a very important part of the cost of running this country and running business in it. But this legislation has not successfully provided exemptions in the context of the application of sales tax to the transportation of goods around Australia. Prime movers attract a 20 per cent sales tax today and will attract a 20 per cent sales tax after this legislation is enacted. That will be gone and the GST on the prime movers will be fully refunded up front. The trailers for prime movers attract a 20 per cent sales tax, despite this legislation, but the GST would be fully refunded. Spare parts for prime movers and trailers attract a 20 per cent tax under this legislation but under the GST the tax paid would be fully refunded. Fork-lift trucks attract a 20 per cent tax with Labor; under the coalition GST, the tax would be fully refunded. Freight documents, packaging materials, fax machines, photocopiers, computers, office furniture and fittings for trucking companies-all of these are subject to 10 or 20 per cent sales tax, and the tax on all would be fully refunded with a goods and services tax. The GST obviously will reduce costs. The Labor Party will turn around and say that it is very complicated with a wholesale sales tax regime to administer to provide exemptions for all those sorts of things, and I agree that it is very complicated and very difficult to do. That is why most countries in the world have abolished these schemes and moved to AGST. It is not complicated; it is simple. It is simple to define business inputs and it is simple to provide the rebates up front-very simple to do and very beneficial to the overall cost structure. Under this legislation, for goods in the hands of exporters, we are still left with 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on vans and trucks for transporting export goods to the wharves. This would be fully refunded with a GST. The same thing applies for fork-lift trucks, office furniture and fittings, showroom fittings and fixtures, computers, fax machines, photocopiers and salesmen's cars. Again, all are still subject to the sales tax, all are obviously business inputs; with the GST, the sales tax is abolished and there is a full refund up front. This legislation falls a long way short of achieving what I think it intends to achieve that is, to reduce business costs by trying to squeeze the sales tax system out of business inputs. The Government could extend the exemptions if it wanted to. That would make the legislation much more complex and it would make the legislation more subject to tax avoidance, a point that the Tax Office is only too fully aware of. It is easy to avoid because we have to try to define whether or not something is a business input. The compliance costs keep going up once the exemptions are extended further. The problem with the nature of the wholesale sales tax is 650plus exemptions and a mass of confusion and complexity. What else could we expect with a tax regime which goes back to 19307 As I said earlier, I am sure it is the oldest living consumption tax in the world today. This legislation, by implication-not in its words, the words of the second reading speech or of the Prime Minister's March industry statement-makes the case for the goods and services tax. Under the goods and' services tax all goods and services will be taxed. There mayor may not be a minimal number of exemptions-that is something people will find out between now and 30 November-but all goods and services tax, effectively, will be tax for business. But all goods and services tax paid on business inputs will be refunded in full. The refund system under the goods and services tax is the only way in which we will ever overcome the anomaly of a cascading tax of taxing business inputs incidentally and of adding costs to exports because of the impact of the tax regime. The GST will eliminate cascading altogether. I am happy today to announce again that all exports will be zero rated; all exports from Australia will be free of any sales tax. It is interesting to reflect on what happened in the Philippines when it introduced its goods and services tax. Like most countries, it has a goods and services tax. Unlike Australia, it still had the political courage to introduce one. Within the first year of the Philippines having a goods and services tax, according to the International Monetary Fund, its exports grew by 20 per cent. The experience of Korea is very similar. The reason the Germans were so enthusiastic about introducing a goods and services tax in 1968 was precisely that they thought it would help their exports. Have their exports done well 7 Have they done well! Germany overhauled the United States last year as the biggest exporting nation in the world. Germany exports more than any other country. It is not surprising, because it has high levels of productivity and a goods and services tax-a sensible tax regime. With a goods and services tax our domestic manufacturers will play on a level playing field, at least as far as tax is concerned, with imports. I know people are very worried about the level playing field-they say there is not one. There sure is not when there is a tax regime in this country which discriminates against domestic production in favour of manufactured products that are imported into Australia. By abolishing the current decrepit old great-grandmother of taxation systems, the Australian wholesale sales tax, and replacing it with a goods and services tax we will be able to give local manufacturers a better chance with imports in the domestic market than is currently the case. Mr Jun-And more jobs.",54
170,Mr DOWNER,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Of course. This really is a debate about tax; but, at the end of the day, how does all this translate into people? Politics ultimately is about people. At the end of the day, if the goods and services tax replaced the wholesale sales tax lock, stock and barrel, many of those one million Australians who are currently out of work would be able to get jobs, because it would reduce business costs, eliminate the cascading effect of the wholesale sales tax, make our exports more competitive and make domestic production and sales more competitive with imports; at the end of the day, it means more security for Australians in work and more jobs for those who are not in work at the moment, and that is nearly one million of our fellow countrymen and countrywomen. In conclusion, this legislation goes some of the way towards achieving what the Opposition wants to achieve, but it does fall massively short. There is a lot of work to do yet, but the legislation does concede the intellectual points to the coalition and, sooner or later, the Labor Party will return to the tion it had in 1985 of conceding the debate altogether.",58
171,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was somewhat intrigued by the argument of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in his obvious support for the introduction of a consumption tax in this country. I was intrigued by his argument that suggested that the Germans enthusiastically embraced this in 1968 and that very quickly exports increased. As I recall 1968 to 1972 or thereabouts, it was the Liberals who were in government in this country; so why was it not embraced if it was so terrific then? Mr Downer-Lack of guts.",59
172,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Lack of guts then, too. That is interesting. I think the Liberals were again in power in 1975 to 1983. Was it the same lack of guts? It is a pretty gutless party, then, from the analysis of the honourable member for Mayo. That is fine; I will let that stand. Can I suggest to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in respect of this particular matter, the honourable member has gone on to say, 'Wait till you see the end product of what we are doing and what our proposals will be'. He has mentioned a zero rate of sales tax on exports and so on, and he has said he does not mind reannouncing that. That is great; the Government will look forward to that. But when? Wednesday or Thursday of next week, I think the betting is, that it will be announced. Mr Downer-Put some money on it and see what happens.",59
173,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,Put some money on it? Mr Downer-And see what happens.,59
174,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,A good bet? About as good as the favourite in the Melbourne Cup? Mr Downer-About as good as whether Hawke will remain Leader of the Labor Party-and you don't want him to.,59
175,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is not a bad bet. Why does the honourable member for Mayo not suggest that to the Parliamentary Secretary to  would have something to say about that, too. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. posi- 3), which we are debating tonight, clearly demonstrates that there is certainly a gulf in the division which exists here between those on the other side who are putting forward their views on a consumption tax and the Government, which, as part of its commitment to developing a more productive Australia, is seeking to exempt from sales tax certain inputs in the business productive cycle. That is probably appropriate because, as we have seen-and the Government does not walk away from the fact-and as is rightly pointed out, the whole issue in 1985 of whether the structure of the tax system fundamentally needed to be reviewed or not was examined. There was a White Paper that was produced, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has consistently said, as a result of consideration of that White Paper, that the Government was not of a mind to proceed with the consumption tax, at whatever rate it might be. That was because there was certainly widespread acceptance in the community that yet another tax would not be palatable. Some of the comments that have been made in recent times about the difficulties of selling the idea of a new tax, whatever form it is in, certainly have not been lost on those on the other side, and I am sure they are going to endeavour, to address that when they do finally release their package. By the sound of it, the package might extend into other areas. We on this side of the Parliament and, I am sure, the people of Australia look forward to the contents of this package being revealed. The people of Australia will probably all be sitting down by their television sets or their radios with their calculators at hand, getting ready to see whether the numbers add up. Well they remember the last effort by those on the other side to get their numbers right with tax packages. I am sure that people armed with that experience will be looking forward with a great deal of anticipation to what is coming. This Bill will extend the existing wholesale sales tax exemption to cover a wide range of business inputs for use by goods producers and certain other categories of persons. It is estimated that the net revenue cost of the proposed changes will be something like $240m for the 1991-92 part year and $445m for 1992-93. 'Goods producers' includes those persons carrying on business in the primary production, mining and manufacturing sectors. In particular, of course, those sectors are of great concern to me as a representative of a major manufacturing and mining region of this country. Other persons who will become entitled to exemptions include research and development entities and cargo handlers at sea and international airports. Again, some of those fit nicely into the Port KemblaWollongong industrial complex, which I represent in this place. Exemption will also be available for subcontractors to goods producers or to any other eligible persons. Notwithstanding some of the reservations that have been enunciated in this debate, the measures demonstra,te the Government's commitment to reducing the costs incurred by Australia's goods producing sectors and are part of its coordinated-and it is coordinated-package of measures contained in the March industry statement. They of course included reductions in tariffs on textiles, footwear and cars; increased agricultural assistance; reform of anti-dumping measures; and measures to address the problems encountered by regional Australia as a result of the process of restructuring. That statement, of course, is now some months old; nevertheless, this legislation is welcomed in that it does address this question of the changes necessary to the wholesale sales tax regime. This Bill, as I have suggested, does extend this exemption to a wider range of goods used in production and related activities, such as research and development or engineering and technical design of goods or of production processes; mine site rehabilitation; the transport of goods by rail, pipeline or conveyor between production premises, eligible storage facilities or exempt ports; storage, handling or dispatch of finished goods, raw materials, work in progress or business inputs; and certain ancillary and supporting activities which ensure the efficiency of the production process. These, of course, include training production staff; accident prevention; pollution control; lighting or cleaning of production premises; and scheduling or costing of production. The Bill itself introduces a new general definition of primary production operations. This will place beyond doubt that exemption will be available for general purpose tools for use mainly in carrying out such operations. I am sure, as the honourable member for Mayo pointed out, that clarification in a number of these areas is certainly welcome. In addition to goods producers carrying out research and development, the Bill will apply to certain research and development entities. They will be eligible for exemption or refunds of tax which has been paid on equipment or materials used for researching or developing new or improved Australian goods or production processes. The Bill will provide new exemptions for goods used by persons operating storage or handling facilities for sea or international air cargo, which is of great concern to people at the port of Port Kembla. Clearly, with the continuing economic fortunes of this country under some stress, any operation which can see its costs of handling and production lowered is going to be well received. In the case of the port of Port Kembla-with the development that is taking place there, with investment also being looked at very closely and with confidence returning to that sectorthis is something which I am sure is going to tip the balance in favour of people looking to develop cargo handling facilities at that port. As I have suggested, this particularly important new measure will reduce the operating costs of Australia's sea ports and international airports, and the benefits will flow to all goods for export. They will enhance the opportunities for Australia's exporters to be truly competitive in international marketssomething which I am sure every honourable member of this place supports. The Bill also will allow for special refunds where stock on hand has been purchased inclusive of sales tax after 12 March 1991 and where those goods are used for the first time after the commencement of the Bill in newly exempted activities. That is an important transitional provision, and it recognises that goods producers should not be disadvantaged merely because they are holding tax-paid stocks of goods which will be used for the fust time in exempt circumstances after the legislation takes effect. Not surprisingly though, of course, and as we have already heard in the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo, honourable members opposite, with their usual jaundiced eyes and tired rhetoric, have called for even more. They have asked why the whole thing should not be abolished. I have already commented that under their stewardship over many years, even with their extolling the virtues of a consumption tax in Germany as far back as 1968, nothing was done. The reason of course, as advanced by the honourable member for Mayo, was a succession of gutless Liberal governments. I can say no more on that. It is certainly ironic that some of the people making comment on the consumption tax and wholesale sales tax and a comparison of the benefits of each should try to go back into some history of these matters. It is somewhat ironic that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his former zealous adviser, the now Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), as I have suggested, did not do anything about it at the time. Where was the advice then, and why is there this enthusiasm for embracing such a massive change in the system now? Is it simply being driven by the dries on the other side? Is it because they are kowtowing to certain other interest groups in the community? What is the basis for this? I am sure we will have it all explained to us next week with the release of the goods and services tax, the consumption tax, this concept of applying a tax at a rate we still do not know. We do not know who is going to be exempt or who is going to be compensated. How it will work we do not know. I am not sure whether the back bench of the Opposition even knows at this stage. Certainly very little has come to light about the issue other than some speculative pieces being written. I am sure that, like we on this side of the House, many other people are waiting to see the details. The Opposition is still running this tired idea, despite the fact that it still has not the slightest clue of how to remove something like seven or eight percentage points of inflation out of this system. When will that issue be addressed? It must really be galling for those on the other side to see the inflation rate running as it is at the moment. What is in prospect is an inflation rate of less than 2 per cent. I make no apology for the fact that quite clearly one of the contributing factors for the fall in the inflation rate is the recession. There is no doubt about it. One does not have to be an economic. guru to know that that is the case. Nevertheless, the Government's policy has been adjusted accordingly to make the appropriate allowances for that. As that inflation rate continues to decelerate, the introduction of this proposed other tax, the details of which we still know nothing, would do something quite dreadful to this gain that we have made in lowering inflation.  tations down.",59
176,Mr MARTIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Perhaps next week the Opposition will put something to us in detail as to how the inflationary effect is to be brought under control. Perhaps even my colleague from the other side, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who will speak ,next, will be able to drop a few hints tonight. Has he been told yet? Probably not. Methinks this will be the fleeting call of those from the National Party who are supportive of this particular tax. We will wait and see. n is a fact that our Government has endeavoured to look very closely and very carefully at this whole issue of the wholesale sales tax regime so as to look, as the honourable member for Mayo suggested, for ways to improve its collection. It is an easy and simple tax to collect, and that is one of the things that can be put forward to recommend it. We certainly look forward to getting the Opposition's views as to how these particular measures need to be changed to any great extent as part of its wholesale throwing out of the tax system and its bringing in of the brave new world that is to descend upon us: the two stages of personal income tax with the massive cuts which I understand are being promised, and the imposition therefore of some compensation package to low earning and disadvantaged people in the community. I would like to hear all about that, as I am sure would many of my constituents. Perhaps the next speaker will raise some expectations about that as well. At the end of the day the legislation we have before us as part of building a competitive Australia is an appropriate response to issues that were raised and announced back in March this year. It goes some way towards improving the situation as far as the taxing of business inputs is concerned, and it is a measure I commend to the House.",61
177,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) provides an excellent argument for the removal of the existing wholesale sales tax regime. The Bill amends the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 to give effect to the measures announced in the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 12 March 1991, almost nine months ago. It will extend sales tax exemptions to certain business inputs whilst ignoring many more. In other words, it will add to the confusion, add to the hit and miss method by which the sales tax regime taxes Australia. If this Government were to be consistent, it would abolish outright the wholesale sales tax system, because clearly in the industry statement inconsistencies were identified and exemptions will continue to need to be brought forward. To fail to abolish the wholesale sales tax system and to reform it overall will mean similar legislation will continue to come before the House to exempt different types of business inputs. It will probably depend upon the power or the pressure of the lobby group coming forward whether its case will be heard and whether the Government will trot in another lot of legislation exempting business inputs. It certainly will be a costly and inefficient procedure. Until all business inputs are exempt from sales tax, we in this nation, and the Government, have no hope of realising the Prime Minister's dream of building a competitive Australia. In effect this Bill apologises to the members of this Parliament and to all Australians over the illconceived, ramshackle wholesale sales tax system with which Australians are burdened. The Prime Minister's industry statement in March identified chronic inequities in the wholesale sales tax system. It also indicated quite clearly, as the Bill clearly indicates, that we have to get urgent refonn in the wholesale sales tax system. Australia's economy is suffering cardiac arrest. When we talk about the the Australian economy, we talk about the businesses out there that create the jobs. A testament of the cardiac arrest which businesses are suffering right now is the record level of bankruptcies right across Australia. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), mentioned the White Paper on tax reform. As far back as 1985 the current Prime Minister and the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the high-flying backbencher from the other side of the House, identified such shortfalls. They called for a tax summit. Their statements were very clear. There was no wavering on the subject. They said Australia must refornl its tax system. There are many statements attributed to the Prime Minister and to the former Treasurer which support what the Opposition will be doing when it announces its policy next week to reform the tax system in Australia, to abolish lock, stock and barrel the wholesale sales tax system as we know it in Australia today and to introduce a much fairer, broadly based goods and services tax. Unfortunately, just as the Prime Minister then lacked the leadership to follow his statements through, he is still lacking it today. Testament to that lack of leadership was seen last night on the news. The Premiers are walking out on him. Why? Because they do not believe he has the leadership to lead Australia and to introduce what he was talking about-new federalism. If that is not a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, I do not know what is. When the Premiers of the States of Australia walk out and say, 'We are not even going to come to your Premiers Conference', I and other members on this side of the House, and I would say at least 44 members on the Government side of the House-unless the numbers have gone upregard that as a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what the Prime Minister leads now are three parties on that side of the House-a loose coalition of members of a group that has as the basis for its policies the Lenin theories of Moscow; some from the extreme Right; and those in the centre, who are not quite sure where they are going. They lack direction altogether. So perhaps it is no wonder the Prime Minister has these leadership problems, because there is a coalition of three parties over there which is stitched together to try to govern Australia. Of course, when the Prime Minister goes to Cabinet, he has to get riding instructions. Where does he get his riding instructions from? He gets them from the heavyweights of the ACTU, not from the members of the Caucus or the members of the Government. Of course, all they are interested in is protecting jobs. But when jobs are protected from competition, they cost jobs. The almost one million people out of work today-as the official figures show-are clear testimony to the fact that they are costing jobs, not creating jobs. If the Government did not bow to the pressures of the union bosses and got on with governing Australia and reforming our tax system, Australia would be a whole lot better off. From statements of those opposite going back as far as 1985, I believe that they know what is right but lack the leadership and courage to reform the tax system. Unfortunately, this legislation is going to come far too late for many. Exemptions such as the sales tax on lubricants and motor vehicles used exclusively within production premises are going to come far too late. They could have been brought in as a matter of urgency as far back as April or May of this year if the Government had been genuine in trying to assist those people in the business community, particularly those people in rural Australia suffering the worse commodity prices in 60 years, the worse depression and the worse drought. Perhaps it would have been a drop in the bucket in the overall tax collection for the Government had it introduced the exemptions then, but it did not do it. It would have been of major significance to the many fanners in the community who are desperately trying to retain their life's work. Many of them-the official figures confirm that it is up to 20,000 or 30,000 over the next five years-are going to lose their farms. Had this Government had any understanding of what was happening in the community, it would have brought this legislation forward to try to assist people in primary production and mining to get some of these taxes off business inputs. Let us consider the answer the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) gave the House on sales tax when he was asked a question by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) on 5 September 1991. On the question of sales tax exemption on general purpose vehicles, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has deliberately misled this House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs SuJlivan)-Order! I am afraid it is not permissible for a member to accuse someone of deliberately misleading the House. I have to ask the honourable member to withdraw.",62
178,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I withdraw that he deliberately misled the House. In answer to a question that was put by the Leader of the National Party on 5 September, the Minister stated that if sedans and motor bikes are primarily lused in agricultural production they are exempt from sales tax. Sedans and motor bikes cannot be exempt from sales tax unless it can be categorically proved that the vehicle is used exclusively within or between contiguous premises owned, controlled or leased by the eligible goods producer. That is clearly spelt out in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on this subject. The exemption is for vehicles used exclusively within or between contiguous production premises. The Minister would have farmers believe that they can purchase, sales tax exempt, sedan type vehicle that would be used pria marily on the farm premises. Unfortunately, the Minister is not in the House today, but would like to advise him that there really a fundamental difference between 'primarily' and 'exclusively'. A general purpose vehicle used occasionally to take children to school or to transport goods to and from town, but primarily used on the farm premises, attracts a wholesale sales tax. The Minister, instead dodging and weaving a couple of days later, should have admitted he was wrong on that occasion because there is no shame in admiton our exports. ting that one is wrong; it is a matter of getting the right information out. Following that statement by the Minister, I had many ca-ls my electorate office in Dalby from people wanting to know whether that was the case. On checking the second reading speech, and checking with the departments, I found that that was not the case. The relative purchasing power of the agricultural sector today highlights the need for reform and the need for this legislation have come forward much earlier. To give honourable members an example, back in business 1973 it took 35 tonnes of wheat to purchase a humble farm utility-an essential item on any farm. In 1991, it takes 175 tonnes of average quality wheat to buy that farm vehiIt cle in Australia. I think that gives the House ates. some idea of how the relative purchasing power of the agricultural sector has been eroded in the last 17 years. The wholesale sales tax and its implications in the transport industry are quite stark. Only recently I was in the western parts of my electorate where people were trucking export cattle. The operator who was bringing these cattle to market had a vehicle worth $360,000. He had a truck, three trailers, crates and tyres. On all those items he had paid wholesale sales tax. On the capital cost of those items he had paid $60,000 wholesale sales tax. On the tyres, which he changes every 30,000 to 40,000 kilometres, he pays $5,000 wholesale sales tax. Those are effectively taxes on business inputs. Under our policy of reforming the wholesale sales tax system, by abolishing the a wholesale sales tax altogether and introducing broadly based goods and services tax, those taxes would be abolished; there would be no I taxes on business inputs because they would is be fully rebated. Effectively, we would be removing a tax on an export industry. For example, the products which were being loaded on those trucks were destined for overseas markets. If we want to be internationally competitive there is only one thing of we can do and that is to abolish taxes on business inputs because, effectively, particularly in the transport industry, they are a tax There are many anomalies that I do not have time to address here today that exist into the wholesale sales tax regime. What we must focus on is the fact that the Australian economy is dependent on exporting goods to international markets. If we want to maintain living standards in the future for the children of tomorrow and for the children of today, and for the 17 million Australians we have here today, we must become internationally to competitive with our export products. There is only one way to do it, to remove taxes on inputs-abolish all taxes on business inputs. That is clearly what we in the coalition are talking about. The rhetoric which has come from those opposite is quite misleading. is certainly confusing people in the electorNext week people in the community will see that what has been said in the last five or six months by those opposite has clearly not been accurate and has misled many people. Unfortunately, many of the reforms are going to have to wait until we come to power. We will be starting from behind scratch. We find that 21 out of the 23 OECD countries already have tax reform which introduced a goods and services tax. Even our trans-Tasman neighbour, New Zealand, introduced it in 1985. Already they are out there in the international markets competing for their share of the international markets without the taxes on business inputs. We are well behind the starting line. We all know who the starter is: he is the President of the ACTU. He has been calling the shots for those opposite. I certainly support the extension of some of the exemptions that the Government is introducing in this Bill but I am afraid that much of it will be too little, too late. There is only one way that this Government can go if it really wants to assist businesses, to create jobs and to get Australia back into the international export market-to abolish totally the wholesale sales tax system and to support the coalition in an overall reform of the tax system in Australia.",63
179,Mr BRADFORD,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," I make the point, as other speakers on this side of the House have, that the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) has some commendable features. We support the general thrust of it; it is a move in the right direction. However, we make the point very strongly that it goes about one centimetre on a one kilometre journey. It really only scrapes the surface. After listening to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) earlier this evening, and having listened to Government members talking as they do about tax, one gets the impression that they believe there is nothing wrong with Australia's tax laws. I suggest to them that they are completely out of touch with what the average person in the street thinks. They would only have to walk down Main Street in any city or town in Australia and ask average people-not accountants-what they think about Australia's taxation laws. They will say quite readily that our tax laws are in an absolute mess. Tax law is in a mess. It has grown like Topsy over the years. It has bandaids all over it. Unfortunately, and it has been recognised by the Opposition, we cannot stop a haemorrhage with a bandaid. Yet, that is what this legislation attempts to do. It attempts to put more bandaids on the existing system, which is totally out of control and needs to be completely revamped. That is the most commendable feature of the Opposition's proposal. We want to go back to scratch and start again, and come up with a taxation system which will work and which will advantage people. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was reported as having said in the Australian some time back: We have had 30 years, we have got 2,000 pages of tax law, rooms full of case law, we have had 30 years of loop hole plugging, of pothole fillings ... He goes on. He was absolutely right then, and the situation has not changed at all. If anything, it has deteriorated since then. Yet honourable members opposite have the hide to criticise the Opposition at every opportunity for taking a radical step and attempting to bite the bullet on tax reform, rewrite the law, start again and come up with a tax system which is fair and equitable and will work and, importantly, will do what the current tax system fails miserably to do-that is, to reintroduce incentive. One would have thought that in Australia's dire economic circumstances there would be a recognition that we need to restore incentive for people to work harder and be more productive. 'The tax system can make an enormous contribution towards doing that, yet the present system does not. If anything, the present tax system detracts from allowing people to be productive. It is totally counterproductive. The Opposition recognises that. For some reason, the Government fails to recognise that. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) recognised it in 1985. The former Treasurer recognised it. It was as clear as a bell to them. They saw what the problem was then. As was just said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), they apparently got their marching orders from someone else and so there was no change then. All we have had since then is more patching up or, to use the words of the honourable member for Blaxland, more pothole filling. That sums it up pretty well. The Treasurer (Mr Kerin)-these words condemn him-said in his second reading speech: These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to reduce the costs incurred by Australia's goods producing sectors. Although the Bill does go a little way towards doing that, the answer is clearly a value added tax. That solves that problem! This does not solve the problem at all. It is rather interesting to look at what is proposed. The Bill is 28 pages, the Treasurer's second reading speech is two pages and the explanatory memorandum is a book. It has hundreds of pages. Here we go again! We would need a university degree to understand the explanatory memorandum, which tells us how the legislation works. It is complex. This is meant to help us understand the legislation. It is full of flow charts. We would have to fly from here to Perth to sit back and read this. It clearly indicates that the Government is again patching up, filling potholes and putting bandaids on things. Let us get serious about tax reform. This country needs a value added tax, a goods and services tax-and the sooner the better. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Su11ivan)-Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

180,Unknown,BILL RETURNED FROM THE,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. NA HEALTH BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 November, on motion by Mr Howe: That the Bill be now read a second time.",66
181,Dr BOB WOODS,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"We are here to discuss the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bi1l1991. The Institute of Health was established in 1984 within the Department of Health. At that stage, its functions were to research a wide range of ' health issues with a particular focus on public health, social medicine, health statistics and health economics. Subsequently, it was made into a statutory authority in 1987, which was somewhat against the view of honourable members on this side of the House. We did not believe that it was necessary; in fact, we still do not believe that it was necessary. However, that is the way things go sometimes. We believe that the Institute of Health has done a very good job. It has been able to focus on a number of issues which the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS, would not have been able to. It has done it very effectively and it has contributed greatly to the understanding of some of the issues in the health arena. This Bill does basically two things: it simply changes the Institute's name to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and therefore relates it to the expanded role of the Institute of Health. Its expanded role includes developing national welfare statistics and, in particular, statistics relating to housing assistance. It is clear, therefore, that its portfolio, if you like, relates very closely to the portfolio covered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. As it stands, the Bill causes no problems for us. We believe that it is very important that statistics are collected in these vitally crucial areas in terms of the social scene. As we have SENATE said, we believe that the Institute does a good job in the health area of its statistics. Our view on this matter is that we will not oppose the legislation; we will support it. One could argue about whether the best way to spend the money is through the Institute of Health or the ABS. It is a fairly unproductive argument in the end. The AIH has the advantage of being able to coordinate the collection of data from State bodies, which is something that the ABS perhaps has not been so expert at doing. This Bill includes a number of other minor issues, such as providing for the AIH to consult with State and Territory welfare and housing Ministers on the collation of those relevant statistics. The Government makes a claim that the extension of the role of the AIH will enhance the ability of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to determine program and policy objectives. Because of that, it will be possible to specify target groups, for example, and to determine standards of service in these areas. It also claims that the process of public dissemination of such national welfare data improves public accountability to both service users and the wider community. There are some doubts as to exactly what extent the AIH will be able to carry out these aims, but since it has done a good job in the health arena, we have no problem with its covering the extra arena of welfare services and housing assistance. For that reason, we will not oppose the Bill before us.",66
182,Mr JENKINS,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I have pleasure in supporting the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill. I thank the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) for his comments and support. I am perhaps not as fulsome in my thanks for the brevity of his comments. Having said that, I find it interesting that this week, when there has been a great deal of discussion about the apparent failure of or problems with discussion of matters of relationships between the Commonwealth and State governments, the legislation that we have before us tonight has a genesis in the commencement of this process. Arising out of the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference was an undertaking to look into several matters. Included in those was the investigation of a framework for determining the roles and responsibilities in service delivery. As part of the resultant investigations on that point, it was decided that there should be a study of the potential role of the Australian Institute of Health. To this end, a working group chaired by Professor Bettina Cass was established to advise on how that role could be best developed to encompass the collation of welfare statistics. Again, it is interesting, when there has been a great deal of criticism of the present round of discussions of Commonwealth-State roles, that at the special meeting of Australian health and welfare Ministers in Sydney on 6 September 1991, the Ministers agreed that an expanded role for the Australian Institute of Health in the collation and publication of existing data on social welfare, community services and housing assistance programs was essential in the context of reforming Commonwealth-State relations. Ministers also agreed that a memorandum of understanding should be developed jointly between the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories outlining the rights and responsibilities of all parties in relation to the Institute's expanded role. Today we have before us a Bill that enables and enhances the role of what is now known as the Australian Institute of Health. When this Bill has passage and becomes law, the Institute is to be renamed to reflect its wider role as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is also an illustration and an example of what can be achieved in formulating national policy. I emphasise the words 'national policy' because the reconstituted Institute, as a result of this legislation, can truly be seen as a national body. As the honourable member for Lowe indicated, the Institute was first put into place in 1984 as part of the Department of Health. In 1987, it became a statutory body. This legislation will enable the Institute to be seen quite appropriately as a body at arm's length from the Commonwealth Government, one that will be controlled by the Commonwealth Government and the States in partnership. It is a body that will continue the good work that it has done in the wider areas that have been inqicated by the new title that it will have. Why do we see this movement towards this wider role? Why is it deemed to be necessary? I think that, simply, as I said in 1987 when speaking on the formation of the Institute as a statutory body, there is always a need for the statistical information that can be made available to enable governmentsand I stress the plurality of the word 'governments'-both Commonwealth and State, to be able to measure the outcomes of programs that are in place, so that those programs can be on the basis of knowing where we are coming from and where we are going to. We can more appropriately measure the success of what we are doing and not rely on walking away from something saying that we are spending X dollars on it and, therefore, we are doing the job. Long past is the time when we could simply get away with having that as our measuring stick. In stressing the importance of this wider role for what will be the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, it is very important that I place on record the need to use some degree of caution in giving it that wider role, because in the general areas of welfare that it is envisaged will be studied by the Institute we may in fact involve ourselves in making it even harder for service agencies, whether they be State Government or local government agencies, in gathering information which is of no direct relevance to them. In the previous Parliament I was involved in the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into an audit report on HACC services. One of the continual complaints that we had from service providers related to what they felt was their undue involvement in the collection of statistics. They did not see the relevance of those statistics and could not understand the purpose of the Govenunent's using them. I know that is an important aspect that the Institute will try hard to address, because if there is not a great degree of commitment from the gatherers of information, the integrity of that data is then put into question. I think that, with the expertise that the Institute has in role in gathering information about health services, in its wider role it will take that point into its thinking. Another important challenge for the Institute in the area of its wider responsibilities will be in trying to put in place standardised information. One of the joys of Federation is that often each of the States, in its own wisdom, has a varying view from that of other States or the Commonwealth about the aspects of government policy and the aspects of definition. Through the Institute's role in the collation of data, it will be able to have input into the way in which it is best gathered. But it should be indicated at this point that, for its new responsibilities, the Institute will not have the function of undertaking research. This legislation will enable it to collate, analyse and publish administrative data that is gathered in this area. Another aspect that was touched upon by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) was whether the Australian Bureau of Statistics could be involved and take the role envisaged for the Institute. I am pleased that the honourable member has come to the conclusion that this Institute has a distinct role in the gathering of information on both health and welfare matters. I believe not only that it is the expertise it has gathered throughout its past years of existence that has indicated that, but also that it is appropriate, in the specialist areas that are under its control or under its study, that we should have such a body. In fact, the body will have special contact with advisory committees and the health and welfare Ministers of the States, the Territories and the Commonwealth Government. There are actually five priority areas that have been identified and accepted by Bettina Cass in her report. They are data collection with regard to services to care for the aged, child-care services, housing assistance programs for low income and vulnerable groups, programs and services for people with disabilities, and existing State-based collections of child maltreatment and substitute care. These are priority areas which cover services administered and/or funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. The its report more clearly defines areas that the Institute can have a look at and report back on not only to governments but also to the community in respect of the state of play under those particular policy areas. I note that in the communique from the joint Ministers meeting it was acknowledged that local government has a role in these areas and, wherever possible, that role will be taken into account. But I think that in this area of collection of this information in particular, generally local government has a role as a service provider and, in that case, its wishes, plus those of any other agencies that are involved, should be taken into account. The expansion of the role of the Institute to include health and welfare is also appropriate in that it will tend to break down that compartmentalisation, if there is such a word, that we have had in the past between health services and welfare services or, more generally, community services. Often the interrelationship between many of the services that we are talking about for the wider role of the Institute in the area of health, particularly primary health care and preventive and social medicine, is not clearly recognised. It is important that we see that interrelationship. I hope that through the emphasis that will be placed upon the study of this data arising out of the Institute's work we will see that breaking down and we will come to a better understanding that for an individual it does not really matter which heading a service is under. All that an individual expects of government and the community is the provision of the best services to meet that individual's needs. It does not really matter whether we, as legislators or administrators, decide that they are health services, welfare or community services; it is the end result. Also, it is of little interest to those individuals whether it is the Commonwealth Government or the State Government that provides those services, as long as those services are efficiently delivered in a manner that is appropriate to the individual's needs in the community in which that individual is living. Therefore, the continuing discussions and development of a more mature outlook to the way in which the three spheres of government under Australia's Federation operate are very important. They are the things that members of the Australian community are crying out to have solved. They do not want to be shunted from one place to another because they are told that their particular problem is not a State problem and that they should go and see a Commonwealth agency or a Commonwealthfunded agency. We should be developing services that are cooperative. In fact, individuals in their time of need would not know directly which is the source government for the programs by which they are being serviced. That is important. As I said from the outset, this legislation represents one small step in the improvement in the way in which the Commonwealth and the State governments relate. That is a very good, albeit small, step if we cannot achieve more efficiencies through constitutional reform. I do not go into full detail of what I would wish to see under such constitutional reform because I do not think that in this day and age it is really wortl}. while discussing that type of reform, as it would be very hard to achieve. So, accepting that we have to operate under the constitutional framework that we have, it is small steps such as the one illustrated by this piece of legislation that are important and will result in an Australia in which people who are looking to government can expect to be provided with services that meet their needs. It was interesting to look back at my speech in 1987 about the Australian Institute of Health. When I concluded that speech, I highlighted the struggle that the Curtin and Chifley governments had to attain the right of the Commonwealth to legislate in the area of health. Throughout the history of this Federation, Commonwealth-State relations have many times been at flashpoint. So there is nothing new. The Fraser Government had a vision of how it saw the Commonwealth and the States operating; and that caused tensions between the two different spheres of government. Any debate on these issues is healthy. Any debate that recognises the needs and the aspirations of the community is even more healthy. I am pleased to be able to speak in this deb/1.te. I wish the new Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, when it gets under way, every success in the role that has been given to it by this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative.

NA (STAFF) BILL 1991 [COGNATE BILL: VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (PROVISION OF TREATMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991] Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 'November, on motion by Mr Humphreys: That the Bill be now read a second time.",67
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"I understand it is the wish of the House to debate the Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill concurrently with the Veterans' Entitlements (provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",70
184,Mr TIM FISCHER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"The House is considering tonight two pieces of important legislation, the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991 and the related Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill 1991. By way of explanation, I speak on behalf of the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Jocelyn Newman. These Bills together represent the legislative machinery necessary to facilitate the transfer of Commonwealth repatriation general hospitals to the States. The Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill provides for legislative authority for the establishment of repatriation private principles. The Bill provides that the principles be incorporated into a disallowable instrument. The principles set out the circumstances and conditions under which public and private health care will be given to veterans postintegration. The Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill sets out the particular provisions which will apply to the 9,000 staff employed in the repatriation general hospitals system around Australia in the capital cities following transfer to the States, describing in general terms the outcomes the Commonwealth is seeking in relation to the rights of affected employees. The coalition has looked very closely at this legislation and I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and to the Government that we will oppose this legislation-at least until such time as the Government comes clean and presents to the House in clear-cut terms exactly what is being laid down by way of safeguards for the veterans, the war widows and the ex-service men and women in relation to their priority of entry or otherwise in the combined, integrated and transferred hospital to the State system. I have said to the Minister before, and I have spoken about this at the Sydney Town Hall and elsewhere, that the coalition is not opposed to integration further down the track. There is a case for integration, especially as the demand on the hospital system eases as the big demand from veterans is worked through and beyond, and even before. But we cannot have integration without proper safeguards, and without comprehensive assurances that are both understandable and acceptable to veterans, war widows and ex-service men and women. In this context, what the Government is saying is 'trust us'. The Government is asking the Parliament, without such information, to trust it with the responsibility of ensuring that it will deal fairly with the unresolved concerns of the veteran community even after this legislation is passed. I say to the Minister that he is a reasonable Minister and he is a man of integrity. But, equally, I want to say that that is an awfully big question of trust that he is inviting the Parliament, the public and the custodians of veterans' entitlements to take on board in this key legislation. That is not good enough because I know that the Minister admits that there are some areas yet to be resolved in relation to the integration of the repatriation general hospital system. This legislation in that context is premature. I do not think we should afford that trust to the Government. We are prepared to look at it again at a future date when those areas still being negotiated in relation to the integration of the repatriation general hospitals into the State hospital system have been resolved. Secondly, this legislation should be withdrawn; it should not have been introduced until the firm details were available. State by State it is something of a curate's egg; it is something yet to be resolved in many States. Of course, in Tasmania further progress has been made-or perhaps more progress has been made in Tasmania than in any other State at this time. But, equally, we need to have a great deal more information before the Parliament should be asked to vote on and support a blank cheque to the Government in respect of the entitlements, being, as we are, the custodians of the entitlements of those who served their country in time of war. Thirdly, although the scheme that the Government is proposing for veterans' health care post-integration has been labelled a private patients scheme, it does not give veterans or war widows true private patient status, and in this sense is misleading. Let the Minister, a decent man, come forward and tell the House exactly what is meant by this repatriation private patients scheme and where it differs-because it does differ-from the more generally defined and what is accepted to be part of private patient schemes for the community at large. For example, veterans will not have the hospital of their choice; they will be able to attend only a public hospital. A veteran will not get to a private hospital if she or he can get into a public hospital within reasonable time. Departmental approval will be required for entry to a private hospital. The honourable member for Maranoa (Me Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Me MCGauran) well realise that there are often administrative delays in getting approval from a centralised deputy commissioner's office in Brisbane or Melbourne in respect of this hospitalisation aspect. Therefore, it is something that we want to hear the Minister and the Government come clean on before we are invited to vote on this legislation. Fourthly, veterans will not necessarily have the doctor of their choice. A veteran's doctor would have to have visiting rights to the hospital attended by the veteran. That may often be the case, whether public or private, but it may not always be so. In those circumstances a veteran would not have the doctor of his or her choice. That can be a matter of great concern to veterans with complex ailments, on which a particular doctor has built up some knowledge. Suddenly patients can be plucked from their doctor's jurisdiction, in a sense, and placed into another hospital not necessarily of their choice and one in which they are confronted with a doctor not of their choice. I welcome any response or explanation the Minister might like to give in relation to ,that matter. Fifthly, there is the question of priority of access. That is a very legitimate concern if a person is in a heart attack phase of life because of his particular age or condition; if he is in a circumstance where he' knows that suddenly he may well require the full range of intensive care facilities or even the general facilities of a major hospital. Veterans want to know that they are not going to spend several hours being shunted from hospital to hospital, as is too often the case in many of our capital cities. They want to know that they will have priority of access. The Government has often said that veterans and war widows will still have access to repatriation general hospitals after transfer-and this much is true. What the Government fails to acknowledge is that veterans and war widows will not have priority of access over members of the wider community, as they have now, and the repatriation hospital will merely be one more State public hospital with a long queue at the door. There is the crunch point for veterans and war widows. Sure, there will be a 20 per cent or thereabouts community access and loading into the current repatriation hospitals. This h- been a long standing arrangement and one which I know the Minister and myself as well as many others have had to defend at some very hostile meetings, and we have done so because there is a need for the work of repatriation general hospitals to be spread across the full gamut of age and conditions of sickness so staff can be well trained in a practical sense. So it is justified to have community patient components in the current repatriation general hospital system, but that changes under this legislation. It will change in such a way that there is legitimate concern held by veterans across Australia. I do not want to add to that concern; I want to approach this difficult question constructively. I do so in the knowledge that these questions must be answered in the due process of the consideration of this legislation. Sixthly, I remind the House that on 10 November 1988 the Minister said that integration would not occur until all the concerns of the ex-service community were dealt with. He claimed this was an 'unequivocal guarantee'. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a similar promise to veterans during the last election as part of an ANZAC-eve speech at the repatriation general hospital at Heidelberg. Yet the Government has introduced this legislation now which, if passed, would mean that integration could occur immediately. Despite the Minister's claims to the contrary he knows that every major ex-service organisation has unresolved concerns with the hand-over of the repatriation hospitals. I know it is always going to be a difficult process. I further know-and I state this on behalf of the coalition-that at the end of the day there is a case for integration; there is a circumstance where, with full and adequate and exposed safeguards and assurances which can be delivered, the coalition will look favourably at that type of legislation. But we are not going to be stampeded into backing an open cheque for the Government on this important legislation. I reiterate: whilst the coalition accepts that integration will come in due course, support for it will depend on how and when it is proposed to be achieved. Priority of access and quality of care have always been and will remain the criteria by which the Opposition will assess any proposal. That is the least it can do on behalf of ex-service men and women as so many of them face hospitalisation in their later years. They are entitled to believe with some confidence that they will be properly cared for. The two Bills before the House fail to address these criteria adequately and that is why, in a very responsible way, the Liberal and National parties have decided to oppose this legislation and place before the Minister the challenge to come clean, to present a State by State report to the House in his second reading response as to what real progress has been made. I think I am correct in saying that there has bcen more progress in Tasmania than any other State as at this time. There are a lot of matters yet to be resolved. The Minister cannot stand up here and say that it is all in place, there are no other areas yet to be negotiated, there are no areas yet to be determined. That is not the position. There are areas yet to be worked through with State governments in many of the mainland States, and there are still one or two outstanding matters even in respect of Tasmania. I know these are important matters, because this Minister is such a reasonable Minister-a Minister of integrity. The truth of the matter is that he is the Prime Minister's last supporter in Cabinet; he is the only man who has stood thick and thin with the Prime Minister through all the leadership wrangles of the Labor Party. Mr MCGauran-But it's in self-interest. Keating would never make him a Minister.",70
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,The honourable member for Gippsland is not contributing to the debate. I suggest he remain out of it.,72
186,Mr TIM FISCHER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"The Minister has wavered and been under a lot of pressure, but the Queensland Right came through for the Prime Minister and this man, as well he might, stood with the Prime Minister because he knows the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) is right at the front of those queuing to become a future Minister for Veterans' Affairs.",72
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"The Leader of the National Party is now moving beyond the bounds of the Bill. I suggest he come back to it, because I am reminded that the Bill is under guillotine and I know that we need to maximise debate on the Bill.",72
188,Mr TIM FISCHER,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"These are very sensitive matters and this legislation should not be swept quietly through the House. This legislation needs to be properly considered, for the reasons I have advanced-the legitimate concerns of so many veterans, including members of the RSL and veterans organisations. I would like to add one other point. Against all odds, the world has seen more history unfold in this calendar year 1991 than in just about any other year since World War II. The year opened with the Gulf war and all that related to that circumstance, with Australia's forces-particularly the Navy-representing Australia as part of the successful United Nations international effort. The year continued with developments in Russia with the coup and the counter-coup. There were the historic talks in Madrid between Israel and the Arab states, and now this week has seen Australians once again committed to going forward to another country-in this case Cambodia-as part of a new UN peacekeeping operation. It was good news today to learn that an Australian general has been appointed overall commander of the international peacekeeping force, and that gives us great confidence in regard to the operation of that peacekeeping force. I want to take this opportunity, in the context of this repatriation hospital legislation, firstly, to wish those Australians already in Cambodia and those Australians ready to be sent to Cambodia every success with their important and dangerous work. Secondly, I commend the Government on the fact that it has, at the last moment, approved the issue of personal weapons to our soldiers for their self-defence. That is very important. It is a decision which I and Senator Peter Durack argued for and which the Government finally agreed to. Thirdly, I want to say that, in another sense, if anything untoward were to happen to them-and indeed Cambodia is more likely to be a dangerous theatre of operation than Namibia was for the Australian force that went successfully to conduct UN peacekeeping operations there-some of these people would end up back in the repatriation hospital system, which is the subject of this legislation tonight. . Here we are at the end of 1991, some 46 years after World War II, and this week we have, once again, Australians going overseas to fulfil a dangerous mission, in this case Australian signallers in the Australian Army. All of us wish them well for that important work. Equally, it behoves the Parliament to do the right thing by those who have gone, in terms of their repatriation entitlement and their ability to have access to repatriation hospitals, the subject of this legislation. Of course, I hope that none of these people will have need to utilise the repatriation general hospital system, but it is there, it exists, and it exists particularly for this circumstance should it, sadly, arise. The coalition will oppose both these Bills, the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill and the Repatriation Institutions (Staft) Bill. The Government needs to come clean before it brings this type of legislation before the Parliament. We will look at the question of integration when the Government lays down and exposes all the safeguards that it is proposing to put in place, especially with regard to priority of access for veterans to repatriation hospitals. If the Government would then like to bring its legislation back, we will look at it again in that context. But we will not sign a blank cheque and sabotage the entitlement of veterans and war widows, correct as this course of action may well be, until we see the detail that we are entitled to see. I remind the House that a former Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, told this Parliament many years ago that upon this Parliament rested the responsibility of seeing that the right thing was done for those who served their country in time of war. In the context of that commitment by former Prime Minister Ben Chifley, the only proper course of action available to this House and to the Senate-to the Parliament as a whole-is to oppose this legislation until the Government does the right thing by those who served their country in time of war. Mr GmSON (Moreton) (8.43 p.m.)-It has been a fascinating experience listening to the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) trying to explain the Opposition's position on this legislation. It is really very difficult to find out what the Opposition's true position is. The honourable member for Farrer talked about trying to protect the interests of veterans. He probably even mentioned veterans in his own community. Yet he tries to have us in this House believe that veterans in his electorate of Farrer would actually prefer to travel to the repatriation hospital in Concord than to have the choice of going to their own private or public hospital in their own electorate. I saw the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) cheering on his leader and saying that he also supported this position. But is he also trying to tell us that the veterans in his electorate of Maranoaone of the largest and most isolated electorates in this country-would prefer to travel hundreds of miles away from their own families, friends and support mechanisms in the electorate of Maranoa to Greenslopes? I cannot believe the cant and hypocrisy of the Opposition in respect of this legislation. The honourable member for Farrer also tried to make us believe that he somehow has the support of veterans groups in this country. He certainly does not. He may have the support of one or two vocal members, but he certainly does not have the support of everyone. If one looks at the facts, talks to those constituent groups-as my friend the honourable member for Griffith, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), has done over the last four years; he has actually spoken to representative groups of veterans and war widows all around this country-and looks at the figures, one finds that the Minister does have the support and confidence of the vast majority of veterans, war widows and their families. For the honourable member for Farrer to try to pretend that he is representing the views or concerns of veterans and their families is a great stretching of the truth. We will find that, as time proceeds, the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party, will be increasingly isolated from the veteran community. Members of the veteran community understand that through this legislation they get choice; they get a right to choose their own quality of care in their own area and they will have their rights protected by this process. I cannot believe the hypocrisy of the Opposition. Previously we have had the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) speaking in this House about trying to bring efficiency into government business and trying to produce smaller government and cut the costs of the provision of services. What we have here in this legislation is a process that enhances the quality of care to veterans, war widows and their families and increases their choice. I know that the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) is constantly lecturing us about giving choice to Australians in respect of their quality of care. Yet today he is in this House mouthing off at me about veteransbut he is trying to deny veterans choice. This legislation is about providing choice to veterans so that they can have guaranteed access to public hospitals or private hospitals anywhere around this country without having to travel hundreds or thousands of miles to a repatriation hospital. How can honourable members opposite sit here now and oppose this legislation when all their previous speeches in this House have been about providing choice to people in this country in respect of medical care and when this legislation is all about choice? Honourable members opposite are ignoring that, and the hypocrisy of their position on this legislation is paramount. Let us have a look at some of the positions that the coalition has put forward. Previously it has said that it supports integration. Yet tonight honourable members opposite have said in this House that they will oppose this legislation. Are they suggesting to us here tonight that, in fact, the Commonwealth should maintain its control of repatriation hospitals? That is not what their policy says. That is not what their Opposition spokesperson says. This package of Bills that we are debating tonight provides real choice to veterans. I am proud to be able to speak on this legislation because I happen to know that the vast bulk of veterans and war widows in my electorate and my State support the Government's moves because, as has been shown by poll after poll and independent study after independent study, the vast bulk of veterans, war widows and their families want to have access to public and private hospitals in their own area. They do not wish to go to a repatriation hospital hundreds of miles away from their homes. The Bills before the House tonight form the basis of a transfer of the repatriation hospitals to the State health systems. There are many very sound reasons for the transfer of repatriation hospitals to the States. It must be realised that the health needs of the ageing veteran community are changing and that with those changes the provision of services must change as well. Increasingly. veterans and war widows of advancing age need and express a preference for local treatment options. Research has shown that most veterans and war widows would prefer to be admitted to a local public or private hospital rather than travel to the nearest repatriation general hospital. Independent research carried out on behalf of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has clearly shown that those veterans and war widows who declared a preference would choose to be admitted to a local public or private hospital. In May this year all entitled veterans and war widows were sent an explanatory brochure outlining the repatriapon private patient scheme and its benefits. According to the deputy commissioners for repatriation, recipients who responded to the brochure were overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed new arrangements. Regardless of all the cant and hypocrisy we might hear from the Opposition this evening, nothing can change the fact that the overwhelming majority of veterans and war widows support the changes contained in this legislation. The majority of veterans do not want to travel long distances to a repatriation hospital for treatment. Understandably, they prefer the convenience of a hospital or specialists nearer their home, their family and their friends. Mr Tim Fischer-Why does the RSL still oppose it at this stage?",73
189,Mr GIBSON,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"As the honourable member for Farrer knows. the RSL does not oppose it. One or two people in the RSL are saying that they oppose it, but the majority of branches of the RSL in this country have supported the changes; they have gained the commitments from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that their concerns are included in the legislation and they are now supporting the changes. The honourable member for Farrer is the one who is out of step with the community. He is the one who has lost sight of what the veterans and war widows in this country truly want. The Bills before us this evening give choice to veterans and war widows who wish to be treated close to their home in a public or private hospital rather than travelling great distances to a repatriation hdspital. Those who live close to a repatriation hospital and wish to continue to attend that hospital have that right. This will be the case for the majority of veterans in my own electorate and probably those in my neighbouring electorate, Griffith, for which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is the member. These Bills do not mean an immediate and automatic transfer of repatriation hospitals to the States. Presently. negotiations with State governments on the terms for integrating the repatriation general hospitals are continuing. However, both Bills establish the mechanisms by which the hospital staff may eventually be transferred into State employment and the conditions under which veterans and war widows will receive their treatment entitlements after integration. The integration of repatriation hospitals into the mainstream hospital system has been under consideration for many years, and it is this Government and this Minister that have finally addressed the issue properly. We have had report after report of government committee, standing committee and Senate committee confirming that the transfer over to the State system was the only option for the repatriation system. In 1984 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recommended that the matter be referred to the review of the repatriation hospital system which was being undertaken by the Brand Committee. It presented its final report to the Government in 1985. Among the Committee's recommendations were that effective rationalisation should take place between the repatriation hospital system and the State hospital system; that departmental and State planning for health services reflect the recognition of the inevitability of ultimate integration of the two systems; and that the Commonwealth Government immediately approach the States to establish standing committees in each State to advise on departmental State relationships in the health and hospital area. The Committee recommended that such committees should consist of senior Commonwealth and State officials and others coopted as necessary. These recommendations were accepted and the Prime Minister wrote to all State Premiers in April 1986 and invited them to take part in the standing committee proceedings. Faced with the increasing difficulty of access for an ageing veteran population to the repatriation hospitals in each State and the realisation that changes were needed in the Commonwealth State structure of health care, the Federal Government accepted the Brand Committee's recommendations. In August 1988 the same Government, via the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, proposed the consolidation of the repatriation hospital system into the State hospital systems by 1995. The Brand Combecause mittee was persuaded that this would lead to a greater range of hospital and specialist treatment closer to the homes of veterans war widows and also would enable the retenthe tion of the hospitals as viable institutions. The Bills seek to expand existing access available with private patient status outside the repatriation hospital system and have an increased focus on conveniently located hospitals. Entitled veterans and war would have access, as private patients, to public hospitals; where the public hospital system could not meet their needs, private hospital care would be available. In considering these changes, the Minister consulted as widely as possible with all those who would be affected by the changes. Since the Government announced its intention to transfer the repatriation hospitals into the mainstream hospital system, the Minister has consulted widely with all constituent groups. I do not know of any other change in government policy that has been supported by the level of consultation, negotiation and access that this Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided with this change. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the work that he has done, because since I was elected as the member for Moreton, with the repatriation hospital at Greenslopes in my electorate, the proposed change has been brought to my attention, and I have regularly consulted with the Minister and his Department on the issue. Every time that I have raised issues of concern, I have been given a good hearing and I have had those issues or concerns responded to positively. I know that throughout Australia every constituent group with regard to returned servicemen, veterans, war widows and their families has been consulted widely, has had its views listened to and has had great opportunities to have its concerns taken note of and included in the Government's changes. I do not know of any other change in government arrangements that has seen the level of consultation and negotiation that this Minister has provided. I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs deserves strong congratulations for his position on that, he has worked very hard to listen to all the concerns of all veterans and war widows throughout this country. I think both and sides of the House would acknowledge that Minister for Veterans' Affairs has been very accessible and very willing to talk to every group in this country on those concerns. It is not just the views of veterans and war widows but also the views of staff of these hospitals that have to be taken into account. widows Since my election as the member for Moreton, I have had considerable discussions with the staff of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital, and I know that those staff members have also had their views widely considered. The figures that have come out with regard to the views of the different unions throughout this country show that they initially had a lot of concern, because they were changing from a Commonwealth control to a State control. There were issues about their entitlements, their leave, their superannuation and their continuity of service that had to be addressed. Every one of those issues has been addressed and now all the constituent unions, covering all of the staff in all hospitals throughout Australia, have agreed to the position that the Government has put, and that is why we have this legislation before us tonight. By incorporating repatriation hospitals into the mainstream system, the Commonwealth will keep the hospitals running as viable institutions serving the community at large. The proposal to integrate the repatriation hospital system with the States has the support of the Australian Veterans and Defence Service Council. This is an umbrella organisation for 24 different ex-service organisations, representing more than 200,000 veterans. The Australian Veterans and Defence Service Council has declared its support for the proposed new health care arrangements after detailed analysis and exhaustive consultation with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This Council supports the proposal because it knows it will benefit its constituent members. Australia has committed a great deal to the public health system, in terms of training staff and investment infrastructure, to make our public system one of the best in the world. At the heart of that system is the public teaching hospital. Because of their crucial role in training health professionals, these institutions attract high quality professional staff. There are currently some 10,000 staff employed in repatriation general hospitals throughout Australia. As I have indicated,' there are several hundred employed at the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital in my electorate of Moreton. Every time. I visit that hospital I am extremely impressed with the quality, calibre and dedication of all the staff, both medical and general, employed at that hospital. I know that they provide a very high quality of care, concern and compassion for all patients in that hospital. They deliver an excellent service; and with these changes they will still be allowed to deliver an excellent service not only to veterans but to the wider community as well. The Commonwealth is aware of the valuable contribution that staff in the repatriation system have made to patients. The Commonwealth entered into extensive negotiations with the ACTU and the unions covering veterans hospitals. These negotiations have resulted in an agreement which commits the Commonwealth to do its best to ensure that the maximum number of staff are offered a job with the States. The agreement also covers income maintenance, recognition of Commonwealth leave entitlements, continuing membership in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, and re-entry rights into Commonwealth employment. It is important in any transfer that staff rights be observed. I have met with the representatives of the staff at the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital and have discussed their concerns, forwarding them to the representatives of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. All of those concerns have been alleviated or acknowledged with the adoption of the legislation we have before us this evening. While the commitments to staff at the repatriation general hospitals are set out in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the unions, the Bill we have before us this evening declares these commitments in the form of a legislative statement of the Parliament's intentions. The Government expects that, as a result of the intentions stated in this Bill and the agreement negotiated with the unions, the overwhelming majority of repatriation general hospital staff will receive and accept job offers from the States. For those staff who accept a job offer or who are offered what is considered to be a comparable job, the Bill contains provisions to separate them from Commonwealth employment. This special legislation package is, then, a vital part of the commitment that both the Minister and the Prime Minister gave to staff that their interests would be safeguarded. The legislation has been developed with extensive consultation with all involved. As a member of parliament whose electorate contains a repatriation hospital, I am very pleased to be in this House this evening to support this legislation. I know that the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Minister have done enormous amounts of work to take note of all the concerns of veterans and war widows. I know that the vast majority of veterans, war widows, their families and the unions involved with covering members employed in hospitals do support this change. This legislative framework that we are debating tonight will give protection to veterans and ensure that the commitments that have been made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can be implemented. I commend the Bills to the House.",75
190,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS," I do not know where the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) got all of that stuff and I do not even know whether or not he really believes it, but I am pleased to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) here in the House tonight to take part in this debate. I do not disagree with what the honourable member for Moreton said about the Minister's dedication. I must say, as I have said on occasions, that I give credit where it is due and he is one of the few Ministers I have encountered in this Government who is reasonably sympathetic to points of view that are put to him. Before I speak on the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill and cognate Bill, I have informed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), that there are former members of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and supporting units in the gallery tonight. That battalion served in Vietnam in 1968-69, and the Leader of the National Party tells me that it has the reputation of being the best unit to have served in Vietnam. I am not entirely certain whether that is right, but I am prepared to accept his word for it because I am sure that he would not tell me a lie. n is great to see former servicemen in the gallery listening to this particular debate. I hope it does point up to them, as it does to those who are listening outside this House, the differences in policy and attitude of the Government and the Opposition on the concerns and affairs of the veteran community. When it boils down to it, we really are like chalk and cheese. I believe that we on this side have a depth of commitment to service personnel. We are opposing this legislation here tonight, and we do not do so lightly. We believe that it really does point to the differences. We are prepared to say that we recognise, with no equivocation, the ongoing importance of the veteran community within Australia. The Opposition will not diminish in any way the importance of veterans, nor will it diminish the recognition servicemen deserve on an ongoing basis. I am proud to be a member of the Opposition for many reasons, but certainly for that reason. As I say, we do not oppose this legislation lightly; we do it because we believe that here is another instance of the Government's further downgrading the importance of the veterans' community. I was disappointed at the attack by the honourable member for Moreton on the Leader of the National Party because I would have thought that the Leader of the National Party was a speaker of great credibility on the topic of veterans' affairs. He is credible when speaking on other matters, too, but particularly when speaking on veterans' affairs. The honourable member for Moreton talks about giving veterans a choice, but that is just been rhetoric. The choice that veterans are being offered here is Hobson's choice-take it or leave it; like it or lump it. However, we on this side of the House want to give veterans a real choice. We do not disagree that there are situations, even where I live in Queensland, where veterans may wish to choose to go to a local hospital rather than travel to Greenslopes. Let us give them that choice. Let us give them the choice of local treatment or a dedicated hospital remaining there for them while they want to access it. That is the choice the Government is going to take away from them. There should be no doubt about that: the Government intends to take that choice away from them and hand their dedicated hospital system over to State control. Beyond that, anything could happen. Certainly the Minister and even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have given us guarantees. The Prime Minister said in April 1991 that no repatriation general hospital would be transferred to a State unless a satisfactory agreement had been reached on matters such as priority of access and quality of health care for veterans and war widows. I am sorry, but we just do not accept that sort of promise. Coming from the Prime Minister, it is particularly hollow when we look back at some of the promises we have heard from him since he became Prime Minister. I do not want to cast aspersions on him, but I do not accept that and nor do I accept the Minister's guarantee. This is the thin edge of the wedge. The Government is saying, 'Trust us, trust us'. We will not, and we will oppose this legislation because we are committed to maintaining standards. The honourable member for Moreton spoke about Greenslopes. I am familiar with that hospital and I am also familiar with RGH Concord. In fact, I had some time in RGH Concord during the time. I was in the Army. so I am very familiar with the situation there. Those hospitals have a very special place in the hearts of veterans, and I do not see that what the Government is trying to do is right. Let us state clearly what the position of veterans' organisations is on this-and I challenge the Minister to disagree with me on this point. The RSL is opposed to integration, as are all the State branches of the RSL. Mr Humphreys-No, they are not.",78
191,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,And the ACT-with the exception of New South Wales. Mr Humphreys-And Queensland.,79
192,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"No, not Queensland as far as I am aware. All the State branches are opposed. Let us put Queensland in for the sake of the argument. I am not aware that Queensland has acquiesced here but, even if it has, the RSL is opposed nationally. Even though, as I say, the New South Wales branch narrowly gave in principle support subject to certain conditions being met, it was reprimanded for taking that stand by the RSL national congress in September. Let us not equivocate about this: the RSL nationally is opposed to integration and it is by far the biggest organisation that we are dealing with. Other major ex-service organisations-including Legacy, the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council and the Regular Defence Welfare Associationhave accepted the inevitability of integration. That is the key to it. In a sense they have accepted Hobson's choice. But they are adamant, nevertheless, that integration should not occur unless the interests of veterans and war widows are properly protected in matters such as quality of care and priority of access. On those issues-quality of care and priority of access-we on this side have serious doubts about whether those things can be guaranteed, and we fail to accept the guarantees that have been offered to us. So that should clarify the situation of the major ex-service organisations, and there should be no doubt about where they stand. I believe, unfortunately, that this legislation is yet another naked attack on the rights of veterans. In that respect I can only say that it is an insult to those people who served our country in war. Given the opportunity, I do not hesitate to pay tribute to them, and I have frequently taken the opportunity of doing so the since I came into this place. I do not do it glibly; I do it from the heart. As I have said in this place before, my own direct association through my late father's war service and my own service gives me, I believe, a deep understanding of service people. They are very special people, and I do not hesitate to heap praise upon them at every opportunity, and indeed to heap praise upon those who are left behind, the war widows and the legatees. All these people deserve our undying gratitude, understanding and sensitivity to their particular needs. Let us just consider for a moment the fact that veterans' medical needs will not peak until the mid-1990s. There is sometimes a misapprehension about that. We think the veterans are getting older and that there are fewer of them. That is right; there are. But the point is that because they are getting older, even though there are fewer of them, their medical needs at this point of time are actually increasing. So it is not as if the demand for the services of repatriation general hospitals is diminishing; it is quite the contrary. Indeed, even though the needs may have peaked, they will still be as great in the year 2000 as they are today. That is significant. We are not questioning so much the direction of this move because, as some of the ex-service organisations have recognised, it is inevitable. Assuming we do not have any more wars by the year 2050, there will not be many veterans left. I do not expect I will be here then. At least if I am, I will certainly be needing every bit of help I can get. But the point is that in that sense it is inevitable. It is a matter of timing; it is a matter of sensitivity. The veterans have every reason to be very suspicious of the Government's motivation in respect of the diminution of the level of service to which they have become accustomed and, indeed, entitled. I underline the word 'entitled' because that is the situation. This is a further diminution of the special status of war veterans. Mr Gibson-Rubbish.",79
193,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,It is not rubbish. Mr Gibson-It is rubbish.,80
194,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,It is not rubbish. Clearly at the moment they have their own dedicated hospital system. There is no sense in which they will notMr Gibson-They will still have access to that hospital.,80
195,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,They will not. The Government is going to hand that over to the States. Mr Gibson-Why don't you read the legislation? They will still have that access.,80
196,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"That is the Government's intention, and they will not have that access to their own dedicated system. Access, as the Minister points out-and indeed the honourable member for Moreton got that part of it right-is a problem for people who are distant from those hospitals. However, the public hospitals to which veterans are to be sent are already overcrowded. How does one overcome that problem? A problem that we talk about here every day is that public hospitals already have queues outside and down the streets and waiting lists that go for years for some particular surgery. Government members want to throw the veterans onto those lines or give them some nebulous comfort. If they cannot get into a public hospital within a 'reasonable' time-and I do not know how one measures 'reasonable', because if we measure it by the standards of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), 'reasonable' could mean two months or two yearsMr RiggalI-In Victoria it is closer to two years.",80
197,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"hi Victoria a 'reasonable' time is close to two years; that is right. So what sort of comfort is that for veterans? If they cannot get into their local public hospital, and they probably will not be able to, within a reasonable time, they will be able to go to a private hospital. In theory that sounds great. Where I come from we have some excellent private hospitals. But it is no comfort; I assure honourable members it is no comfort. The access that veterans have to RGHs is absolutely critical. In thinking about the remarks I would make tonight and about what we are talking on, the irony of what happened yesterday occurred to me. Where was the honourable member for Moreton yesterday? It was the fiftieth anniversary of the Australian War Memorial. I do not want to put too fine a point on this, or score a political point over something that was a solemn occasion, but there were 30 or maybe 40 members of the Opposition at the War Memorial yesterday. How many were there from the Government? I counted three, including the Prime Minister. As I say, I am not making that point lightly. Yesterday was Armistice Day and it was the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the Australian War Memorial. It was a solemn occasion. The Prime Minister stood there and went through his thing. It seemed to me rather hypocritical that he should have stood there and reminded us-using the words and the rhetoric that he did-of the importance of veterans; that here is this great monument, which is correct, and that it is something that every Australian should see and visit; and that until they had done that, they could not really understand what Australia was all about. That was the sense of his words. Yet by this legislation the Government is not matching that rhetoric with actions. That is the irony. As I sat in my office tonight thinking about what I should say on this Bill, I thought that that had to be the supreme irony, that there is that glaring difference in attitudes and the inconsistency between what was said and what actually happens. Getting back onto the legislation-the Minister tells us there has been consultation. I have already referred to the extent of that. I made the point that there is considerable concern in the veterans' community and that the RSL nationally is opposed to this legislation. So what is the hurry? I would have to be very suspicious of the Government in going down this track so quickly. There is no hurry. We have made the point already that veterans' needs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. So we might have reason to be very suspicious of such haste. The legislation fails to address the very reasonable concerns which have been raised by the ex-service community. It seems to me that this is the proverbial thin end of the wedge. The Prime Minister's promise in April 1989 to which I referred is not worth anything, and the guarantees that we have been given and that veterans are being given in this legislation are doubtful. This is a diminution of veterans' rights because at the moment veterans do have their own dedicated hospital system. Anything less than that-and this is what is proposed-is a diminution. We on this side are committed. The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, made this point when he addressed the national conference. We are committed to the maintenance of RGHs-although we do recognise that in time and under certain strict conditions, integration may be necessary. There is no hurry at all for that to occur, but we do see that in time it will be inevitable. I have already mentioned this so-called reasonable time that will exist. If veterans cannot get into a public hospital within a reasonable time, they can go to a private hospital. But I have already alluded to the problems that exist within the general public hospital system under Medicare. As I have said, veterans are special. They have special access at the moment, special care, special consideration, special treatment-and so they ought to have. That they should have to get in queues is disgraceful, and I am hurt by it. I think that every veteran in this country will be hurt by that prospect. Let there be no misunderstanding; that is what the Government intends. I cannot understand it. Mr Gibson-The vast bulk don't go to veterans' hospitals now.",80
198,Mr BRADFORD,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"If the honourable member for Moreton had tried to explain why there was such a hurry to do this, then we might have decided to support the legislation. We support the general thrust of the integration somewhere down the track, but why the hurry? Why now, at a time when veterans' needs for medical attention have not even peaked? There will be an increasing demand in the future, not a diminishing one. I make the telling point, which was made by the Leader of the National Party, that there is no guarantee-I challenge the Minister to give me a guarantee, if there is a one-that veterans will even be able to choose the hospital they will go into. Further, will they have a choice of doctor? The answer, it seems to me, is no. They will have no choice of the hospital they will go to or of the doctor who will treat them in that hospital. That in itself is a considerable diminution. At the moment those facilities exist. The repatriation general hospital system allows that choice. Veterans get very special treatment and recognition in the RGHs. That is traditional; it is intrinsic to those particular hospitals. It cannot be replaced by a State owned hospital that services the public and veterans alike. It is not possible because of the way these people are. We will oppose this legislation-I am very proud that we have chosen to oppose it-to make' the point that needs to be made; that is, Opposition members have a very different attitude to veterans' affairs to that of the Government. This particular legislation highlights that difference. The Opposition will not forget and will not diminish the importance of veterans in this community. We will continue to recognise for as long as it takes, and whatever it costs, the contribution these people have made. We will not give the Government a blank cheque in respect of this matter simply because we do not trust it.",81
199,Mr COURTICE,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"Hinkler) (9.22 p.m.)Tonight we are cognately debating the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill 1991. Basically, the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill proposes to amend section 84 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In addition, the Bill, by the insertion of a proposed new section 90A, provides for the establishment of the repatriation private patient principles which set out guidelines and circumstances under which private patient treatment will be provided. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) covered the matters relating to these Bills very well and I congratulate him on his contribution. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table. I think it is fair to say that all Ministers for Veterans' Affairs, going right back to the beginning, have had a commitment and have done an outstanding job. We are very fortunate that this Minister has a very special understanding, compassion and concern because of his own family's involvement with the veteran community. He knows full well the circumstances that veterans have to face from time to time and their requirements for health services, particularly now that they are ageing, as well as the requirements of our war widows. Briefly, the principles will guarantee veterans, war widows and eligible dependants a choice of doctors and specialists who agree to treat under Veterans' Affairs arrangements; direct access as private patients to shared accommodation in public hospitals; private hospital care, where the public hospital system cannot meet the medical need within a reasonable time, in a private hospital with which Veterans' Affairs has an agreement, or other private hospitals where necessary; and continued access to former repatriation general hospitals. The safeguarding of the veterans' and war widows' rights is a fundamental goal. I think honourable members on both sides of the House would agree with that. A major concern of ex-service organisations has been to ensure that transfer of the hospitals to the States health systems would not diminish the level and quality of hospital and specialist treatment. They sought reassurance that the Government's guarantees on the standard and level of service would be maintained when the hospitals came under State control. I believe that the Bill addresses these concerns. I emphasise that the term 'priority of access' does not embrace the proposition that veterans or war widows would get priority entry to a hospital over a patient with more urgent medical needs. That is something the doctors will determine. However, the repatriation private patient principles ensure that veterans and war widows in need of hospitalisation get the necessary access through better use of the integrated repatriation hospitals, the public hospital system and private hospitals. It is important to recognise that. Only a few honourable members in this House are medical practitioners and they would know much better than laymen what constitutes priority when it comes to treating anybody in an emergency situation. The principles also guarantee the additional choice of a private hospital not contracted to Veterans' Affairs, provided they obtain financial authorisation. In such cases accommodation and other charges will be met to a pre-determined level with the veteran or war widow liable for the fees gathered. It is estimated that Australia's veteran community, including widows, widowers and dependants of ex-service personnel, is about 600,000. There is no doubt that over the next decade, as our veterans age, there will be more pressure to ensure that they are treated in a proper and fit manner. Indeed, the Government has appropriated approximately $5.3 billion this year to ensure that we retain the best repatriation system in the world. No other country in the world has a system as good as the one we have. I think the Government can be justly proud of it. It is unfortunate tonight that these Bills are not being supported by the Opposition. It is often the case that there is bipartisan support on this issue because it is-and should beabove politics. In this case the Opposition has said that it will not support this legislation. I am not clear whether the Opposition is opposed to one Bill or both Bills because we are debating two separate Bills tonight. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has been quoted as saying that it would be timely to have integration when the numbers of veterans drop to about 10,000. By doing a very simple mathematical calculation, one comes to the year 2030. The question can be asked: what was the response of State health Ministers when it was put to them that repatriation hospitals would be integrated into the State system in the year 20307 We also need to ask for the costing of the Opposition's policy. I refute totally the remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). He criticised the Government's decision and said that it was an attack on the veteran community. That is nonsense. It is disappointing that the honourable member would make such a comment. It is important to point out to the House that the honourable member for MCPherson has one of the highest number of veterans in Australia in his electorate. I have looked at the treatment those veterans have received in his electorate. It is the case that 459 went to RGHs; 2,558 went to the public hospital system; and 4,208 went to the private hospital system. Under our provisions, the 2,558 who went to the public system will be able to go into the private sector if they wish. The previous speaker does not even know what is happening in his own electorate. He is obviously out of touch if he believes that those figures support his argument. They totally refute everything he says. In these sorts of debates we are dealing with the emotions of our veterans, whom I am as proud of as anyone else. It was disappointing that the previous speaker highlighted the number of people who went to the War Memorial yesterday. I went to the War Memorial on Saturday and spent several hours there celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. An uncle of mine has his name up on the wall; he lost his life in the last war. No-one has a monopoly on patriotism or belief in our veterans community because we all share that same pride. It is disappointing that the previous speaker would make such comments. It is particularly disappointing because the Minister is the most committed Minister for Veterans' Affairs we have ever had. My electorate is in central Queensland, which also covers the electorates of a few representatives of the National Party. Three hundred and seventeen veterans there use RGHs, 541 use the public system and 1,092 use the private system. This indicates, as it does right across Australia, that our ageing returned service personnel, male and female, would prefer to be treated in their own area. As they get older and as they have to seek medical attention, they want to be close to their families and their loved ones. They do not want to go to the bottom end of the State. It may be okay for someone on the Gold Coast to think that the Gold Coast and Brisbane is Queensland, but Queensland is also Mount Isa and Cairns. The pressures and effects on our elderly veterans who have to travel from Mount Isa and Cairns down to Greenslopes is immense. Their families are living in Cairns, Tully, EI Arish, the Atherton TablelandsMr Gibson-And in Barcaldine.",82
200,Mr COURTICE,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"And in Barcaldine, as the honourable member for Moreton says. They would prefer to be treated in their own area. To further highlight this case, I took the Prime Minister's country task force into the electorate of Page this year. We met the veterans community. I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton would be interested in this, as the Minister was when we presented a report about the veterans community and its views on integration. The veterans community of Grafton supported integration 100 per cent. Mr Gibson-The vast majority do.",83
201,Mr COURTICE,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"Exactly. They supported it for those very reasons. They do not want to go to Concord if they can go to a hospital in Grafton or Casino where their family is. This legislation is about helping the veterans community and ensuring that we deliver the best se(Vices available. I am sure that everyone would like to be able to spend 10 times the amount we do on our veterans community. We have more than doubled our appropriations since 1983. The facts are there: $5.3 billion has been spent on our veterans community. We have put our money where our heart is. That is important. In speaking about our ageing veterans community, I would like to mention three great Aussies from Bundaberg: Mr Charlie Cheetham, who won a military medal on the Somme; Mr Bill Logan, who was in Gallipoli; and Mr Ed Crosby, a great old character and mate of mine who saw action in France and west Africa. They are all in the twilight of their years. They typify the true Aussie spirit. This legislation is about those sorts of people and what they fought for. Mr Gibson-Great Australians.",84
202,Mr COURTICE,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"Yes, that is right. Over a period of time our veterans from other wars-World War II and the other campaigns in Malaya, Korea, Vietnam and the active service that we have seen since and, I daresay, we will see again in some flash point in the world in time to come-will require the same sort of compassion and treatment. That is what this legislation is about. That is why I refute the comments made by the previous speaker, because we are about working with the veterans community to ensure that we deliver the best services. I would like to point out that the Minister has negotiated and worked closely with all sections of the veterans community over several years in regard to this issue. This has not been a fly by night piece of legislation that has been rushed through. It has been brought into help the veterans community. It is disappointing that the Opposition will not support this legislation because I believe it is important and beneficial. That is the most important thing to the veterans community. That is why it is above politics. This issue should be above politics because we are dealing with great Australians. I would like, even at this late hour, to say to the Leader of the National Party-who I believe is dedicated to the veterans community; there is no doubt about that-that he should reconsider his position on this issue. I think he should support the legislation. Because of the time available for this debate tonight and the number of speakers, I will close on that point. I want to state again that it is a matter of medical judgment as to whether a patient gets priority in a hospital. It is misleading for anyone to suggest that we can either create a miracle or demand that someone has access over the judgment and skill of the medical profession. A point that has been used against this legislation is that that means that our veterans will not get a fair go. They will. It is not for us as laymen to determine who gets priority when there is a car accident or some calamity that may well happen. It is for that reason that that point of view is put. I will close on that note and simply say that we owe a debt that we can never repay to our veterans. We all understand that on both sides of this House. While there is nothing wrong with getting into the tos and fros on any number of issues in this House-I love that more than anyone else-this issue is one that should be above politics. Again, I say to the Leader of the National Party that he and the rest of the Opposition should reconsider their point of view on this issue because it is too important to play politics with it, both in this House and in the other House, and it deserves to be supported. The Minister deserves to be supported for the commitment and the unflinching effort that he has put into the veterans community.",84
203,Mr RIGGALL,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"In rising to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill, I agree with the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) when he said that this particular subject should be above politics. In many cases, I believe that it is. I genuinely think that honourable members from both sides of the House have a commitment to getting the best for our veterans. It is not something that either side should be scoring points on. Today I was privileged as a member of parliament when a lady by the name of Wilma Young and 10 of her compatriots were here in the House. Wilma and her friend Mavis were talking on radio yesterday about their experiences during the War. Both of them were nurses and both of them were taken prisoner in Singapore. They were not so much talking about what happened in the prison camp but how they ended up being taken prisoners. Both of them were on board a ship which was, tragically, sunk. Wilma and Mavis both stated how they got off the ship, one of them stating that one of her very good friends at the time was right beside her and drowned. One of them said that when the ship heeled over some of the nurses slid off the deck of the ship and cut their hands and their arms to the bones as they went through the railing of the ship. They were in a dreadful state when they were taken prisoner. Luckily enough, Wilma was one of the people who did not suffer that particular tragedy and was able to nurse many of her compatriots through that very difficult early stage. Mavis had flown from England to be present at the fiftieth anniversary of the War Memorial. She stated that the very thing that saved her life, strangely enough, was the fact that she could not swim. She had a life jacket on and bobbed around in the water and was not able to get to shore. Those who did get to shore were, tragically, shot. Today I and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) had the great privilege of entertaining Wilma and her compatriots in the House this afternoon. One of the things that struck me was their spirit. While their bodies were getting frail in some cases, many of them using walking sticks, the spirit was that of 21-year-olds. Their eyes sparkled and there was something about the group that made me proud to be there visualising the spirit of the ANZACs. Honourable members who are interested should read a book called White Coolies. It reports what happened in Singapore and the hell that the nurses went through during those times. The author of that book was also a member of that group. Modestly, she did not say anything about it today. It was just one of those things that she had done during her life and one of the things that she had achieved. One was very humbled in her presence. In rising to speak on the Bill, I take the point of view that the Minister is very genuine in his attempt to resolve the problem. In doing so, I genuinely believe that he has partially got it wrong. While we would like to see a transition of the hospital system in such a way that the veterans can be looked after, I think we have to look very seriously at where those people are going. I would like to raise two aspects. First, I refer to a letter that I received from the Heidelberg Repatriation General Hospital Senior Medical Staff Association in my State of Victoria. It states: This Hospital is one of Victoria's foremost teaching and research centres. Founded in 1941 to treat personnel from the Armed Forces, it has expanded to become a progressive general teaching hospital of the University of Melbourne. Following an extensive rebuilding programme, the Repatriation General Hospital is now amongst the most up-to-date and best equipped hospitals in the State. The large site also offers scope for further development. That is what is there in Victoria today. That is the safety net that veterans in my electorate want. They appreciate the point that many of them are able to go to the local private hospital, but they like the safety net of being able to go to a major hospital if they need to have a serious operation; the major hospital that they choose to go to is the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. They are very concerned that the hospital could be transferred into the public system in Victoria. I do not think their concerns are unfounded, when I consider what has happened in Victoria since 1982. When the then Labor health Minister, Tom Roper-better known as Snappy Tominherited the system, he said quite clearly that he had 'an outstanding hospital system'. Those were his words in 1982. Yet a decade later, in 1991, what do we have? We have a waiting list of more than 30,000 patients, one-third of whom have been waiting for over one year for elective surgery. Most of them are poor and elderly. We have a run-down in hospital facilities and equipment that will take years to rectify; a loss of morale and professional dedication among Victoria's health professionals; and a public hospital system that costs $80 more per head than the average cost per head of other States and Territories, equivalent to $374m per annum. That is what it is costing Victoria against other States. We have a State-run psychiatric health system that is dominated by work practices and inefficiencies, as it is run more for the good of the staff than the patients. This is the tragic record of what has happened in Victoria today. We have a highly centralised bureaucracy that has overseen a massive growth in the non-direct patient care staffing levels over the last 10 years and a general loss of confidence in the system. The Minister quite seriously wants to take this world-class hospital, as stated by the Senior Medical Staff Association spokesman, and put it into that system. That is something that really is not within the interests of the veterans. It is very hard to come to grips with those two facts. Members of the Opposition in Victoria, in their preparation to take government next year, wanted to go in and do an audit on the hospitals to see how efficiently they were run. What happened? When they wanted to go in there, the union movement would not allow that audit to take place. It threatened them with massive strikes. Why? Because it had something to hide. This has been stated in the papers in Victoria. An article in the Sunday Age on 8 July 1990 states: The Cain government's attempts to reform wasteful work practices and cut back on excessively high staffing levels in the public hospitals have consistime tently failed. Mr White, for example, was forced to abandon an overhaul of work practices in the hospitals two years ago after workers were given a 4 per cent pay rise based on productivity grants. Nothing happened. An editorial in the HeraldSun, under the heading 'Our Sickest Strike', states: If ever a strike should not have happened it's the hospital stoppage-an outrageous abuse of union power, in defence of the indefensible. The Minister wants the repatriation hospital, which is a world-class hospital, to join a system which is full of so much underfunding and mismanagement that it is not reasonable to ask it to do that. The Herald-Sun editorial concluded by stating: Meanwhile at the Royal Women's Hospital, if the babies being born into this strike-torn, economica\1y abysmal State were aware of the anarchy awaiting them, they could be excused for asking for a return ticket. They are not my words; they are the words of the paper. I know that the Minister is genuine in his proposal to give a better future to the veterans. I understand that, while he has given them a Clayton's private health system, it is not quite good enough to put them into a public system in Victoria that really will not look after them. The Minister will be pleased to hear the balance of this letter from the Senior Medical Staff Association. It states: The Senior Medical Staff Association wholeheartedly supports the proposed changes and welcomes the challenge of providing a wider service, responsive to community needs. For instance, the Hospital now offers full diagnostic facilities to outpatients, not just repatriation patients. It then goes on to invite me to join a tour of the hospital to have a look at its world-class facilities. I was rather perplexed as to why this medical group of professionals would want to join such a dismal system as that in Victoria, so I rang the Chairman of the Senior Medical Staff Association and spoke to him about it. He was very keen for me to come to Melbourne to have a look at the hospital, which is something that I hope to do in the near future. That aside, I wondered why he was so keen for the hospital to join the Victorian system. We discussed it for some and it seems that the Association is keen for the hospital to join because it does not want to end up as a geriatric hospital looking after just veterans; This is a point of view that I can sympathise with. When we discussed this prospect, it became clear that what the Chairman really wanted was for the hospital to be able to look after veterans as well as general patients, to admit outpatients and allow general private patients to come into the hospital. It seems to me that the Staff Association had a gun at its head: either go into the Victorian system or become a geriatric hospital. It was a Clayton's choice; it was not a choice at all. Finally, I would like to say to the Minister once again something that I have brought up privately with him and something that I raised with the RSL, both in my electorate and in the State. I invite the Minister to consider the possibility of that hospital in Victoria being allowed to transfer into the control of the RSL, under trust, and associated bodies so they could run it as a private hospital to suit their needs. The Minister funding veterans with the equivalent of private health insurance. Think about it. There standard. could be a body of people in Victoria who could professionally run a large teaching hospital under private enterprise principles. It is something that could lead the way in industrial relations and efficiency. Quite clearly, the hospital could maintain excellence by its own momentum. It is hospital that could rely on the funding the pool of veterans and rely on a team of management drawn from veterans and other interested people, which I assume would the staff association, and it could be run as private hospital. It could be held by these people in trust until such time as it goes beyond the point of veterans needing that hospital, somewhere towards the year 2000. In the interim period, the Government would get two things. It would get a greenfield site, which, as I said earlier, allow industrial relations to be looked at in practical sense. Even the Minister would They appreciate the rhetoric over voluntary employsomething ment agreements that is coming from his side of the House. It is something that looked at quite seriously with the repatriation hospital. Secondly, we could look at the financial ability of that hospital to cope a private system. If we owe a debt to our veterans, then I see no reason why that debt, if need be, should not be partially paid supporting that system over the next decade. It is not a great price to pay when one conpeople siders the price that those people paid protecting Australia. The Minister knows very well that I have put this proposal to the RSL. It is quite keen to look at the costings and the practicality such a proposal. I inform the Minister in a spirit of bipartisan support that we would very keen to look at that and at the practicalities of solving his political problems, solving have the RSL's problem of keeping its repat hospital under its care and keeping it financially viable, and resolving the staff's problem by not turning it into a geriatric hospital but maintaining it as a centre of excellence, which it is now. But, fundamentally, over and above that, my proposal would keep it out of the is Victorian system, which, quite frankly, does not deserve a world-class hospital of this",84
204,Mrs GALLUS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"I oppose the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill and the Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill. In doing so I would like to say what Daw Park Repatriaits tion Hospital, which is in my electorate, a means to the veterans of my electorate and from the neighbouring electorate. Many of the veterans who live in my electorate came there because of the presence be of the hospital. They regard the Daw Park a Repatriation Hospital as their hospital. If any honourable member ever walks into that hospital, he or she will understand why. The veterans come into the hospital, walk down the corridors, are allocated a bed, and they say, 'Hi, Joe. Hi, Harry. Hi, Mark'. They know everybody. They know the staff. More would importantly, they know many of the people a who are already in there. They feel at home. are comforted. It is their hospital. It is that belongs to them. For them that is very important. It was theirs after the war, could be and it is still theirs. The veteran population is now ageing. Veterans are no longer young, fit people who under can move around. They need the security of what they already have. It might be said that this gives them an advantage that the rest of by the community does not have. Nobody else can go into a hospital and know half the there by name. However, I suspect that in this is something that we owe the veteran community. After the war, we were all very keen on repaying the debt to that community, but now that time has passed it is almost as of if people feel the debt has passed with it; but it has not. Those men lost their friends; many be of them were injured. They gave up their prospects to go to that war. They were given the repatriation hospitals to help them afterwards. That has become part of their lives and part of their entitlements. It should not be taken away from them. More importantly, I think the repatriation hospitals have become part of Australia's culture. We are in a situation now in which we seem to be losing our culture. People do not seem to know where we are or what we are. We have very few institutions that we can lean back on in this country. Some of the enduring institutions are the RSL and the repatriation hospital, but we seem to be hellbent on destroying them as well. I would like to voice some of the concerns that the veterans in my electorate have expressed to me. The first one is that if the present arrangement goes ahead as planned, with the guarantees that have been given verbally-although I might note not completely in the legislation-what they see happening would be initially a move away from the repatriation hospital as those people who did not live in that area tried to get into the public hospitals that were nearer to them and also tried to get into the private hospitals. After a certain period, if they found that that did not work, they would try to come back to the repatriation hospital. However, they are afraid that in the meantime the community patients would have taken over a great proportion of that hospital, and they no longer would be able to get in. This is what scares them. The hospital is something that they have had all their lives. They are now ageing, and they need it more than they have ever needed it. There is a fear of great loss. For those who live near the repatriation hospital, they can see the reason why they moved into the area gradually disappearing. Of course, one thing that has been stated about this legislation is that it gives greater access to care for people who do not live near a repatriation hospital. I think that is a bit a furphy, because those people already have that facility. They have the option to go to other hospitals if they do not live near a repatriation hospital. I do not think that is one of the advantages of the Bill. The veterans have been told that they can go into the public hospital system. My colleagues have pointed out the exact state of the public hospital system. I am not sure what the situation is in Victoria, but certainly South Australia has enormously long waiting lists in its public hospitals. The waiting lists are especially long for the diseases of old agefor prostate operations and for operations concerning hip replacement. The veterans are well aware of that position. What has kept them safe is having their own repatriation hospital. Suddenly they can see the spectre of their being placed into the public system, where they will have to line up with everyone else. We then come to the so-called guarantees that have been given to the veterans. They have been told that they will be given reasonable access to the private system. Many of them question the word 'reasonable'. What is reasonable access? In the repatriation private patient principles as provided for in the Bill, the Minister has actually tried to define 'reasonable time'. It is actually not reasonable access; it is 'reasonable time' that he has tried to define. He has tried to define it quite comprehensively. But I think that we can understand the veterans' distrust of this Government, because they have not actually been dealt with fairly on this matter. I will get back to that later. Just talking about reasonable access-first of all, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has told the veterans that they will have doctor of choice. Yes, they will have doctor of choice; but if their doctor of choice cannot operate in the hospitals that the DVA specifies, what use is the doctor of choice? They have not got doctor of choice. What they do have is perhaps doctor of choice at those hospitals which DVA specifies are okay hospitals. How many hospitals will that be? We have not been told. The negotiations on this are not clear. This is one of the reasons of why I object to these Bills. They seem to be rushed through in absolutely undue haste before there are any clear details about what is going to happen about things such as which hospitals, for instance, in South Australia will be put onto the private list. I point out to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) that, when people get old, they need much more care. Caring for the frail aged is not the same as caring for a 20-year-old with a broken leg; they need both intensive care and after hours care. I point out to the Minister, who may not be familiar with South Australia, that there is only one private hospital in the whole of Adelaide that has after hours care. So this is also a problem for the veterans. It is one thing for the Minister to say that veterans will have this sort of access to hospitals. But, when one looks at the private hospital system, it is not actually set up for the care of the frail aged in this way. One thing that I have also heard rumour of is that some of these hospitals will be developed in other ways. For instance, I believe one of the hospitals in another State will developed as an orthopaedic centre, which would seem to fit in very well with the repatriation idea. But I have heard that one either Heidelberg or Greenslopes hospitals being considered as a gynaecological centre in the future. That seems hardly compatible with veteran care. As I have said, I have is heard that rumour. I am not sure that rumour is, but it does add fuel to what is concerning the veterans. They hear these rumours and they add to everything that they are worried about. Regarding the trust that veterans have in Government, there is already concern over Daw Park Repatriation Hospital where this year $750,000 has been dropped from its Minister said: budget, which will mean the dropping of 18 The staff this year. There are also stories that over the next five years there will be a drop of staff members, which is again of enormous unequivocal concern to the veterans who use the Daw Park the House. Repatriation Hospital. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said that the veterans would have greater choice; I think I have addressed that. The veterans who live away from the repatriation hospitals already have a choice. They can already go to the other hospitals in their area, so the change will not advantage them. This whole story of telling veterans that they will be private patients is not true and the veterans can see through it for what it is. What is more, they resent very much being given pretty little coloured brochures to tell them that they can become private patients. When they have read those brochures, they have found that in fact they will not be private patients. The honourable member for Moreton also referred to consultation. Well, if this is consultation, I would hate to see anything that is not consultation. I was present when the Minister was in South Australia talking to the veteran community. He did not seem to me to be consulting, but just sitting at the head of the room saying what will be. One wonders whether this could have possibly happened 20 or even 10 years ago when the veteran community was still a be fighting force in this country. I cannot help but think that the veterans are being taken advantage of in this way because they are no of longer as young, as strong and as fighting fit is as they used to be. Ten or 20 years ago, nobody would have dared to cross the veteran community in the way that this Government crossing it today. It really treats veterans as how good though they are dead wood. The consultation simply has not been there. If it had been, why would all RSLs in every State except the New South Wales divisions say that they do not go along with integration. the This is not consultation. I will read a couple the of comments going back to when this was first introduced. On 10 November 1988 the integration of the repatriation hospital system will not take place until all of the concerns of the 40 veteran's community are dealt with. That is an guarantee that is given by this side of That does not say very much for the unequivocal guarantees of the Minister's side of the House if that was an unequivocal guarantee. He said that all of the concerns of the veteran community would be dealt with. The Minister and I were together in the room in South Australia when the veterans gave him their concerns. He made it very clear that integration was going ahead whether they agreed with it or not. That is not my idea of consultation, nor my idea of dealing with all the concerns of the veteran community. But that was not the only statement that was made. The following year, the Prime Minister backed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs by saying: . . . no RGH will be transferred to the State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters such as priority of access, and quality of health care for veterans and war widows, and unless the interests· of hospital staff have been adequately safeguarded . . . Finally, as part of the same speech, he said: . . . no final decision will be taken if the RSL has reasonable cause for dissatisfaction with the proposed arrangements. That seems to be quite different from what is going on now and quite different from the statement made by the Minister one year later again. The next year, the Minister, having given the veterans this unequivocal guarantee of consultation, saying that nothing would go ahead without their agreement, said: And don't, please, think that by burying your head in the sand or by writing furious articles this proposalthat is, integrationwill go away. It won't. It's the right way to go and the Government is committed to it. So much for the veterans and their concerns! So much for the honourable member for Moreton's claim of great consultation! The question I ask is the same question as other members on this side of the House have asked: why the urgency? When this Bill was originally mooted, it was to be for 1995, which made some sort of sense because 1995 is when we will reach the peak of usage of the repatriation hospitals. That year made sense. But it is no longer 1995; it is going to be 1992. Why the haste? Why must it go in in 1992 when peak usage will not be until 1995, and usage will not be back to present levels until in fact after the year 2000. Finally, I would like to comment particularlyon Daw Park Repatriation Hospital because I believe there are current negotiations going on with the State that the RSL may find agreeable in the end. Certainly, if it does, I believe we will be happy to support the integration of the hospitals because as such I think we all recognise that integration of the repatriation hospitals into the State system is inevitable. What we on this side of the House object to is the way that the Minister and the Government have ridden roughshod over the RSL and the veteran community against their objections, against the guarantees that the Minister originally gave to that community and against the faith that the community put in the Minister. There is a need for the Minister to go back to that community and keep faith with it. I will oppose both of the Bills.",87
205,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"in replyFirstly, I would like to thank all of those honourable members who have participated in this debate. I have enjoyed being here and listening to their contributions. I was very interested to hear those from the Opposition side. I was surprised that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) did not mention the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991, nor did his colleagues. So I just take it as written that there is no opposition to that Bill as no attention was paid to it. I appreciate that and I thank the Leader of the National Party for that. Mr Tim Fischer-We are opposing both Bills, as I said.",90
206,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"The Leader of the National Party says that he is opposing both Bills. I wish he had paid a bit more attention to the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill because it would have been very helpful for us to know what the Opposition opposes in that legislation. I think there are 8,000-plus people working in the repatriation hospitals and, through much consultation, we have reached an agreement with the unions and the staff. Now we find that the Opposition, without any reason being given, is opposing that legislation. I just have to say to the Leader of the National Party that I am sorry about that. I was very interested in the contribution made by the Leader of the National Party. I was a bit disappointed that he did not take a bit longer. I do not think he had his heart in it. I know that, if he were the shadow Minister for veterans affairs, he would have taken more time on it. I know that he has more important things to do, but we would have appreciated a little more contribution. I was very pleased to hear that the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) and other honourable members, state that they support integration, but not just at the moment. I suppose that point has been taken and I can understand that Opposition members would take this political opportunity to score a few points with the veterans community if they could. The Opposition seems to have cast aside all of the veterans who support integration. We have the war widows nationally, as members of the Opposition all know; we have the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council-which claims to represent and have more members than the RSL. The honourable member for'Farrer, the Leader of the National Party, knows that. We have the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association, which has some 20,000 members. They are the major users of our repatriation hospitals. The honourable member knows full well that that is the case. They support integration. We have the Korean and South East Asian Veterans Association. Sir William Keys was the national president for many years. He supports integration and he also supported integration when he was the national president of the RSL. I find it strange that the Opposition is not supporting Sir William Keys on this occasion. We have 47 out of 48 Legacy organisations supporting integration. They have done a great job on behalf of the veterans community, especially the war widows and the veterans' dependants. Does the honourable member think they would be supporting integration if it were not the right way to go? I know all these veterans associations have made special stipulations, and I say to the Leader of the National Party and other members of the Opposition that they have those stipulations and that is why we are debating the legislation today, because for many years now the majority of the veterans community have been asking the Government to put up. That is why this legislation is before the House tonight. I advise the Leader of the National Party that in my second reading speech I stressed that the legislation of itself does not transfer a single hospital. It simply puts in place a framework for transfer and, importantly, provides guarantees which have been sought by the ex-service community. The ex-service community has been asking for these guarantees. These Bills are a culmination of an extensive consultative process over more than three years, incorporating specific response to representations from the ex-service community, the DVA unions and the ACTU for formal guarantees to back up the assurances already given. Negotiations with the State governments are well under way and the successful integration of each repatriation general hospital will depend on the State governments building integration into the health care system. While this process will influence the timing of integration in each State, it is vital that the ex-service community be reassured that the guarantees provided by the government are enshrined in the legislation. I appreciate the contribution of the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr RiggaU) and his genuine concern. I think his electorate is in the Latrobe Valley and parts of the Gippsland area. We will soon supply him with some figures of the veterans in his electorate who are treated locally and those who are treated in the RGHs. I know he has made a genuine contribution; he has spoken to me personally and privately in my office and the chamber, and I appreciate his concerns for the veterans community. The honourable member for Hawker also has some special concerns in South Australia. There are many veterans in South Australia who use Daw Park and I understand the honourable member's concerns. We went to South Australia-and we are not riding roughshod over the veterans community; the honourable member knows that-and met the veterans before and after the honourable member left. We came to some arrangements; we are meeting again and we have been consulting . and consulting. We are not riding roughshod. No hospital is being integrated at this time; we are still negotiating and we are still trying to deal with the special concerns of the national President and the national Vice President of the RSL. In New South Wales the RSL voted for integration, with certain specifications, and it did so in Queensland. In South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania it voted against integration. I am the first to admit that. But the RSL does not represent the total community. We said we would deal with any reasonable concern. Mr Braithwaite-Don't you believe in the RSL?",90
207,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"Sir Alby Evatt agrees with integration. I am a member of the RSL, so it is no good the honourable member for Dawson coming in here and chirping and trying to score a cheap point on whether I believe in the RSL. Of course I believe in the RSL. My mother has a life gold pass. The honourable member should not come those little tricks here. I am a little smarter than the honourable member for Dawson on this, and if he wants to come those capers I will tell him how many people in his electorate want to come to Greenslopes Hospital. He is opposing this legislation. Does he think the people in his electorate want to come down to Greenslopes when they can be treated locally? I can read the legislation. The honourable member should not try to sidetrack the issue. I think the he is just trying to be a bit smart tonight. Let us return to the legislation. I appreciate the genuine contribution made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and I thank him sincerely. It was a very constructive and caring contribution. The honourable member makes many representations on behalf of the veterans community in his electorate and he speaks very closely to the staff at the repatriation hospital at Greenslopes. I appreciate the advice he gives me on the concerns of the people who work at Greenslopes and the veterans who are treated at the repatriation hospital. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) represents the veterans community in his electorate and makes many representations. He makes representations trying to have veterans from his electorate allowed to be treated in his electorate so that they do not have to come down to Greenslopes. Does the honourable member for Dawson think that the veterans in the electorate of the Leader of the National Patty want to go to Concord or Heidelberg if they can be treated locally? Of course they do not. The veterans in MCMillan do not want to go to Heidelberg. Does the honourable member know how much it costs to go in on the train when the wife has to visit the husband or the husband has to visit the wife in Heidelberg? Mr Riggall-I do.",92
208,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,It costs $38. Mr Tim Fischer-Just come clean.,92
209,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"We are coming clean. The honourable member does not have to worry about our coming clean. I would like him to come clean about why he is opposing this legislation. Let me point to the facts. If the honourable member really represents the veterans community, as he says he does, he should know that nationally, last financial year, over 58,000 veterans were treated in repatriation general hospitals, 49,500 were treated in public hospitals and 30,000 were treated in private hospitals. After integration, and once we put the legislation through for the private patients scheme, a big percentage of those 49,000 veterans who have been treated in public hospitals as public patients will be able to be treated as private patients in public hospitals. Do those opposite oppose that? Will they stand up tonight and tell me that they oppose that. Of course they do not. This is the political opportunism that we are faced with: those opposite just oppose the legislation for the sake of opposing, not because they believe in the veterans community or they want to do the right thing by the veterans community, because they do not. I am very happy that the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has walked in. He usually makes a genuine contribution on behalf of the veterans community, but I would like to take the cane to him a little in relation to his suggestions that there were few members of the Party over at the War Memorial for Remembrance Day. I happened to be in Brisbane, with a lot of other members, representing the Prime Minister, the Department and myself at the service there. I think that was a pretty cheap point to make. The honourable member for MCPherson claims that he is genuine about representing the veterans in his electorate. I point out that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has more veterans in his electorate than the honourable member has in his. The honourable member for MCPherson has some 23,000 veterans in his electorate. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was saying, the honourable member was not really representing the veteran community and the constituents in his electorate, because only 459 veterans from the Gold Coast chose to go to Greenslopes, and some of those were required to go there even though they wanted to be treated at the Gold Coast. Is the honourable member representing the veterans and their families? Let me tell him how many of those veterans are treated in the public hospitals. It is 2,558. Does the honourable member know how many of them are treated in the private hospitals, which he is opposing tonight? Mr Bradford-No.",92
210,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"Yes, the honourable member is. The number is 4,208. So there are some 6,700 veterans in MCPherson being treated locally, and the honourable member wants them to go to Greenslopes. Mr Bradford-No, we want them to have a choice. Mr IlUMPHREYS-Yes, you do-and we are giving them the choice; they can go to Greenslopes or they can be treated locally. But the honourable member does not want them to do that. Here is the legislation, and the sad part about it is that the honourable member has not read it and does not understand it. If he read the legislation, he would understand that the veterans will have the choice of going to Greenslopes or being treated locally. It is quite veterans in the honourable member's electorate are not being represented by him. We have the figures and facts right before him, and he does not want to know about it. I just say to Opposition members: 'For goodness sake, wake up and do not oppose this legislation just because you can score a cheap political point with some of your friends in the veteran community, because the majority of the veteran community believe in integration'. When I get letters from veterans and war widows asking me why they cannot be treated locally in the private hospital and be part of their own community where their family and friends can visit them, I will say that it is because the Opposition opposed this private patients scheme and this legislation in this House tonight-and honourable members opposite can answer their questions as to why they are opposing it. The honourable member opposite raised the old furphy about State hospitals. That is the old political football of bagging the State hospital systems. Is the honourable member going to say to me that 49,588 veterans who were treated in public hospitals in Australia as public patients were treated wrongly? I tell the honourable member that, of those 49,588 veterans who were treated in public hospitals, only one wrote to me complaining about the treatment received in those hospitals. That is one veteran. The honourable member bagged the State hospital systems in each of the States. Let me tell him this: anybody who is going to get sick and has to be treated anywhere in this world should make sure that it is in Australia - unless that person has a lot of money in his or her pocket. Honourable members opposite all know that quite well. Yet they stand up here tonight and carry on as if the State hospitals are bad. They should just ask the veterans in their electorates who are treated in the public hospitals why they are not complaining to them about the treatment that they get. It is terribly wrong to stand up here and accuse doctors and nurses-dedicated people - of not treating the veterans in those hospitals properly. But that is what the honourable member just did, and I think that that is quite unbelievable that the outrageous. Nevertheless, I appreciate the contributions of honourable members opposite and I understand their concerns. I also understand the concerns of those veterans who want to be treated in the repatriation hospitals, and they will be able to be treated there. And if they want to be treated locally, they will be able to be so treated. The sooner these people on the other side wake up and stop cheap political point scoring, the better off the veteran community will be. Honourable members opposite should not stand up here with crocodile tears and pretend that they care for the veteran community when they are opposing this legislation here tonight. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Humphreys) read a third time. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (PROVISION OF TREATMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 November, on motion by Mr Humphreys: That the Bill be now read a second time.",93
211,Mr GIBSON,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"I would just like to make a quick comment in response to some remarks that were made in the contribution by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). The honourable member claimed that this Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment Bill demonstrates some form of diminution in the level of concern and support for the needs of veterans on the part of this Government. He then chose to use, as some form of demonstration of this alleged lack of concern for veterans, the fact that many more Opposition members than Government members were present yesterday morning at the Remembrance Day service at the Australian War Memorial. I was particularly distressed at this contemptible implication, and I very strongly criticise the honourable member for MCPherson for his insensitive distortion. Many members on both sides of this House had loved ones who served in war zones and did not return, or who returned with considerable health problems. We each choose our own way of remembering the sacrifice of our own family members, friends or the many thousands of other Australians who similarly served their country. I do not need to participate in public displays to remember my grandfather, my great uncles or my uncles who served in World War I, World War II and Korea. I will never forget the sacrifices of all veterans, and I am very disappointed at the imputation of the honourable member for MCPherson. Question put: That the Bill be now read a second time.

212,Dr BOB WOODS,AYES,Lowe) (10.38 p.m.)The House is discussing together the four health insurance Bills relating to pathology amendments to Medicare. Most of these are a complete farce; they are a bunch of nonsense. They will not improve the medical system of this country one iota. NA Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order!

214,Dr BOB WOODS,PAIRS,"The Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill and cognate Bills change the structure of pathology practice in this country. Sadly, they do not change it for the better; they change it for the worse in a number of instances. We have a number of problems with what the Government is trying to do to the pathology industry. In essence, there are three elements to the area these Bills address. There are some changes to the system to prevent pathologists and general practitioners having inappropriate relationships, that is, giving kickbacks; there are some changes to the fee structures; and there are changes relating to collection centres. Firstly, let me address the question of kickbacks and dismiss that very briefly. There is no doubt that these provisos are needed. There is no doubt at all in anybody's mind that there are a number of pathology practices which are inappropriately and, indeed, illegally offering kickbacks, either directly or indirectly, to a number of GPs for utilising their pathology services. The extent of this is rather unknown. Most people in the medical industry, both in pathology and elsewhere, believe that it is very extensive indeed. There is no doubt that this has a major influence upon the costs of the system. For example, one of the ways in which it is done is to offer a pathology nurse to a general practice. In essence, although that nurse is paid by the pathology practice, she is employed in the general practice and works around the general practice as any other nurse would do and, therefore, is an extra member of staff paid for by the pathology firm in question but with the benefit, of course, going entirely to the general practice. There is no question at aU that this occurs and that other similar schemes and loopholes occur on a fairly widespread basis. Another rort which I think is fairly common is that pathology units will rent a space from a practice, but rent it at inflated fees. Obviously, in this situation it is a rort-a rort which costs the taxpayers of Australia money-and I applaud the Government for its attempts to try to close this loophole. In as far as that part of it goes, we will certainly support wholeheartedly the measures which address kickbacks. It is vital that we do actually address these issues and stop the system from being rorted and wastage occurring. A number of other issues occur. One is the question of what happens to collection centres. Collection centres basically are just that; they are centres where blood or, in many other cases, urine samples are collected for the pathology practice. There is a bit of a market in them at present inasmuch as there is competition between the pathology practices to set up collection centres at appropriate places. Of course, it is very convenient for a GP to send his patients to have pathology samples taken at a collection centre nearby rather than across town or some other distance away. Therefore, having a collection centre near a GP's practice or a group practice is an advantage in terms of who will get the collection sample. Whether it is, in fact, an advantage in terms of how many samples are processed is a separate question which I will come back to. At present, there are virtually no controls over collection centres. They are subject to the whims, if you like, of the market and, indeed, there is a great deal of competition between practices to set up collection centres in the appropriate place. They are not without their costs but, by and large, they do recoup those costs by virtue of diverting tests from one laboratory to' another. This legislation proposes a series of controls upon collection centres and, indeed, a series of fees upon collection centres according to a table which has been circulated by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). The first question to ask is: what is the overall impact of collection centres upon the total number of pathology samples collected and the number of pathology tests done? Is there any serious suggestion that increasing the number of collection centres will, in fact, increase the number of samples sent to a pathology unit or the number of tests requested? The answer is very clearly that if there is any impact at all from collection centres it is, in fact, very small. Some of the reasons for the suggestion that collection centres should be restricted, and this legislation seems to imply that the number of collection centres will be reduced to approximately half of the current number, are intra-professional-a series of competitive problems within the pathology market. Some segments of the pathology industry believe that they - ight have a competitive edge if the number of centres were limited. We should bear in mind that, by and large, the request for pathology samples is based, ideally, upon the clinical condition of the patient, but certainly upon a GP's judgment in a number of circumstances; the GP decides what tests need to be done and how many tests need to be done, and those tests are in almost all cases specified very exactly. It is very difficult, therefore, to perceive of a GP prescribing or requesting more tests just because there happens to be a pathology collection centre 100 metres down the road. We have here a piece of legislation which is, by and large, superfluous; which is not going to restrict the number of pathology samples; which is not going to restrict the number of tests done on those samples; and which will have little effect by itself upon kickbacks-although there are some aspects of the controls on pathology collection centres which will, indeed, stop one aspect of the kickbacks, and we would support that. The question then is: should we support the collection centre legislation? There is another aspect to this, which is rather difficult to justify; that is, the question of fees. The fees which are being charged for pathology specimen collection centres include about $1,000 for each centre. When we tried to find out exactly the basis for the fees, the Department seemed to indicate that there was no sensible basis for it at all; it was simply a question of the bottom line of the Budget. It decided that the pathology industry could afford to donate, if you like, these fees to the Government and asked why the pathology departments should not do this. It seems to me to be a very crazy way of increasing the fees on pathology when there is no sensible basis for the assessment of the fees. It is simply another way of putting on extra controls. In essence, that is what the whole thing amounts to. In terms of the collection centres, it amounts to a series of controls and a number of interferences in the running of pathology units by the pathologists or the people running the particular authority. It is another example of this Government not being able to keep its hands off a free market. If interfering with the free market leads to a better system, or if it leads to a fairer system, or if it leads to a better delivery of the system, or if it leads effectively to a sensibly cheaper system with no extra cost to the patients, we have no trouble in supporting these issues. The fact is that the collection centre legislation is only half thought out. It is based on a suggestion from the AAPP, but it is not supported by a number of members of the pathology profession who believe it will not only disadvantage their practices but, more importantly from our point of view, will also disadvantage the patients. It is the patients who will suffer. It is the patients who will have to trudge miles or kilometres to the nearest pathology centre or get in their car to go to there and who will be disadvantaged in one of a number of other ways. We do not believe that the Government should interfere. We do not believe the Government should regulate unless it has to. The Government does not have to. The regulation will not be beneficial, and we are therefore unhappy about the collection centre proposals in this legislation. There are some other aspects of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill which are fairly straightforward-I will touch upon them in passing-such as ensuring that the licensing scheme means that only those doctors who should receive appropriate payments will, in fact, receive those payments; that is, the sample has to be collected at a licensed centre or an equivalent private or recognised hospital or from a treating practitioner. Those aspects of the legislation, which are fairly straightforward, we will support. As I said before, we will certainly support the provision that a Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be paid if there is ever any evidence of a deal between the GP and the pathologists or any form of kickback. There are figures-I will not go into them now, but I am sure the Minister is familiar with them-which indicate very clearly that deals are being struck in a number of situations which relate to increasing the income of the GP and, as a result, increasing the income of the pathologist by providing more samples. In the end, the only person who pays is the taxpayer and the patient, who in many cases may be the same person. We are very happy to support this provision. There are a number of aspects that the Government might have considered addressing, including changing the fee structure. It is very clear that one of the problems in pathology, as in the rest of Medicare, is the absence of any price signal to patients. It is arguable that by and large pathology tests are indicated by, tested and requested by GPs rather than by patients. There is no doubt that a price signal to the patient has a significant influence upon the number of samples which are tested by a GP and which are requested by a GP. A GP who knows that there is no price, no cost and no pain to a patient at all is obviously more likely to prescribe a larger number of tests. Of course, there is now good evidence for this, which I am sure the Minister is familiar with. I will just touch upon one example which relates to a particular general practitioner in Melbourne who, for many years, had been sending his pathology samples to a particular pathology practice in Melbourne. He was approached by a separate pathology practice, which offered him the facility of bulkbilling. The original pathology practice had not offered him that facility and, by and large, it was against its policy to offer bulkbilling. Of course, he then turned to the first practice and said, 'Look, I have been offered the option of bulkbilling my patients. I come from a relatively disadvantaged area. It would be nice for me to be able to say to the not cost them anything to have a pathology test. Will you offer me the same facility; that is, will you allow me to bulkbill to your laboratory?'-implying, 'If you do not, I will go to the other pathology unit'. Somewhat against the first pathology practice's better judgment, it said, 'Yes. In your situation, we will make an exception; we will allow you to bulkbill'. And, indeed, it did. The general practitioner stayed with the first practice. He bulkbilled and at the end of the first year the pathology unit, which was very familiar with the practice of this general practitioner, looked at the number of tests which had been done prior to his having the facility for bulkbilling and after his having the facility. There were no real changes in the number of episodes and there was no real change in the number of patients referred. The only changes were in the number of tests done. The number of tests increased in the first year by 40 per cent. There was no other change at all apart from bulkbilling. Anybody who stands up here and says with a straight face that the facility of allowing bulkbilling and allowing a 'free' service does not lead to over use is obviously talking through his hat. For once, as I have said before in this place, I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who, in relation to pharmaceuticals, indicated that if we offer a free service it will be misused and abused. That is exactly what happened with pathology services. There is no question that it has been abused and misused. I must also touch on one problem with the original legislation. I understand that the Government will move an amendment to clause 4. The Government clearly has not picked up a loophole-we were very happy to be of service to the Government and pointed this out to the Government-in relation to collection centres in private hospitals. The amendment circulated to us is entirely acceptable and we think it closes the loophole very appropriately, somewhat to the detriment of one or two pathology practices around this country which are unhappy about it. It is a fair amendment and we therefore patients that it will support it. Because of the guillotine I will try not to continue for too long. The next issue relates to the changes to the fee structure, which are somewhat scatterbrained. It is very clear that the fee structures suggested by the Government relate to, for example, having an episodic fee rather than an individual item fee, and having an alteration to the system so that two tiers are now taken into account according to where the sample is collected. I can understand how the Government has come to this decision but in the end, if one looks at the bottom line, it will not really resolve many of the problems which the pathology profession is facing. The pathology profession is not unhappy about these changes by and large, but it is also true to say that the impact of these fees upon the pathology profession will not be enormous and will not make as many changes to the practice of medicine as they should. It certainly will result in cuts and the end result in four years, of around $100m in terms of savings, is not unreasonable. A large part of this has been done by reducing the actual fee, which will be around 70 per cent of the current scheduled fee level. The CPI has also been forgone which, if I remember rightly, off the top of my head, was around 3.7 per cent scheduled for this year, and that will no longer be offered. We do not believe that the structure of the fees in particular and the system of tiering and episodic fees will have a major impact upon the quality of the fees, the quality of the service offered or the appropriateness of the service offered. For that reason we are unhappy about what the Government is doing, but equally it is true to say that it will cut down on some overusage, albeit in a somewhat roundabout way. For that reason we will not be opposing these measures. We also have reservations about the policing of some of the suggested arm's length agreements. It is not clear how that policing will occur. One suggestion made to us was that some of the increased fees for collection centres and other licence fees which have been introduced should be devoted to the policing of these changes. I think that is not an unreasonable request. The fees are quite remarkable. For example, the fees have risen from about $200 annually for laboratories to something like $2,500 annually. They have changed in a number of other categories. In every case the increase is very marked. For example, for an approved pathology practitioner the fees have risen from $100 to $500, if I remember correctly. That is just in relation to the APP, the approved pathology practitioner. For pathology authorities I think it has risen from $100 to $1,500. There is no sense behind this increase in the fees. I hope that the Government will see fit to make sure that the other aspect of this legislation is attended to; that is, the policing and monitoring of the sensible parts of the legislation. Since it now has a very juicy source of income for which there is no basis-it is not offering a better service with it; in fact it is probably going to offer a worse service-it is a very sensible suggestion that we devote at least part of the revenue from these increased fees to the policing of the whole program. One of the things the Government should have done is address the problem of free medicine: the inequities of bulkbilling. Of course, the Government has done absolutely nothing in this regard. It could not even do anything in regard to the GPs because it decided, in spite of its original Budget announcement, that it would wimp out. Basically, it said, 'Okay, it is just too hard to do anything that might be seen to undermine bulkbilling. We will introduce a co-payment'. One might think that, by and large, introducing a co-payment would be a signal that bulkbilling was perhaps not the be all and end all that various left wing Ministers have suggested it might be. But when a co-payment is introduced in the way this Government introduced it for the GP aspects of Medicare, clearly it is saying, 'We will actually have a co-payment, but we will structure it in such a way as to actually encourage the use of bulkbilling'. That is the biggest nonsense I have ever heard. How the Government can justify that sort of approach is entirely beyond me and beyond most other people. We are rather short of time tonight because the Government, in its brutal fashion, has again downtrodden democracy and imposed a guillotine upon this legislation. For that reason we will not be opposing the legislation, but we have expressed very forcefully our considerable reservations about a number of aspects of these changes. They will work to a certain extent, but we do not believe they will be an efficient way of changing the system. We do not believe they will change the practices of a number of doctors-both genuine doctors and, indeed, a number of crooked or uncaring doctors. We do not believe they will make the fundamental structural changes to the pathology aspects of Medicare that are needed badly. For that reason, we are very unhappy indeed. However, because of the constraints of time and because the Bills will actually improve the system slightly, we will not be opposing them.",95
215,Mr SNOW,PAIRS,"I think we all agree with the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) that pathology costs have been too high in some cases and that action is required. Through this legislation, I believe we are tackling the abuses and the overusage he talked about. For instance, we had situations where full fees were paid even when more than one test was sent with one collection and one delivery. Obviously, reform was needed. I believe the Opposition's cooperation on this legislation is welcome and understandable. Overusage has been increasing at a disproportionate rate in recent years and it is important that reforms take place. We have introduced reforms to the schedule fees; savings measures have been introduced, and there has been encouragement of a reduction in the number of services. The key components of the legislation involve a licensing scheme for pathology collection centres. They relate to a single level Medicare benefit, set at 70 per cent of the current specialist pathology fee for all services-other than for some cytology and histopathology-and four high volume tests. They also involve a new transaction fee which covers costs other than those associated with doing the test, such as collection costs and courier costs. It is important to mention that general practitioners can now do their own tests but they will not be receive a transaction fee. Often the test is done in a comer of the doctor's surgery and probably a transaction fee is less called for. They do not have their own quality control programs, but that does not mean that their tests are inaccurate in any way; it just means that the pathologists have organised quality control programs. It is interesting that only about 2 per cent of general practitioners actually have the more extensive provisions necessary for conducting pathology tests in their surgeries; so only a fairly small number are involved anyway. There is no doubt that there are too many collection centres, and they are often too close together. I believe this has been acknowledged and accepted by the profession. The honourable member for Lowe talked about controls, interferences and a free market. The pathology testing areas are the last place where one would be able to find a free market. If there were a free market the Government would not be involved, and the Government is involved here as it pays people a fee. The profession is in a position where it is able to set fees. The honourable member for Lowe talked about the absence of price signals to patients but later on talked about bulkbilling. The very absence of price signals means that it is not really a free market. We have the bulkbilling problem that the honourable member talked about but, in balance, we have to look at the benefits. I admit that there are some costs with bulkbilling but the fact that there is one transaction fee, and a practitioner may do two or three tests and send them away together, will reduce the abuse of bulkbilling. The fact is that a patient is more likely to object to repeated calls, and the practitioner is less likely to require repeated calls, because of the charge the patient is paying. So there are signals there. We have that constraint both through the patient and through pathology, which I believe will affect abuses. In the end we have to say: do we want to keep bulkbilling with its advantages for the poorest and those most in need in the community? The answer of the Government is yes. The honourable member for Lowe said that the changes in fees and payments would not make much difference to the pathology profession, but he admits there are big savings for taxpayers. Surely that is a major criterion for supporting the legislation. The licensing of the pathology specimen collection centres, which will take place from 1 February 1992, will bring about a situation where private approved pathology authorities will be required to hold a licence for each of their collection centres to enable the payment of Medicare benefits in respect of pathology services rendered at those centres. A licence fee has been set at $1,000. New pathology practices will be eligible to apply for up to three licences, so we have not curbed the market to a great extent. If people want to set up a practice, they can. New market entrants will be assisted during their first year of operation. Special consideration will even be given to granting licences to centres which service rural areas on a proven need basis. So practices will be able to have up to three licences, and there will be special consideration for rural areas. But the collection centre must be an independent facility. As the honourable member for Lowe said, this gets away from the problems that existed where there was so much of a link with surgeries. The number and location of collection centres will be reviewed in cooperation with representatives from the profession, with a view to reducing the number significantly over a two-year period. As I have said before, it is generally recogrused within the pathology profession that there were too many practices. I wish to make a couple of important points. The first is the reform of collection centre arrangements which has been undertaken to negate the potential for the nexus that the honourable member for Lowe was talking about. There must be no functional, direct or indirect pecuniary or other beneficial contractual arrangement or understanding in relation to the ordering of pathology between the approved pathology authority, the pathologist, the treating practitioner, the employer or an employee of the practitioner or any other party. So that is quite clear. The Health Insurance (pathology)(Fees) Bill 1991, which is also being considered, makes it clear that the crucial role of general medical them. practitioners in primary health care will continue to be encouraged, as will the collection of patient samples in their surgeries wherever possible. It also ensures that bulkbilling arrangements continue; that patients will not suffer the loss of existing entitlements to pathology services; and that a significant reduction in the number of collection centres will encourage GPs to collect specimens themselves. Patients should therefore be inconvenienced only when their doctors insist on directing them to collection centres which may be some distance from the referring doctors. The importance of the appropriate use of pathology in disease prevention and diagnosis is well recognised. I am pleased to say that it is supported by the Government. However, inefficiencies in the current arrangements plus the inappropriate use of pathology services have created an unacceptable burden on our health system. The reforms are designed to reduce these inefficiencies and produce a more cost effective industry. The reforms sit squarely with the Medicare objectives of cost containment, equity and universality. That explains the slight difference in approach to these Bills between the Government and the Opposition. The proposed formula gives consideration to the issuing of additional licences for those in rural and remote areas. The new arrangements will cause the industry to rationalise and become more cost effective. The fact that there is agreement within the profession is important. The profession agrees that too many collection centres have evolved as a result of the lucrative financial gains possible. The Pathology Advisory Committee will be monitoring the level of bulkbilled pathology services to ensure that there is no change in the profile as a result of the changes and to ensure that the disadvantaged and people on low incomes are not prevented from accessing services. So the advisory committee will be watching; there will be a professional eye and a government eye on what is happening under the legislation. I welcome that, for it is important. Above all, the measures are particularly important, and I am pleased to support",100
216,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS,"It should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the tortured history of health insurance legislation in Australia to learn that the Health Insurance Act is being amended yet again by this Parliament, on this occasion by no fewer than four amending Bills in the one day following two Bills last week. Since the introduction of the Act in 1973, more than 50 amending Bills have been introduced, and still the Government has not dealt with some of the basic difficulties in the legislation. Evidence of the continuing problems is reflected in a recent decision of the Federal Court to declare invalid the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Bill, which was passed by this Parliament earlier this year. The fact is that the Medicare system of universal health coverage that was introduced by this Government in 1984, whilst perfectly laudable in its ideals, simply cannot pay for itself, which is why the Government is looking around for whipping boys-in this case, the pathologists. In 1988-89, about $25.9 billion was spent on health care in Australia. Of this, only around $6 billion came from direct out-ofpocket payments by individuals. Since the introduction of Medicare, hospital admissions and bed days per person have gradually increased. Since 1984, medical services used per person have increased by around 3 per cent annually, or 23.2 per cent overall, with the greatest increases being in pathology services. Australia has more hospital admission rates and more doctor visits per person per year than, for example, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Australian hospitals have higher staffing levels for all personnel and nursing personnel than do Denmark, West Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Staffing ratios per patient in Australian hospitals are three times those of Germany. Is it little wonder that the Government is scratching its collective head and running around in circles in relation to health care generally? The latest bandaid measures are testimony to the Government's desperate attempts to patch up what could be described as a sinking ship. At first, we were going to have the $3.50 medical fee charged to patients which would be deducted from what the doctors receive from the Government. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) was adamant about this; there was going to be no turning back on this particular issue. What happened? He buckled under pressure from the Left, from his own faction of the Party. What we got was a bit of this and a bit of that. An amount of $3.50 was to be charged by bulkbiIling doctors and $2.50 by the rest. The Government is trying to do the impossible to cover all people. Discouraging those who could afford to take out private insurance from doing so, which then spirals upwards in cost as part of this vicious circle, actually does a terrible disservice to those who really need health care in this country-the old and sick. To be sick is bad enough but to have to worry about the cost of treatment is something which we hope we could spare the citizens-the old citizens, in particular-of any civilised society. We should listen to the cry of just one person. In a recent letter to the Editor of the Australian Financial Review, John Goodwin of West Pennant Hills in Sydney wrote: Sir, being one who doesn't wish ill to any fellow human being I find it difficult to express my feelings about the new Medicare charge which has just been approved by the Labor Caucus. However, it's time. I told the world how I feel about Messrs. Hawke, Howe and Kerin and my hope for their ultimate fate. It would be fitting if all of them contracted a debilitating, incurable, painful disease such as that which affects my wife-a disease requiring constant medical attention just to try to control the agonising pain. Maybe then they would think again about adding another $3.50 a fortnight to my already excessive health care charges. While they are imposing a new charge on the sick, Mr Hawke has the temerity to appear in Parliament and accuse Dr Hewson of lack of compassion. I can now understand how my late father felt when he said on changing allegiance in 1975 after voting Labor since 1927 that it was no longer the people's party but the party of power brokers. The ageing of the Australian population has, to date, had almost no effect on the enormous blow-out in the cost of health which in 1988 was running at $1,415 for every man, woman and child in this country. It is responsible for a mere 0.35 per cent of a 3.5 per cent increase in the per capita use of private medical services. The increase of 15 to 17 per cent in medical costs above the growth in population has more to do with the nature of aggressively high tech and extraordinary medicine which has been offered to the population. Heart surgery, organ transplants, joint replacements and expensive drugs are expected these days to be available to all those who need it. In this country there has been virtually no questioning of these impossible expectations. Rationing is inevitable and this has already been recognised in overseas practice. In the United States, the Oregon State Government has given priority to certain treatments on the basis of public opinion polling and data from medical economists whose unit of measurement is the quality adjusted life year. This has meant a decision to fund neo-natal intensive care but not heart transplants. In Maryland, the Government proposes to deny access to some welfare benefits, including health care, to those who do not participate in preventive health measures such as PAP smears, breast screening and vaccination. In Britain, the Government has introduced 'budget holding' for general practitioners who shop around hospitals for the best price for patients' treatment, and general practitioners have to control their spending on pharmaceuticals and pathology tests. In this country we have a debate on the introduction of the pathology aspects of the health insurance legislation. Yet one of the central questions which one thought might be answered in relation to the current inquiry and in relation to the health insurance legislation is a simple question about bulkbilling and the delivery of pathology services. Do doctors who bulkbill order more pathology tests than those who do not? There are some suggestions in the report of the national health strategy entitled Directions for Pathology that there is no correlation. Yet when the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who in the Senate represents the Minister for Health (Mr Howe), has been asked on a number of occasions in the Senate about whether this information can be provided, again and again we do not get the answer. All these points are brought out in a letter to the Australian by a Western Australian doctor, Dr Michael Jones, who said in his letter: Most would agree that in a civilised society everyone, regardless of circumstances should have access to 'basic health care'. Unfortunately, has yet defined what this means. Does it include cardiac surgery for the elderly, expensive treatment for those unfortunate enough to be infertile, cosmetic surgery for those unhappy with their appearance. Until there are clear guidelines about what should and should not be available, costs will spiral. The method of financing is of secondary importance. An oversupply of doctors spurred on by the fear of litigation and the need to investigate and treat every possible problem, together with a community fed on a diet of medical miracles and wonder drugs, is a recipe no country can afford. For all the money being spent on health or, rather, illness, there is no relationship between a country's spending on health services and the health of its people. For example, Japan, with a gross domestic product outlay on health services of 6.7 per cent, compared with Australia's 8.1 per cent, has a life expectancy of 79.2 years for women and 73.7 years for men. Both of those figures are higher than those for all comparable GECD countries. The Government in Australia is underwriting and promoting an illness industry. Its lack of commitment to preventive medicine is mirrored in its outlay on the promotion of health, which is still less than 10 per cent on the most generous figure of total health outlays. The Government's better health, better life program, which was set up at the end of 1989, was allocated only $43m over three years on a cost-shared basis with the States and Territories. Yet the savings to the nation, quite apart from the benefits to personal health, are large. For example, the Director of the Centre for Health Promotion and Research in Sydney, Dr Garry Egger, estimates that expenditure of $500,000 over three years on sports injury prevention could save the nation up to $200m. We have a system which teaches people to seek and rely on magic bullets dispensed by a godly medical profession, which often has neither the time, the training nor the interest to counsel patients about future prevention of ill health. For women, who may live longer than men but who are chronically ill much more than men throughout their lives, prevention is not merely better than cure; it can mean the difference between life and death. Over 2,000 women die every year of a preno-one ventable cancer-cancer of the breast. At the last election, the Labor Government stole our policy on mammography, declaring that it was going to spend $64m over three years on screening women 45 and over for breast cancer. Never mind that the high risk comes after the age of 40. It has recently been announced that $64m is now to be spread over five years. This is probably because 18 months into the program, only $lm has been spent. Does the Government regard procrastination as better than prevention, and magic bullets and bandaids as a happy alternative to both? In relation to pathology in particular, in the national health strategy, remarks are made in relation to needing to cut back on pathology services. We see that some services in relation to women, such as honnone assays, which are increasingly being used in honnone replacement therapy, may well be the subject of these sorts of cuts which are being brought into existence. That is not to say that assays are necessarily the be-all and end-all in tenns of women's health. In fact, before I came down to the chamber I was interested see a debate on the Lateline program which featured Gennaine Greer discussing her latest book, The Change, which relates to the specimen impact of menopause on women and the way in which society regards women and the ities, changes which they undergo at menopause. There is criticism from her of the honnone replacement therapy program which is being carried out and which has been seen by some as a panacea to women's health problems at and after the time of menopause. In the meantime, we have a situation in country where women are dying; the sick crying out in anguish because they have to pay dearly for basic medicine; and hospital waiting lists continue to grow. The GovernCanberra-based ment satisfies none of these problems. The failure of the Government's universal covercapital age is contained in one statistic in the February 1991 report of its national health strategy. In 1990, 23 per cent of people with incomes of less than $160 per week continued to take out private health insurance, and per cent of the privately insured in Australia have incomes under average earnings. These people cannot afford health insurance, but they are clearly concerned that they cannot obtain adequate health care in the public health system. According to an independent organisation, the Health Issues Centre, far from diminishing inequalities in health status between socio-economic groups, the gaps are actually widening because of high unemployment and reduced living standards in Australia. Is this what the Minister and the Government call success?",101
217,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"The debate tonight concludes with a range of Bills that will transform Australian pathology services. The Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill, the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment (No.2) Bill, the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Fees) Bill and the Health Insurance (Pathology) (Licence Fee) Bill make a number of amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in honnone relation to pathology services. The main function of the Bills is to introto duce a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres, charging fees for the licences required to be held by pathology collection centres and increasing the fees payable by approved pathology authorapproved pathology practitioners and an accredited pathology laboratory. The main thrust of the Bills is to address the problem in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane of hundreds of collection centres operating very close together with unnecessarily high costs. The measures proposed in these Bills serve to increase costs associated with providing this pathology services and, therefore, minimise are the number of pathology outlets. However, as so often is the case when bureaucrats draft such legislation, no regard is paid to people living outside cities in rural communities. Pathology collection centres are spread right across my electorate of Maranoa, deemed remote by any standards; in fact, it is three times the size of Victoria. When the provisions were initially 40 raised in the 1991-92 Federal Budget, there was genuine concern and fear right across my electorate, and right across rural Australia, that people in these communities would lose their pathology services. Those most concerned were families with young children and aged people living in remote areas so they could be near their extended family, their children. It was to be announced that licensed collection premises would be compensated by two different transaction fees for the cost of collecting and transporting specimens to a laboratory. There was absolutely no mention of what constituted a licensed collection centre. However, a suggested definition was a centre that had a throughput of 1,000 patients or more a month. This was widely reported and widely accepted as fact by many both within the pathology industry and outside it. In fact, they were fears that could not be categorically denied by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. No pathology collection centre in the electorate of Maranoa processes anywhere near 1,000 patients per month. I would say that we would find a similar situation in many parts of rural Australia, where 1,000 collection samples per month would be more like an annual figure. Under those guidelines, maintaining a pathology service to remote western Queensland, and in fact to rural Australia, could not be justified. For months the future of the pathology collection services throughout my electorate and rural Australia lay in the balance, as did the jobs of many registered nurses who operated those centres. However, since the Budget announcement I have had the frustrating job of trying to convince the Government of the need for these remote area pathology collection centres as distinct from the collection centres in the major cities. It was suggested by Canberra that remote area pathology collection centres were of little consequence and that their demise was of little relevance. This suggests how very little contact bureaucrats have with remote Australian communities, including the local GP. Prior to the existence of rural pathology collection centres, patients would have to endure long bus journeys to their nearest major centre of population. In the case of my electorate, 1,000 kilometres was not uncommon. It was more the norm. In other cases, patients would be treated by their family doctor and the resulting specimens were transported on the bus to the processing centre in the major cities. However, this is not a suitable method of transportation of blood culture or for tests of a microbiological nature where an immediate analysis is so often called for. Pathology collection centres certainly provide an essential service for urban Australia, but they are more essential for Australia's rural communities which suffer so many other hardships. When we make regulations to address problems of overcrowding in cities, we must carefully assess the impact such measures will have on rural population centres, especially when we are considering Australia's health system. The licensing equation that has finally been agreed upon represents a far more common sense approach than the originally proposed 1,000 patients per month formula. Collection centres no longer enter the equation. Licences will be issued to an approved pathology authority on meeting various specifications. One licence will be issued for every 30 GPs who refer more than 15 patients per quarter. One licence will be issued per 50 patient episodes; that is, all the same services ordered by the same doctor for the same patient on the same day. Four licences will be issued per full time equivalent pathologist. According to this equation, the approved pathology authority will be issued with a representative number of licences. These licences will be dispensed at the discretion of the relevant approved pathology authority. Information to my office would suggest that the pathology service offered to the electorate of Maranoa, and in fact rural Australia, will remain largely unchanged with the passing of this legislation. However, the licensing structure and the fee structure imposed by these Bills will ensure greater difficulties in maintaining a rural service. The change in fee structure will result in less income and greater cost to the pathologist. The cost of importing foreign equipment, for example, from Europe and America has increased recently by 8 to 10 per cent on average. This income cost imbalance is perhaps most threatening to those rural collection centres operating on very marginal profits, if there are any profits at all. One of my priorities over the last 18 months, since being elected to Parliament, has been to ensure access to health services for those living outside the major capital cities. I believe that, if the Government has a commitment to ensuring equality in the provision of health services, consideration should be given to exempting remote pathology collection centres from the proposed $1,000 annual licensing fee. The rationale for introducing such a move in the first place, as conceded by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), was to curtail the unnecessary overservicing in major cities. Overservicing in my electorate of Maranoa and in most of rural Australia is not the issue; in fact, maintaining a service is the only controversial issue. I believe that a $1,000 government charge in providing an essential service to residents disadvantaged by location is quite unfair.",104
218,Mr HOWE,PAIRS,"in reply-I thank those who have contributed to the debate. The debate has not filled the galleries and the chamber; nevertheless, the legislation is important because the savings involved are in excess of $100m. In reality, pathology does not operate in the free market. The decisions are essentially not made by the patients but, hopefully, are essentially made in the interests of the patients by the doctors who are the decision makers. Clearly, the various measures involved in the licensing regime will reduce' the number of collection centres to a number that can exist on the basis of demonstrated need. In response to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), one needs to take account of rural and remote areas. The collection of specimens in very remote areas tends to be done by general practitioners. One needs to take account of the particular circumstances in the honourable member's electorate. Pathology is an industry. As was indicated by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), there are kickbacks. There are entrepreneurial practices that operate in relation to this industry that the Government needs to take action on. This legislation recognises the reality of the provisions of pathology services. It recognises that there must be a reasonable relationship between the number of pathologists working for a laboratory and the number of services being provided by the laboratory. It is clear that the uncontrolled proliferation of collection centres is a major element in generating unacceptable levels of pathology services without any necessary clinical justification. Collection centres are effectively an extra link in the chain between the doctorpatient contact and the taking of a specimen. As such, they are by and large an unnecessary cost in that chain. The Government has taken the necessary action at a number of levels to ensure that the industry is more efficient; that we reduce the exponential rate of services in this area to a more acceptable level; that, generally, the costs are more fairly distributed; and that the system as such will operate more effectively within the whole health system. I indicate that there is one amendment to the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment (No.2) Bill 1991, which was referred to by the honourable member for Lowe. That amendment, which I will move on behalf of the Government, will be in line with the suggestion made by the Opposition.
