Our opportunity to demonstrate bipartisan what been limited under the Howard government gest that it is impossible for Labor to show public attention to the dismal record of the Australian shipping industry.

There is agement and interest in an Australian shipping we appreciate, has always been at the leading form, an active participant in organisations garded as a constructive contributor to the of international standards in the maritime government that important leadership role the same respect in the international maritime union circles.

The problem is that under the Howard has been undermined and we no longer command industry-be it in government, employer or fleet-as is well known in the Australian cities but also in inland Australia-has unfortuthat this is a disgrace given the pivotal role of Australian fleet and support industries are the following reasons. We require such a safe and of our environment from unsafe shipping. We need skilled merchant marine to support our defence with a large degree of uncertainty in our own such as East Timor, Indonesia, Papua New Those are just a few of the difficult challenges in terms of defence and our requirement to not only to manage the democratic way of life questions about ensuring our ports and seaways that we have the capacity to encourage NA Wednesday, 5 February 2003 jobs growth in Australian maritime industry growth by ensuring that Australian industry on an equal playing field.
