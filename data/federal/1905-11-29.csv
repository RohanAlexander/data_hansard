10,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I move That this House dissents from the ruling of Mr Deput] Speaker, that an honourable member is not entitled to repeat an argument already used by another honourable member in the same debate. I consented to the postponement of this motion yesterday, because I had no desire to interfere with the arrangement entered into between Ministers and other honourable members with regard to certain business. I think, however, that the matter should be disposed of today. The ruling to which I take exception was given during the debate upon the proposed new standing orders. Whilst I was speaking, the Deputy Speaker, with whom I regret to have to disagree, called me to order for repeating an argument which had been already, used by another honourable member in the same debate. He referred to standing order 276, which reads as follows: The Speaker or the Chairman of Committees may call the attention of the House, or the Committee, as the case may be, to continued irrelevance or tedious repetition, or the taking up of time by a speech of such unwarrantable length as to obstruct the business on the part of a member, and may direct such member to discontinue his speech. I should like to draw attention to the fact that no question of irrelevance or tedious repetition was involved, but that a broad ruling was given in the terms I have indicated. I respectfully submit that when the Deputy Speaker gave his decision he was under a misapprehension as to the ruling. which you, sir, had already given. You were very careful in giving the ruling recorded at page 5366 of Hansard, to point out that so far as repetition of argument was concerned, it was the duty of honourable members to avoid the repetition of arguments used by other honourable members in the same way during the same debate. Further on you saidMany honourable members will probably lect a ruling I gave some two or three years when, I think, the consideration of the Tariff was drawing to a conclusion. A letter which had vanced. been written concerning the Tariff was read two or three times by different honourable members, and I ruled, understanding order 276, that letter having already been read more than I could not allow honourable members to repeat it in the same relation. In your rulings on this point, you have specially pointed out that honourable memSpeaker, bers are not entitled to repeat arguments in the same way that they have been used by other honourable members or in the same name. relation. I presume that if an honourable member pointed out that-two and two make four,. and that another honourable member did the same thing, and still another followed his example, you would be enthe titled under the Standing Orders to call upon the third member to refrain in from repeating arguments viously in the same way, and in it the same relation. If, however, decision of the Deputy Speaker that no honourable member is entitled to repeat arguments already used is to hold good, bate will be seriously hampered. For stance, the Prime Minister is frequent!y absent from the Chamber attending to pubentirely blocked. lic business outside this House, and it maybe desirable, upon his return to the Chamthing ber, to repeat an argument used sence. Under the ruling of the Deputy Speaker., however, it would be impossible to adopt, that course. Further, we know that in connection with important matterssuch as. for example, the second reading of a Bill-the first five or s.ix speakers sent most of the arguments that can advanced for or against the measure. Under such circumstances, those who were nor lucky enough to be included amongst first five or six honourable members to catch Mr Speaker's eye. would be denied an portunity of putting their views before public, and before their constituents.  tion of that in connection with the request by representatives of country districts revision of the fodder duties. used the same arguments.",13
11,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Yes . and upon that casion, it was very necessary that the ments emploved by them should be driven home. At that particular crisis in our hishonorable members 'w>as prohibited. tory it was most important that the representatives of rural constituencies should have a full opportunity of giving expression to their opinions. In conclusion, I recolshould like to point out that time after ago, time the necessity arises for repeating arguments which have been previously adWe all know that many lawyers find it is only by constant repetition that the they are able to establish their case before once, a jury. Whilst it may be necessary to put into operation the standing order to prevent irrelevancy and tedious repetition, I submit that the Tilling of Mr Deputy if adhered to, will prove inimical to the best interests of debate in this House. I therefore move the motion standing in my",14
12,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I second the motion, because I feel that it is desirable that this question shouM be discussed. If ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker is applied generally to the conduct of business this Chamber, it must necessarily reduce used preour proceedings to an absolute farce. If is disorderly for one honourable member to the use an argument that has previously been employed-no t by himself, but by some other honourable, member-it seems to me dethat not only will discussion of any measure inbe confined to a very limited number of speakers, but, in some instances, it will be",14
13,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It would be a terrible if honourable members were confined in his abto new arguments, I suppose?",14
14,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Every honourable member will feel the effect of the ruling to which I have referred. I have been looking through the pages of Hansard with a view to ascertaining if there be anyprenotable exception, and I find that there is be scarcely a member of this Chamber, who, at some time or other, has not employed arguments which have been previously used the either by himself or other honourable members. Upon some questions there may posopsibly be only two or three main arguments the which can be advanced, either for or against them. I can easily conceive that the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker be upheld, one honourable member may rise, for a and put forward all those main arguments, They all and by so doing absolutely prevent any further discussion of the question at issue. ocAs a matter of fact, under the ruling to arguwhich I allude, even a reference to arguments which had been advanced by other It seems to me that if a question is to be discussed at all, it is impossible for it to be fairly debated without honourable members referring to arguments which have been already used, and, perhaps, for purposes of clearness and emphasis, repeating them. It is easy to imagine that a proposed law which is advocated by honourable members upon one side of the House may be opposed by the first speaker upon the other side of the Chamber, on the ground of its injustice. The injustice which it would inflict may be the central argument upon which the whole opposition to the proposal rests. Does anyone suggest that because the first honourable member-wh o has been fortunate enough to catch Mr Speaker's eye-ha s used that' argument in opposition to the proposal, other honourable members ought to be prevented from employing it? It is due, not only to the members of the House, but to their constituents, mouth - piece they are, that they should have the freest right to express their opinions upon a matter of that kind, even though they might feel called upon to repeat arguments which had already been adduced. If it were not so, it must be clear to anybody who considers the matter, even from a superficial stand-point, that a Presiding Officer who was disposed to be tyrannical would be vested with power to effectually "" gag "" every honourable member. That condition of things ought not to obtain in a free Parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker relied, in support of his action, upon the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. Hi's supposed authority is to be found on page 300 of May's Parliamentary Practice, which says, in relation to irrelevance or repetitionA member who resorts to persistent irrelevance may, under Standing Order No. 24, be directed by the Speaker or the Chairman to discontinue his speech, after the attention of the House has been called to the conduct of the honourable memberIt will be seen there that the attention of the House has first to be called to the conduct of the member who is guilty of persistent irrelevance. May continuesand akin to irrelevancy is the frequent repetition of the same arguments, whether of the arguments of the member speaking, or the arguments of other members; an offence which may be met by the power given to the Chairman under Standing Order No. 24. It will be observed that there is a very important qualification imposed by the introduction of the word "" frequent."" My reading of the standing order in question is that it is not disorderly to repeat an argument which has previously been used either by the same speaker or by another honourable member; but it is disorderly to frequently repeat it. That is an important qualification, which appears to have been entirely lost sight of in the Deputy Speaker's ruling. It seems to me that the standing order of the House of Commons does not preclude reference to arguments which have been used by other honourable members, nor the repetition of an argument which the speaker himself has previously used. What it does preclude is the frequent repetition of the same argument. Turning to page 828 of the appendix of May, I find the following, which deals with the question of irrelevance or repetition :(27th November, 1882, and 28th February, 1888) That Mr Speaker or the Chairman, after having whose called the attention of the House or of the Committee to the conduct of a member who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own arguments or of the arguments used by other members in the debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech. In this connection, I say that we have a standing order- I refer to standing order No. 276-whic h gives Mr Speaker power to deal with honourable members who are guilty of tedious repetition. And there was no necessity under the circumstances to fall back upon the British House of Commons procedure, unless it was desired by the Chair to arrogate powers which the Standing Orders did not confer or contemplate. But May's Parliamentary Practice does not support the Deputy Speaker's attitude. In the quotation whifch I have just made, it will be noted that the word "" repetition "" is again qualified by the word ""tedious."" Tedious repetition, I take it, means more than one repetition. Indeed, itt means more than one repetition by the same person. .From both these readings it seems that a reasonable interpretation of the standing order is that an honourable member may use an argument which has been previously employed by another honourable member irrespective of whether he does so designedly or as the result of inadvertence. But it is clearly disorderly for him to indulge in tedious repetition of that argument-in other words, to say the same thing over and over again. If it were not so, it would be useless to debate any question, because two or three honourable members might virtually advance all the main arguments either for or against any specific proposal,",14
15,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That would be "" hard luck.""",16
16,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Such a ruling would, therefore, operate very unjustly. The honourable member for Bland himself might be excluded from speaking under such circumstances. He might spend a considerable amount of time consulting-authorities in the library in order that he might be qualified to address himself to a certain question, and yet he might be denied an opportunity to give expression to his ideas; because ing his absence some one else had forestalled him and employed the arguments he intended to employ. He might attend in this Chamber with the intention of delivering an important speech- a speech which not only concerned the House and his constituents, but the country at large, and which by virtue of its importance ought to go before the country. But under the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, he might be absolutely prevented from delivering that speech, and consequently the pearls of wisdom which might otherwise have flowed from his lips would be lost to the present generation and to posterity. I am not arguing this question from any sense of personal ill-usage. I am eliminating the personal element entirely, and viewing the matter simply from the stand-point of reason and justice. It seems to me that if the ruling of the Deputy Speaker be enforced within such narrow limits, the proceedings of this House as, a deliberative assembly will be reduced to an absolute farce.",16
17,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," Apparently , some honourable members are anxious to decide this quesfion-whic h is one of far-reaching importance-withou t any debate whatever. It is with considerable diffidence that I address myself to the motion, and I can assure honourable members that they will not facilitate its early settlement if I am interrupted at the outset. think it is a pity that the members of the Government, who should be the constitutional guardians of the liberties of honourable members, have not addressed themselves to this question with a view to showing whether or not, in their opinion, the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, if upheld, would curtail those liberties.",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I happened to rise when the honourable member did.,16
19,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Then I shall make my' speech as brief as possible, in oider that my honourable and learned friend may have an opportunity to deal with the question. Some references have been made to English' precedents in connection, not with this ruling, but with rulings which you, Mr. Speaker, have given, and which, on the occasion in question, appear to have been followed under a misapprehension. I maintain, first of all, that in a House of this size, English precedents should not concern us.  dur- member say, again and again,; that we ought to accept this and that ""because it is English.""",16
20,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"In this regard, at all events, I am a convert to, the views of the honourable member. I think that he will agree that in a Chamber so large as is the House of Commons it would be impossible to give that liberty of speech which should be extended to members of so small an assembly as this is. If we had 600 or 700 members of this House, each exercising his opportunities to speak, obviously no business could be transacted; but we have only seventy-five members, and the difficulty of properly representing the sparselypopulated constituencies of this great continent are such that every honourable member should be given complete freedom to express the views of his constituents. While I.should be the first to admit that % to repeat over and over again arguments used by previous speakers would be to take an undue liberty in a House of this character, I cannot agree with the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker that to repeat an argument which has been used, it may be only once or twice, by a previous speaker must necessarily be out of' order. What would be the position if that ruling were upheld'? An honourable member, hostile 1 to the question at issue, might easily forestall another who wished to put a certain question in a serious way before the House, and, having forestalled him, I he might take a point of order that arguments already used by him were being repeated.",16
21,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The second speaker could not even agree with him by saying, ""hear, hear.""",16
22,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That also would be out of order. It would be absurd if one honourable member could feebly state an argument in order to shut out its proper statement by another. That is one reason why I feel that the House should dissent from this ruling. There is another consideration, and it is a constitutional one, which concerns all honourable members alike. Rulings from the Chair are designed not only to maintain order but to facilitate business, and all business in this House must be conducted upon a representative basis-the basis on which we hold our seats. That being so, it is clear that any ruling which aims at the root of the representative basis upon which we hold our seats in this Chamber should not be upheld. Let us consider the position which must arise if this ruling be accepted. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra has a large number of constituents who have entrusted him with their representation in this House. Rightly or wrongly, they think that no other representative should be left to voice their views. The honourable member for Melbourne, for example, might be able to put the views of the electors of Illawarra with even greater forcefulness than could the honourable and learned member representing that constituency. But I hold that the electors of that constituency are ithe only people entitled to judge of that matter. If this ruling be upheld, it is clear that the rights of the constituencies will be interfered with. That is the principal grounH upon which I support this motion. I trust that the Government will give us that assistance which we are entitled to expect from them in dealing with it. As this ruling must necessarily affect all parties, the House should endeavour to forget the rancour or feeling under which it has been labouring for some time, and deal with the question in a dispassionate way.",16
23,Mr FISHER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Mr Speaker will deal with it.,17
24,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Unfortunately he will not. If he would, I should be perfectlysatisfied. The question will be put to the House, and I therefore ask honourable members to deal with it in a judicial manner. The question with which we are concerned relates not to the past, but to the future. Let us divest ourselves of any of those bitternesses which necessarily resulted from the all-night sittings on. the occasion on which this ruling was given. If that be done, honourable members will recognise that this ruling, if upheld, must seriously curtail the liberties of the House, and will therefore support the motion of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra.",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I trust that the motion will not be assented to, more especially if its acceptance is to involve the adoption of the views that have been urged in support of it. If each honourable member, because he represents a different constituency, is to be entitled to repeat the same argument for the sake of his constituents",17
26,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Not necessarily in the same way.,17
27,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If every honourable member is to be permitted to repeat his own arguments, and those of others, ad infinitum, debate will be at an end, and Parliament will cease to be.",17
28,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,We do not object to that.,17
29,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"E v i d e n t l y . The corporate existence of Parliament in those circumstances would be destroyed. We should have a gathering of irresponsible individuals, whose places in this respect might be supplied by so many gramophones or phonographs which, without the exertion of physical force, could keep on repeating what had' already been said. The contention of those who have supported the motion would reduce the proceedings of the House to chaos. Here, as in the House of Commons, the unlimited right of an honourable member to repeat his own arguments, or those of others, would lead to absolute paralysis of business. Are we compelled to choose between a doctrine of that character and the ruling now submitted' to us? I regret! that the motion, as proposed, appears not to truly represent the actual position.",17
30,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It was submitted to Mr . Deputy Speaker, and was fixed up by him.",17
31,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is scarcely correct.,17
32,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not wish to dispute that point. But surely honourable members will agree that the consideration of this ruling requires us to have regard to the time, the place, and the moment of its deliverance. No one would say that in no Circumstances should an honourable member be permitted to repeat his own arguments, or those of another to which he desired to replv. Such a ruling, if not fatal to debate, would seriously cripple it. I venture to submit that when we look at the time and circumstances of the ruling, we shall find that arguments were being repeated with the object of convincing no one, elucidating nothing, advancing nothing. Their sole object was to occupy the time of the House. That is absolutely forbidden in express terms by the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and is also forbidden by one of our own Standing Orders, although its terms are less explicit. In these circumstances the ruling that that was not the time or the occasion on which an honourable member was justified in repeating his own arguments, or those of others, was a proper one. Everything depends upon the time, the place, and the circumstances.",17
33,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That - is a very poor answer.,18
34,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I defy the honourable member, or any one else, to state the conditions under which every standing order is to be applied in all conceivable circumstances. That would be impossible. In this matter, .as in relation to everything else, we have to trust to the good sense of the House, or to the judgment of Mr. Speaker, or the Chairman, as the case may be. Mr Speaker, or the Chairman, takes all .the facts of each situation into account, and it is for him to say, in the particular circumstances, whether or not repetition is justifiable. A re-statement of arguments either for the purpose of giving a bona fide answer, or an explanation- a re-statement made not from a desire to occupy time, but to clear up some point that had been submitted-woul d not fall within this ruling.",18
35,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I submit that it would.,18
36,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I beg to differ from the honourable member, and to assert that the ruling places no limitation upon debate that has not been already imposed by Mr Speaker, and, indeed, by our own Standing Orders. Our Standing Orders, properly read, and the rulings of Mr Speaker, as I have heard them, properly understood, imply that while there are times and places at which, a re-statement of an argument is absolutely necessary, and is in many other cases justifiable, there are also times and places in which it is absolutely unnecessary. If Mr. Speaker and the Chairman are not to interpose in such circumstances, and, with the weight of their independence and mature judgment are not to guide us, for what do we require a Speaker or Chairman? Do we expect the Standing Orders to operate automatically? Do we not intend that they shall be applied by Mr Speaker and the Chairman according to the problem that happens to be submitted to them. It appears, therefore, that the fair and reasonable view is that the ruling having regard to the circumstances in which it was given was absolutely right; and that, while in other circumstances it would not apply, that fact does not detract from its soundness. I venture to assert that it would be impossible for Mr Speaker in any ruling, to define all the circumstances in which such' a ruling should be accepted absolutely, qualified in some particulars, or rejected. I take no exception to the submission of this motion, and certainly none to the way in which it was put before the House. It was dealt with argumentatively, and as briefly as possible. But I take a different view of the ruling from that which the honourable and learned member for illawarra has adopted. He has read it as applying absolutely at all times, to all honourable members in all debates. My reading of it is that it applies only to the time and place and debate in respect of which it was given. In such circumstances, it was right. In others it might have been wrong. On a general principle our Standing Orders condemn repetition or irrelevance, as do the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, When repetition becomes irrelevant, tedious, or useless!, whena point has been made and sufficiently enforced, Mr Speaker or the Chairman must be allowed to intervene to enable public business to be transacted. We must trust them to interpose at the right moment to prevent abuse of the forms of the House and loss of public time. I submit that under the circumstances cf the case Mr Deputy Speaker took the proper course, and should be upheld by the House.",18
37,Mr ROBINSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," As the Prime Minister is of opinion that no exception can be taken to the submission of the motion, I shall not debate that aspect of the question; but I wish to say, as briefly as may be, that I think he has evaded the question before the Chair. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra asks the House to dissent from the ruling that an honourable member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has already been used by another honourable member. The Prime Minister said that when there has been tedious repetition of an argument for the purpose of delaying business, it is within your province, Mr. Speaker, or that of the Chairman, as the case may be, to as.k an honourable member to discontinue his speech. T do not think any one could take exception to such a ruling. But the ruling which we are challenging is quite different. It is given on page 5370 of Hansard, in the following words:The ruling was that our rules prevent an honourable member from repeating an argument which has been previously used. Then, again, on page 537 r, Mr Deputy Speaker is reported to have saidMy ruling was that an honourable member would be guilty of irrelevance or repetition were to use arguments used by an honourable member previously in the same debate. Therefore, it was twice stated that it is not within the province of an honourable member to repeat arguments used by another honourable member. Not a word was said about circumstances, time, place, and conditions, nor were any of the qualifications added which the Prime Minister has introduced. If Mr Deputv Speaker had ruled that an honourable member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used by a dozen previous speakers, when it is obvious that the repetition is for the purpose of delaying business, 1 should have supported the ruling, and opposed the motion. That, however, is not the ruling which was given, and the motion of dissent asks the House not to allow the hard-and-fast rule to be laid down by - Mr Deputy Speaker that, once an argument has been used, it cannot be used again by another speaker.  ""gag-""",18
38,Mr ROBINSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"To enforce such a ruling would be a most iron-handed proceeding. We shall) shortly be dealing with certain clauses of the Trade Marks Bill, the arguments in regard to which will revolve round the point whether what is known as boycotting will result from the passing of those clauses. The same arguments will be repeated over and over again, though presented in different ways, and it is necessary for the information of the public that they should be so repeated. But, under the ruling which I have read, no honourable member would be entitled to address himself to the subject after, say, two speeches had been delivered on each side of the Chamber. I do not object to any reasonable prohibition of repetition, and would strongly support any ruling against unreasonable repetition; but' when an officer of the House rules that a member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used only once before-whic h was the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker in so many words-it is the duty of those who differ to express dissent in the manner provided for in the rules of the House. The Prime Minister has admitted that repetition is sometimes desirable, though at other times it is not desirable. But, having admitted that it is under some circumstances desirable, it is his duty to vote for the motion, because the motion dissents from the ruling that repetition of an if he argument which has been used only once is not permissible. I intend to support the motion, because no reply has been made to the contention of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, whilst the speech of the Prime Minister evaded and clouded the real issue, by introducing qualifications and limitations which were not used in the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker, and were not mentioned during the debate. The rulings referred to by the honourable and learned member as given by Mr Speaker seemed to me to be supported by May and all the leading parliamentary authorities, and to such rulings, of course, we all bow.",19
39,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Will the honourable and learned member read mv original ruling?,19
40,Mr ROBINSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is as follows:Mr Speaker has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honourable member who is addressing the House, but also of .1 re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honourable member was making has already been made by other.honourable members, I ask him not to repeat it. Then follows the re-statement of the rulings which I have already read. The discussion of a motion of this kind presents difficulties to honourable members, but unless the ruling is cut down to make it accord with the practice stated in May and by Mr Speaker, I shall feel it my duty to vote to dissent from it. I shall do so with regret, but I feel that it is more necessary to get rid of a wrong ruling than to avoid giving pain to an honourable member, however high a position he may hold in the House.",19
41,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I do not wish to discuss the question raised by the Prime Minister, whether, under the circumstances, Mr Deputy Speaker was entitled to call upon an honourable member to discontinue his speech. That would be so much a matter of opinion, depending largely upon one's knowledge of what occurred, that I do not think the honourable and learned member for Illawarra would feel justified in occupying time by asking the House 9 to discuss it. Mr Deputy Speaker, however, gave the ruling from which we are asked to dissent deliberately and after consideration, and if we allow it to stand, or assent to it, it will most seriously limit debate on important occasions. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra was using a certain argument when Mr. Deputy Speaker saidThat argument has been mentioned by a previous speaker.",19
42,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I submit that whether the argument has been put before the House by another honourable member or not, I am not debarred from using it.",20
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Mr Speaker has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honourable member who is addressing the House, but also of a re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honourable member was making has already been made by other honourable members, I ask him not to repeat it. That ruling, I think, goes very little further than the House of Commons practice, though it must be remembered that the standing order of the House of Commons specifically refers to the arguments of other honourable members, while ours does not. If it had remained at that, I would let it pass, because the circumstances would explain it, but when the honourable and learned member for Werriwa moved! to dissent from the ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker said I rule that the honourable and learned member's statement of his dissent is but of order. It does not correctly represent my ruling. further on he said- I should like to point out that the dissent expressed in writing by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa does not correctly state the effect of my ruling. The ruling wasThen follows this re-statement of it in more explicit terms, after consideration, and the moving of a motion of dissent, in which it had been wrongly expressedThat our rules prevent an honourable member from repeating an argument which has been previously used. That means that, if an argument has been used by any honourable member, it cannot be used by another. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra then said I have put my dissent in the following form r "" I dissent from the ruling of the Deputy Speaker that an honourable membeT is not entitled to use an argument already used by another honourable member."" Mr Deputy Speaker would not agree that that statement of his ruling was correct. Mr MCCay. Dissent [REPRESENTATIVES.] jrom Speaking of the honourable and learned member, he saidThe terms he has used in his protest scarcely express the effect of the ruling. I will give the honourable member an opportunity to put his protest in proper form if he so desires. My ruling was that an honourable member would be guilty of irrelevance or repetition if he were to use arguments used by an honourable member previously in the same debate. So that the final statement of his ruling by Mr Deputy Speaker, was that, to use arguments previously used by another honourable member in the same debate, would be to be guilty of irrelevance or repetition. There is nothing to limit or qualify or mitigate the absolute generality and severity of the ruling. If an honourable member uses an argument, no other honourable member can use it in the same debate, without being guilty of irrelevance and repetition. I do not know how it could be irrelevant, and presumably repetition is the offence. I think that even the Deputy Speaker will admit that his ruling is expressed in too general terms. It was expressed at a trying time, when a good deal of difficulty was being experienced, and I submit that there are some very important limitations to be placed upon it. So far as I am concerned, if this House were to become seized of the fact that the ruling was not of that broad, drastic, general character that its words implied, I should be satisfied. I should be very loth to vote for any mo- Hon dissenting from the ruling of the Chair under any circumstances. I believe that the Chair should be supported to the utmost of our power; but it is because the ruling in question is so broad and sweeping in its character that I feel bound to direct attention to the fact that it is, on the whole, a deliberate decision, which makes no reference to any particular circumstances. I imagine that the honourable and learned member for I llawarra would be satisfied if he were informed that there were unexpressed limitations connected with the ruling. I do not see how the House could support it in its present broad form. I trust that we shall receive some intimation that it is not meant to be construed - to mean as much as it says, and that we may be able to avoid the necessity of voting either by way of assent or dissent upon a ruling given, as I freely admit, under circumstances of some difficulty.  this as a non-party question. The position of the Opposition today may be occupied by us next week, and I look upon the mofied tion as a most serious one. Although I reluctant to question the Deputy Speaker's ruling, I realise that the privileges of honourable members must be maintained all costs. I would refer honourable members back to the time when a severe drought afflicted nearly all parts of Australia, and members representing outlying districts all the States, with the exception of Westshall, ern Australia, had to use precisely the same arguments in support of a remission of the fodder duties. If the Chaitman had ruled that after the second orable member had spoken, the arguments previously used must not be repeated, the whole debate would have been stifled. Then, again, in the case of the discussion on the Orient mail contract, many honordisposed able members on both sides of the used the same arguments, although they may not have been couched in exactly the same words. If you, sir, had put a stop to that discussion on the ground that honorlit able members must not repeat the arguovercome ments already used by others,' we should have all felt very much aggrieved. course the circumstances under which the. ruling in question was given were quite exceptional. I must confess that heard it given, I regarded it as one most extraordinary that I had ever of,. I am sure the sense of the House is entirely against the idea that an honorsince able member should be debarred from rewrong peating an argument previously used by another speaker. However careful honorpeat able members might be in their efforts avoid a conflict with the Chair, such ing would have the effect of stifling bate. Many honourable members have prehad pared second-reading speeches, and have failed to catch the Speaker's eye until the debate has proceeded at some length. They have then found that many of their arguments have been anticipated, and that the ground has to some extent been cut from under their feet. If , under such circumstances ? conditions, you, sir, were to rule that the House could not listen to me, for stance, merely because I was repeating arguments that had been previously employed, I should_ consider that were dealing with me very trarily. F o r the reasons I stated I think we should be very careful to guard our privileges. I am ready to pay due respect to the Deputy Chairman, who may think that he was perfectly justiin the ruling he gave. If, however, he am made a mistake, it would be well for him to acknowledge it, and to allow the matter to rest there. If the motion is pressed, I at shall have to 'vote for it.",20
44,Mr GB EDWARDS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"South Sydney). - It seems to me that during the last few minutes we have drifted into a very serious in position. If we negative the motion we in effect, affirm in its bald outline the ruling of the Deputy Speaker. I think we should pause before we adopt that course, as it would carry us further than honany honourable member would desire to go. By supporting the Deputy Speaker in his ruling, we shall affirm a principle which may Jiave the most serious effect upon our debates. I should like to see the motion of by means of some amendment, House or by some statement of the Deputy Speaker to the effect that his ruling, which was given in the heat of debate, went further than on calmer consideration he thinks ought to have gone. It would be better to the difficulty in some such manner, rather than to negative the motion, and thus Of affirm a most dangerous principle.",21
45,Mr CONROY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," As one of those who raised a protest at the time that when I the ruling was given, I must say of the that I do not think that the Deputyknown Speaker intended it to be construed in the broad sense in which it has been interpreted. It would be clearly for us to affirm the principle that no honourable member should be entitled to rean argument that had been previously to used. In justice to the Deputy Speaker, I a rulmust say that I understood his ruling as deconveying what was said by him after. I wthdrawn my opposition. In the heat of debate, I should not have been likelv to withdraw my opposition if I had understood the ruling as it is now construed.",21
46,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Did not the honourable and learned member understand the ruling to apply to the particular occasion and the . Mr CONROY - I am quite willing to' inaccept the Deputy Speaker's assurance to that effect. At the time, I certainly understood the ruling to mean what was implied you iii the statement made by the Deputy arbiSpeaker, as recorded at page 5369 of Hanhave sard, and I think that a. few words of explanation from the honourable gentleman will entirely remove all apprehension on the subject. It would not be possible for us to carry on our proceedings under the ,'ame rules as to limitation of debate, as might with propriety be applied to an unified Parliament. A statement may gain considerable weight by repetition, owing to the fact that honourable members represent so many different States, and so many different sections of the electors of the Commonwealth. No disadvantage could attach to allowing one honourable member after another to speak in the same strain upon such a subject, for instance, as the remission of fodder duties in a time of drought. The very multiplicity of statements might afford the best possible ground for interfering with the Tariff, and dislocating trade arrangements. Therefore, the repetition of argument in certain cases may be desirable, and in keeping with a strictly relevant discussion. If the ruling were interpreted in the strictest sense, the representation of the States might be to a large extent stifled, and the citizens of those States would have to look to the Senate, instead of this House, lo protect their interests. I am bound to say that I understood the ruling to have particular reference to the time and to the circumstances under which it had been given.",21
47,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It was after the honourable ""and learned member had withdrawn his opposition that the ruling was given in its general form.",22
48,Mr CONROY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I certainly understood the ruling to have direct reference to the circumstances under which it was given. That being so, I could readily accept the Deputy Speaker's assurance that that was the case. The honourable member for Illawarra has already indicated his willingness to accept such an assurance. . Mr WATSON (Bland) - It seems to me that the possibility of the motion being rejected opens up a new prospect so far as some of the electors of the Commonwealth are concerned-particularl y those who happen to be pressmen or Hansard reporters.

I think -'' that the prospect to which I have re"" ferred, is one that we may well ponder over, and I am inclined to vote against the motion, purely from that point of view. One honourable member has suggested that probably I, as well as other honourable members might f all under the whip of the Deputy Speaker in this relation. That is quite possible. We have all sinned in some respects by repeating arguments which have been previously used in debate. That, however, is no excuse for deliberately laying ourselves out to repeat those arguments.  honourable member himself offended?",22
50,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The fact that I have offended is no reason why we should deliberately lay ourselves out to repeat arguments.,22
51,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The r e is nothing about' deliberately laying ourselves out to repeat arguments in this ruling.,22
52,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The trend of the argm ments used by honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber is that we shall be disadvantaged unless we are allowed to repeat arguments. That is not a justifiable attitude to assume so far as the House in its corporate capacity. is concerned. It is not a good thing that we should encourage the repetition of arguments in this House, whether by one man repeating himself or repeating the arguments of another honourable member.",22
53,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is not a question of "" encouraging,"" but of preventing repetition.",22
54,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If I had to choose between the two alternatives, I should Choose against repetition",22
55,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Because the honourable member speaks for the whole party which he leads when the caucus has decided upon a certain line of action. . Mr WATSON - The honourable member was closely associated with the Labour Party in New South Wales, when it was supporting the Government of which he was a member, long enough to know better than that. He knows that his statement is not correct.",22
56,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is the view that the honourable member wants to put forward.,22
57,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Except upon a very few matters, I am not entitled to speak for the party of which I happen to be the leader today. Certainly I do not speak for that party upon this question. I would suggest to the honourable member for Illawarra that, after all, we have the ruling of Mr Speaker upon this matter, and it seems to me that that is the only ruling to which effect is likely to be given, so far as this House is concerned. Leaving out of account the possibility of altering the standing order so as to make it more strict than it is, I take it that the ruling given by Mr Speaker several times during the debate of last week points to an insistence upon the repetition being ""tedious "" before an honourable member is ruled out of order. Irrespective of whether we carry or reject this motion, Mr Speaker's ruling will stand. I am content to leave the matter there. I would ask the honourable and learned' member for Illawarra to make some allowance for the fact that not only honourable members, but possibly Mr Deputy Speaker, may easily have been "" rattled "" to some extent by the experience to which the occupants of the Chair had been subjected owing to the action of the Opposition. Some allowance might fairly be claimed by each of us in respect of anything that was said during those weary hours.",22

59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"All this is ""tedious "" repetition.",23
60,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If that be so, I am quite willing to resume my seat. I would suggest that the honourable member should obWain an authoritative ruling upon the point which he has raised. In conclusion, I would urge the honourable and learned member for Illawarra to withdraw the motion.",23
61,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I think, sir, that perhaps I had better say a word or two in regard to this matter. In doing so, I desire to reciprocate the very hearty expressions of good-will which have fallen from the lips of the mover of this motion. I recognise at once the inherent right of every honourable member-and I should' be the last to interfere with itJ-t' o dissent from any ruling which may be given. I also feel that the decision of this House will be of a strictly impersonal and non-party character. In the first place, I should like briefly to relate the circumstances under which mv ruling was given Those circumstances must be taken into consideration, and I do not think some of the instances given are apposite. The adjournment of the debate had been moved, "" and several members had addressed to the motion. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra then rose to advance reasons in support of it. He spoke for some time, and then attempted to use the condition of the officers of the House as an argument in favour of the proposal to adjourn. I drew his attention to the fact that that argument had been previously used in the debate. I hive looked up Hansard, and I find that it was employed by two honourable members, namely, the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and the honourable member for Macquarie. I had a distinct recollection of it having been used, and I drew die attention of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra to that fact, but did not give anv ruling. He then asked whether the fact that an argument had been previously used by another honourable member would debar him from repeating it. I then gave my main ruling, which was not quoted by the honourable .and learned member for Wannon, but which was read by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. It is as follows:Mr Speaker has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honourable member who is addressing the House, but also of .a re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honourable member was making has already been made by other honourable members, I ask him not to repeat it. That ruling was at once questioned by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who handed me a dissent in writing, which I ruled out of order, because to mv mind it did not express the ruling which I had given, either fully, or even impartially. The honourable and learned member then withdrew his dissent, but in the meantime the honourable and learned member for Illawarra had prepared another. Between the period when I gave the ruling, and 'that at which the dissent was handed in, the matter had been referred to two or three times. There was a good deal of confusion prevailing, and directly the Hansard proofs were supplied to me, I noted th'aft where I used - o r intended t'o use-the plural, the singular had been employed by the reporter. Following the usual practice, had I considered it desirable. I would certainly have made my subsequent rulings honourable agree with the original ruling, by altering themselves the latter to the plural. That is the point to which the honourable and learned member for Corinella has alluded. When the honourable and learned member for Illawarra handed in his dissent, I felt that it did not express my ruling, and honourable members will recollect that I suggested at least one alteration in it. But 1 had another alteration in my mindan alteration to the use of the plural. As, however, the honourable and learned member was anxious that I should accept his dissent, I did so. At the same time, I feel that it does not express the original ruling which I gave. That ruling, I desire to say, was quite in accordance with the ruling of Mr Speaker, and also with the practice of the House of Commons.",23
62,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,It - involves a very dangerous restriction of libertv.,24
63,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am not responsible for that. The occupant of the Chair is bound by precedent just as much as hon- orable members themselves are bound by the Standing Orders. I feel, however, that the honourable and learned member for Illawarra believed-thoug h other honourable members did not-that in my ruling I had used the singular, and that I had stated that an honourable member would not be in order in repeating an argument which had been used by another honourable member.",24
64,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The honourable member approved of the terms of my dissent.,24
65,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I gave no ruling upon it. I said that it did not express my ruling. The honourable and learned member then asked in what respect it did not express it, and I told him that it did not contain the words "" in the same debate.""",24
66,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I altered it accordingly.,24
67,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That is so. But the honourable and learned member can understand that during a time of commotion it is not possible to take a note of everything. I did not feel satisfied with the form of his dissent then, and I certainly do not fee', satisfied with it now.",24
68,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Do I understand that the honourable member adheres to his first ruling?,24
69,Mr SALMON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Yes , to my original ing. I think that it should stand. I will frankly admit that I was in some doubt as to whether I had the power to refuse to accept the dissent of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra in the form in which he had drafted it. But he very kindlv agreed to alter it in one regard, and I feel sure that had the atmosphere been calm I would have requested him to amend it in another direction, and that probably he would have done so. '",24
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I hesitate to add to this debate, and should not have done so but for the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. If anything would induce me to advise the honourable and learned member for Illawarra to withdraw his motion it is the attitude which has been assumed towards it by the leader of the Labour Party, who even yet seems to be almost savage in his desire to stifle debate. I see no trace of his calming down upon that matter, even after having secured possibly the severe application of the closure rules to future debate. One would have thought that the honourable member would have been a little saner and calmer after his recent triumph. However, he still appears to catch at any straw which will justify him in stifling the arguments of opponents. As the honourable member for Macquarie interjected, that is all very well from the honourable member's point of view. Everybody knows that there has not been very much in the nature of repetitive arguments from the Labour corner recently, and really there has been no need for it. I should imagine that repetition on the part of honourable members sitting there goes on in quite another place, so that further repetition in the House is unnecessary. Consequently we find the honourable member for Bland voicing the opinions of the caucus, and scarcely any other honourable member of it giving utterance to the sentiments of the party. That may be a very commendable thing from the stand-point of party discipline, but it does not apply to other parties in the same way.",24
71,Mr BATCHELOR,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The honourable member himself was very dull when he sat in this corner last session.,24
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am not aware of it. I am afraid that I was not in the sense in which the honourable member is referring to the matter. However, I do not wish to talk about last session. We have quite enough to do in focussing rulour attention upon this session. While the honourable member for Bland was perfectly justified from his point of view in advancing the arguments that he did, and in catching at a mere straw thrown to the wind by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa in order to provide himself with some i'lstification for proceeding further to stifle debate. I think that a broader and saner view of the matter will show him that he is entirely wrong. The ruling of Mr. Deputy Speaker, if it be upheld, means neither more nor less than the application of another form of closure, even more direct and effective than any of the forms which have already been adopted by the House. I venture to submit that,the House has no intention of placing any such arbitrary power in the hands of any speaker, neither is there any constitutional justification for so doing. Certainly there is no authority for such a proceeding. When the honourable member for Laanecoorie rose to make his explanation, I expected that he would fit to modify in some way the attitude which he assumed upon the occasion to which allusion has been made. Instead of that, he finds fault with the drafting of the motion, and emphasizes his view as to the correctness of his ruling on the occasion referred to. He attempts to buttress his own ruling upon that occasion by the ruling given previously by Mr . Speaker in relation to the same question. Therein I think he makes a very great mistake. I draw a clear distinction between the unqualified statement of Mr Deputy Speaker arid the more qualified statements of Mr Speaker in relation to this point. When Mr Speaker gave his ruling, he pointed out that it was not in. order to repeat arguments to which utterance had already been given "" in the same way "" by other honourable members. Then, again, he used the qualifying words, "" in the same relation."" That makes a vital distinction.",24
73,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Does not Mr Deputy Speaker say that he withdraws everything in his ruling which varies from that by Mr . Speaker, upon which it was based, and also that he has been misreported.",25
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I did not hear the honourable member make that statement.,25
75,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"He said that the first ruling given by him was correct, but that those which followed, so far as they differ from it, were inaccurate.",25
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"He said in his first ruling that Mr Speaker has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honourable member who is addressing the House, but also of a re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him.",25
77,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"In that case it was simply said that repetition "" may "" consist of a re-statement. There was no mention of tedious repetition.",25
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That is so. Mr. Speaker went further, and said that arguments were not to be repeated in the same way and in the same relation. He meant; no doubt, that honourable members should not be permitted to continue droning out statements uttered in almost identical language by other honourable members. I do not cavil at Mr Speaker's ruling. It is a wise restriction to place upon debate. But I do not think that he intended to lay down the rule that there should be no repetition of argument in connection with any matter have seen before the Chair. Such a ruling would mean that only two or three honourable members would be permitted to speak on any question. There are certain well-defined lines of argument in connection with almost every debatable subject that comes before the House. Take the union label clauses of the Trade Marks Bill , with which we are to deal almost immediately. If an honourable member is not to advance arguments against the union label on the ground, for instance, that it may lead to boycotting, there will be little debate on the whole subject. When we come to discuss the union - label clauses, one or two arguments will form the staple of the whole of the opposition to them.",25

80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Perhaps that is why the honourable member wishes to clutch at this straw-to shut down debate,",25
81,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I thought that the honourable member had shot his bolt.,25
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I trust that the honourable member will rely upon the "" gag"" which he already possesses rather than try to bring another "" g a g "" to bear through the mediumi of Mr Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees. Unless reasonable latitude be allowed in the repetition of the main arguments relating to any question, 'we may as well have no further debate. I take it that the qualifying words used by Mr Speaker, in delivering 'the ruling to which ^reference has been made, cause it to differ in a vital degree from the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker. It may be that we should have regard to the circumstances in which the ruling was given, and under which debate had taken place; but, making every allowance for those circumstances, I do not consider that the explanation Mr Deputy Speaker has given has made it one whit clearer or more favourable from his point of view. Since hearing the speech made by the honourable member for Bland, I am more averse than ever to this motion being pushed to a vote, inasmuch as it is clear that, irrespective of 'the consequences that may happen when he is on this side, and struggling againsf great odds, as we appear to be doing, he is ready to give his support to anv proposal that will have the effect of curtailing debate. I hope, therefore, now that the matter has been ventilated-and particularly as we have recognised the difference between the qualifying words used by Mr Speaker, and those used by Mr Deputv Speaker-w e shall not proceed to a division, but allow the matter to remain in the hands of Mr Speaker, and trust to his wisdom and guidance in future debate.",25

84,Mr JOHNSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Unde r this ruling, the honourable member would be absolutely shut out. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have millions of imitators, but very few original thinkers. If we were precluded from following the language and ideas that have been expressed by others for thousands of years, no honourable member could make a speech. I have heard little originality in this House, and it seems to me that it is essential to our well-being that there should be repetition. The present is only an evolutionary repetition of the past. ruling, if upheld, would cause the Oppo-. sition to give up hope, I feel that I should support Mr Deputy Speaker, but having regard to the rights and liberties of the House, I feel that I ought to support the action of the honourable member for Iliawarm. On this question, therefore, I am a ""Yes-No"" man, and I therefore trust that the motion will not be pressed. If it is, I shall have to think very seriously, and that is what I do not wish to do. In this country everything prospers, but no one thinks, and that is what I do not wish to be called upon to do.",26
85,Mr FULLER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I regret that so much time has been occupied in discussing the motion, but feel that the way in which it has been received affords ample justification for my action in submitting it. In view of the statement made by Mr Deputy Speaker, that his original ruling is correct, and that those which followed are hardly in accordance with that which he intended, I think that I ought not to press the motion.

If contending parties have fought before the Registrar, they are not likely to be satisfied with the decision of the Law Officer, who, whether he be the Attorney-General or the Crown Solicitor, may not necessarily be an expert in trade marks law.

97,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not object to amend clause 45 to make it read, "" If either party desires,"" instead of "" If both parties consent.""",27
98,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I think that the appellant from the Registrar's decision should have the right to say to whom he will appeal. The simplest thing to do is to allow an appeal direct to the Court from the Registrar in the case of opposed applications Under the English law, the decision of the Registrar is subject to appeal to the Court, or, with the consent of the parties, to the Board of Trade, which is the exact opposite of the provision in the Bill .",27
99,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The effect of ' amending clause 45, as I suggest, would be to make our law similar to the English law. Mr . MCCAY - I think that it would be better to provide that any party aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar may appeal to the Court direct, or, if both parties consent, to the Law Officer.",27
100,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The decision of the Board of Trade is final.,27
101,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Yes . In England there is only one appeal from the decision of the Registrar-to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the Board of Trade. I suggest to the Attorney-General that we should provide for only one appeal here-to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the Law Officer. I do not think that the Law Officer would have much to do under such circumstances. In my opinion, it is undeLaw sirable to have an intermediate stage.",27
102,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . have obtained a special report on this subject, which supports me in the opinion that, if it were provided that all cases should be taken to the Court, the result would be that in trivial matters a man would have either to abide by a decision of the Registrar, at which he felt aggrieved, or to undertake very expensive litigation.",27
103,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I think that in ninety-nine cases out of 100, the decision of the Registrar will be as good as that of the Law Officer.",27
104,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It may or it may not be. I think that the case will be met if we provide, in clause 45, that if either partu desires, the appeal may be direct to the Court. I do not think that both the parties should be forced to the Court.",27
105,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I did not suggest that. I suggested that if both parties consented, they might appeal to the Law Officer.",27
106,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I could understand that arrangement if the decision of the Law Officer were final; but I think it would be almost a nullity to make it so.,28
107,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The appellant may wish to go to the Law Officer, and the other partu to the Court. ' Mr ISAACS - I would give either party the right to appeal to the Court direct. It must be remembered, however, that if they appeal to the Supreme Court, there is a possibility of a further appeal to the High Court. If the appeal in the first instance is to the Law Officer, the party who loses may agree to end the proceedings, as he has not lost very much; but if the appeal is to the Court, and the decision carries heavy costs, there will be an inducement for the losing party to proceed still further. I think that we should allow applicants to avail themselves of the cheapest procedure, and that we shall go far enough if we provide that, if either desires, the appeal shall be to the Court.",28
108,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I think that the honourable and learned member for Corinella should be satisfied with the arrangement suggested by the Attorney-General. I am almost prepared to leave the clause as it stands. I would not put it in the power of one party to say that he would not use the Law Officer. It must be remembered that the Court referred to is the Supreme Court of Victoria, or the High Court, and, probably, parties in a distant State like Western Australia would not like to be dragged to Victoria.",28
109,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,They would be dragged to Victoria if the appeal were to the Law Officer.,28
110,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,But that appeal would be a much more simple affair than an appeal to the Court.,28

118,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I wish' to know whether sub-clause 2 is in its proper place? I do not see what the question of entry of name has to do with the assignment or equities arising in connection with an assignment. This sub-clause appears to have crept into the wrong place. After reading the first sub-clause, I should never have suspected the presence of subclause 2, because it does not seem to have anything to do with the rights of a registered proprietor as to assignment. Subclause 3, although connected with subclause 1, is not quite properly-placed in the clause. , Sub-clause 2 should come reunder the part of the Bill headed ""Registrable Trade Marks.""",28
119,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"This clause deals with effective registration. If a man has a name as part of the trade mark, it is provided that the registration shall not affect the rights of an owner of the same name.",28

121,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It has nothing to do with assignment, but deals with the effect of registration. Registration does not give the proprietor of the trade mark exclusive right to the name, which forms a part of it. I do not know of any better place to insert the sub-clause.",28
122,Mr LONSDALE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"New England) The contention of the honourable and learned member ifor Corinella with regard to sub-clause 2 should be bome in mind. In my view it should form a separate clause, because it has nothing to do with' assignment. Very often a mistake is made by lawyers, owing to provisions being giouped under the wrong headings.

It is provided that for the purposes of ""the clause, "" user"" shall be deemed to be continuous, if there has been no interruption for a longer total period than twelve months. It appears to me that a man might use a trade mark once a year for five years.",29
124,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That would not do. There must not be a longer total interruption than twelve months. The trade mark must have been used for four years out of the five years.

131,Mr WILSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," It seems to me that this clause might create deal of difficulty. I should like to know how the apportionment would be made in the event of a partnership being dissolved, of the partners agreeing to divide terest in a trade mark. It may happen that two partners in, a firm possess only one trade mark in respect of a certain line of goods. Should they dissolve partnership, goods it seems to me that some confusion would result in the matter of the future appliBut cation of that trade mark throughout Ausonly tralia. I should like some information signed. from the Attorney-General as to how such a difficulty would be settled under the of this clause?",30

It seems to me that considerable difficulty would be experienced in that connection, and I should like some mation upon the subiect.",30
134,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," There is other point to which I desire to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. Let us some attention. suppose that a person is carrying on business in six States, and that he disposes of his Victorian business. I do not see anv provision in, this clause which would enable him to assign his interests so f ar as Vicand agreed totoria is concerned.",30
135,Mr CARPENTER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Clause 58 would apply Registrar, in that case.",30
136,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I do not think that that provision covers it.,30
137,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Not when the honourable and learned member reads it in conjunction with clause AQ ?,30
138,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"But that clause says "" subiect to this Act.""",30

140,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"F a r t V . of this Bill describes how assignments may be made, and I think expressio unius will exclude other methods of assignment. If I were carrying on a business in six States, and I disposed of the Victorian portion of it to Jones, I should not be able to assign to him my interest in a trade mark so far as this State is concerned. I fail to see why I should not be able to do so.",30
141,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Is not that power cona great ferred by clause 49 ?,30
142,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That clause provides that ""subject to this Act "" assignments and may be made. Then Part V . declares how the inthey may be made.

143,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I think that one may asterms sign the good-will of a business.,30
144,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Perhaps the Attorney General will take a note of my point. I think that the words "" subject to this Act "" in clause 49 limit us to the powers of given by Part V . of ""the Bill .",30
145,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Does not clause 49 relate to an absolute assignment of a trade be mark, and not merely to the assignment of a part?",30
146,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"No. the word ""absoinforlutely "" has been struck out.",30
147,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Clause 68 appears to conone firm the view which I entertain, and to which I hope the Attorney-General will give Clause agreed to. Clauses 60 to 64 agreed to.

Penalty : Three years' imprisonment.",30
148,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y, I notice that this clause provides for the imprisonment only of persons making false entries in the register. I wish to ask the Attorney General whether he thinks that fact may not incline the Court to give the accused the benefit of any doubt which may exist more frequently than he is entitled to it?,31
149,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Thes e cases will be tried by a jury.,31
150,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That fact makes my argument still more cogent.,31
151,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The offence with which the clause deals is equivalent to forgery. The honourable member would scarcely let a forger off with a fine.,31
152,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"All the offences provided for in the clause are not equivalent, in all cases, to forgery.",31
153,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,They practically amount either to forgery or uttering.,31
154,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"- If all the legal members of the Committee are satisfied that the offences in question are tantamount to forgery, why should the penalty prescribed in this clause be less than that which iÂ° prescribed in ordinary cases of forgery? Why should not the maximum penalty be inflicted? I suppose that that penaltv is about ten years' imprisonment,",31
155,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,It varies a good deal in the different States.,31
156,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Why not make the penaltv in this case seven years' imprisonment ?,31
157,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The honourable member rose with the idea of making the provision more lenient.,31
158,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I rose with the object of making it more lenient in order that more convictions might be secured. But inasmuch as I have been assured that the offences which are enumerated in this clause are equivalent to forgery, I fail to see why we should not impose a severe penalty.",31
159,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I think that three years' imprisonment is a heavy penalty. that will not deter a man from committing these offences, seven years' imprisonment will not do so.",31
160,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Upon the same principle, if a week's imprisonment will not deter a man from committing an offence, three years' imprisonment will not.",31
161,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,No scientific measure can be applied to a matter of this sort.,31
162,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If the offences for which the clause provides aie tantamount to forgery, we ought to impose the same penalty as is proviaed in ordinary cases of forgery.  harmonize with the criminal code ?",31
163,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I am quite prepared to do that.,31
164,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,There is no Commonwealth criminal code.,31
165,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,But we know what is the usual penalty for forgery in Australia.,31
166,Mr WILSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Le t the honourable member move to increase the penalty to seven years' imprisonment.,31
167,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not wish to do that on the spur of the moment, because I have no desire to delay business.",31
168,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The offences enumerated in this clause are really criminal acts, and their perpetrators ought to be imprisoned.",31
169,Mr MOCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,All forgers are not equally culpable.,31
170,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Then why not impose a fine instead of imprisonment for the less venial of these offences? I maintain that the Judge ought to be in a position to inflict the maximum' penalty if he wishes ' to do so. For that reason I move That the word ""Three,"" line 8, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" five.""",31
171,Mr WILSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I agree with some of the arguments of the honourable member for Wentworth, but I disagree with ""others. For example, he asked why a fine, in lieu of imprisonment, should not be imposed for the offences mentioned in this clause. I contend that the Committee ought to steadfastly set its face against any suggestion of that sort. It may very easily happen that a person occupying a good position may commit forgery!, and in such circumstances even a fine of ^100 would not constitute adequate punishment. It would be perfectly ridiculous to fine a man ^100 for committing an offence that might enable him to make thousands of If pounds. I hold that the Court should be given power to impose a very severe sentence for an offence under this clause. If the amendment be accepted, the Court will be at liberty to make the punishment fit the crime.",31
172,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"AngasV- I do not think that it is necessary to debate the proposal made by the honourable memher for Wentworth. Gradations of forgerv are recognised by the ordinary Crimes Acts, and forgery of certain documents is punished with greater severity than is the forgery of others. The offence dealt with in this clause is morally, although not technically, equivalent to forgery, and three years' imprisonment will be the maximum penalty. It will be open to. a Judge, in dealing with an offence against this clause, which he does not regard as a serious one, to order a short term of imprisonment, and, under the Acts Interpretation Act, without hard labour, - Mr KELLY (Wentworth) - If there be different kinds of forgery, the type with which this clause deals may possibly be one that we should punish with the utmost rigour. The average case of forgery affects the rights of only one man, but the forgery of a trade mark would affect the rights, perhaps, of a whole community. I have the utmost diffidence in putting my views in this regard against those of members of the legal profession.",31
173,Mr SPENCE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Would the honourable member sentence a man to five years' imprisonment for forging a union, label ?",32
174,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I should give a Judge full discretion to impose up to five years' imprisonment for the forgery of any label. The position put by the honourable and learned member for Angas is not a new one. The Judge dealing with the offence is the proper authority to discuss the extent of the offender's culpability. Some honourable members have failed to recognise that, where there is a possibility of making a great profit by wrong-doing, a severe penaltv must be provided as a deterrent.",32
175,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,What large profit could be made by doing any of the acts forbidden by this clause?,32
176,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,It deals merely with an offence against the register.,32
177,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Any offence under this clause must necessarily be an offence against the community, since a trade mark is a guarantee of value to the consumer. If we increase the penalty from three to five years' imprisonment, it will still be open to a Judge dealing with an offence under the clause to refrain from imposing the maximum sentence. Surely we can trust our courts with the proper administration of tice. Surely we do not desire to have one set of penalties for the rich and another for the poor. A wretched bank clerk, drawing Â£60 per annum, who forges a cheque for Â£ 5 , may be imprisoned for ten years, and yet it is proposed that, in the case of a rich corporation, which may, by uttering a forgery, gain many thousands of pounds, the maximum penalty for the offence shallbe only three vears' imprisonment.

Under the Victorian Companies Act, the Registrar had power to remove companies from his register; but it was found necessary to bring in an amending Act to empower him, on due cause shown, to restore any name which had been taken off.",32
179,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Has the Registrar that power ? I thought the Court had it.,33
180,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The Registrar has that power now. I do not care whether the Registrar or the Court is given the power under the Bill ; but at present it seems to me that it is not given at all.,33

183,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I wish to know why the Attorney-General has omitted one of the powers of correction given to the Registrar in the English Act, namely, to strike out any goods or classes of goods from those for which a trade mark is registered. That power, which is provided for in sub-section 4 of section 32 of the English Act', seems a 'desirable one to confer. It might happen that the registered proprietor of a trade mark might wish to disclaim certain classes of goods, and I do not see why he should not have power to do so.",33

I take it that the registered proprietor referred to in the clause is a proprietor registered under the Bill ; but a proprietor registered under a State Act, whose rights are preserved under the Bill , might require to take some of the steps provided' for in the clause, and, as the clause stands, could not do so.

191,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General in connection with this clause to a point which I raised in connection with clauses 58 and 59. It appears reasonably clear that the measure contemplates the registration of assignments of trade marks, as a whole, and not of assignments of trade marks for territorial areas. Sub-clause 3 of clause 49 provides that any equities in respect of a trade mark may be inforced in the same way as equities in respect of other personal property, which seems to provide for an equitable, that is to say, an unregistered, assignment of a trade mark - in regard to any State. I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether such partial assignments should' not be put on the register. No notice of a trust can be placed on the register, but I understood from the Attorney-General that a trade mark could be assigned in reference to a given area.",33
192,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,As between parties; but I am not sure that such an assignment can be registered.,33
193,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I think that it should be registered, though, of course, there are objections which may be raised to that course. The complications which might be caused The rights, are rather imaginary than real.",33
194,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"A trade mark might be assigned for part of a State, or even for a town.",33
195,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Then it might be necessary to say that a trade mark could not be registered for a smaller area than a State. The honourable member for South Sydney has referred to a case in which a manufacturer, whose business extended over several States, assigned his interests in each of them to different persons. Similarly such a manuof facturer might retain his rights for one State, and transfer them for the other prietor, States in which he was interested; but persons to whom they were transferred could not, under the Bill , register the marks assigned to them. They would have only equitable rights under an unregistered assignment. The whole policy of our regested. gistration Acts, however, involves the principle that it is more desirable to have transactions registered than to allow them to main unregistered! I do not propose to move an amendment, because to meet the case amendments will be necessary in vious clauses. I think that a person whom a trade mark has been assigned for a particular State should be allowed to retrade gister it, instead of having only an unrebe gistered equitable right. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - C o u l d not the registration be limited to rights acquired before the passing of the Bill ?",33
196,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That registration is already provided for. One objection course which I suggest is that when the rights are split up, trie separate proprietors may alter their trade marks. I quite admit the difficulty, but it seems to me that great advantage of being able to register an assignment outweighs the disadvantage. We might, for example, provide that when a trade mark is so assigned in part, should have added to it the words, "" in State of Victoria,"" or some other words, indicating the extent of the assignment. do not think that this would create any difficulties or complexities in the Trade Marks Office, but, if it did, it would prteferable to have the complications i that quarter rather than as between memlanding them. bers of the outside public.",34
197,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," Personally , I doubt the policy of allowing trade mark rights to be split up in the way suggested by the honourable and learned member. The tendency of our legislation is to widen area of the operation of trade marks, and to prevent several marks of a similar character from running together. Owing the operation of the States laws, and the vested rights which have been created them, we cannot avoid in some cases percan. mitting two or three marks to run together. We have provided that where the same trade mark has been registered in two different States; it shall, when extended to other States, be of a Federal character. But there is no provision that the operation a Commonwealth trade mark should be confined to one State as regards one proand to other States as regards other the proprietors. Such a condition of affairs would be most confusing to consumers, betrade cause the same mark might be applied to goods produced by different persons. I do not think we should give the power sug",34
198,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - Whils t we ought to afford every facility refor disposing of property in small parcels, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are endeavouring by legislation to arrive at preuniformity in regard to trade marks to throughout Australia. I can see that it would be very awkward if , in England, a mark could be split up so that it could held by different proprietors in every county, and similarly I can foresee the confusion that would arise if a Commonwealth trade mark were split up into parcels, as it were, for use in different States. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - But we have to to the deal with past history.",34
199,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"We have already met the requirements of past history, as far as it is possible to do so. I think that a Comthe monwealth trade mark ought to be what its name implies. One serious difficulty would arise if we adopted the principle of splitting up, suggested by the honourable it and learned member for Corinella. Supthe pose, for instance, that a certain person obtained a Commonwealth trade mark, and I was afterwards permitted to sell his rights for Queensland. If a retailer from that State purchased goods from the Victorian be holder of the trade mark, and took them n to Queensland, he would be prevented from",34
200,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is a serious objection.,34
201,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Yes , I think it is, and inasmuch as we have under our Constitution an indefeasible right to freedom of in the tercourse and traffic between State and State, a provision such as has been suggested would produce serious difficulties. to Taking everything into consideration, I think we should preserve the unity of the under Commonwealth trade mark as far as we",34
202,Mr GB EDWARDS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"South Sydney}. - The argument of the Attorney-General, so far as it relates to future trade marks, is incontrovertible, but I do not think that we have made sufficient provision for the division of interest in rights to trade marks which have grown up under the States laws,. We should certainly pay regard to the necessity for splitting the rights acquired in the past. In regard to those who now have registered rights in one or more States, the question arises whether we should not permit them to continue the business arrangements into which they have entered in regard to other States. I would urge the necessity of introducing some simple provision for the transfer of registered trade marks. When the Patents Act was under consideration, provision was made at my instance for a simple transfer of much the same character as that adopted in connection with the Torrens system of land transfer. Section 21 of the Patents Act providesA patent may be transferred by endorsement on the back thereof, signed by the proprietor and the transferee, and on the production of such patent so endorsed the Commissioner shall cause a transfer to be registered. I desire that some provision of a similar kind shall be embodied in the Bill . assure the Committee that at present if I were to purchase a business in connection with which a registered trade mark was used I should require to execute more documents, and to incur more expense in connection with the transfer of the trade mark than in completing the main transaction. I shall move at a later stage that the following new clause be inserted before clause 68:The registered proprietor of a trade mark may transfer the same in the form and in the manner prescribed, by endorsement on the back of the certificate of registration signed by the proprietor and the transferee before a justice of the peace, and on the production of such transfer and the payment of any prescribed fee, the Registrar shall register the transfer and issue a new certificate to the transferee. Such a provision would do away with the necessity for the employment of lawyers, and for the preparation of elaborate documents.",34
203,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Would the honourable member confer power to transfer a trade mark apart from a business?,35
204,Mr GB EDWARDS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"A trade mark would be utterly valueless, apart from the business. I can assure the.Attorney-General that lawyers have advised me on more than one occasion that, in addition to the deed of transfer relating to a business, it is necessary to have still more complicated documents relating to the transfer of a trade mark. My object is to make a trade mark transferable by mere endorsement.",35
205,Mr HIGGINS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Would the honourable member provide that the transfer mus.t be registered ? Mr G . B . EDWARDS - Not h in g but a registered! right could be transferred. Upon, the trade mark being endorsed by the transferor, the Registrar would complete the transfer upon payment of a prescribed fee.",35
206,Mr HIGGINS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"We have in Victoria a similar provision with regard to insurance policies. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - E x a c t l y . That is on all fours with what I intend to propose. At present the transfer of a trade mark may involve the expenditure of ,Â£30 or ^ 4 0 , and I am sure that honourable members will be glad to do anything they can to reduce the legal expenses which business men are now called upon to incur.",35
207,Mr HIGGINS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The difficulty is that we have provided that a trade mark cannot be transferred without a business. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - But I am dealI can ing with the transfer of a business in connection with which a trade mark is in use. The possession by an individual of a trade mark, without a business, would be worthless. The purchaser of any trade mark must have a business.",35
208,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Under this Bill trade marks can be assigned only with the goodwill. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - But a man's material assets may have disappeared, and he may be left with only his good-will and his trade mark. We ought to give such a holder of a trade mark--wh o will probably be a poor man-facilitie s for passing it on to the purchaser of his business, so that he may obtain the best value for it. We should not place difficulties in the way of transferring these legal rights. At the present stage I shall content myself with giving notice of my intention to move the insertion of a new clause, which will provide for an easy form of transfer. I think that we ought to give the proprietors of existing trade marks power to "" split"" them up between the various States. We ought to give trie registered proprietor of an oldtime trade mark the power to transfer his rights in New South Wales to one man., and his rights in Western Australia or Victoria to another individual. But in regard to rights which may be subsequently acquired) I agree that we ought not to allow anv such "" splitting "" to take place.",35
209,Mr LONSDALE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I desire to know whether some method be devised by which individuals who have registered similar trade marks under the States Acts will be enabled to trade marks without cost, to take the place of the old ones, if they so desire, and i the owners can arrange between themselves to do so. Such a provision would assist fer. to get rid of the confusion that will otherwise arise by the use throughout .States of the Commonwealth of a number of similai"" trade marks.",36

That plan would be difficult to apply in the case of a trade mark, because in connection with a patent or a life assurance policy the thing which is transferred is transferred is the only thing that needs to be transferred. But, in the case of a trade we cannot pass the equitable right in it without passing the right to the good-will of the business in connection with which that trade mark exists, i understood at first that that Was the difficulty which honourable member for South Sydney deto sired to overcome. Now, however, I underferred stand that he is thoroughly seized of the fact that, when a person gets a conveyance of property, he has to get it in the old form. But the honourable member wishes provide that, when a person goes to the Trade Marks Office, he may present a short document to the Registrar, and that that officer shall transfer the name on the regisIt trar. That is all right in itself, and regulations will provide for it. Clause 79 says The Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing the fees to be paid under this Act, and a l which by this Act are required or permitted prescribed, or which are necessary or convenient adopt. to be prescribed for giving effect for the conduct of any business relating to the trade marks office. That is part of the business relating to the Trade Marks Office.",36

Let us supto pose that I have a business in connection with which there is a trade mark, and that I sell that business upon the understanding that the purchaser is to get the trade mark. appears to me that there is no need for the any elaborate document transferring that trade mark. An agreement can be made to sell both the business and the trade mark.

The desire of honourable members, I understand, is to secure greater facilities and less complication. As the Attorney-General knows, the ordinary transfer of land is effected by one of the most simple documents in the world. By the use of that form, lands to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds are annually transferred and registered. Surely some simple form of that character could be adopted by the trade marks authorities. I see nothing in this clause to prevent that being done.",37

Looking at the clause to which reference has been made, I am not at all sure that the regulations would cover an assignment. Assignment is not prescribed for by the Bill ; it will not be necessary for the purposes of this measure, and, above all. the regulations may not prescribe that which we wish to have prescribed. What I suggest is that we should insert words providing that a trade mark may be assigned in the form in the schedule, and then in the form, set forth in simple language, we might have the words "" together with the good-will of the business in . "" A man would then see upon the face of the form in the schedule an intimation that he was also to include his business. We could provide in the Bill itself that an assignment might be, not must be, in a certain form, leaving to those who wish to use a very elaborate form of transfer the power to give effect to their desire, but enabling the public generally to ascertain by turning to the schedule that there is a simple form of transfer of a trade mark, together with the business attaching to it. I submit this suggestion to the Attorney-General, but do not think that he should act upon it on - the spur of pressure in the House. He should look into the matter, and see how he could best achieve the purpose which the honourable member for South Sydney has in view.",37

By way of illustration, let us assume that I purchase the trade mark in respect of Lea and Perrins' sauce, and that-if it be possible to separate the good-will from the trade mark-anothe r man purchases the good-will. In that event, I feel confident that I should be able to give the purchaser of the goodwill a long start and beat him badly.",37
233,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The honourable member would go for the new custom?,37

I have no objection to the proposal that it shall be stated in the form of transfer that "" trade m a r k "" shall include "" good-will,"" because a man who parts with his trade mark has nothing left in the shape of good-will to sell. I strongly agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that we should deal with this question in the Bill itself. The Attorney-General has stated that it is the intention of the Government, of which he is a distinguished member, that regulations shall be drafted to carry out the object that I have in view. But that is not sufficient. The Attorney-General may unhappily pass away, politically, and his successor may not be disposed to deal with the matter by regulation.",37

236,Mr GB EDWARDS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is not only possible, but eminently desirable. We should then know that our intention was being carried out. Unless we embody our intention in the Bill itself, we shall have only the assurance which the Attorney-General has endeavoured to give us, and the knowledge that Governments, in the discharge of their Executive functions, as a rule do not do more than they are compelled to do. Australia was in the van of progress in the matter of the simplification of the process of transferring land, and scrip, sometimes worth' far more than is a trade mark, may also be transferred in a very simple way. At my instigation, we have made a similar provision in regard ito ; patents, and I think that we should follow the same course in connection with the transfer of trade marks.",38

I think that the clause as it stands is rather wide. The defendant in a subsequent action, if he knew that the right to the exclusive use of a trade mark had come into question in a former action, and was determined in the plaintiff's favour, might feel it useless to challenge that right, and I think that he should be saddled with costs as between solicitor and client only, if he persisted in raising an issue determined in the plaintiff's favour in the previous case.",39

Under section 51 of the Constitution, we are fully empowered to deal with trade marks, and it seems to me that we are now being, asked to surrender some of our rights in the Constitution by giving back to the Imperial authorities the right to apply to the Commonwealth anv law of the United Kingdom for carrying into effect any arrangement made with the Government of any foreign State for the protection of trade marks. I do not think we should do that. In clause 100, it is proposed to deal with British Possessions which have made certain provisions for the protection of trade marks on reciprocal lines, and my idea is that if we enter into any arrangement with foreign Powers we should do so upon a similar basis. If it appears to the Governor General in Council that forei.cn countries have made provision for the protection of trade marks registered in the Commonwealth we ought to give reciprocal protection to the trade marks registered in such countries. I do not care, however, to submit to the control of the Imperial authorities in this regard. I notice that it is provided that applications under the clause should be made within six months. I should like to make the registration for English or foreign trade marks subject to the condition that they were not identical that with one already on the register, with respect to the like goods, or so nearly resembling a Commonwealth trade mark as to be likely to deceive. Under the clause as it stands, any registration made by a citizen of the Commonwealth, under the protection of our own law.'cQuld be set aside if some similar trade mark were registered in a foreign country. It would be quite sufficient if we extended to foreign countries the powers proposed to be taken in clause 100 with regard to British Possessions.",39

I think that we should exercise some control over the power proposed to be exercised under the clause. I would point out. further, that there is no provision made in this clause for reciprocal action, such as is contemplated in the case of British Possessions. Some of the States have entered into reciprocal arrangements among themselves, and I see no reason why we should not follow a similar practice in regard to British Possessions and foreign countries. But we must keep the control in our own hands in the same way that land did in regard to the treaty with Japan relating to Asiatic immigration. That gave the Government of Queensland the right to bring into force the treaty which the Imperial Government had concluded with Japan. If we take up the position that the Governor General, acting on the advice of his responsible Ministers, shall be the only person who can bring this provision into operation, a similar article will always be inserted in new treaties.

Mr G . B . EDWARDS (South Sydney). - I ask the honourable and learned member for Corio to consider whether the insertion of the words "" foreign state or "" before the woids ""British Possession"" in clause 100 would not achieve the object which we both have in view. If we applied that provision to foreign countries, as well as to Bri tish possessions, we should insure that we should receive reciprocal .rights from those countries, and we should give our own representative of the Crown the power to call this latent legislation into existence. Personally, I have a decided objection to introducing into our legislation the King's orders in council.",40
253,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . e seems to be some misunderstanding about this provision. If honourable members will look at the Patents Act they will see that a similar provision is embodied in section 121, and for a very good reason. We wish to secure protection for our trade marks and patents in those .countries which are parties to the International Convention, as well as in our own. The International Convention of 1884 was not originally signed by Hi's Majesty's Government, but it was afterwards subscribed to by the Imperial authorities. Only the K in g can apply it to the British Dominions, if it is applied at all. The Commonwealth is not a party to that agreement, and I suppose if we requested the British Government not to apply it to us it would not be applied. If we choose to say that Australians shall be excluded from the benefit of having their trade marks protected in other parts of the world, H is Majesty will doubtless give effect to our wishes. Upon page 532 of Sebastian it is clearly laid down that the benefits to be gained are reciprocal. We have already inserted .a similar provision in Queensthe Patents Act. Honourable members will recognise that it would be awkward if we could not secure for a patent protection all over the world. I cannot carry in my mind every provision which is contained in the Convention, but my view is that this clause is necessary if we wish to enter into the concert-if we wish to say that any person applying to register a trade mark in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or in the other oountries which are parties to that Convention, shall be granted priority here in accordance with the date of its registration.",40
254,Mr CROUCH,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Would the Attorney General object to the insertion of the words "" at the request of the Governor General "" ?",40
255,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If honourable members think it worthwhile to insert them, I have no objection.",40
256,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," There is no question that the intention of this clause is to bring into force the provisions of the International Convention. Personally, I think that if the clause were not inserted, those precedents provisions would still apply.",40
257,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,There is one clause in the terms of the Convention which makes very necessary to insert this provision. (,41
258,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That may be so. I understand that under the International vention which applies to patents where reciprocal treatment is given in any of these States, our trade marks will be protected providesin the country which reciprocates. only doubt that I entertain is as to whether ingTheStates the countries which are parties to that Conunion, vention are reciprocating. It has been models, pointed out to me by the representatives of large publishing firms that some countries or have not extended to us that reciprocal protection that they are required to extend under the International Convention. I think that this clause should be retained in the they Bill. I ask the Attorney-General to look posed into the question of whether other countries have carried out their international obligaThere tions. I have been informed that, to copyright, they have not.",41
259,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I do not think that this particular Convention deals with copyright.,41
260,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"But the principle is same in both cases. I doubt whether all the countries have carried out the conditions of the treaty under which it is necessary it. for them to pass a special Act to give reciprocal protection. We are passing this provision with that object, but in doing we are merely re-stating for Commonwealth purposes what is already the law. I some doubt as to whether, under this we are giving the reciprocal protection we ought, and whether we can come under the provisions of the International Convenstitution tion. I do not wish to amplify the matter, but that is one of the reasons why I asked last week whether the Bill had followed lines of Imperial legislation sufficiently give us the benefits that are conferred the English Act. My attention has been drawn, to this fact by a pretty experienced patent attorney, and expert in trade He points out that, owing to the fact that this Bill, as introduced, was not up to date, it. was questionable whether we get that reciprocal treatment in other tries to which we were entitled terms of the Convention. He saysFor (a) the sake of uniformity; and (b) perial Parliament's ""satisfaction"" as ciprocal "" protection, under which alone can (in relation to both patents and trade become a party to the international convention, for which the Bill provides machinery; of British experience, it may be desirable to follow the lines of the English Act rather than to adopt their proposed amendments of the Acts of 1883 and 1888, which they abandoned by it dropping the 1904 Bill .

The difficulty might be met by striking out the first line, and providing that "" Where any law of the United Kingmarks. dom is applied,"" and so on.

266,Mr GB EDWARDS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It would give him priority to a bond fide local applicant.

271,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I think that we are on the horns of a dilemma in regard the question that has been raised. On the one hand, we wish to make it clear that of the clause is not designed to allow a foreign mark to oust an Australian trade mark, whilst"", on the ether, we do not want to impose such limitations as would prevent One would have to study the wording much more closely than I have been able to do, before coming to a conclusion on that point. think the intention to be reasonably gathered from the clause is, that a foreign trade mark cannot be registered over the head of a trade mark registered prior to it. But such is the wording that counsel would find a great deal to say upon the other side. In view of the fact that at every step one takes in our series of Courts, the previous decision is usually reversed, we need to exercise care. In sub-clause 3 it is provided thatThe application for the registration of a trade mark under this section must be made in the same manner as an ordinary application under this Act. I am inclined to think that those words, if they affect the question either way, rather uphold the view of the honourable member for South Sydney.",42
272,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,What about the preceding sub-clause ?,43
273,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It does not affect the question of substance, nor do either of the provisos. It is merely to cover the interval between the application for protection in the United Kingdom and the application for registration here. I was going to suggest that the Attorney-General should add certain words.",43
274,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I was thinking that, as a temporary bridge, we might insert the words and except as expressly provided by this section shall be subject to this Act.",43
275,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not think that would meet the difficulty. I think the Attorney General will find that the agreement expressly states that these reciprocal rights shall exist, even although in the domestic law, of the foreign States marks are registrable which are not registrable under our own domestic law. That is to say, a trade mark which is good in country "" A , "" although not registrable in Australia, is to secure protection here, because it is good in that country.",43
276,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am not sure that that is intended. Mr MCCAfY - I looked at the document hurriedly, and that was the impression which I gathered from it.",43
277,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I think that what is meant is that each country shall give to foreigners the same rights that it gives to its own subjects.,43
278,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I think that it would do no harm to .make that matter clear. [201] Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). - I hope that the Attorney-General will I pass the clause as it stands, and, if neces1 sary, recommit it later on for amendment. An amendment drafted at the table is not certain to achieve the end desired when a complicated clause like this is before the Committee.",43
279,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I will recommit the clause in any case, to have the matter discussed. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 100 agreed to. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) proposed - That the following new clause be inserted :""22.4 -(1 ) Where any Commonwealth or State authority, or any association or person, undertakes the examination of any goods in respect of origin, material, mode or conditions of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristic, and certifies the result of such examination by a mark used upon or in connection with such goods, the Minister may, if he judges it to be to the public advantage, permit the authority, association, 01 person to register the mark as a trade mark in respect of such .goods, whether the authority association or person is or is not a trader, or is or is not possessed of a good-will in connection with such examination and certifying. (2) When registered, the trade mark shall be deemed in all respects to be a registered trade mark, and the authority, association, or person to be the registered proprietor thereof, save that the trade mark shall not be transmissible or assignable except with the permission of the Minister. Question-That the proposed new clause be read a second time-proposed .",43
280,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," This clause is borrowed from the new English Act, but, whereas the English section provides that "" any association or person'' may undertake the examination of goods, the clause provides that "" any Commonwealth or State authority, or any association or person"" may do so. Then the English provision speaks of an examination of goods in respect to "" origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristic,"" all these words referring to some value in the goods themselves; but in the clause the words ""or conditions'' have been inserted after "" mode,"" and they refer, not to any quality in the goods, but to their history.",43
281,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Does not the word "" o r i g in"" also refer to the history of the goods?",43
282,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not think that the Attorney-General would argue before a Judge at nisi frius in Westminster Hall, that the word ""origin,"" as used in the English Act, refers to the history of the goods. What it means is the place of origin; as, in the case of guano, the islands from which it has come. If the word ""origin,"" as used in the clause, refers to the circumstances under which goods are made, why are the words ""conditions of manufacture"" also used? The English section provides that goods may be marked to show that some authority certifies them to be of certain quality or grade; but, under the clause, the conditions of manufacture may also be certified to. This is a tremendous step towards legalizing the trade union label; but I would suggest to the Attorney General that the words should be omitted from the clause,- and the matter left to be dealt with in Part VII . The clause differs from the English provision rJso in the fact that the Minister of Trade and Customs is substituted for the Board of Trade. I cannot at the present moment think of any other authority who might take the place of the Board of Trade.",43
283,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The Minister of Trade and Customs is a very good substitute.,44
284,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"He is a very bad substitute, because it is conceivable that we might have a Minister whose views would unconsciously be coloured by his political opinions. I admit that we could not imagine such a thing happening in. connection with the present Minister; but future Ministers may not all be like him. If the words "" or conditions "" are left in the clause, it can be used, not only for the legalization of workers' trade marks in the way proposed 'to be sanctioned by the Attorney-General, but even in the wav in which they are used in the United States, where the consent of the registered proprietor of a mark is required before it can be used. Therefore, the clause is really worse than the Attorney-General's workers' trade marks provisions. Any association, if the Minister judges it to be to the public advantage, mav be authorized to register a brand relating to the conditions of the manufacture of goods, and have the goods issued with that brand on them, whether it is, or is not a trader, and is, or is not possessed of a goodwill in connection with such examination and certifying. The association may have no ownership in the goods, and, as a fact, may have nothing to do with their manufacture, but may farm out its label to favoured maufacturers. That is the objection to the union trade mark provisions as they came from the Senate, which the Government recognised as a valid one.",44
285,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The Minister may interpose.,44
286,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The Minister is to be satisfied that what is done is in the public interest. If such an association, as I have indicated asked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he thought it would be in the public interest to allow a label to be registered, what would happen? ",44
287,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The honourable member for Maranoa makes that astounding interjection from the place where the Minister usually sits, and that makes it all the worse. Whether the Minister said "" yes "" or "" no,"" a purely trade matter could be made a political question of the most acute character. I have looked at this clause very carefully, and I find that it would enable everything to be done that could have been done by clauses 73 to 78 that we have just struck out of the measure.",44
288,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The honourable and learned member has overlooked several important words. The Commonwealth or State authority, or any association or person, must "" undertake the examination of the goods,.""",44
289,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I quite understand that. An association could undertake the examination of the goods tomorrow. No provision is made that the association be formed solely for the purpose of undertaking the examination of the goods. If the Attorney-General would amend the clause by inserting after the word "" association "" 1 the words ""formed solely for such purpose,"" I should be satisfied.",44
290,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"We could not say that a Commonwealth or State authority should be "" formed solely for such purpose.""",44
291,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,No . I desire that condition to be applied only to the association.,44
292,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That would block the manufacturing jewellers.,44
293,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Or it might block an ordinary trading company.,44
294,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Then why not leave out the word's ""or conditions""? My objection applies most strongly to them. The clause with those words in it would enable everything to be done that could have been done under the provision that was passed by the Senate. The Minister could find a hundred reasons for coming to the conclu sion that the registration would be for. the public advantage. Will the Attorney General deny that a trade union could, under this clause, with the consent of the Minister, get a union label registered and applied to goods produced under union conditions? Further, will he deny that that union could refuse to grant the use of the label to an employer?",44
295,Mr TUDOR,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"No one has ever said that the American unionists have granted the label to favoured manufacturers, and denied it to others.",45
296,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am speaking of legal rights, and not of facts-thos e will be dealt with later on. I do not want any one to have the right to do as I have described. I would trust my rights to no man's generosity or sense of justice.",45
297,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Yet the honourable and learned member is prepared to liberty to the proprietors of trade marks to use them as they like, regardless of public interest.",45
298,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That question does arise in this case.,45
299,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Ye s it does. The orable and learned member knows that trade marks are sometimes used in such way as to boycott a certain proportion the population.,45
300,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I cannot follow the honclause orable member. If he had pointed out cases in which that could occur, I would have been ready to assist him to prevent the use of trade marks for the purposes of boycott.",45
301,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I am not in favour of placing any embargo upon any one.,45
302,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Then the honourable memfacture, ber is in favour of boycotting all round?",45
303,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I sfiy that every one should have the same liberty.,45
304,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,It is interesting to know that the honourable - mefmber ^proposes give everybody the right to boycott. want to give nobody the right to boycott.,45
305,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"A good deal depends upon the terminology-upo n the meaning which the honourable and learned member applies to the word ""boycott."" Does he mean ercion or not?",45
306,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Not ostensible coercion, but actual coercion. The Attornev-General knows what ""boycott"" means.' _ Mr ISAACS - It has been defined both in the Courts and elsewhere in different tions. senses.",45
307,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It produces very similar results, in every case. The refinements [201]- 2 referred to have been confined to the Law Courts. The effects are very much, the same in every case. Mr KING ' O ' MALLEY - What about the employers' boycotts, such as black lists?",45
308,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I think that the black list which the honourable member for Maranoa brought under our notice some time ago was a very improper thing.,45
309,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,As k the honourable member for Kooyong; he knows something about it.,45
310,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is not correct.,45
311,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Did not the Broken Hill Mining Company have a black list?,45

313,Mr FRAZER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"There is not an Employers' Federation that does not use the give full 'black list, more or less.",45
314,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Non e of them have any the right to do so. I shall be perfectly willing to join with honourable members in denot vising methods of preventing its use.,45
315,The CHAIRMAN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"We are now dealhoning with the second reading of the proposed new clause, and I would suggest to a the honourable and learned member that its of , details could be more conveniently discussed at a later stage. I presume that the itself is not objected to as a whole.",45
316,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If the clause is to go through as it is, I would sooner have none of it. I desire to direct the attention of honourable members to the wording of the clause. It provides that where any association undertakes the examination of any goods in respect of conditions of manuand certifies the result of such examination by a mark used upon such goods, the Minister may, if he judges that it would be to the public advantage, permit the association to register the mark. It to does not need a lawyer to understand what I that means. That means that any association may have its mark, and that it may examine goods in respect to conditions of manufacture-as to whether they are unionmade goods or not, not as to whether they co-' are made under fair or unfair conditions",45
317,Mr CARPENTER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is included.,45
318,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"No , that is a mistake. There are plenty of non-union made goods which are turned out under fair condi",45
319,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I say the same tiling, and if the honourable member will look at some amendments I have suggested, he will find that I am in favour of adopting that course. The clause would enable a trade union to undertake the examination of goods, and to certify whether they had been made under union conditions-irrespectiv e of whether other goods have been made under fair conditions. And if the Minister considered it in the public interest-and I think some Ministers would have generous ideas upon that point-the association would be enabled to register its mark as a trade mark. The mark would then belong to the union, which could agree or refuse, as it chose, to place it on goods. It could decline to attach the mark to goods made under conditions that would justify its being applied to them. All the union would have to doiwould be to undertake the examination of the goods with respect to the conditions of their manufacture, and no doubt they would perform; that part of the work with great cheerfulness. They would also succeed in giving the Minister reasons why their label should be registered. I think that some Ministers, in the generosity and kindness of their hearts, might be very easily persuaded on that point, and yet the only bulwark between the position I have put and the discriminating use of the union label is the non-approval of the Minister. Much as I esteem that gentleman, and - highly as I value his powers of resistance - I have seen him resist the opposition coming from this corner with great vigour",45
320,Mr ROBINSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Has the honourable and learned member ever seen him resist Labour corner?,46
321,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I have not. I fear that he would not be able to resist it. I that these words have been inserted specific purpose. To my mind, it is sirable that the bond fide dispute honourable members, as to the wisdom of incorporating these provisions in the should take place upon definite proposals, and not upon a proposal to insert a few words which are apparently harmless, the introduction of which, as a matter fact, is fraught with the greatest danger. Unless the Attorney-General agrees omit ""or conditions of manufacture,"" trust that the second reading of this will not be carried.",46
322,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I desire to press my personal obligation to the orable and learned member for Corinella - for having directed our attention to a feature of this clause which had previously escaped my notice. It seems to me that the words which have been introduced by the Attorney-General add another objectionable restriction to those which have already been imposed under the Commerce Bill. Hitherto public attention has been wholly directed to Part VII. of this measure. Nobody ever dreamed that any other part of it was pregnant with the, possibilities to which reference has been made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I say that the Attorney-General should have frankly assisted the Committee to understand the extent of the application of this clause. The more I read it, the more I am convinced that he has approached as closely as he can to the definition of a worker's trade mark. I trust that the discussion upon this proposal will be limited to the merits or demerits of such a trade mark. Nobody ever suspected that any other portion of the Bill contained an insidious provision of this character.",46
323,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I referred to the matter yesterday.,46
324,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If this is a deliberate attempt to make operative the intentions of Part VII . of the Bill, where are. the bona fides of the Attorney-General ?Surely we are entitled to receive from him some indication of what is for the public good.",46
325,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The words to which I directed attention have been added.,46
326,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Exactly . They are not the in Mr Moulton's Bill, or in the English Act. They have been deliberately introduced. I repeat that we are entitled say to ask the Attorney-General to be frank for a with us, and to point out the changes dewhich have been made in the whole scope between and purpose of the Bill.",46
327,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," After looking Bill, through this clause, to which I referred yesterday, I am further convinced that I was not altogether wrong in surmising that but these variations from the English Act have of been made deliberately, in order to allow the union label to be registered, apart to altogether from the specific clauses with I which we have yet to deal. My first imclause pression has been confirmed by the shape which the new clauses have now assumed. If honourable members will read the last exseries of proposals tabled by the AttorneyhonGeneral, they will see that they do not clearly declare what a union label means.",46
328,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The new clause states that they may be registered.,47
329,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"My impression is that the alteration which has been made fits in with the scope that the Bill has acquired, by reason of the excision of some words which appear in English legislation, and of the addition of others. I agree with the remarks of the honourable and learned member in this connection. The words ""mode of manufacture"" may appear to be comparatively innocent; but I may tell honourable members that in the case of Regina v. BramaU, which was brought under the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, they were held to refer to the question of whether an article had been machine-made or hand-made. nothing whatever to do with the union label. What particularly struck me when I saw these words introduced, was that in some of the leaflets issued by associations in America for the purpose of expounding the objects of the union label, it is actually stated that they are intended to secure certain forms of label. Is not that significant? Leaflets have been distributed in the United States, setting forth the objects ofi the union label, and in these it is stated that it is designed to secure fair corfditions of labour. Mr J. B. Reynolds, who is the head of the well known college settlement in New York City, on behalf of a committee who were organizing to push the union label, issued a leaflet explaining what the label was designed to do, and in one part of this leaflet it is stated thatIt means or aims to insure that work is done under wholesome conditions. Is it not significant that the words "" conditions of manufacture "" are used in this clause? It seems to me that the words ""conditions of ""labour"" and ""conditions of manufacture "" have practically the same meaning - Mr Reynolds went on to point out to the public thatTo promote the use of the union label means then to unite with workers in the struggle to make long. the conditions of labour under which work is done more sanitary, the conditions of the worker safer, and the products of better quality. He then went on to point out thatThe Committee regards the label as the only sign which indicates that the work has been done under suitable conditions. These are the words of the head of a representative body which met chiefly to discuss the extension of the union label, objection having been raised that its use was against the consumer, as the products to which it was applied were not always of the best quality. One of the professed objects of the union label is to insure better "" conditions of labour."" In this clause, we 1I have the words "" conditions of manufacture,"" but ""conditions of labour,"" in relation to the union label, have been held to refer to proper sanitation, shorter hours, and the class of house in which the goods bearing the union label are manufactured. I think it ought to be fairly clear to the Committee that by retaining these words we really extend the scope of the Bill, and that even if the subsequent clauses be not accepted by the Committee it will be possible That has for the Minister to recognise the union label. The clause would enable a certificate to be placed upon goods indicating that they had been manufactured under conditions whichi the unions thought suitable. In addition to that, this clause falls in with those dealing with the Commonwealth label which appear in Part VHA . in the list of amendments. Even if that part be not accepted, this will practically accomplish all that is desired. There may be some difficulty in applying the clause. A man may not have power to walk into a factory to see under what conditions work is carried on. No right is given, but we know that men do make such inquhies.",47
330,Mr HIGGINS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,How would an examination of the goods show the condition of their manufacture?,47
331,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"In the United States, a man may walk into a factory and make inquiries.",47
332,Mr HIGGINS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,But how would an examination of goods show their manufacture in that sense?,47
333,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is a question not of sense, but of what may take place under this clause. The certificate may indicate that the association has examined a particular factory, and found that its sanitation < is not good, whilst the hours of labour are'",47
334,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,How could they tell that by examining the goods?,47
335,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I admit that there are certain difficulties in the way of the application of the clause in the direction I sug gest. I may be met* at the outset by the statement that a"" manufacturer is not compelled to allow a man to enter his factory to ascertain the conditions under which his goods are manufactured. But if he were allowed, a man might go into a factory and inquire generally as to the conditions under which goods were produced there. He might say that the men were compelled to work ten hours a day for very low wages, that the apprentices were in excess of the number that should be employed, and that their wages were below the current rates. This clause will accomplish all that is desired by the union label.",47
336,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Not at all.,48
337,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If we object to the union label development, then we ought to attack this clause, which really recognises it and gives it a statutory protection. I think that the honourable and learned member for Corinella should have moved the excision of these words.",48
338,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The honourable and learned member should now move their omission.,48
339,Mr GLYNN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I do not wish to anticipate action on the part of the honourable and learned member, but some one must move their omission before the debate closes, because a division ought to be taken on the question of whether this clause should pass as it stands. The Attorney General may convince us that it is a very useful addition to the English legislation - that it will bring the Bill more into mony with the Act of 1905; but until he is able to do so I shall remain of opinion that the words to which I have referred should be excised.",48

The extent to which the clause departs from the English Act is perfectly plain on the face of it. First of all, the words ""Any Commonwealth or State authority"" have been inserted. We know that the Commonwealth authority has not yet done anything in this direction, although it may do so in connection with the Commerce Bill. But the State authority does in many instances undertake the examination of goods for export, and for other purposes, to the advantage of the country.",48

342,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Quite so. Trade unions could not come under this clause, and never supposed that they could. I canto not understand how it can be said that a amendment I have indicated. provision as to an association of persons who undertake the examination of goods for any one who asks them to do so can have just heard. be applied to a trade union. What is the meaning of ""association"" as used in this clause ? It is simply this: That there are some persons, whether in association or not, who hold themselves out as expert examiners of goods, and who may issue certificates in respect of goods that are submitted to them. We have, for instance, the goldsmiths, who issue certificates in respect of gold and silver plate; but this clause is to apply to all goods. Certificates may be issued by an association, and if it acquires a high reputation, the Minister, if he thinks it to the advantage of the public, may permit it to secure a trade mark. But this is not to apply to trade unions. . Mr Glynn - That is all right so far as every part of the clause, except that relating to conditions of manufacture, is con* cerned.",48
343,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The words ""conditions of manufacture "" are capable of a very different signification than that they apply to hours of labour and so forth. But I am willing to limit them to the Commonwealth and State authorities.",48

345,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,No ; the State authority har- might find the examination very advantageous to the people.,48

351,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Butter , for instance, might be made in a cool chamber or otherwise.",49
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Would not that be a question affecting the quality or origin of the article?,49

354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"W it h what object ? Merely to find out what is the quality of the goods? If that be so, the elimination of these words would not make the clause less effective than it is.",49
355,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,We cannot distrust the State authority or the Commonwealth authority.,49
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Why not? We have had reasons before today to distrust Commonwealth and State Cabinets, and I, for one, am not prepared to give the Minister of Trade and Customs any further powers in this direction than those which he now enjoys. In the mardo. ginal note we are told that this clause relates to the standardization of goods, and the application of trade marks to them. I find, on referring to the Commerce B i l that there is to be no inquiry under that measure as to the nature of goods, although it has been specially charged with such matwhich ters. Reference is made in it, not to method of manufacture, but to the manube facturer or producer. Why, therefore, should a distinction, be made in this stance ? There is nothing in the phraseology of the clause which would exclude trade - unions from its operation.",49

386,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,What is the objection to them ?,50
387,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The objection to them is that they are extraneous, and do not belong to this part of the measure. The English section, from which the clause has been adapted, deals specifically with marks indicating the character of goods.",50

389,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If the honourable member thinks that origin and mode of manufacture cover the ground which would be covered by retaining the word ""conditions,"" why does he wish that word to be retained ?

If that were the only reason 'that actuated the honourable and learned member, why is he still persisting in striking out the words?",50

395,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The Attorney-General as fair and ingenuous as usual.,51
396,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I want to face this question.,51
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Hav e we any constitutional authority to do what is proposed ?,51
398,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The State has the constitutional authority to do it for itself, and we say that if the State chooses to do it, we will permit it to register the mark which it puts upon the goods. I do not suggest that we have the authority to either order the State or to empower it to undertake any such work.",51
399,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is proposed to enable the State to say whether goods are made by unionists or non-unionists. "" Mr ISAACS - If the State chooses, why should it not do so?",51
400,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That is not the test of sweating.,51
401,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I have never put that as a test of sweating. The States would say whether the goods were made under sweating conditions or otherwise, and the only fear must be-and the honourable and learned member was challenged to state his reasons, and he did not do so-les t the State will undertake to inform the people whether or not , the goods are made under humane conditions. I am not going to yield to an objection of that kind.",51
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"What is to prevent the States from ,doing that now ?",51
403,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"When , we legislate for trade maiks the States will have no power to register their trade marks as trade marks unless we make provision for them in the Bill.",51
404,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,But cannot the State vent sweating without attaching a trade mark to goods?,51
405,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am not dealing with that question. My point is that we are dealing with a proper subject for trade mark law. A similar provision has been adopted by the British Parliament. The General. principle of this clause is one that has challenged in this House and outside It has been, held that you cannot have proper conception of trade mark unless the stead of an appeal to reason. mark belongs to the owner of the goods.",51
406,Mr SKENE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Does this clause follow exact wording of the English Act ?,51
407,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It follows the principle of the English Act, and the principle which I am now referring is is the English Act. The principle of this clause is that the ownership of the trade mark is not in the person in whom the proprietorship of the goods is. vested. If the words objected to are resisted on the ground that we should not permit the State if it chooses to inform the people as to the conditions of manufacture, I cannot accept the amendment.",51
408,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," The Attorney-General has charged me with being unwilling to allow the public to be informed as to whether or not goods have been manufactured under sweating or humane conditions. I want to tell him that that statement is utterly incorrect. My quarrel has all along been with the false theory that only union-made goods are turned out under humane and proper conditions, and it is for that reason that I have taken up the attitude of opposition to these particular words and to other clauses. If the Attorney-General had taken the trouble to read certain amendments I have suggested in connection with other clauses, he would have found that I recognise that the real issue should be between sweated ' and non-sweated goods. In all the States that have Arbitration Acts or Wages Boards which control the hours and wages and kindred conditions of labour, those industries to which the awards of the Courts or the determinations of the Boards apply, are carried on under proper conditions, whether the employees be unionists or non-unionists.",51
409,Mr WATSON,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Sometimes .,51
410,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,That has been disproved in a recent case.,51
411,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"There are evasions, no doubt, and the evaders should be severely prepunished. The distinction between unionists and non-unionists does not affect the issue of sweating at all, and it is because that false issue has been raised-a n issue alien to the whole spirit of Australian legislation-that honourable members are quarrelling with the proposal of the AttorneyI thought that the Attorneybeen General would have known better than to of it. make such charges. He made an ad eapa tandum appeal to imagined ignorance, inIt was unworthy of him, and unworthy of the the position he occupies to use any such arguments. I object to the State or to an association making a distinction which is to not a real distinction between fairly-made embodied in and unfairly-made goods.",51
412,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,There is not a word about unionists or non-unionists in this clause.,52
413,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"No ; but the distinction between non-unionists and unionists could be made under the provisions of the clause, and that is the cause of my quarrel with it. My objection to the words proposed to be struck out is that they make it possible to introduce a false standard of comparison in Australia-on e which is alien to the spirit of the wise Australian legislation which has provided fpr Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards to regulate the conditions of work.",52
414,Mr SPEN CE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," There is another phase of this question which I should like to present with a view to indicate the necessity of retaining the words which the honourable and learned member for Corinella wishes to strike out. Any one who has watched the trend of legislation in the States must realise that the interests of the public are being conserved to a greater extent every day. A Pure Foods Bill is before the Victorian Parliament, and measures of a similar character have already been passed by other States Legislatures, and we should, by means of the Bill now before us, endeavour to assist the States to carry on their good work. It can readily be recognised that in order to make effective the work of a State Department, or the work of an association which may be formed for the specific purpose of examining and certifying as to the quality of goods,, some provision must be made for the registration of the marks which will indicate that the goods have been made under satisfactory conditions, and that they are pure and up to standard. Let us take the case of the Victorian butter industry. Not only is the produce examined as to quality and branded accordingly, but inquiries are made as to the conditions under which it is manufactured. In the event of faulty samples of butter being received, inspectors are sent to the factories from which they were received to instruct the managers in the most approved methods of production.",52
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Is that done under a Trade Marks Bill ?,52
416,Mr SPENCE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"I am stating facts which I contend have an important bearing upon the amendment. Every one knows that the conditions of manufacture affect the quality of many goods-particularl y articles of food. At present the States authorities make provision for the inspection of meat and rabbits, and other articles of food, with a view to protecting the public as far as possible against the dissemination of disease. It is well known that goods made in sweating establishments have been the means of spreading disease, and it is surely necessary to provide some safeguard against the sale of such articles. Unless goods are made under wholesome conditions they cannot be pure. I contend that if we agree to the amendment, we shall incur considerable risk in this connection.",52
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I think that we are getting on splendidly. We only need to hear a few more speeches of a similar character to those which have been delivered by the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Darling, to realise exactly what is contained in this Bill. The Attorney-General has told us - now that it is an anti-sweating Bill, and the honourable member for Darling has informed us that it is a Factories Bill and a Health Bill.",52
418,Mr WEBSTER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The honourable member objects to those measures? Mr JOSE PH COOK --No . But I object to introducing provisions of that nature into this Bill. We ought to have been told what was the intention and purport of the measure. It is not a Trade Marks Bill in the ordinary sense of the term at all. It is a measure which seeks to promote the health of the^ people, and to insure that they shall work under fair conditions. I say that we have not the constitutional power to do anything of that kind. During the present and previoussessions, we have been endeavouring to secure an alteration in the Constitution, so as to permit the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to factory inspection and' uniform industrial laws. We cannot do that without first securing an amendment of the Constitution, but we can "" sneak"" those matters into this Bill, I suppose?  member calls insuring fair conditions to the workers- "" sneaking '' them into the Bill?",52
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I do not see the relevance of the honourable member's interjection. I am referring to the constitutional side of this matter.  not want to see it.,52
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I am just as anxious as is the honourable member that the people shall work under good conditions. I believe that he is honestly seeking to benefit the workers. But surely he - does not suppose that he is the only person who knows what is good for them?  best.,53
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,But the honourable member should credit others with endeavouring to do their best for the people.  member is not trying to do that.,53
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I am obliged to the honourable member for his opinion. I do not value it. ' He is not doing the best that he can for the workers by indulging in this sort of humbug. people outside will suffer as the result.of his action.  able member tells us in respect of every Bill.,53
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Trad e marks do not affect the health of the people, or the conditions under which they live and labour. They affect solely the quality o i articles of merchandise, and they have nothing necessarily to do with the conditions under which goods are produced. tainly they have nothing to do with the health of the people. We require another set of laws entirely to compass those objects. What we cannot do under the Constitution by means of factory legislation, we are endeavouring to clandestinely effect in this Bill . That is not straightforward conduct; and I venture to say that it will be entirely ineffective for the purposes contemplated by honourable members opposite should it ever be placed upon our statute book. We have not the power",53
424,Mr SPENCE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"To register a trade mark? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We have not the power to register a trade mark which relates to the conditions of manufacture and the examination of ""goods. As far as I can see, we can get no trade mark which will take the place of a Factories Act. If we desire to enact factory legislation and to provide proper sanitary conditions for the workers let us support the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in his endeavour to secure an amendment of the Constitution which will enable us to obtain control of these powers. Then, we may use them throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I say again, that in this Bill we are seeking to usurp a function which is already provided for in the Commerce Bill . That measure inquires into the condition of rabbits, meat, & c , and vests the Minister with power to brand them.",53
425,Mr SPENCE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If persons wish to register any such brand as a trade mark, why to do my should not they have power to do so?",53
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Why does the honourable member require to duplicate legislation? The Commerce Bill guarantees the quality of butter, meat, Sec, and the States themselves possess extensive and expensive paraphernalia to do the rest. As a matter of fact they are doing it.",53
427,Mr SPENCE,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"They cannot register a trade mark. The Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Would the registration of a trade mark enable them to examine a rabbit or a piece of beef any better than they are doing now ? Would it . afford an additional guarantee that the beef was fit for human consumption? I say again that under the Attorney-General's amendment we are setting up a piece of factory legislation which will enable us to assist the States in the inspection of factories and in the determination of the conditions which vaiious goods shall be made. Cer- It is not within our legislative compass to do that. To insert this clause would, at the best, be a meddling interference with the States. If we want these further powers let us take the straightforward course suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and ask the States to grant them to us.",53
428,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Robertson) After having listened t'o the discussion upon this measure, I am bound to confess that the honourable and learned member for An gas was right when he said that the clause is unnecessary, and should be struck"" out. If the honourable and learned member for Corinella is sincere in his desire to nullify the bad effect of the provision, he will agree to the suggestion of the Attorney-General, who is willing to confine its operation to a State which may appoint an officer for the purpose of having a trade mark registered. Either the honourable and learned member is opposed to the clause entirely, or he is not. If he is opposed to it he should vote for its excision, but if he merely wishes to nullify its bad effect he will accept the suggestion of the Attorney-General. In my opinion, the deputy leader of the Opposition was right when he declared that the object of the clause is to give an additional power to trade unions. It amplifies what is proposed in Part VII . of the Bill. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella will have no more effect than will the proposal of the Attorney-General, and, consequently, I decline to support it.",53
429,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I admit at once that the Attorney-General has gone a considerable distance towards removing the fear that I had entertained in regard to the possible application of this clause. But in the most complete way he has justified the discussion which has taken place. He admits that he had in his mind that a State or Commonwealth authority might interfere with the conditions under which goods are produced. I am sure that the public did not for one moment believe that such a sinister proposal was hidden in this clause, and I regret that the Attorney-General has not dealt more frankly with the Committee. Honourable members opposite must not imagine that they possess a monopoly of the desire to protect the workers. I claim that I am as anxious as is any honourable member to improve the lot of the working classes, and in support of that statement would point to my record outside. The desire of the Opposition 'is that this Bill shall be so framed that the public will be able to tell at a glance for what purpose it is designed. We do not wish it to be converted into a Public Health Bill, a Wages Board Bill, or anything of that kind, and we hold, therefore, that it should relate strictly to trade marks. opinion of the Opposition, the proposed new Part VII. is opposed to the interests of the workers, and will afford ground for a fair fight between the opposing forces. But we did not expect that an outpost in the shape of this clause would be put forward lest the main army might be defeated. We have not been fairly treated, and I resent the suggestion made by the Attorney-General, that the Opposition, in opposing this clause, are influenced by a desire to prevent all work being carried out under humane conditions. Our opposition is based on the one ground that such a provision as this should not be introduced in this part of the Bill, and that we ought to have had from the Attorney-General a frank explanation of the effect of a new clause brought in by himself. If we cannot repose the fullest confidence in the Attorney-General, we have reached a sorry stage. The honourable and learned gentleman told me the other day that he was Attorney-General not only for the Ministry, but for the House, and I should like him to deal with the Committee from that stand-point. He must have made the mental reservation that there was a power, in this, clause which did not appear on the surface, and he should have acted frankly",54
430,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,To what power does the honourable member refer?,54
431,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,The power to make examinations as to the conditions of manufacture,54
432,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I say that that is the argument of those who oppose the clause.,54
433,Mr KNOX,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,I hold that it is highly important that it should be clearly understood that the clause goes further than we at first believed.,54
434,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," In order to expedite business, I wish to withdraw my amendment in favour of that suggested by the Attorney-General. It covers a good deal of the ground, although, perhaps, not the whole of it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",54
435,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - Before moving the amendment which I . have indicated, I desire to intimate that I< propose to add it to the end of the clause,, so that if any honourable member has a prior amendment to move, he should at oncesubmit it. As it appears that no one deIn the sires to move a prior amendment, I move That the following new sub-clause be added :"" (3) This section shall, as to conditions of manufacture, apply to Commonwealth and Stateauthorities only."" Amendment agreed to. Proposed new clause, as amended, agreed' to.",54
436,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I understand that it is the desire of honourable members that we should proceed now to deal with the non-contentious clauses. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",54
437,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"That brings us to proposed Part VIII - protectio n of trademarks. I move That the following new clause be inserted :""78Q. Whoever(a) forges a registered trade mark; or (b) falsely applies a registered trade mark to> any goods; or (f) makes any die, block, machine, or instrument for the purpose of forging or of being used for forging a registered trade mark; or (a"") disposes of or has in his possession any die, block, machine, or instrument for the purpose of forging or of being used for forging a registered trade mark, shall, unless he proves that he acted without intent to defraud, be guilty of an indictable offence, and liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three years.""",54
438,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I wish the Attorney-General to state what will be the effect of the departure from the ordinary clause in the criminal code, which is embodied in the provision, that the person chargedUnless he proves that he acted without intent to defraud, shall be liable to imprisonment. The ordinary forgery provisions of a criminal code make the forgery and the mens re the two things necessary for a conviction. Here, apparently, the principle observed in the Customs Act of assuming the guilt of a person until he proves his innocence is applied to a limited extent. I would ask the Attorney-General what are the reasons for departing from the ordinary form of the criminal cod'e ?",55
439,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I cannot for the moment place my hand on the English Act from which this is taken, but I think that it is in the ordinary form. The offence referred to in paragraph a speaks for itself. The false application of a registered trade mark to any goods, which is dealt with in paragraph b may be the mere fact of false application, whilst I think that the offences mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs are of such a class that the person charged should at least prove that he had no intent to defraud So far as. three of these cases are concerned. I do not know how we could do otherwise than presume the guilt of the person concerned. But, as to one of them, I can understand",55
440,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"If a man forged a trade mark, I do not think that any one would believe his statement that he had no intention to deceive.",55
441,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The provision to which the honourable and learned member has called attention may be quite right, so far as paragraph b is concerned; and, perhaps, that is the only reason why it has been inserted. I do not think he can complain of the words in questibn.",55
442,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," In proposed new clause 78V, we have the following definition of "" forgery of trade mark ""A person shall be deemed to forge a registered trade mark who either(a) without the assent of the proprietor of the trade mark or the authority of this Act makes it or a mark so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive That provides a new terror for imitators of trade marks.",55
443,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Thes e words are in the English Act.,55
444,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"What commonly happens when B is sued for using a colourable imitation of A's trade mark is that he is cast in damages, ordered to account, and restrained from continuing the infringement. The Bill, however, also calls the offence forgery.",55
445,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It is not the applying, but the making, of the mark which is forgery. Proposed new clause agreed to. Amendments (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat the following new clauses be inserted :78R. Wlioever sells or exposes for sale, or has in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which any forgery of a registered trade mark is applied or to which any registered trade mark is falsely applied, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act, unless he proves(a) that he acted without intent to defraud; or (4) that the goods were manufactured in or imported into Australia and the trade mark was applied to them before the commencement of this Act, and were held by him bond fide and without intent to defraud. Penalty : One hundred pounds. 1 78s. Whoever imports into Australia any goods to which any forgery of a registered trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied shall, unless he proves that he did not knowingly import the goods in contravention of this Act, be guilty of an offence against this Act. Penalty : One hundred pounds. 781. Whoever aids abets counsels or procures or is in any way knowingly directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to(a) the commission of any offence against this Act; or (b) the commission of any act outside Australia which if committed in Australia would be an offence against this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. Penalty : One hundred pounds. Amendment (by Mr. posedThat the following new clause be inserted :78U -(1 ) The following goods are prohibited to porting competitor. be imported, and shall, if imported, be forfeited to the King :(a) All goods to which any forgery gistered trade mark is applied, which any registered falsely applied; and (b) all goods manufactured at any place outside Australia and having applied them any trade mark being the tered trade mark of dealer or trader in Australia unless the trade mark is accompanied by a definite indication of the country in which goods were made or produced. (2) All imported goods forfeited under section may be seized by any officer of Customs. (3) The provisions of the Customs Act 1901 apply to the seizure and forfeiture of goods under this section to the same extent as if they hibited imports under that Act. (4) Before taking any action under this or permitting any officer of Customs to act under, the Collector of Customs for the State require the person requesting any action on the part of the Customs to give security in accordance with the regulations.",55
446,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y, I wish to point out to the Attorney-General that an importer might import goods to which a forgery of a registered trade mark was applied without knowing that there was anything improper about them. M^r. ISAACS - Sub-claus e 4 might meet that case.,56
447,Mr MCCAY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"- I do not think that it meets the case to which I am referring. It prevents blackmailers from pretending to be honest friends of the public, but imported, it does not protect the importer innocently contravened the provisions of the Act. I shall not propose any amendler-General, ment, but I think that the Minister or may, the Collector of Customs should be emoccurred powered to forego forfeiture of goods any when satisfied that the importer has not seized wilfully contravened the Act, provided that being the forged trade mark is erased, and, pertroller-General haps, some penalty paid. I do not think effectually that an innocent Australian consignee should suffer for the wrong-doing of a foreign consignor.",56
448,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," Paragrap h b provides that goods imported into Ausshall tralia bearing the registered trade mark under of any locally-manufactured article shall be forfeited to the King. It is desirable that the Customs authorities shall have or power to confiscate goods to which a may locally-registered trade mark has been the ISAACS) profraudulently applied, but the paragraph to which I refer may be used by a local manufacturer as a weapon against an imAn imported article may bear as its registered trade mark, let us say, a lion, and under this provision a of a relocal manufacturer, by registering a lion or to as his trade mark, could prevent further trade mark is importations.",56
449,Mr KENNEDY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,Not if the trade mark to on the imported goods were accompanied regisby definite indications of the country in any manufacturer which they were made.,56
450,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"The manufacturer abroad the would net immediately know of the action of his rival in this country. Australia is this only a small market for many of the manufacturers of other countries. Knives go shall from Sheffield to all parts of the world, were probut the Australian market is not large enough to justify Sheffield manufacturers section in using special trade marks to meet Austheretralian conditions, until they know that may that is absolutely necessary. If a local manufacturer were to register one of these trade marks, he could cause the forfeiture of all goods then in transmission.",56
451,Mr ISAACS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Indi-Attorney-General) . - I propose to move several amendments in this clause, which I think will meet the objection which has been raised to it. The new sub-clause which I intend to insert is similar to a provision in the Commerce Bill. .Proposed new clause amended to read as follows, and agreed to(1) The following goods are prohibited to be and, if imported, may be seized as who has forfeited to the King :"" (2) Subject to the regulations, the Comptrolor on appeal from him the Minister, if in his opinion the contravention has not either knowingly or negligently, permit goods which are liable to be or have been as forfeited under this section to be delivered to the owner or importer upon security given to the satisfaction of the Compthat the improper marks will be removed from the goods, or that the goods will be forthwith exported."" {3) All imported goods liable to be seized under this section may be seized by any officer of Customs. (4) The provisions of the Customs Act igoi apply to the seizure and forfeiture of goods this section to the same extent as if they were prohibited imports under that Act. (5) Before taking any action under this section permitting any officer of Customs to act thereunder, the Collector of Customs for the State require any person requesting any action on part of the Customs to give security in accordance with the regulations, but the Collector of Customs may act under this section without any request. Amendments (by M i . ISAACS) agreed toThat the following new clauses be inserted :78V. A person shall be deemed to forge a registered trade mark who either(a) without the assent of the proprietor of the trade mark or the authority of this Act,-makes it or a mark so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive; or (4) falsifies any registered trade mark, whether by alteration, addition, effacement, or otherwise. 78W -(i. ) A trade mark shall be deemed to be applied to any thing if it is woven in, impressed on, worked into, or annexed or affixed to. the thing.

Progress reported. EXTRA SITTING DA YS : CLO SE",56
452,Mr DEAKIN,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," In movingThat the House do now adjoum, at this comparatively early hour, I desire to inform honourable members that we can scarcely hope to conclude our sittings at this time in future. In view of the early, close of the session, we must sit not only. for longer hours, but upon more days than we have hitherto devoted to the business of the country. I hope that honourable members after this early adjournment will give us their best assistance in disposing of the Trade Marks Bill this week, because, even with the extra days and hours at our disposal,, our strength will be taxed to the utmost to dispose of the measures awaiting our attention before Christmas.",57
453,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," It will be fairer to honourable members, especially those who are in the habit of returning to their homes at the week end, if the Prime Minister at once informed them whether he proposes to sit after the usual hour of adjournment On Friday next, and on the following day. Mr DEAKIN. *- Certainly; unless we have disposed of the Trade Marks Bill.",57
454,Mr KELLY,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"It would be almost as great .a pity to interfere with, the private liberties of honourable members in regard to going to and returning from their homes, as it would be to endeavour to force through the Trade Marks Bill by the application of the "" gag."" It seems to me that we ought to know definitely what we may expect, because many of us have to make arrangements ahead. For instance, I have made an appointment to proceed to my constituency, with a Minister in order to attend to certain departmental requirements. If the House is to sit late on Friday next, and meet on the following day, I shall have to abandon all my plans. It should be fully understood that the decision to sit on extra days is not due to any action on the part of the Opposition in delaying business, but to the desire of the Government to push through an undue amount of work before the session closes.",57
455,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y,"Robertson) If it were the intention of the Government to close the session at the end of next week, I could quite understand the proposal to sit on extra days. I trust that the Prime ADJOURNMENT. Minister will not this week sit later than the OF THE usual hour of adjournment on Fridays. I SESSION. see no reason, however, why we should not afterwards sit on Mondays, or meet at an of earlier hour on the ordinary sitting days.",57
456,Mr FRAZER,DISSENT FROMDEPUT Y," I hope the Prime Minister will adhere to his determination to make the fullest possible use of the time at our disposal between now and Christmas. In view of the time that has been lost, if not wasted, during the last few months, it is extraordinary to hear honourable members in opposition raising an objection to devoting a little extra time to the business of the country. They should have some consideration for representatives of the distant States, who are anxious to return as soon as possible to their constituents, whom they have no opportunity of visiting more than once during the year. We have very little to show for the time that we have been in session, and I hope that the Government will insist upon carrying through their programme. I shall give them all the assistance I can. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.40 p.m. 1",57
