2,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"For the information of honourable members, I present a report of an inspection of electronic voting equipment used in the parliaments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United States of America and in the European parliament building in Brussels. In the spirit of parliamentary reform, which we all seem to be embracing at present, this report is something of a landmark. The visit to which the report refers was undertaken with the agreement of the prime ministers of the countries which have a history of electronic voting. Sweden first installed a system in 1932 while Finland installed a system in 1951. Both systems have been upgraded. The other countries visited were Denmark and Belgium. The report summarises the technical aspects of the equipment used. A full description is held within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office. One of the major points made in the report is that none of the parliamentary , presiding officers or officials seen by the expressed any reservations whatsoever about the appropriateness or efficiency of the ment used. The report canvasses the advantages and disadvantages of electronic voting. The advantages were seen as a saving in the time of the House and its members; the immediate availability of the complete details of a division in both electronic and hard copy; the ability to show on an electronic display panel the question or matter before the House; and electronic recording of votes results, which leads to more statistical information being available. The perceived disadvantages were the loss of an opportunity for a pause or cooling-off period while divisions are being held; the possibility of a member voting for an absent colleague-of course that would never happen here-the lack of a visual indication as to how a member votes; the possibility of additional divisions being called; and the significant cost involved. These concerns have been addressed in the report and I believe largely dispelled. The mission considered that a system could be built that meets the needs of the House. While it would not be appropriate to estimate the costs on the House of Representatives chamber, a broad indication of the cost estimates are of the order of $3 million spent over a three-year period for both the House of Representatives and the Senate chambers. If electronicvoting is installed only in the House of Representatives chamber, the costs would be around two-thirds of the e'quiptnent costs and one-third of the installation and maintenance costs of $300,000 per annum over three years. The major benefit would be a saving in the time' of members of the House of approximately nine hours per annum. The equivalent is almost equal to one full day's sitting. There would also be other advantages in the more timely availability of information. The report recommends that the government, opposition and other non-government members confer to seek in-principle agreement to the installation of electronic voting equipment and that officers of the parliament undertake the team detailed planning for such a system which would be based on a' personal identification equip- card for each member. This system would require that members vote in the House itself. It was recently suggested that modem parliaments deserve to have modem management systems. Electronic voting is such a system. It would not only save the time of the House and its members but also improve the recording of the activities of the House and of the way in which visitors to the House can be informed of the activities of the House itself. I commend the report to all members.",11
3,Mr SINCLAIR,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and before the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) moves to take note of the paper, there are several aspects to electronic voting that I wish to refer to. Mr Speaker, I heard no reference to costs or time of installation in your statement. Could those aspects be brought to the attention of the parliament so we know what processes are involved, how much delay would be involved in its introduction and what the costs would be?",11
4,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"The broad indication that we have been able to ascertain is a cost, over a three-year period, of about $3 million for the installation of electronic voting equipment in both chambers. Again over a three-year period, the maintenance and installation costs would be approximately $300,000, which would be absorbed as part of that process. In terms of how quickly something like this could be developed, as I have indicated and as is indicated in the recommendations contained in the report, we would hope to get an in-principle decision in support of this from all members of the parliament. The Sound and Vision Office and the Parliamentary Information Systems Office would be asked then to do a full and detailed costing of the proposal, which would be given to government for consideration. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Sinclair) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1993-94 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1993-94 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the bill be now read a second time.",12
5,Mr COSTELLO,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Higgins) (12.37 p.m.)The opposition will not oppose these appropriation bills which are supplements to the government's main budget bills. The three appropriation bills before the House provide additional appropriations of $710 million which are partially offset by savings of $545.5 million from appropriation acts Nos. 1 and 2. The current bills therefore represent a net increase in expenditure of around $164.5 million. Today I would like to concentrate on the government's performance on the expenditure front, its inability to rein in the budget deficit, and its negligence in dealing with Australia's dangerously low level of national savings and resultant foreign debt crisis. Australia is sinking into a morass of foreign debt. This has not stopped the national Left declaring war on the government over the weekend, demanding higher expenditure and putting in a new ambit claim for new tax spend policies. The national Left, in complete defiance not only by the backbench members and trade union members of the national Left faction within the Australian Labor Party but also, apparently, with the concurrence of senior ministers in that faction, put out a statement over the weekend putting in new proposals for tax spend policies, essentially to bring the efforts of the government to a higher plane, as it were, and in a vote of no-confidence in relation to the current administration by the right wing faction of the Labor Party represented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). We are beginning to see the deep divisions in the Labor Party over policy come to the fore not only in relation to the budget but also in relation to the proposed industry statement which will be developed over the next couple of months. Deep divisions are emerging within the Labor Party over the role that the government should play in industry policy. The Left clearly wants the government to take an active role in picking winners and then tailoring policy to help those particular winners and, clearly, it wants the government to assume a much greater and much more dramatic involvement in relation to the economy and essentially to begin directing investment through tax breaks, depreciation rates and the· like. Does the Labor Party have no shame? Senator Cook says that the days of handouts to industry and of picking winners are over. Even the committee on employment opportunities which wrote the green paper Restoring full employment said in relation to industry policy: ... programs should generally be generic in nature rather than industry specific. The example set by the former minister for industry in picking personal winners should have been enough to deter and warn of the dangers involved in such a policy. Yet we see significant sections of the Labor Party operating on the motto: fingers burnt, lessons unlearnt-let us return to the policy of getting government ministers to pick those winners in private industry so that the government can ensure that funds and its policy of investment and the like is directed to them. Meanwhile, the national Left is digging in and preparing for a siege over the jobs levy. The Minister for Finance was saying on Sunday morning that a proposal for a jobs levy was located on the edge of a cabinet table, clearly implying that it was about to be pushed off the cabinet table and into the waste paper bin. But by Sunday afternoon, the national Left, apparently with the concurrence of senior figures such as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), indicated that it still was committed to a jobs levy, wanted more taxes on business and a new 60 per cent marginal tax rate in order to fund $3 billion in its tax and spend bid. Those initiatives would do nothing to improve national savings or improve the lot of Australians, especially the unemployed. The prospects of a sustained economic recovery is heavily dependent on Australia's ability to lift its critically low stock of al savings. Without a rise in national savings, Australia faces the prospect of another boombust cycle. What is even worse is that the government has had plenty of warning of this impending problem. The government itself commissioned a report, known now as the FitzGerald report because it was produced under the chairmanship of Dr Vince FitzGerald. On 2 April last year former Treasurer Dawkins announced that he had commissioned a report to be prepared by Dr FitzGerald on the major factors impinging on both private and public sector saving and the issues that needed to be addressed in lifting Australia's savings performance. On 29 June last year, Dr FitzGerald delivered that report on national savings to the Treasurer. Unfortunately, the government has taken no substantial interest in it apart from using it as a cover, an excuse, to implement a whole raft of tax increases in last year's budget, which it never had the decency to explain to the Australian people before the election and which it magically popped out of its conjurer's hat after the March 1993 election. , In relation to the last election, of course, the government's position was: we will announce our tax policy after the election. It essentially went into that election with no tax policy or, rather, a hidden tax policy-a tax policy to increase wholesale sales tax, wine tax and the like, after the mug punters had cast their votes in the election ballot. So we saw on budget night the FitzGerald report, which was a serious report and a serious attempt to address a very important issue in this country, namely the level of national savings, just became a smokescreen, an excuse to try to justify a government which had not been open and frank with the Australian people and which had gone into the last election with a deceptive position in relation to its tax policy. What did the report say? The report found that national savings· had fallen to critically low levels. It states: Our underlying structural rate of national saving has fallen to around 18 per cent of GDP, 5 percentage points of GDP below the average of the past three decades. nationWho did the FitzGerald report find is the chief villain in the erosion of Australia's national savings? It pointed the figure firmly at the Commonwealth government and it pronounced it guilty. The report states further: The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving. What did the FitzGerald report recommend to address Australia's savings decline? It recommended: ... the Commonwealth should seek to return its general government overall deficit to persistent surplus. What was the government's original response in the budget to this report? Its immediate response to a report, which it had commissioned and which had said that the government should be returning its position to persistent surplus, was to. go ahead and increase the budget deficIt-to take the budget deficit from an outcome ?f $14.6 billion to $16 billion. After the FItzGerald report on national savings had come in s-y­ ing, 'Listen, you had better start headmg south', the government headed north. It - ook a long journey south via a northward dIrection. It had almost a plea from the FitzGerald report for a commitment to start decreasing its budget deficit, but the government t-rne- out to be moving in precisely the opposIte dIrection. The government found itself in a difficult position. It also proposed to increase taxes, the secret taxes that it did not tell the people of Australia about before the election: the taxes related to petrol and wine; the wholesale sales tax' and the tax on accrued but untaken annual l-ave and long service leave. The logic of raising taxes to solve Australia 's nati-nal savings problem does not bear scrutmy, because merely raising taxes has only the effect of reducing private sector savings, which are also part of the national savings equation. There is only one w-y to raise savings; widen the gap between mcome and consumption. Let us examine the commitments given by this government in relation to its quest to in the budget deficit. In the One Nation statement the government had said that the budget would be back in s-rplus by 199--?6, even though it was commItted to promlsmg $8.6 billion in personal income tax cuts. The One Nation statement, as honourable members will recall, was supposed to introduce into the Australian 'economy the prospect that we become gang busters; that the Australian economy had taken off in such a way that the Prime Minister could give $8.6 billion worth of tax cuts and still get the Commonwealth account back into surplus by 1995-96. But the One Nation statement did not last very long because even prior to the March 1993 federal election the government's commitment had slipped. Now the target was for a budget deficit of between 0.5 and one per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Then came t?e election campaign. The government commltment to reducing the size of the deficit slipped even further. The target became a budget deficit of one per cent by 1996-97. During that election campaign, when the Prime Minister was being asked about his income tax cuts and how they fitted with prospects to reduce the government's budget deficit who will ever forget the famous words at th- National Press Club? The Prime Minister said, 'Look, I am not just promising income tax cuts. It is not a promise. It is l-aw-Iaw. I have put it into the statute. So do not come down here and ask me whether I am going to deliver. I have already delivered. It is l-a-w'. Of course he was probably misspelling law, and what he meant was I-o-r-e. That is probably what he had in mind when he was down at the press club talking about his income tax cuts and how they fitted with his proposals in relation to the budget deficit. On 21 July the then Treasurer took the rap for the deception that had been made to the Australian people before the last election. He announced that the promised tax cuts were under review. The next day the Prime Minister announced the indefinite deferral of the second round of the promised tax cuts. If this government could not deliver a tax cut which it said was law between March 1993 and the budget of 1993, rein who would ever believe that there is any prospect that it will deliver on those income tax cuts down the line? The people of Australia were promisednot just promised but delivered-an l-a-w income tax cut prior to the election, which disappeared by the August budget. The government came around and said, 'Look, we're sorry, we cannot deliver on those but we might do in four or five years time'-in other words, 'We can't keep our promise over four or five months, so why don't you trust us to keep our promise over four or five years?'. One would have to be as incredulous as some of the Labor backbenchers, who actually believe that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was doling out sports rorts grants on the basis of need, to believe that. We might as well face the fact: those income tax cuts have gone. This government has conveniently pushed them out beyond the next election, so it cannot even held to account in the next election for those broken promises. In the budget, the budget deficit target began sliding even further. The budget deficit reduction strategy had blown out again. In budget brought down on 17 August the government's deficit reduction target had slipped this time to 1.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. In the aftermath of the budget, in the government's wheeling and dealing with the Australian Democrats and the Greens to get the budget through, the deficit reduction target slipped even further; now it had become 1.2 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. In the space of 18 months the government's deficit reduction target had blown out four times, even after the government had ditched over $5 billion worth of tax cuts. If we were making forecasts like this in a prospectus trying to raise money from the Australian investing public, the Australian Securities Commission would be down there having a look at usMr Nugent-Less reliable than the weather forecast.",12
6,Mr COSTELLO,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Less reliable than the weather forecast-wanting to know how we were getting all of these projections. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is at the table, is going to bring Christopher Skase back from Majorca. He would want to know how all these sorts of forecasts had been made. When the Attorney-General brings Mr Skase back from Majorca-I hope he does, and not before time-to give some answers in relation to his administration of the Quintex group, I hope there is space on the jumbo jet for the whiteboard because the accounts might have been written up on the whiteboard and rubbed out. What if Mr Skase said to him, 'Look, I do my accounting on a whiteboard and then it is rubbed out? Does he think that would be accepted in the Federal Court? Why should we accept it from a federal minister? Why should there be one standard for the private sector and another for the government sector? This is always the approach of this governforeign ment-one rule for everybody else and one rule for us. Thousands of small business be people out there want to know why they have to keep all their records when the government does not keep it's. Thousands of people out there are being held personally liable for prospectuses, for companies that are making the trading forecasts, and they want to know why the government is never held to account and liable for its forecasts. We saw the budget deficit reduction target blowout over four times. We come to the critical question: why is it absolutely essential to begin to make inroads into the budget deficit and lift the insatiable demands on national savings by the public sector? The answer to this question also lies in the FitzGerald report: We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progressively further into foreign debt. The report said in no uncertain terms that Australia cannot continue to increase foreign borrowings indefinitely. It warned of the dire consequences which would face future Australians if we do not mend our pronigate ways. The FitzGerald report said that our overall level of foreign debt is already very high and that foreign financiers are building premiums into the terms on which they are prepared to finance us. What does that mean? It means that we are required by overseas lenders to pay higher rates of interest on our loans in order to compensate them for the risks associated with Australia's high level of external indebtedness, and it will become more and more expensive for Australians to get funds from overseas. A high level of foreign debt also makes Australia more vulnerable and increasingly at the mercy of international financial markets. As the FitzGerald report says: ... a high level of debt makes us increasingly exposed to changes in commodity prices, investor sentiment or other external shocks In short, Australia is mortgaging its prospects of future wealth and prosperity on a mounting foreign debt. With every extra dollar of debt which accumulates, the economic sovereignty, the ability Of Australians to choose freely and openly from every possible alternative which is before them, is diminished just that little bit more. But do not just take my word for it. Dwell for a moment on the words of the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer in his May 1987 ministerial statement. He boasted that the budget was on the verge of a return to a surplus and he said that we were: . . . on the verge of freeing ourselves and our young people from the dictates of international financial markets. ' He said the government was: ... clawing back Australia's financial independence. But to see this process through we cannot relax for a moment. To do so would risk slipping back down the slope of international indebtedness. That was at a time when net foreign debt was around $86 billion and now it is $178 billion. I am glad we did not slip back down the slope! We catapulted back down the slope, in terms of foreign indebtedness. At a time when the Prime Minister was saying to the Australian people, 'Look, we are going to free ourselves from the dictates of the international financial markets', we were only down by about $86 billion. By the time he had finished the freeing process we were down for $178 billion. This is the way he was actually managing the economy. This was the world's greatest Treasurer. This is the man who said, 'I ought to be given the Legion of Honour for all of my efforts, and I am going to free you from the dictates of the international financial markets by doubling the net foreign debt'. What an absurd performance. What a pathetic performance. At the end of the September quarter of 1993 Australia's net foreign debt stood at $178 billion. This is the burden which the fledgling economic recovery has to carryon its back. On 1 February in this House during question time the Treasurer pronounced the reces c sion was finally over and that happy days were here again. He released revised economic forecasts for the 1993-1994 financial year. But the storm clouds descended the very next day with the release of the December balance of payment figures which saw a blow-out in the current account deficit to $1.765 billion. FitzGerald warned the government over its management of the economic recovery. He said: We cannot, and should not, as a nation expect to finance future growth on our economy by going substantially further into debt to foreigners. The extent to which we can grow over the mid and late 1990s and beyond will depend on how much we. can lift domestic savings. The Treasurer has been recently paying lipservice to the need for the government to more aggressively rein in the Commonwealth deficit. But with all the big budget ticket items that the government is mulling over in the preparation for its budget, with all the ambit claims that are being put in by the national Left, with all the claims to try to deliver on pork-barrel promises to get themselves back there at the March 1993 election, I suspect that the Treasurer is in a good deal of trouble. The Treasurer has to placate and allay the fears of the financial markets, but more than that, he has to deliver. If the government was truly committed to solving the unemployment crisis and helping people find jobs it would, for a start, jettison one of the major structural impediments in the labour market in this country-a complex, clumsy, highly legalistic, union controlled system of industrial relations which is not designed to allow people to work on the best terms and conditions and in the best and most productive way for their own benefit and their own wages, and the benefit of the companies and corporations that they work for. If the government was truly committed to solving the unemployment crisis it would not be spending more money on shuffling unemployment queues-on those labour market programs that do not work, and merely rearrange the queue of one miJ1ion unemployed. Mr Swan-You do not believe in them at all.",15
7,Mr COSTELLO,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Do not get pious about unemployment in this country. You created it. In 1981 after the metalworkers had their sustained pay campaign, the present Prime Minister was barrelling metal industry leaders for the unemployment that they had caused. Those opposite will remember his graphic phrase, 'You've got 100,000 dead men hanging off your belt'. This government has one million dead men and women hanging off its belt. It deliberately induced a recession in country and put people out of work. It went about creating the recession we had to have. The Prime Minister himself said that it was the recession we had to have. I do not know why those opposite dispute it. What a great success he was. He set out to give us a recession and he succeeded. It is a pity that he did not succeed with some of his other promises, for example, in relation to foreign debt-the promises that he was making back in 1987. If the government were truly worried about this country's unemployed and if it were concerned to do something for its victimsthe victims of the Keating Labor government-it would set about building the foundation of a sustained economic recovery, turning its deficit to surplus, raising Australia's critically low level of national savings. We have a government which is threatening the prospect of a sustained economic recovery through its fiscal negligence and its misguided belief that any problem can be solved by throwing money at it. That will not prove to be what is necessary to give the unemployed real jobs in real corporations with real careers in the way that they want. Real jobs in real corporations doing real things for real wages come as a result of an economic recovery built on the back of business investment and, most particularly in relation to this speech, business investment that is financed out of Australia's savings and which does not take its toll in relation to foreign debt. With international interest rates still at low levels, the burden of servicing Australia's massive foreign debt has taken on a deceptive lightness. As the world economy picks up and the European and Japanese economies become more buoyant, there is a risk that international interest rates will rise as investors start to compete for funds. If international rates start to climb, the full magnitude of servicing Australia's massive foreign debt will begin to show in the burgeoning monthly current account deficit figures. Recently there has been a lot of comment that the missing ingredient in the economic recovery has been business investment. I raise the question: what is going to happen to this Australia's foreign debt and the balance on the current account when business investment begins to pick up further? Where is business going to find funds to finance new investment? The shortfall in national savings forces the private sector to look offshore and to rely on the savings of foreigners to fund investment. The continued shortfall between the amount of national savings and investment means that our reliance upon the savings of foreigners will continue and our excessive stock of foreign liabilities will get worse, increasing both the cost of funding and the nation's exposure to external shocks. This brings me to the question of why the Prime Minister deliberately engineered the recession of 1991-92. It was originally going to be a soft landing but it turned into the recession which Australia had to have. The rationale behind the government's scorched earth monetary policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s was to rein in Australia's current account deficit and the massive build-up in foreign debt. However, the scorched earth monetary policy of high interest rates sent the economy crashing into recession but has failed to address the underlying problem of the current account deficit. The real solution to the current account deficit problem was, and still is, to increase national savings. The greatest contribution which the government can make is to do something to get its budgetary position back into surplus. The fascinating aspect of this savings problem has been the Commonwealth's rhetoric directed against the states. In a press release on 27 June last year the then Treasurer started sermonising and hectoring the states about the need to increase national savings. He claimed that the Commonwealth had a track record of fiscal discipline and would play its part and that the onus was on the states to play their role. In an ultimate piece of hypocrisy he said, 'This may require state politicians to take hard decisions but the nation as a whole needs the states to improve their fiscal performance'. Mr Dawkins had some charts to try to back up his claim that the Commonwealth had been more effective than the states in restraining the growth in outlays. But those charts were nothing more than an elaborate exercise in conjuring. They contained no data, omitted important social security and welfare expenditure and could be described as an elaborate statistical construction. The fact is that a substantial amount of the fiscal restraint that has been achieved by the Commonwealth over the course of the last decade has come as a result of the Commonwealth squeezing the states. It has been a case of the Commonwealth government saying to the states, 'Do not do as I do, but do as I say. We will not be setting the example here, but we will be making you carry the can'. I can only say that it is a very lucky break for this Commonwealth government that we now have Liberal administrations in states such as Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. It is a very lucky break for the government, because those states have had the decency to try to address the things that this government never could and never would. This government continues to spend without applying to itself the standards it demands of others. It is a credit junkie in search of a continuous fix. It ignores the warnings of Dr FitzGerald in relation to savings. The future economic prosperity of this nation depends on this government coming to terms with the FitzGerald report, getting the budget back into surplus and lifting the stock of national savings. The tragedy is that this is a government that plainly has no idea and does not have the commitment to see that task through.",16
8,Mr SWAN,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"I rise today to support Appropriation Bill (No.3) because it is an essential part of the government's fiscal stance. It is critical to capacity to create jobs and to generate growth, exports and the jobs that we need in this country. The sad part about the contribution by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is that he talked about policy as though the Liberal and National parties have one or have a policy which they are prepared to admit to. The fact is that, apart from Fightback, there is no deficit reduction plan such as the government has to get the deficit down to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. There is no tax policy apart from the GST. Mr Costello-What was your tax policy before the election?",18
9,Mr SWAN,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Our tax policy is to cut the corporate rate of tax and to bring down income taxation for middle and lower income earners. We have a tax policy and the coalition has the GST, which the honourable member for Higgins and most members of the 56-strong front bench have spent the last year running away from. It is very interesting when we talk about the Appropriation Bill to see where the opposition stands on these questions. As the honourable member for Higgins walks out the door, I ask: what is the policy of the opposition at the moment on any fiscal matter? Let us see what the opposition has had to say about fiscal policy recently. I would like to look at what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has had to say. On 30 November 1993 on Lateline Kerry O'Brien asked him whether it was the case that he was still committed to the basic sense and direction of Fightback. When asked whether he was still committed to the broad approach, the Leader of the Opposition stated: ... the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles. So the Liberal Party is still, in broad terms, committed to Fightback. But, when it comes into this House and starts talking about taxation, do we hear anything about a GST, the great monster it still has hidden in its cupboard, which I am sure it will bring out after the next election if it is successful in being elected to the treasury bench? The our Liberal Party has no other taxation policy apart from its commitment to a GST. Kerry O'Brien went on to question the Leader of the Opposition. He said: You weren't always quite so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig MCGregor: 'I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry I like competition'. There is plenty of competition at the moment in the Liberal Party. There is no doubt about that. The Leader of the Opposition is true to form-he is certainly a dry-promoting competition on his 56-strong front bench. He said: There's nothing like putting yourself on the line. Kerry O'Brien asked: But you haven't changed philosophically? The Leader of the Opposition responded: No. The basic direction's the same, although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now. That is pretty right, because everybody coming into the front bench of the Liberal Party is all right and all dry. They have at least that in common with the Leader of the Opposition. Kerry O'Brien said: But when you say that the principles and the directions of Fightback still prevail, what are the principles and directions of Fightback that still prevail? The Leader of the Opposition said: Well, we still stand by the need to cut government expenditure. Kerry O'Brien asked: Massively? The Leader of the Opposition responded: Well massively is your word. Kerry O'Brien said: Well, ten billion over three years was Fightback. The Leader of the Opposition responded: Well obviously we're reviewing a lot of those cuts ... But let's understand it. The issue was a more efficient and more responsive public sector. Yes, we stand by that ... That is, 'We stand by the Fightback cuts and we stand by the GST that funded all of the other policies in Fightback'. So what we have is a Liberal Party which has been overtaken by professed populists, particularly down there on the Palm Beach peninsula-Bronny's peninsula-where they are all hard and dry. They are all running around the place pretending to be warm and caring but underneath they are still committed to the principles of Fightback, still committed to cutting public expenditure by $10 billion or $20 billion, and still committed to massive hikes in indirect taxation. What did we get from the Leader of the Opposition following the election, when he dumped the GST? On ABC radio on 20 April 1993, he had this to say: No I wasn't rolled on the GST ... I think probably in the Party Room more people spoke in favour of keeping it ... Than opposed it, that is. So the majority of members on the opposition benches-those who are game to admit what they stand forare still supporting the GST. Of course, the Liberal candidate in the recent Werriwa by-election made no bones about his support for the GST because that is where the rank and file of the Liberal Party is. Frequently in this House we have the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), advocating Asian levels of taxation and expenditure. Of course, what Asian levels of taxation and expenditure mean in Australia are cuts to revenue, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has said on many occasions, to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion a year. What programs will the opposition cut if we are to have Asian levels of revenue implemented in this country, as its Treasury spokesman frequently advocates in this House? Are we going to knock out aged pensions altogether? That is about $8 billion a year. We know that those opposite oppose all of the labour market programs, so they might pick up around a billion there. It probably means they want to oppose family allowance and family income supplements. In the absence of any other policy pronouncesmaller ments from the opposition, and given the statements of the temporary Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, we can only conclude that they still stand for all of those principles put forward in Fightback. One of the reasons we as the government have so many problems in trying to attack those opposite as to what they stand for in terms of policy is that we cannot finc:l any current pronouncements because they are too busy fighting each other over the leadership. An example is what the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) had to say on Four Corners on 14 February. The reporter asked him: How damaging is the leadership issue in terms of the Party being able to move forward in 1994? The honourable member for La Trobe said: Well it's horribly damaging because no one seems to take us seriously. Of course they do not take you seriously. We cannot take you seriously in this House. The honourable member went on to say: And with respect, it's difficult to take us seriously if we do not speak as one on issues, and if we've got no sense of where we are or where we're going or where we want to take the country. I repeat what he said: And with respect, it's difficult to take us seriously if we do not. speak as one on issues, and if we've got no sense of where we are or where we're going or where we want to take the country. That is the policy position of the Liberal Party in this House. How could anybody take the Liberal Party seriously? The opposition has 56 members in its executive when it adds in its whips and parliamentary secretaries. Every child player wins a prize in the Liberal Party. The opposition front bench is sardine city. You cannot fit in. You are all squashed up on the front bench all busily jockeying for positions on Four Corners and all the other programs in the country trying to see who is going to be the most humble, popular, warm, caring politician in the Liberal Party who can take over the leadership. We had Alexander Downer on Four Corners. Mr Downer, the honourable member for Mayo, was with his Victa on a Saturday afternoon genuinely mowing his 3,000 acres. He was very humble, very warm and very caring. But what has Mr Downer had to say about Fightback? What has he had to say about a GST? Of course, he was one of the foremost exponents of that policy. Now we have two new candidates endorsed in the lower House who are all pretending to be warm, cuddly and caring, but underneath are really representing the hard right edge of Reagan and Thatcher. That cannot be hidden from the people. You have endorsed a candidate in the electorate of Warringah. He believes that he is somehow a direct descendant of Queen Victoria and seriously puts forward the proposition that Australia should not have an Australian head of state. Who really believes that in Australia anymore? If that is the future direction of the Liberal Party, that is a very bizarre way to go. lt does not really matter which faction of the Liberal Party we are dealing with. There is Alexander Downer mowing his 3,000 acres with his little Victa on a Saturday afternoon. There is Tony Abbott, who thinks renters are inferior people. He was a central designer of and propagandist for Fightback. There is Amanda Vanstone, who runs around the place saying that policy development in the Liberal Party should be a bit like a bus-people should just know the general direction; they should not worry about whether they have brakes or seats. When we have those sorts of contributions from prominent people in the Liberal Party who are touted as having leadership potential, is it any wonder that we on this side of the House simply sit here and say, 'If we cannot work out what you are saying about current issues, then you must really believe in Fightback and you must still really be committed to all of those principles put forward in Fightback.'? When we get down to it-whether you are talking about industrial relations, or debating economics, or talking about the home childcare allowance, or talking about the child-care rebates-there is only one central policy that you believe in: lower wages and higher indirect taxes. For average people in this country that means lower living standards. That is ultimately where you are. Through all your policies, you want to engineer a redistribution of wealth in this country from the bottom and the middle to the top. That was what Fightback was all about. If you want to have a debate about the equity of what this government has done in tax, we are quite happy to do so. You have only one taxation policy: to support the GST. When this government brought in its tax cuts for lower and middle income earners, dropping the marginal rate for those people earning between $20,000 and $38,000 from 38c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar, what did we get out of you? You stood around the Senate and said that you were going to block the tax cuts. You were going to take the money out of the hands of average wage and salary earners. When we brought in a deficit reduction strategy, what did you do? You opposed it. Today you come into this House and pretend that you have some sort of policy framework to increase national savings and to get rid of the deficit. It is a joke. The only policy that you have is a $23 biIIion GST Fightback tax policy to tax the living hell out of every ordinary person in this country and skew the distribution of wealth up the scale. I would like to move on from the poverty of the policy position of the Liberal and National parties and talk about some substantial issues. One thing that this government is doing is addressing the substantial issues. We are addressing the substantial issues this year in the context of the white paper on employment opportunities. I think this appropriation biII provides the opportunity to talk about the challenges in the year ahead; the sorts of challenges which go to the heart of what sort of society we are and what we want to be. Jobs, living standards and family relationships are central to where this nation is going. Underlying these issues and policy responses are key questions about economic values and social values. How many jobs do we require in this country? How do we create them? Who will be the beneficiaries? How do we support our families? How can government policies assist families? How can we, as a community, live together safely and with respect and care for others? They are the key value questions which go to the heart of the government's policy response through the white paper and through programs such as Medicare, the home child-care allowance, the family allowance, the additional family allowance and so on. That is where those opposite are so derelict in their duty-they have no policy alternatives. In discussing these challenges that we face in the year ahead, I briefly refer to a speech that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave on Australia Day. He made the very important point that this economic recovery must be a recovery for all of us-not for some and not others. It is a key point which I believe those opposite will not address at all. They only have one solution for the problems of long term unemployment and that is to abolish all labour market programs. This government has a realistic approach to the problems of unemployment and employment opportunities through its policy of growth plus-get the economy 'growing as strongly and as quickly as possible but recognise that the beneficiaries of that growth will not necessarily be the long-term unemployed. The jobs created through that growth will go primarily to new entrants to the labour market and others who are re-entering the labour market. So what will we, as a community, do for those people who, through no fault of their own, will not be the beneficiaries of sustained growth, who will not obtain the jobs that come with that growth and who, unless there is strong intervention from the government, will remain on unemployment benefits permanently? Are we, as a nation, so rich and vigorous that we cannot or should not devise policies for those people? What do we get from opposition members and their ideologues in some of the employer organisations around the place when this government's green paper talks about a policy of growth plus and of job compacts? We get harangued with-rhetoric from the likes of Mr Ian Spicer and those opposite on the front bench, particularly the honourable member for Higgins, who today suggested that the sorts of proposals put forward in the jobs compact are si,mply make work schemes. They are not make work schemes; they offer real work, real experience and real jobs for Australians who would otherwise remain permanently unemployed and form a part of an underclass that this country cannot afford, socially or economically. We stand here as a government absolutely committed to significant initiatives in that area, determined to do something not only about growth and jobs through exports and so on but also about those people who cannot benefit in it. We want to share the growth and wealth in this country with these people. There is no concept of that from those opposite in any of their pronouncements. There has been no recognition from them that we as a nation-as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said some time ago-are now in the best position that we have been in for 30 years in terms of generating growth, the best conjuncture of economic circumstances that we have seen. We now have a strong recovery and low innation, which, if we get the settings right, give us the potential to make this recovery enduring, sustainable, and one which we can share with all of the community. But what do we get from those opposite and some of the ideologues in the employer organisations? As the recovery generates strength, which is then demonstrated in all of the figures, they get up and say, 'No, we can't do anything for the long-term unemployed. We can't have the jobs compact. We can't have any of that. That is just wasting money'. I assure those opposite that there is an absolute determination to move forward and to do something for those people. On this side of the House, we are committed to doing something for the long-term unemployed through the jobs compact and through labour market programs, which are absolutely essential to the long-term economic health as well as the social cohesiveness of this country. What is ignored by the ideologues and the economic fundamentalists opposite and those in employer organisations is that it is in the economic interests of the government to intervene through labour market programs to provide work experience and placements for the long-term unemployed. If we don't intervene it will lead not only to a very inefficient labour market but also, if not dealt with, to excessive wage innation, because the simultaneous coincidence of high unemployment and scarcity of available vacancies could occur simply because there could be a complete mismatch between the vacancies that are emerging and those people that are available to fill them. For reasons of economic efficiency, there a very powerful case for the jobs compact. But the case is made even more powerful for reasons of social cohesiveness. Those opposite come into this House and talk about values. There is one value held dear by all Australians: looking after mates-putting a helping arm around those less fortunate than themselves and helping those who are innocent victims of economic restructuring. For those opposite to maintain that there should be no special intervention for these people, and to then talk about values and to complain about rising crime rates and so on, simply exposes how uncaring and hypocritical the opposition really is. A recent report from the Australian Institute of Criminology makes the very obvious link between lack of necessary interventions in this area and the development of a US style underclass and rising rates of crime. There is a very valid reason for the opposition to support this appropriation bill. If the opposition is really concerned about the core values of prosperity, growth, equity and so on, there is no other path to take than the fiscal strategy put in place by this government and the appropriate social policies that accompany it.",18
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Mr Jenkins)Before calling the honourable member for Curtin, the chair advises the honourable member for Lilley that earlier in his speech he transgressed on a couple of points of order: firstly, by not referring to members by their electorate and, secondly, by not referring his remarks through the chair. It causes the chair some consternation from time to time when 'you' is used. The chair feels somewhat vindicated in not interrupting the honourable member for Lilley because later in his speech he was well within those standing orders. I understand that the transgressions probably occurred in the 'heat of battle'.",22
11,Mr ROCHER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"The paucity of the argument of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is pretty apparent. He spent a good three-quarters of the time allocated to him speculating about what coalition policy might or might not be and giving his interpretation of the sayings of is various people-throwing in a few bogies such as Reagan and Thatcher. Generally, it was sort of rhetorical nonsense that we hear so often from those who find it difficult to say anything positive about what their government is doing. It is a strange old world when we see members of the governing party worrying about attacking a coalition in opposition that has no chance of innuencing the decisions of government-and will have no chance until after the next general election. The honourable member would have spent his time more fruitfully expressing a positive argument-if he could find the positives to express. As we know, he spent very little time doing that. I notice that he referred to the coalition's alleged attitude towards employment. While the honourable member might have been grievously misrepresented in reports that I read, I understood that he and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) were not too happy about their own government's .green paper. He failed to acknowledge that and, apparently, has changed his mind. If I misunderstood the reports about his attitude towards his own people's paper on employment and long-term employment I apologise, but I do not think that is the case. The truth is that the honourable member for Lilley and those on his side of the chamber are embarrassed about the levels of unemployment in this country and, on top of that, the levels of underemployment, which probably double the formal figure of nearly one million unemployed in this country. He says his government stands for employment and stands to remedy long-term unemployment. Well, it has been in office for about 11 years. God help us if government members did not stand for employment. All they have managed to do is give this country a legacy of something approaching two million people unemployed and also underemployed because some people simply do not choose to seek work given the hopelessness of the situation. These bills set out to augment the budget which was brought down in August last year. The 1993-94 budget has really failed to give hope to those people who are currently suffering in the aftermath of the greatest economic recession in Australia since the 1930s. This was a recession presided over by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and was a recession-as we all know-that the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, insisted we had to have. Labor has mauled those of its loyal supporters who need the government to initiate a program of budgetary reform and to restore a sense of balance to the nation's finances. Government members talk of solving the unemployment problem but the figures stand there for everyone to read. They talk about the problem but they have not come to grips with it, and the prospects of them doing so in the foreseeable future are very bleak indeed. Job and training levies, higher personal taxation and a set minimum corporate tax rate are about all this government has to offer. That is all we are hearing in the run up to the next budget, which we understand is to be brought down in May. There is not much imagination there and there is not much to give people hope that the government really does have policy. The honourable member for Lilley and others-the Prime Minister is doing it nowspend a lot of time talking about the absence of coalition policies. It would be very interesting to see the written policies of Labor. Despite the rhetoric, I have yet to see written policies from Labor such as those produced by the coalition at the most recent general election. Until I do, I am not going to be influenced-and I hope other people will not be influenced-by this claptrap that government members go on with about coalition policies when they do not have any written policies to put before the public of Australia. The honourable member for Lilley was trying to convince us that the budget represented policy. That is not a Labor Party policy; that is something produced within the shadow cabinet. It has no relevance to Labor Party policy. It is presented as a fait accompli. The truth is that the current unemployment malaise was created by the true deceivers opposite. They now resort to bandaid measures to treat the festering sore of chronic unemployment and chronic underemployment. To delude some in our community, government members set out to get them to believe that the government really cares for those in need. No attempt is made to remedy the causes; only the symptoms are receiving attention. That is the point we try to ram home every opportunity we have. Only last weekend we saw the loony left of the Labor Party outline proposals to increase the levels of taxation for both businesses and individuals. It claimed it wanted to create jobs whereas, clearly, if such proposals are adopted they will actually cost jobs. For Australia to accelerate its move into the Asian business arena we need to begin harmonising our tax regime with the region. Competitiveness within the region is, of course, of immense importance if we are to be able to match the dynamics that prevail in our neighbourhood, our region, and if multinationals are to base their operations in Australia, as seems to be an objective of Labor. Worse still, the Left has recommended that the budget deficit be increased which would have the detrimental impact of reducing aggregate savings even further, and further worsen Australia's balance of payments problem. Unemployment though is undoubtedly the major problem now facing Australia. On this point I would imagine all of us in this place surely agree. Where we differ is the means by which to remedy the problem. Talk of Labor's social conscience is diversionary and deliberately intended to ignore the coalitions's appreciation of the real problem at hand. The coalition's sentiments need to be matched by the government. That involves a determination to follow a policy line which at times may be painful but will solve the unemployment problem in the medium term, and there is no sign of that. We in the coalition are the parties representing those who truly care. We do not made pretend to care; we actually do government has had the opportunity to use the 1993-94 budget to re-establish its financial The credentials. Unfortunately, Labor has failed take the corrective action that was needed, factors-particularly and needed badly. It is of concern that the government has allowed domestic savings to continue to fall; the budget deficit, even on its revised estimajor mate, to reach $14.75 billion this financial year; business investment to fall to a record low; and the mix of government outlays to at shift in favour of consumption at the expense of investment. These matters are all of conlow. cern because, managed effectively, they offer the means by which the Australian economy can generate real and lasting jobs. Aggregate national savings in the 1992-93 year were at the lowest level ever as a proportion of gross domestic product and in real dollar terms. According to the ANZ Bank, savings were actually negative in 1991-92 and 1992-93, with borrowing by the public sector for consumption purposes exceeding the total savings generated by the business and household sectors for both of those years. That is amazing stuff, and quite unprecedented. . This serious shortfall in domestic savings, combined with Labor's spending sprees, is forcing the private sector to tum to overseas borrowings at a time when the demand for foreign savings is highly competitive. Reliance on foreign savings has resulted in an increased level of foreign indebtedness as well as increasing the cost of borrowing. It further opens the Australian economy to the effects of external economic shocks. The FitzGerald report made very clear who the main culprit in this decline was when it said: The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving. This major structural decline FitzGerald traced back to the excesses of the Whitlam years, but it is clear that this government has made a substantial contribution of its own to lower national savings levels in recent years. While the government has been claiming that the deterioration in public sector saving . has been cyclical in nature, Dr FitzGerald it clear that this slide has been anything care. The but cyclical. He noted: main cause of the fall in our saving performance is not cyclical factors (as saving is still low to even after recovery) but underlying structural the structural decline in public sector saving. FitzGerald noted that reversing this structural decline in our national savings will require a effort on the part of the public sector to restore public sector finances. Investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is its lowest level in 40 years. Of this, investment in plant and equipment is at a postwar Australia needs a massive injection of investment in productive assets if the recovery is to be sustainable and real jobs are to be created. The public sector, comprised of federal, state and local governments, has been cutting back on its contributions to overall investment. The national accounts show that total public sector investment has declined whereas consumption has skyrocketed. The investment in public infrastructure that does occur is a pale imitation of the past quality public sector investment. Much of the investment now occurring is not in revenue earning productive investments but in social capital. This is reflected by the decline of investment in public trading enterprises. The continuing shift to consumption from public investment has been made worse by the rapid increase of consumption 'spending whilst public investment has plummeted. Mike Nahan of the Institute of Public Affairs has stated that public sector consumption spending grew at an unprecedented rate over the four years to 1992-93. Of this, the government borrowed more than $15 billion over the last two years just to cover the running costs of its non-commercial operation. The objectives which the government should pursue with vigour are clear if the level of national savings is to be markedly improved and if sustainable growth in the private sector is to be achieved. The government has to reduce the budget deficit and move it into surplus. It has to reduce the ratio of consumption to investment and increase both public and private investment in real terms. It has to bring forward the deficit reduction program from 1995-96 to 1994-95 and it has to resist reducing the budget deficit by increasing taxes and charges. Labor's revised estimate of a budget deficit of $14.75 billion is a massive turnaround from its surpluses of only a few years ago. The turnaround is of the magnitude of $20 billion. It cannot be blamed just on the impact of the recession. If the government's debt reduction strategy is ever put in place, it still result in a budget deficit of $5.8 billion in 1995-96. We should have been aiming for a budget surplus by then and not a deficit. The government recognised this as a desirable goal in its One Nation economic statement of a little over a year ago. That document called on the government to produce a budget surplus within the same time frame that Labor now anticipates producing a budget deficit of, as I have just mentioned, nearly $6 billion. It is instructive to observe that the government's most recent budget deficit figure for 1996-97 is based on growth foreof casts that are even more optimistic than the forecasts contained in the now infamous One Nation statement. So we have every reason to be worried as to whether the government's new fiscal targets, such as they are, will be reached. The government has imposed on this country a chronic budget imbalance of a magnitude that dwarfs the budget surpluses of a few years ago. This chronic budget imbalance seemingly has no end in sight. Rather than a reduction in the budget deficit, what we have under this government is an increase in the size of the budget deficit for the current financial year and an increase in the public sector's call on national savings. That is very significant. If Labor's growth forecasts are not realised-which would be the usual state of affairs, given the record of this administration-the Commonwealth's finances are in even more serious trouble. In terms of shifting the increasing imbalance between public sector consumption and investment, it appears that Labor is not prepared to act in a decisive manner. Even the most hardline response from the government shows that, based on budget projections, capital outlays are expected to decline by 42.1 per cent between 1992-93 and 1995-96. In the same period, recurrent outlays are to increase by approximately 22.5 per cent. This is a guesstimate over a period in which the nation is supposed to expect above average economic growth and, hopefully, rapidly improved job creation. The question that arises is: why will the Commonwealth's future non-capita I expendiwill ture outlays be rising at such a rapid rate? Surely there will be a decline, if its aims are met and if its forecasts are accurate in the welfare bill, and an increasing ability to pay for it, if its forecasts are accurate. It appears most likely that any improvement in the budget deficit position will be squandered on projects that are dear to the heart of the Labor Party but do little to aid real job creation improve Australia's competitive position. That situation will largely arise because of Labor's grovelling stance before the perceived might of certain pressure groups. We all know about that. We could, if we chose to, get on to the sports rorts as an example. Perhaps that will be done later today by others. Programs are created that are promoted as being worthwhile by this government but, on closer inspection, are just a method of providing a base from which political correctness and government largess can be spread. The government needs to keep key objectives in mind as it frames the upcoming budget. The deficit reduction strategy should be a surplus creation strategy. The government needs to redress markedly the ratio of consumption spending to investment spending in favour of investment. It is necessary that the government bring forward its deficit reduction strategy, meeting tighter targets in 1994-95. The government also needs to reduce the current fiscal imbalance, not by increasing taxes but by showing a firm hand and reining in its recurrent expenditure. In past, much proposed belt tightening by the government has largely been achieved by reducing funding to the states. This should be achieved by the government cutting its own consumption.

12,Mr ELLIOTT,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"I am pleased to join in the discussion on Appropriation Bill (No.3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) before the House this afternoon. It is worthwhile at the outset to relate a few of the additional expenditure measures involved. Some honourable members have suggested that they are program items that are in fact discretionary, that they are not significant so on. Included in the measures that the House is discussing this afternoon are a $50 million grant for the capital works associated with the Olympic Games site in Sydney; $20.7 million for the rural adjustment scheme, which, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is very important to many areas of rural New South Wales; additional funding relating to the health sector; additional funding as a result of the government's commitand ments to the people who suffered in the bushfires in New South Wales in January; and also measures relating to child care because of the additional take-up rate of child-care assistance to what was anticipated at budget time last year. The fact that those measures are there suggests that the government has quite rightly identified areas where there will be a need for additional expenditure and has provided for that through these appropriation bills. In aggregate, something like $165 million is attached to the measures in Appropriation Bill (No.4). The debate this afternoon has obviously not focused on that. It has been a more wide-ranging debate, as these appropriation debates usually are, on the state of the economy, on various people's expectation about growth and other things and on employment. If we are going to have that debate, I think we should start from the basis that the economy has grown strongly since the budget was brought down last August. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has brought in revised figures for the budget deficit. At budget time, we were told the by the opposition that the $16 billion figure was going to blowout, and that all these problems were going to occur because the government's estimates at that stage were unsound. Of course, the economy has grown far faster than anyone anticipated at budget time, to such an extent we have had a revision in the budget deficit to $14.75 billion for 199394. That is still significant, but it is perhaps worth noting that that deficit represents only 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. If we look at most of our comparable trading partners and compare their budget deficits with our deficit even for this year-it is at the bottom and point of the cycle in terms of the cyclical adjustment that has occurred with the recession-I think we can legitimately say that it is a pretty good starting point. In the next few years the recovery will gather pace. Clearly employment will gather pace. We have the settings right in terms of low interest rates, a low inflation rate and a low inflationary expectation to ensure sustainable improvements in our budget position over the next few years. That is why at budget time we had the deficit reduction strategy through to 1996-97. The estimate is that we will work towards approximately one per cent of GDP by 199697. There will be various ebbs and flows in expenditure and revenue forecasts throughout that time, but one thing we can say is that the government has demonstrated a real determination to ensure that we do have a mature outlook towards outlays and that we do have a responsible fiscal process through that period of time. We have the track record to support that. In the 1980s we actually had three budget surpluses. I listened to the contributions made earlier by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). They were berating the government because of the deficit. The fact is that the three surpluses which have occurred in the last 30 years have been under a Labor government. The government has made it clear that, over the next few years, it will have a responsible strategy as far as the deficit reduction plan is concerned. We have done that while keeping faith with important commitments such as reducing the company tax rate to 33 per cent, to get ourselves on a comparable basis with our trading partners and our near neighbours which have very significant economies and which are our competitors. We have done that while implementing the tax cut, in fact, bringing forward the tax cut for this financial year to 15 November. Over a full year it means that $3 billion worth of tax cuts will be delivered to the Australian taxpayers. Again, that has helped stimulate the economy. We have also recognised that, in formulating our budget plans, we need to have a recognition of those cyclical issues that the opposition decries but, nevertheless, are now showing through in the economy. At the time of the One Nation statement it was important that there be a commitment by the government to kick-start the economy. It was not happening in the private sector; it had to happen because the government took initiatives, as it did with the rail program and all sorts of other things that occurred at that Over $2 billion worth at that stage was put into kick-start the economy. That was important. It has been shown that it was the right strategy in terms of our economic performance since that time. The Investing in the nation statement built on that and gave incentives to the private sector as far as depreciation allowances and major development project incentives were concerned. All of those things were designed to encourage the growth that is now occurring in the economy. Our economy is now growing at 3 th per cent. I would suggest that that is very significant when compared with the performance of our trading partners and the OECD countries. Most of those countries come out and talk to us because they want to find out more about how they can achieve growth rates of that level. I think we can achieve more. All the indications are that, over the next couple of years, the economy will grow at an even faster pace. But it will be a sustainable growth. That is just as important in this context. I think we have the right ingredients to have a sustainable and durable recovery for Australia built on that low inflatio_n setting and the fact that we are starting to get jobs growth and the right balance through the economic process. If we look at the position at the time of the One Nation statement and the Investing in the nation statement, the opposition attacked every single one of those measures. We have had something like 13 cuts in interest rates in the period since February 1990. On every one of those occasions the opposition said, 'This is not the time. We're forcing the pace. There'll be a run on the dollar. There'll be all sorts of other consequences because interest rates have been cut too much in their terms'. :1 was important to bring those interest rates back, and they were brought back in a way that will be sustained in the future. The outlook for inflation means that interest rates can stay at their lowest level in 30 years for an extended period. There is nothing more important for Australia's sustainable economic recovery than keeping that low inflationary setting and those low inflationary expectatime. tions. Once again, we need to encourage a setting in which business and all those people who are interested in doing business in the economy are planning and investing on the basis of that low inflation outlook. All of those things point to the success that has been achieved in building the recovery in a strong and durable fashion. There is no doubt that, when considering where the economy is heading in the future, everyone's focus is on employment, and rightly so. That is the last element, if you like, in the recovery process. It always appears to be that way. Over the last six months, we have seen employment growth: about 148,000 jobs have been created in that period. We can be confident about the future of that structural improvement in employment and the employment outlook. The worrying indicator in all of the deliberations that have been going on is the number of people who are in the long term unemployed category. That is a matter that should be of great concern to the whole of the parliament. It is not a case of just coming in and rubbishing every proposal that comes along; it is a case of recognising that it is an issue that the nation has to deal with in a very direct and appropriate fashion. How is that best achieved? Despite the opposition's continuing negativity, a range of those labour market programs has been identified in various studies as being appropriate mechanisms to meet part of that challenge. Other things need to be done, but those arrangements, which have the appropriate flexibility, are part of the important adjustment that needs to take place in order to provide for the long-term unemployed. Much of that long-term unemployment does have as its core the structural adjustment that has occurred in the economy. Necessary structural adjustment has occurred in regions right across Australia in order to improve our competitive position; nevertheless, it has been at a substantial social cost that we, as a government, are determined to address. It is a case of finding the right balance when addressing that. It is my view-and I think the employment green paper makes this clear-that development of something like the jobs compact is an appropriate way to target much of that con- . cern. It is important that, as part of that process, we try to look at all of the initiatives that are currently in place to ensure that we are getting the optimum value out of the programs that exist and, where necessary, we build on those in an appropriate way. The fact that the economy is growing and the employment situation is improving is obviously part of that process. But it will be just as important in the forthcoming budget to address those issues. Inevitably, there will be a range of speculation as to the appropriate mechanism to do that, but what is important is that, at the end of the day, when the budget is delivered on 10 May, we can be satisfied that real sustainable effort is being made in that regard. All the opposition's hysteria about new taxes, other charges, a blow-out in the budget deficit strategy and so on will be shown for the sort of humbug that it is in this exercise, because the government will deliver on those strategies, as we have committed ourselves to do. Let us look at some of the other things that need to take place in the nation. Opposition speakers spent a long time talking about national savings and the FitzGerald report. One of the key areas of national savings that has been important for the nation over recent years is that of national superannuation, the comprehensive retirement incomes package. What has the opposition's approach been to the determination and the drive on the part of the government to deliver on that retirement incomes package and to recognise the nature of the demographics of the population and the need to focus on providing for people's retirement incomes? As recently as last week, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that he would not proceed with national superannuation as proposed by the government. He apparently does not believe that the fact that workers did not have access to national superannuation in the past is of much concern. I assume that he wants to go back to an arrangement such as applied before Labor came to power, where the vast majority of award based workers had no access to superannuation; superannuation was not a prerogative of the work force throughout the nation. That attitude has changed in a way that will mean there will be sustainable national savings and ,real improvements in the national economic outlook for people to provide for themselves responsibly through a superannuation regime built on the various social securia ty arrangements that provide the appropriate safety net for people as they phase into superannuation arrangements over the next few years. I think the importance of that to national savings has been underestimated. The fact that the opposition wants to wind the clock back in that regard highlights the fact that much of its talk about national savings has really missed the mark very badly indeed. There is no doubt that more things need to be done to promote investment. This government has ensured that we have competitive tax scales for companies. We have a regime that has ensured that the profitability of the company and manufacturing sectors is improving and business outlook is more positive. Surveys show that business is increasingly more positive about the future. One assumes that the lag in investment from the private sector will start to improve with the profit share being where it is today. The initiatives that have been taken by this government are worth recounting. I have mentioned the reduction in the company income tax rate to 33 per cent. We have had a change in dividend imputation, removing the double taxation on dividends. We have also had a range of new initiatives as far as the depreciation investment allowance is concerned. All of those measures are designed to give companies more scope to be positive and aggressive with investment. I think the challenge is there for business and increasingly it is taking up that challenge to provide more investment. More investment will mean more jobs in the future and more scope for the Australian economy to grow and be competitive in a world sense. The other important aspect for the company sector is the structural adjustment that has occurred there. We need to look at the change that has occurred in relation to the manufacturing sector of the economy. We need to look at the trade position over the last few months, at growth in manufacturing exports and what that means for industry. Business has a more outward looking focus because we have removed tariff protection and the other things that ensured that we had closed economy. This government changed that. We have made our economy open and competitive. We have made business look outwards to explore and develop new markets. We have also created the circumstance where companies that are coming to invest in Australia can move forward and look competitively at Australia. We recognise how important it is to promote in Australia regional headquarters of businesses so that we ensure that we have the breadth of industry that is necessary in the global world of trade. That is a very positive initiative and one that is gathering momentum. We have seen that Australia is increasingly being looked upon as a hub for financial services and a range of other hightech services. All of those things add to the breadth of the economy and add to the scope for a sustainable recovery. This will mean that as the economy picks up over the next few years the opposition's drive to talk the economy down all the time will be seen for what it is. It will be seen as a political exercise that has very little significance other than in scoring a few cheap political points. It is designed to keep the Leader of the Opposition where he is-or, in the case of the honourable member for Higgins, to allow him to replace the Leader of the Opposition. This is really what parliament has been about so far this year. There has not been much focus on the other issues. I think the appropriation bills that we have before us today highlight the fact that there has been substantial economic change over the last 12 months. It is very hard to look back over that period and not be impressed by the fact that we have continued to generate strong growth. We have an underlying inflation rate of two per cent and an interest rate regime that is the lowest in 30 years. With this setting it means that business can look to expand in productive ways over the next few years. We can compare that sort of scenario with the fact that, as I was saying, the opposition has continually wanted to diminish that recovery. It has continually wanted to undermine the strength and the growing nature of the economy across the various sectors. It keeps referring to the fact that we have had budget deficits over the last few years. Our public sector' borrowing requirement is still comparatively small 'and is still very competitive in world terms, yet the opposition wants to portray those deficits as being somehow irresponsible financial and fiscal management. The fact is, much of the borrowing that occurred in the late 1980s did not come from the Commonwealth government sector; it came either from the states or from the private sector. We have turned that around in a way that means that there is now a focus on savings across the board. We have suggested that appropriate stringencies apply to the states in a number of areas, but we have also been prepared to tackle those issues of microeconomic reform that mattered in the national economy-be they in rail, or be they in the broader areas of trying to get agreement across the electricity grid and so on. So we have not shirked those responsibilities in telecommunications and elsewhere. The opposition has continually said that those measures have not gone far enough, but we have been concerned to ensure that employment, as well as the economic conditions, remains important. That should be a focus for us all. What would the effect have been of the idea that the opposition advocated in Fightback: to slash and burn the budget deficit-$9 billion or $10 billion worth of cuts in outlays? As far as the government is concerned a massive cutback in government services, .in rural-regional areas, and in support to people such as the aged and the frail is riot acceptable. Right through our policy process we wanted to ensure we had a sound financial position built upon a recovery. The government kick-started the economy with the One Nation and the Investing in the nation statements, and gradually that was wound back to enable the private sector to take up the investment as its confidence in the economic recovery grew. The ingredients are there now for that investment to occur. I believe these appropriation bills reinforce the strategic way in the government has approached its management of the economy over its time,in office. I have no doubt the adoption of these measures and the measures that will flow through in the budget for 1994-95 will ensure that the sustainable recovery and the jobs growth which are so vital to all Australians are achieved in accordance with the government's objective throughout its time in office.",26
13,Mr MACK,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"A great deal has been said in recent debates about democracy, executive and ministerial responsibility, and accountability. A great deal has been said about the reform of question time, the distribution of sporting and cultural grants and the print media inquiry. Honourable members and commentators have spoken and written with great pretentiousness about the debasement of the noble Westminster system of government. The press gallery has had a field day commenting on the hypocrisy of all concerned. Underlying all the partisan point scoring, and largely superficial commentary, is not only the most important political issue of today-the power of the executive versus the power of parliament-but how Australia's political administrative structure will face the future and the need for constitutional reform. Only those with a short-term view or vested interest can be satisfied that the country is equipped to face an international competitive future with our hybrid Westminster-American constitution and a federal system cobbled together by the state politicians of the 1890s. I make a brief and no doubt forlorn appeal to honourable members to drop the parliamentary conventional wisdom and shed their adversarial Mr Hyde suits and go into Dr Jekyll mode, and to the press gallery to drop its court jester role, and admit that question time, as John Paul, a senior lecturer in political science at the University of New South Wales, said in a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, is an 'unparalleled disgrace' to all concerned. Any dispassionate observer would also admit that executive dominance has evolved to such a degree that this House has only marginal public relevance. Some members of both this House and the press which gallery who have been here too long or who have lost touch with the real world either cannot recognise that relevance or, even worse, like it the way it is. The truth is that question time is a largely hypocritical charade which only appeals to people's worse instincts, both here and in the community. The press gallery must share the blame, for the gallery is an integral part of the parliamentary institution. For the vast majority of Australians the parliament exists .only through the media. Had the gallery consistently reported a serious analysis of parliament, real reform would have occurred many years ago. . Contrary to claims by some honourable members about how the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has debased parliament and question time, the running of parliament has not been greatly different for many years, both here and generally at state levels, in terms of public benefit. It is fashionable for the opposition and much of the press to point to the Prime Minister as a prince of parliamentary darkness, the master of invective and a dictatorial bully with contempt only for non-Labor members. While there is some truth in these charges, and references to non-Labor members as 'unrepresentative swill' and 'vermin' are hard to take, behaviour and abuse of this type is hardly new. There have been plenty of similar examples throughout parliamentary history from all sides. In truth, the Prime Minister is quite mild compared with Neville Wran at his best-or worse. The Prime Minister has not yet referred, as Wran once did, to the Leader of the National Party as a 'piece of slime' or told him to 'get back on the end of his sheep'. While the Blewett report and the work of those honourable members who contributed to it was, I believe, a reasonably honest attempt to achieve some worthwhile reform, it was done within the constraints of the reality of this place and party innuences. The net effect of the report and the executive's subsequent changes will be marginal as far as the public or the good or bad governance of the country are concerned. In spite of the rhetoric about public interest, democracy and scrutiny, we all know there is only one real purpose of this House in question time and that is a public relations exercise aimed at attaining the government benches and the ministerial offices. Everything else-the well-being of the country, truth, justice and integrity-generally finishes last. Every analytical observer of this House has known that it has largely been a rubber stamp for the executive government for years and will continue to be so under the present arrangements. Even the overwhelming majority of the direct participants-the members, the parliamentary staff and the press gallery-were shown by the MCIntosh study of 1989 as accepting that the House has little public benefit and was almost totally subservient to the executive. At a cost of $3 million a day, it is the most expensive and heavily subsidised television program in existence, which cannot even be justified in the name of entertainment either live or recorded and edited. The vast majority of legislation emanates from and is decided by the executive and forces outside parliament, as does policy and even the formation of public opinion. As a check on executive government, the House conspicuously fails-and that is supposed to be its fundamental role. From the executive government's point of view, that failure is the executive's success. The so-called scrutiny of ministers and legislation is only occasionally effective and in reality is about scoring points, taking scalps, innuencing polls and the next election. The system is stacked against government or ministerial accountability in favour of executive dominance, particularly given the huge increase in ministers, parliamentary secretaries and ministerial staff since 1983. We have a set of standing orders which not only cannot be enforced but also neither side wants enforced. In spite of opposition howls of anguish about the injustice of it all, little was different when it occupied the government benches and little will be different if and when the coalition ever attains government. The role of the Speaker is untenable. I hasten to add that I have great respect for the Speaker. His performance so far is certainly outstanding among the four parliamentary Speakers I have experienced. Nevertheless, the constraints of the role as it exists, with the Speaker's survival dependent on the momentary whim of the Prime Minister and his preselection dependent on the party executive, make the position unsatisfactory with the best will and competence in the world. Standing orders cannot really be enforced unless the role of the Speaker is totally independent of the executive and personal political ambition, which just about rules out every member of this House. While many Westminster systems around the world have grappled with· this problem and arrived at various solutions, none is totally satisfactory. In many ways, the Speaker's role should be filled by a fixed term judicial appointment. After all, the Speaker's role is to interpret the rules or laws legislated by the House, just as the judiciary does with all law for the community at large. But over and above all of this the fundamental reason why question time, the role of the Speaker and of the House itself can never operate in a satisfactory manner is the nature of the development of political parties over the last 80 years. In a recent paper, the Clerk of the Senate very clearly summarised the position. His view merely confirms what many political scientists and dispassionate observers have concluded: . The rigidly organised and disciplined modern political party has prevented Parliaments from exercising their original or supposed function of contro11ing Executive Government . .. Modern political parties are a radical negation of as an institution ... They are organisations designed to prevent parliamentary government from working ... Modem parties are to Parliament what collusive oligarchies are to a market. Just as collusive oligarchies prevent the price mechanism of the market working, parties prevent the operation of the mechanism of responsibility which was at the heart of Parliamentary Government. Over the years the centralisation of power within political parties has been refined by the so-called principles of inner cabinet solidarity, cabinet solidarity and caucus solidarity, the purpose of which is to remove any voting power from the majority of the members of the House and remove any accountability of the executive to parliament. Members within parties are often prevented from representing what their electorates think, or even from presenting their own views. The modem party requires regular suspension of individual conscience and individual responsibility of its members, something which was condemned at Nuremberg and something which I, along with an increasing number of the public, can never accept. The end result of party development is that the House of Representatives is no longer parliamentaty government; it is party government. We no longer have any real parliamentary control over executive government in the lower house, but a complete reversal of what the constitution envisaged-total control of the House of Representatives· by executive government, a situation renected in most state lower houses. All this is not the fault of political parties or even the individuals in them. Political parties, as a means of development of public policy through organisations of like-minded people, have a valuable public purpose. Unfortunately, their development within the framework of our combination of American and Westminster systems, which failed to incorporate an essential separation of powers, has caused a loss of purpose. More often than not they are now mechanisms to obtain and perpetuate power. It is no accident that we have seen conspicuous failures of integrity in recent years. Virtually every state has become embroiled in controversy. We have had the Fitzgerald Parliament commission in Queensland, the Slattery commission and the ICAC in New South Wales, the bribery royal commission in Tasmania, the State Bank investigation in South Australia and the WA Inc. royal commission. In Queensland and Western Australia the commissioners clearly identified the root of the problems as the failure of parliament to be a check on executive government. The Prime Minister's recent statement of so-called reform of the House contains many noble sentiments on face value, but between lines it reads 'executive dominance' - not to any great degree but it moves in that direction. The fact that ministers will be less subject to scrutiny of a minimum sort and that question time will probably not be broadcast live, watched by fewer people in an edited dissolution and more boring form, does not add up to a great deal. It is just another example of the philosophy that the rules of the game proutive mote: never give a sucker an even break. Polling no doubt indicated that question was not reflecting well on the government spite of the applause within the ivory tower, so they sought to change the rules. I do not blame the Prime Minister. In isolated position, after a lifetime of dedication to pursuing dominance of the system, an elected dictatorship between elections, which the system encourages, little else can be expected. Given the minimal relevance the House, why should he and his ministers not spend the minimum time here? The government can bury its head in the sand and shrug off these problems, but, governments, unfortunately for the government, the Australed Ian community will not accept that position. The present state of the Senate isa reflection of this, as is the long-tenn trend around Australia with an increasing non-major vote. This dissatisfaction is a public reflection of the failure of partisan overgovernment address the economic, social and environparliaments mental difficulties of the country. Major party support is at its lowest level in at least quarter of a century and the government should not deceive itself that the last election result indicated increased support for extremist policies of the coalition gave the community little choice. The Senate situation cannot be remedied an expanded version of changing question time rules or by corrupting the voting method of the Senate to eliminate minority views, suggested by Senator Gareth Evans. That would change nothing and address none of the long-term problems, except probably to ensure a change of government at the next election. The level of executive dominance achieved since 1901 is not acceptable to any thinking person and disenfranchisement of minority views to perpetuate that dominance is not acceptable to the Australian community. Many refonns are necessary. The federal only system is desperately in. need of genuine refonn. Calls for further centralisation by the of states are futile and undesirable. It would result in a massive centralisation of , power but not address the problems of execdominance and checks and balances. At present, the states are a bulwark against time executive dominance in Canberra, but that in worthwhile check comes at too high a cost to the efficiency of the country. There are local, regional and national interests which must be his reflected by governments, but. a massive reorganisation of the functions of. the three in effect levels is needed. While some refonn is proceeding, it is too slow. The nine Australian governments are all of suffering in various degrees from partisan politics and executive dominance themselves. Even though federalism does provide some accountability and defence against central a Balkanised conflict of unelectexecutives, often representing no-one but themselves, does little good for the country as a whole. The establishment of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty over executive party government, which is emerging from the community'S increasing refusal to give absoto lute power to anyone group in various around Australia, is certainly a progressive move. The fact is that last year's a budget was negotiated, and the present struggle about the sovereignty of parliament is an indication of this, as is the constitutional it. The refonn occurring in New South Wales. The growth of mechanisms around Australia in the last few years, such as the various royal by commissions and corruption bodies, is another reflection of the community'S need to protect itself against executive dominance. That these as bodies are tending to become penn anent does ensure some improvements in accountability and is some defence against the misuse of centralised power; however, they deal really with symptoms without attacking the cause. Reform of the voting system is long overdue. It is· amazing that a reasonably advanced society that calls itself a democracy has accepted the primitive single member electorate system for so long. This system is a gross distortion of the public will, with that will randomly reflected in seats in parliament. It is a 'winner take all' approach which eliminates minorities. Political history at federal and state levels is littered with pies. of distortions, such as the 1990-93 federal government with 39.6 percent of the vote, or the current coalition representation from New South Wales. The Liberal Party gained 32 per cent of the vote and the National Party gained 10 per cent of the vote, yet both have eight seats in this House. Executive dominance needs to fear fair voting systems, such as proportional representation. The people, however, are in no such position. It is notable that on only two occasions in memory the public, rather than the executive, were given a choice of voting systems; in the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand, they chose proportional representation. It is ironic that Australia has the best example of proportional representation in the world: the Hare-Clark system of Tasmania, which is supported by both major party executives, albeit reluctantly, as long it is never allowed to escape from Tasmania. Many other incremental reforms can-and I hope will-be made, but the bottom line is the proper separation of executive and legislative powers, something well recognised for over 200 years as essential for a fully democratic system. The people should be given the right to vote directly for the government. This separates executive government from parliament, removes the need to enforce iron party discipline, empowers all members of parliament, allows representatives the right to individual conscience and individual responsibility, ensures to a vastly greater degree the accOllntability of the executive and removes. to a large degree partisan politics and the emptiness of opposition and the pathos of minorities within the government of the day. It would even put the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) out of his misery by making the position redundant. It removes the corrosive effect of personal leadership and ministerial ambitions which corrupt the parliamentary process. It would open up the choice of cabinet positions to the whole community and makes possible fixed term elections and stable government. Ironically, such a change in our political exam- system was unthinkable until the Prime Minister, the high priest of centralisation of power and executive dominance, opened up the republican debate. This, in tum, has opened up the whole question of constitutional reform, and symbolic change versus substantive reform. Many commentators, academic studies and bodies, such as the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, are now pursuing these questions on a long-term basis. Certainly, if the people get their way, they will elect a new· head of state rather than accept an appointed hub cap favoured by the political establishment. This wilI be a substantial step towards a full separation of powers. Irrespective of long-term reform, opposition to the unaccountability inherent in the present executive dominance and the futility of government by swapping small oligarchies every so often at elections is now publicly entrenched. Attempts to enhance executive as dominance by the recent so-called reforms to the House or the threats by Senator Evans to eliminate minorities in the Senate will only hasten real reform.",30
14,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,Order! I call the honourable member for Werriwa. I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.,34
15,Mr LATHAM,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Werriwa) (2.25 p.m.)There is no greater honour or responsibility for an Australian than to serve in our national parliament, more so in the electorate of Werriwa, which has been represented with such capacity by the great men of LaborWhitIam and Kerin. I hold immense gratitude and affection for my predecessors: Gough WhitIam for his instruction, inspiration and comradeship; John Kerin for an orderly transition in Werriwa and forever displaying a dignified and very decent approach to public life. In every respect in this Parliament, as Bob Hawke once described Kerin, he was a self-made man. He applied a broad yet homespun intellect to the development of Australia's best set of rural and resource policies. Throughout Werriwa and the nation, he earnt respect with his common sense and egalitarian approach to issues and, as no one could doubt, he made sure that he wrote all his own jokes. Since World War II Werriwa has reflected each of the mainstream issues of Australian politics and has acted as both a catalyst and a testing ground for Labor policy-through the urban expansion of the 1950s and 1960s to the Whitlam renaissance and the structural adjustments of the 1980s. My electorate remains very much a microcosm of Australian society and the challenges for national policy in this decade, It is an urban, demographically young and multicultural electorate, grappling with the challenges of economic development, better planning and service delivery-all underpinned by a growing sense of confisystem. dence and identity. This is very much the Australian condition in the 1990s. These initiatives. appropriation bills provide an opportunity to argue how issues and experiences in my electorate-while strongly confirming this government's agenda and direction-in way several areas of federal responsibility highlight the need for new or adjusted policies. Sydney's south-west, covering the electorline ates of Fowler, Werriwa and Macarthur, time of Jack Lang. provides an outstanding case study of the means by which the government can promote regional economic development and accelerate the pace of micro-reform and competition policy throughout the national economy. The south-west region has developed competitive strengths from its large consumer market, capable work force and relatively cheap and well-serviced industrial land. The one gap the effectiveness of the regional economylocation now being targeted and overcome-reflects the great competitive weakness of regional Australia, that is, inadequate transport investresourcing ment to efficiently move goods and people road, rail, sea and air. The recent Kelty report Developing Australreceive is identified transport services as development issue in each of the 63 regions surveyed. Significant· gains are required Australia's transport system to reach average practice, let alone international best practice. On an island continent with dispersed populaareas tion centres, economic efficiency inevitably depends on the effectiveness of the transport system. Whenever the economic distance between markets is reduced, Australia enhances its competitive advantages, both for domestic and external trade. j The benefits of improved transport investment are beginning to be realised in Sydney's south-west. The federal government has developed a regional transport program with new road and rail links and, most importantly, through an inspired announcement during my by-election campaign by the minister for transport, inviting private sector investrnent to accelerate Badgerys Creek Airport to international status. More needs to be done, however, in Werriwa and across the nation to improve the effectiveness of our transport The government needs to build on the achievements of One Nation through four new First, it should embrace federal responsibility for urban railways just as One Nation picked up federal funding for national highlinks through urban areas. From its own .funding sources the New South Wales government has been unable to construct a new rail in Sydney's west or south-west since the Second, the government should tie federal road grants to regional economic strategies. The New South Wales government has linked its capital works budget in Sydney solely to the urban release program. Without targeted infrastructure assistance for industry clusters, the metropolitan area has produced high commuter travelling times and a large imbalin ance between the location of jobs and the of housing estates. Untied road funding in New South Wales has also resulted in National Party pork-barrelling and underin areas· of greatest need. Even by though Sydney's west and south-west represent 30 per cent of the state's population they just 14 per cent of funding from the a crucial Roads and Traffic Authority. Third, the government should redirect for federal expenditure not just through fiscal equivalence on road charges, as recommended by the Kelty report, but also by scaling back of overinvestment on other economic programs. For instance, if the education system more capably met the needs of the long-term unemployed, the government would not need to spend as much as $12 billion a year on DEET programs. In my assessment, government responsibilities on the demand side of the labour market are more critical than those on the supply side. The only long term answer for the long-term unemploy-d is a growth economy pushing back towards full employment. Fourth, the government needs to improve the taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds and pooled development funds to foster more private investment in Australia's transport system. I look forward to this being a key feature of the forthcoming industry statement. I mentioned the fast-track development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek. This project represents the best opportunity for industry clustering and employment growth in Sydney's west and south-west in the 1990s. A study by the national institute in 1991 revealed total employment potential for 36,000 new jobs over the next 20 years on and around the airport site. Presently, Badgerys Creek, like most major airports in Australia, is under the control of a public sector monopoly-the Federal Airports Corporation. Unhappily, the substantial opportunities for aviation and economic development arising from Badgerys Creek are prejudicial to the interests of the FAC and its commercial  most profitable airport-in 1992-93 sustaining 55 per cent of the FAC's nationwide profit of $89 million, while 12 of the other 18 FAC airports returned losses. The development of Badgerys Creek and the attraction of modem airport technology and curfew free operations would bring substantial competition to the aviation market in Sydney and cut into the profits of Kingsford-Smith. Through the restraint of airport competition, the economic development of Sydney's west and south-west has been restricted for the sole purpose of propping up the FAC's profits and cross-subsidising provincial airports outside Sydney. I am delighted that the new Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), knowing the issues so well, holding the electorate of Kingsford-Smith, is not one to put up with bureaucratic delay, or obstruction, or the featherbedding of public sector monopolies. The government need not be restricted by the conventional wisdom that competition policy will damage the development of regional economies. In the areas of Sydney's west and south-west-regions with mature industry structures and very encouraging growth-competition policy would stimulate economic development. Breaking up the FAC's monopoly is an essential microeconomic reform, not just for my electorate but across the nation. While many parts of the world-the European Community and NAFTA-are slotting into trade blocs, Australia has no right of entry into its targeted markets in east Asia and south Asia. Our only advantage is proximity, but without efficient and comprehensive air and sea freight systems this competitive edge will be wasted. This demonstrates the central truth of economic management in the 1990s-how all policy must be set within the context of an open and competitive economy. This government's basic reform of the economy is now entrenched. There is no way back to the subsidies, regulation and sheltered markets of old Australia. The only meaningful debate is about the. pace of reform, not its direction. There is always a temptation for politicians wanting to exercise their power to regard industry regulation and intervention as a way to remake the market. In truth,no government can knock the market out of the ring. The government's greatest achievement has been to kill off the last remnants of the Australian settlement; that is, the laws and institutions on which Australian politics founded a consensus in the first decade of federation-centralised wage fixing, industry protection all round and White Australia. The settlement was designed to institutionalise Australia's standard of living-then among the highest in the world. This enshrined the ethos of a lucky country, sheltering from the demands and competition of the international economy while enjoying national wealth out of agriculture and mining. This government has been about restoring the competitive edge Australia lost in the postwar period and putting back some of the luck. Hence the ethos of an open and competitive economy. The competitive advantage of nations comes from industrial upgrading to the new investment technology and managerial capacity which give companies an edge on world markets. Firms which remain static are imitated by competitors and soon lose their market advantage. Ultimately, nations succeed in certain environments because their corporate environment is dynamic and challenging, pressuring firms to upgrade and widen their advantages on domestic and international markets. The more companies rely on government assistance, the less likely they are to upgrade their competitive position. The role of government is to stimulate market competition, not smother it with tariffs, subsidies and central planning. This illustrates a very important point about how to best judge the success of economic policy. Competition of any kind is never staticnot between firms and not between nations. In an isolated and closed economy, international comparisons count for little; in an open and competitive economy, however, they are the only test of national success. Australia have no room or reason for complacency. If we wish to trade successfully in our region, among the fastest growing and changing economies in the world, our pace of adjustment must be just as rapid. Quite simply, nations with competitive weaknesses cannot move fast enough to rejuvenate and restructure their economies. The longer politicians avoid reform, the greater the decline in productivity and competitive advantage. The focus of national policy must centre on structural efficiency-securing for Australia international best practice in our transport, communications· and industrial relations systems. Structural problems require structural solutions and that, of course, is the agenda of this government. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has noted: It is domestic competition which makes companies lean and beckons them to look for opportunities abroad . . . the promotion of competition in areas has to be the cornerstone of policy. Competition policy has two components. First, strong anti-trust laws are needed to prevent horizontal mergers and market collusion. Second, governments, federal and state, must challenge and break up the privileged market conditions of the professions-doctors and lawyers-and increasingly expose government business enterprises to the benefits of competition. The debate should not be about public versus private ownership but about the huge differences in productivity between competitive and monopoly markets. The Industry Commission, for instance, has estimated how reform of Australia's public utilities would add two per cent to the nation's GOP. The heads of government meeting in Hobart later this week will measure the resolve of all governments in Australia to accelerate and expand competition policy across the public sector in electricity distribution, water and gas supplies, ports, international shipping, airports, railways, telecommunications, postal services and even local government. In this debate, however, it is essential to recognise that governments cannot control the competitive advantage of nations, they can only influence it. There is too little questioncan ing in Australia of the pace of reform by the private sector. According to the Australian Manufacturing Council, only 10 to 15 per cent of the manufacturing businesses that could be exporting are actually doing so. If companies reform their own performance as quickly as they expect governments to change policy, Australia would be in a much stronger economic position. One of my predecessors Gough Whitlam argued in this parliament how the quality of life for Australians, in particular the value placed on community services and opportunities, depends more on where they live than how much they earn. Experiences in Werriwa confirm how this principle remains as valid in the 1990s as it was 20 and 30 years ago. My electorate continues to experience the rapid population growth which has been a feature of its demographics since World War II. Like many of the suburbs of Sydney's all west and south-west, the rate of growth in government services-federal, state and local-has not kept pace with the increase in population. It is unacceptable, for instance, that west and south-west Sydney have 10 per cent of Australia's population, with a high proportion of young people, but only three per cent of student places in higher education. It is much easier for politicians to fund new services from growth in government revenue than relocate resources to areas of greatest need. Australia's economic circumstances, however, have killed off this soft option. The government needs to place the redistribution of public resources at the centre of its agenda for social policy. Only by tackling the problem of regional inequality in Australia can we move towards one nation. An obvious measure is to reform the charter by which federal authorities allocate grants to the states and local government. State boundaries-lines drawn in at Whitehall last century-have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. For instance, it is absurd to suggest, as the Grants Commission does every year, that community needs in Hobart and Darwin are two to seven times greater than those in Campbelltown and Blacktown. Questions of equity and service delivery need to be judged on a regional rather than state basis. With limited government resources, funding formulas must be prepared, on the basis of need between regions, to take away as well as give. The government successfully used this approach for the local capital works program in 1992. The $6.5 million allocated to Campbelltown and Liverpool councils not only boosted local industry but addressed leading lifestyle issues through the construction of new community cultural and sporting facilities. In electorates like Werriwa, the federal government must provide greater support for services and facilities which, in other parts of Sydney, are secured through higher private incomes. The quality of life in Australia depends substantially on the services and opportunities which the community provides from the combined resources of government. Less privileged areas are particularly affected by the lack of resources available to local government. It is little understood in Australia's federal system of government how, of the five community services from which young people derive their lifestyle opportunities-education, child care, recreation, cultural pursuits and libraries-all but education are provided by local government. By restoring the local capital works program to these appropriation bills or, more likely, in the May budget, the government could overcome part of this imbalance between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances. The scarcity of government funds in the 1990s will continue to focus attention on the cost-effectiveness of service delivery. An element of competition between service providers can improve both the quality and the efficiency of the public sector. This means separating the demand and supply functions of government into a purchaser-provider split. Professor Dick Scotton,· who with John Deeble devised the Medibank program, has used these principles to advocate an overhaul of Australia's health system. His proposal is much more than an efficiency measure, as it provides the government with an opportunity to regionalise health care in Australia and ensure a fair distribution of resources between regions. The distribution of hospitals in Sydney reflects historical rather than contemporary patterns of urban settlement. This lag means that most beds and services are where the people used to live, not where they live now. The East· Sydney Area Health Service, for instance, has 6.9 beds per 1,000 population while south-west Sydney, which covers the electorate of Werriwa, has 2.4 beds per 1,000. The south-west region has 11.1 per cent of the state's population yet receives only 7.3 per cent of health funding. Just as the federal government cannot rely on the states to redistribute health resources on the basis of need, it cannot count on them to tackle the growing gap in Australia between the demand for health care and the availability of services. Internationally, health policy makers have grappled with the problem of securing greater efficiency and cost control in the delivery of services while maintaining universal insurance. In many cases, this has resulted in the national government establishing service contracts with both public and private hospitals for the provision of core services. A single national insurer offers a range of options for health coverage linked to the principle of capacity to pay. This system could be used to integrate the public and private hospital systems in Australia, just as the federal government two decades ago ended the distinction, for funding purposes, between public and private schools. The development of public beds in private hospitals would address the problem of underutilised resources in our national hospital system. The direct funding role for hospitals would be administered by regional authorities, allowing the federal government to allocate funds on the basis of need. The service provider role would involve competition between both public and private health institutions to win performance based contracts from the regional authority. By taking up the responsibility which the 1946 referendum conferred on this parliament to provide medical services,"" the government can establish a national health system. All Australians, no matter their income, no matter their location, can have equal access to essential health services under the universal coverage of national health insurance. There is no inconsistency between a belief in market economies and the legitimate role of government in the redistribution of income and public resources. Social democracy has set itself the countervailing role of sustaining those things the market either cannot provide or actually takes away. Ultimately, Labor's hopes for a more equal and just society rely on a certain judgment about human values: the belief that whilst people will always defend their own interests they also care enough about the society in which they live to advance the interests of others. This is what Australians have always meant in the national ethos of a fair go. It is basic to the rejection, election after election after election, of the conservative notion that self-interest is satisfied only at the expense of other people. Australian society is changing in a way that opposition members will never understand. This is reflected in the coalition's claim that this government is somehow trying to remodel Australia through reforms such as the republic. This is the tired ·old script of conservatives through the ages: too insensitive to understand that society has already remodelled itself; too obtuse to accept that good government and reform involves the skilful anticipation of change. r mentioned earlier that Werriwa reflects a young and multicultural community with 40 per cent of the electorate aged less than 20, and 25 per cent born overseas. For these people, without memories or emotions for Britain, Australian independence is a natural feeling. This is what makes the republic inevitable and so too a more independent foreign policy in Australia. Our nation and its new hopes and challenges can only succeed by enlarging our institutions and striking out for a mature and independent Australia; not straightening out change and clinging to the bonds and symbols of Australia's childhood. More than ever, the values of the Australian Labor Party for an independent, tolerant and egalitarian society are Australia's values in the 1990s. This government, in the context of a growth economy, has an enormous opportunity to press home these values in all its work and programs. Mr Speaker, r will give my very best to this task and, in discharging my responsibilities as the member for Werriwa, within the great Labor traditions of this electorate, r commit myself and all my efforts to the achievement of an open and competitive economy and our mighty crusade for a more independent, tolerant and equal Australia.",34
16,Mr MCGAURAN,ELECTRONIC VOTING," Mr Speaker, at the outset allow me, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, to congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his impressive maiden speech. He will, of course, allow me to disagree with some of the points at least that he raised. r thought the comment about the National Party being pork-barrellers was a bit rich. It was a totally generalised and gratuitous comment, unlike the charges levelled at the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Returning to Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1993-94 and Appropriation Bill (No.4) 199394 which are before the House, r would like to direct my comments to Appropriation Bill (No.4) and specifically to the allocation of $7.3 million in additional assistance to those affected by the New South Wales bushfires. As you will recall, Mr Speaker, this House dealt with the tragedy of the New South Wales bushfires at the first available opportunity, which was during private members' business on Thursday, 3 February this year, at which time a motion moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) received bipartisan support. It may benefit the House for me to repeat the resolution: That this House: (1) expresses its sadness at the loss of human and damage to fauna and property caused by the recent NSW bushfires; and (2) commends the efforts and sacrifices of regular and volunteer firefighters from New South Wales and interstate in quelling those fires. The honourable member for Bradfield and other honourable members who took part in debating that motion deserve to be commended. They all expressed shock and dismay, principally at the loss of life but also at the loss of fauna and property. I was particularly taken with the contribution by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), whose electorate, like those of others who spoke, suffered enormously from those devastating bush fi res. Essentially, although time did not allow, the honourable member for Lyne touched on three aspects of the bushfires from which lessons must be learnt. The first was for the provision of adequate support and equipment for those volunteers as well as for the professional firefighters. I must say that a large number of firefighters from my electorate of Gippsland travelled to New South Wales to fight the bush fires. On their return they have expressed to me their surprise-to put it at its very mildest-at the antiquated equipment with which many of the firefighting units from New South Wales were expected to face up to these fire storms. The honourable member for Lyne did touch on that point. Another lesson he stressed is that New South Wales, and Australia more generally, does not have a significant aerial firefighting capacity. If time permits, I would wish to touch on that, because in Victoria and South Australia we have developed a very extensive, sophisticated and effective aerial firefighting network. The third issue which the honourable member for Lyne touched on is the need for a greater level of control burning. I wish to direct most of my remarks towards that issue. Needless to say, the New South Wales bushfires were of more than a little intereSt to Gippslanders, Victorians and, for that matter, Australians generally. But, as Gippsland is dominated by the Great Dividing Range and East Gippsland has hundreds of thousands of life hectares of forest, Gippsland has suffered terribly from bushfires over the years. We are very conscious of the dangers of bushfires. Over the years we have tried to develop the very best system possible for combating them. No-one is perfect; we are learning all the time. A great many lessons from New South Wales will also be taken on board by Victorian firefighting and emergency services authorities. My comments are in no way complacent because we will accept advice from anybody on how to improve our performance and protect life and property. A number of very concerned constituents have been to see me since the New South Wales firefighting experience. I seize on the comments of . Mr Fred Ward of Bairnsdale because he represents a very widely held view in Gippsland that we in Victoria, and Gippsland specifically, have allowed much of the same problem to grow up in our area as appears to have occurred in New South Wales. That is in regard to the growth of fuel in the forests. In short, Mr Ward does not believe that there is enough fuel reduction burning in alpine and subalpine vegetation. In Gippsland we seem to allow only small areas in selected terrain. It has to be said that there is a lot of ignorance in the ranks of the authorities with regard to the need for fuel reduction burning. I believe, as Mr Ward argues, in conjunction with Mr Jack Treasure, a legendary mountain cattleman resident in Gippsland, that the authorities must listen to those who have spent a lifetime working and living in the Great Dividing Range and in the forest areas of Gippsland. Mr Ward and Mr Treasure intend to pursue the need for fire fuel reduction in all categories of bush, whether it be national park, heritage areas or the like. I must stress that Mr Ward-and no doubt this also applies to Mr Treasure-is not critical of those called on to fight fires; instead, he is critical of the failure to prevent them in the first place by reducing the amount of fuel in the forests. In summary, there is a belief in Gippsland that there is not enough preventive work taking place to reduce the amount of dangerous undergrowth. It must be borne in mind that burnings must be on a regular basis, otherwise bush and scrub can grow up to a very heavy extent. Fred Ward, a well-known identity of East Gippsland, is not a cattleman, a mill owner, a farmer or a person with any financial interest in the resources of public land. Thereof fore, he speaks objectively and with a great deal of experience. His experience includes survival of the 1939 Black Friday fires at Omeo. I note that, during the debate on 3 February, the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) recalled his experience of the 1939 bushfires in Gippsland when he lived in that area and his father was involved as a volunteer. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has very vivid memories of the tragic and widespread fires in Victoria of 1939. I must say that the 1939 fire is deeply entrenched in the consciousness of all surviving Gippslanders from that era. Mr Ward also did voluntary service as an equipment offi-er: for the Om eo Bush Fire Brigade after the 1939 fires. As a skier, trout angler and gold prospector he has an extensive knowledge of the wild country around most of East Gippsland. He has been employed on snow clearing, road construction and timber work. Mr Ward wishes to draw attention to the extreme fire hazard which exists in the national parks, wilderness areas, general forest and grazing lands of eastern Victoria and the adjacent New South Wales Alps. He only ever wants to offer constructive criticism and advice based on real experience. He has told me that in his view the worse fires that Australia has experienced have been caused mostly by lightning strikes. Such strikes can and do occur on days of minimum humidity, maximum heat and the highest wind velocities. So, where these conditions persist, it is certainly likely that fire will become unmanageable. When talking to any of the firefighters involved in the New South Wales fires or fires elsewhere, they all tell us that once the fire is up and raging there is nothing that can be done and they are very heavily dependent on the natural elements changing. Mr Ward believes that the factor most conducive to the spread of wildfire is the thermal updraught. This occurs, he believes, at the top of forward slopes or above large masses of fire or it can also occur in certain weather conditions and result in hail and snowfalls. He maintains that the power of thermal updraughts is such that it can carry burning material for many kilometres ahead the fire mass and create the classic example of spot fires. He categorically states-and this is supported by all of those who have worked and lived in the East Gippsland bush-that with the present state of excess fire fuel the Great Dividing Range is the worse fire hazard that exists anywher- in the world. Interestingly, Mr Ward makes the point that, after the disastrous fires of 1939 and Ash Wednesday 1983, fuel reduction has become more and more ineffective simply because the rate of fuel reduction burning is not keeping up with the production of that fuel. In the im. mediate sub-alpine snow gum and woolly butt forests around the Alps, fire-killed and fireinitiated regrowth of these tree types has increased by some 100 per cent. He has translated that increase into fire intensity and he believes that that is the basis for a complete disaster. Mr Ward believes that fuel reduction burning can be effective only if the areas of fuel generation are attacked. He believes it is obvious that this has not yet been done. For effective control, breaks must be prepared along the tops of ridges by bulldozing and raking. Fires should then be lit down the forward slopes at a distarice so close to the break that no chance of significant updraught can be created to carry the spot fires forward. This should be done progressively until the bottom of the forward slopes is reached. This would create a mosaic of bush that could be burnt every time it will bum, on the generation areas, and safely. In regard to the hackwards slopes, the shady sides, Mr Ward believes they will burn when it is dry enough. The major criticism he has of the present methods of fuel reduction is that it is being done over a very short period and the most difficulty can be expected to be met while trying to get it to bum. He argues that the nettle has to be grasped and burning under control must be done in summer. His answer to the howls of protest is simply that if we can fight fire with fire when the whole country is alight-as it was near Sydney-by back-burning, why then cannot we do the same with fuel reduction? The big advantage we would have is that we can pick our time, place and weather. The only alternative to controlled burning is to let lightning strike fires bum themselves out, and that is obviously an alternative fraught with enormous risk. He also makes the point that access to fire outbreaks in any part of the whole fire prone areas of bush is vital to the continuing existence of flora and fauna. Therefore, improvement of access should be a high priority. In conclusion, Mr Ward believes that his comments and advice to me and to Victorian state ministers are based on his belief that a catastrophic fire event is inevitable in Victoria unless action is taken now. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.",39
17,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTRONIC VOTING,"Order! It being almost 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The honourable member will have leave to continue'speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Australian Security Intelligence Service",42
18,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a question on a serious matter affecting national security. It a question that ought to be answered by the Prime Minister but he is not in the chamber; he is taking a rostered day off. It is a question that could be answered by the Deputy Prime Minister. He is not here,42
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will get to his question.,42
20,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Or it could be answered by the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He is not here either.,42
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader will get to his question or resume his seat.,42
22,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, whom am I to ask-the Leader of the House? I will direct my question to the Leader of the House. Why has the government decided not to establish a proper independent inquiry into the serious allegations that have been made concerning the operations of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service by some of its former officers? Have their claims already been investigated by the government? Does the government agree that the Australian people need an assurance that ASIS is operating in accordance with its charter and in accordance with Australian law, and that a judicial inquiry with appropriate national security standards and safeguards is the best means of providing that assurance and recommending the most appropriate form of accountability?",42
23,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not necessarily the case that an intelligent government responds immediately to a set of suggestions, propositions or whatever put in the context of a television program the night before. A government that is actually used to governing does not jump off the mark at the mere presentation of those statements. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has had a deal to say on this matter. Questions have been directed to him on it, and he has put out statements. He, of course, is the minister directly responsible for the operations of' ASIS. So, as the honourable member knows-having had an opportunity through his colleagues, if he bothers to read their questions and the answers to them-he has an is opportunity to find out the answers to those particular questions by questioning the relevant minister in the Senate. If he wishes to raise the point' further in this place he can raise it with the Prime Minister come Thursday.",42
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to standing order 142, which states very clearly: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. That particular standing order was unaltered by the standing orders that were adopted by this House a couple of weeks ago. The standing order relating to therostered day off for the Prime Minister is ISlA, which says: Questions without notice shall be asked only of those Ministers who are rostered ... The point of order. I take is that I understood the Leader of the House, by his reference to other ministers being responsible for this matter, to be suggesting that no minister present in the chamber can possibly be responsible. So he is seriously saying- Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance on this-that, as a result of the rostering, if a matter relating to national security is raised and the Prime Minister and the Minister for - oreign Affairs or his representative are not present, then there is nobody in this parliament, nobody on the government side, who is responsible for dealing with that question. Mr Speaker, is it your ruling that the Leader of the House, as the senior cabinet minister present and the person designated at the head of the rostered listMr Duncan-Come back tomorrow.",43
25,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not coming back tomorrow because matters of national security do not come back tomorrow.",43
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right!,43
27,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am making the point today.,43
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bennelong might refrain from responding to interjections and get to his point of order.,43
29,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am provoked.,43
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am protecting you.,43
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point that I make is this: the strict wording of standing order 142 says that questions may be put to a minister relating to public affairs. This is clearly a matter of public affairs, and clearly a matter of national security ought to be the subject of a question to somebody when question time is being held. As the senior government minister present, is the Leader of the House seriously saying that despite that status nobody at all is responsible for matters of national security when the Prime Minister is not present?",43
32,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it is quite evident that a question can be directed to me in my position as Leader of the House that relates to when and who would answer a question. I took the question from the Leader of the Opposition on the basis that I am responsible for the roster. As to the rest of the nonsense that the honourable member for Benne10ng went on with, it was more than adequately answered and anybody who wants an answer to those particular questions can take a look at the Senate record.",43
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! With respect to the points of order raised by both the honourable member for Bennelong and the Leader of the House, I took it that, when the Leader of the Opposition rose to ask a question and made the point that the person perhaps to which he would wish to direct the question was not here, he nevertheless was happy to direct it to the Leader of the House. I also took it that the Leader of the House in that capacity was prepared to respond to that question and, as such, it is in order. Environmental Employment",43
34,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to the green paper prepared by the committee on employment opportunities which highlighted the potential for additional employment in the environmental sector. Can the minister advise the House of any additional environmental employment initiatives following the green paper?",43
35,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and, indeed, I had the opportunity to visit his electorate last month. It is true that significant job opportunity does exist in the area of environmental management and related industries. It was against that background that this government introduced an employment program called LEAP-Iandcare and environment action program. Our commitment to this program in the budget 1992-93 was $60 million. That has been spent and it saw the creation of 5,530 jobs. Because of the success of the program, in this current financial year 10,000 further jobs have been committed under the program. It has been a very successful initiative because it has enabled us to combine work on the environment and work that is important for regional areas in terms of economic development. The honourable member for Leichhardt referred to the rainforest reafforestation project, which came about because of this government's commitment to, on the one hand, preserving the wilderness and, on the other hand, recognising that there was a demand for certain species of timber that should be managed in a plantation sense. We set about developing programs whereby we could achieve the win-win situation: preservation of the wilderness, therlffore increasing the attraction of Far North Queensland to tourism, and the protection of the wilderness-a very strong environmental approach-but at the same time creating job opportunities by training people in planting particular species of rainforest timber that can grow faster in certain parts of the country. In the area of Leichhardt, 11 councils got together to support this initiative. In 1992-93, 170 people went through LEAP. Today I am pleased to announce that, as a result of having looked at this program and the importance of it, the success of it, there are a further 80 places for that particular initiative. It ought to be recognised as a successful program, a win-win outcome. It delivers on jobs, delivers on the environment and, importantly, trains people in the important process and function of land management. Unemployment",43
36,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could the Minister for Employment, Education and Training explain why Australia's long-term unemployment rate is more than three times that of Canada while the unemployment rate of the two countries is similar?",44
37,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member were prepared to read the green paper he would understand the particular problem that we as a country are going through and which other countries have not followed. Because we have embarked on the process of structural reform much more strongly, the problem that has occurred in this nation is a twofold outcome of a significant increase in jobs but, at the same time, an increase in the numbers of unemployed. In the period from 1983 to now, the period that this Labor government has been in office, we have created 1.6 million jobs. Canada has got nowhere near that number. At the same time, we have taken the participation rate in. the labour force from something like 59 per cent to 63 per cent. A one percentage point rise in the participation rate absorbs 88,000 jobs. So the 250,000 unemployed are more than taken up by the increase in the participation rate. We have therefore seen a restructured economy that has stronger growth than Canada translated into jobs, but at the same time we have attracted people back into the work force who previously had no opportunity to get into it. We therefore have tackled this not just from an economic perspective but also from a social perspective",44
38,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this was a fairly simple question about long-term unemployment. I wanted to see whether the minister knew anything about it and he has not even attempted to answer the question.",44
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is being relevant.,44
40,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member fails to appreciate-it is probably the reason he is so under pressure in terms of his deputy leadership on that side of the House; he has not given any direction in policy in this area-that we have a particular phenomenon associated with the long-term unemployed which has come about because of structural change in an economy which had to rely in the past on a significant level of unskilled in . the work force and which is moving to a situation in which we increasingly require greater skills. The people who are not attractive to be employed· where the job growth occurs are those who do not have the skills, those who have been out of experience and practical application in the work force. That is why we need a program targeted to them beyond just getting economic growth going. That is what the government is committed to under the white paper. We will be developing a response that continues the sustainability of economic growth and continues to build on that 1.6 million jobs but, at the same time, gives particular attention to the long-term unemployed and brings them back into job opportun ity. NA",44
41,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this aftergenerate noon members of the legal committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Public Pay Telephones",45
42,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Communications and the Arts aware of proposals by Telstra to increase charges for users of public payphones from 30c to 40c per calI? Can the minister advise the House of his response to the proposal?,45
43,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his continuing interest in telecommunications matters. By way of background, my predecessor, now the Minister for Resources, as the Minister for Communications sought a report from Austel last December on Telstra's application to payphone charges from 30c to 40c. Telstra, or Telecom as it was then known, has previously applied for increases. Applications in April 1991 and May 1992 were both disallowed by the ministers of the day following reports from Austel. I received a report Telstra's recent proposal from Austel· on 21 January and I had 30 days to allow or disallow the application from Telstra. I have now considered the report and can inform the House of the current status of Telstra's applisolved, cation. While the proposed increase is substantial, Telstra has put forward such a strong case that Austel has recommended that I not disallow the increase. Pay phone call charges have not risen since 1986.  ed in Hansard.",45
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on the front bench on my left will cease interjecting.,45
45,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But he need not read his answer.,45
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And I do not need the right honourable member for New England to respond.,45
47,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In recent years, Telstra's public payphone business has not been able to a profit, due largely to the high cost of providing the service and ensuring that it meets its universal service obligation. Telstra has also significantly improved the pay phone service quality, with availability improving from 65 per cent in 1988 to 93 per cent in 1993. I am sure the right honourable member for New England regularly uses the phonecard services which have been introduced by Telstra in recent days. However, Austel in its report expresses some concern about affordability issues. In particular, I would point out that 20 per cent of pay phone users do not have a home phone and make four times as many calls as other payphone users. In addition, a tariff increase for public payphones would have a most significant impact on low income people with no home phone. For these reasons, I had some discussions with Telstra about these particular issues. Telstra wrote to me on 16 February and withdrew its application in order to draw raise up a package which addresses these issues that I have outlined to the House. I would like to commend Telstra for its initiative in showing some concern for low income earners who would be hardest hit by the proposed payphone increases. I have on written to my colleague the Minister for Social Security seeking the assistance of his department in ensuring that we can develop some measures that assist low income earners. Once this issue has been satisfactorily reI would expect Telstra to resubmit its application for an increase. I have also requested the assistance of the Minister for Social Security in exploring a long-term solution in making it easier for low income earners to have access to home phones. Community Grants",45

How could the minister commit $250,000 under that program for 1993-94 when the budget appropriated no funds for that program for 1993-94? Did she provide this correspondence to the Auditor-General?",46

The Prime Minister gave a $1 million election commitment. How that was administered was a matter for me and for my portfolio. As the shadow minister said, I wrote to the local shires explaining to them that, firstly, there was a commitment and, secondly, how that would be funded. The funding for that was outlined in the budget documents, Budget Statement 1993-94, and I am happy to table them.",46
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Exactly. Can't you read the budget papers? Mr Costello-Let's have an answer to the question.,46
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Auditor-General: ATSIC,46
58,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I point out to the minister by way of preamble that the political partisan posturing of the Auditor General has drawn him to my attention. I ask the minister: does the Auditor-General require the direction of ATSIC before he can conduct an audit into the affairs of the Aboriginal Legal Service? If he does need the instruction of ATSIC, will the minister use his best endeavours to redress this obviously unfair and inequitable situation so that there is no reason why the Auditor-General cannot point his power of perusal in this necessary and far more socially useful direction?",46
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Aboriginal Legal Service is a private organisation and therefore does not come within the mandate of the Auditor-General. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission provides funding to the Aboriginal Legal Service. The service is obliged to submit financial returns that are audited in return for receiving those funds. In addition, under the recent changes to the ATSIC legislation, both the commissioners and the Office of Evaluation and Audit within ATSIC have a capacity to evaluate particular aspects of operations of the commission, including private operations of the commission, so that if there was any auditing per se to be done, it would be done from within the framework of ATSIC. The Auditor-General's powers in relation to the Aboriginal Legal Service, in so far as they are there at all, go to the right to audit ATSIC itself. In the course of auditing ATSIC, as honourable members will be aware, the Auditor-General has enormous powers to seek information from the community generally, as well as from officers of the organisation. But I think it is probably true to say that, except via that indirect process, no aspect of the Aboriginal Legal Service would necessarily come within the ambit or mandate of the Auditor-General. It would come within the ambit, to some degree at least, of the audit operation within ATSIC itself. Community Grants",46
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Given the fact that the minister has just informed the House that the Prime Minister approved funds under her program",47
61,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, no; no.",47
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That he approved a grant of $250,000 under the sporting grants program, as she said in her letter, could she please explain her statement to the parliament on 8 February 1994: 'I did not discuss the distribution of any specific funds at all with the Prime Minister.'?",47
63,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member either deliberately or inadvertently did not understand my first answer, and I will go through it with him again. The Prime Minister was involved in the government's decision to fund $1 million as a specific election commitment towards the funding of the Altone Park complex. What I then said was that I had responsibility for how that could be and should be done. I then tabled in this House the budget program which showed how that was going to be funded. What I said in parliament previously and what I say again today is absolutely accurate. What is so unusual about a government actually deciding that it will fulfil its election commitment? What is so strange about that? We made an election commitment. Opposition members-Ha, hal Hoorah!",47
64,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You laugh, but you are in the opposition benches",47
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,47
66,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition can laugh. Can you laugh at the $30 million election promise you made in Cairns? And how did you cost that? Where are the papers for your $30 million election commitment? Did you ask your advisers for advice? Where did you receive your costings? Of course, what you did was ask the shadow Treasurer",47
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume her seat. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 59. I ask you to suggest to the minister that she address her remarks to the chair.",47
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind all honourable members that that is a standing order and it should be observed.,47
69,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will address this matter to you. I was referring to election commitments, particularly an election commitment for $30 million that the Leader of the Opposition made but does not like to face up to. Was it a program that had papers? Who cos ted it? How was it costed? He asked the shadow Treasurer, and he discussed it with his staff. Then he went up to Cairns and said, 'There's $30 million'. How was that funded? He said, '$10 million a year'. He promised the total amount of the sports facilities program in one unfunded commitment after he visited the site. Mr Costello-Is the minister still answering?",47
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Higgins will resume his seat. If he comes to the microphone to take a point of order like that, I am not interested. Sit down! Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, can I make my point of order?",47
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You come to the microphone to make a point of order in the appropriate way or you do not do it. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, my point of order is on the question of relevance. The question was not concerning Cairns; it was concerning how the minister explains her statement that she did not discuss the matter with the Prime Minister.",48
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Commonwealth Bank of Australia,48
73,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. What was the final outcome of the secondary sale of shares in the Commonwealth Bank that was concluded late last year?,48
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, because the sale of that second tranche of shares is a very good story and one that reflects well on my department. When a line relating to revenue that the government anticipates receiving from sales appears in the budget, it is sometimes argued that those figures are a little wobbly in the upward direction. In the course of the sale of those shares, in accordance with the anticipation in the last budget, the proceeds totalled some $1,686 million-that is $236 million greater than the estimates included in the 1993-94 budget. It was an outstanding success, particularly compared to the amount that we had anticipated spending on selling those shares. The cost of managing the sale was only $14.5 million-less than one per cent of the total proceeds and $21 million less than was allocated in the budget. So, overall, in this budget we were to the good some $257 million for the sale of those shares. Community Grants",48
75,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Did the minister give her letter of 2 March 1993 which committed expenditure to Altone Park to the Auditor-General-yes or no?",48
76,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Auditor-General had access to all my files. He had access to them in round three and round four.,48
77,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did you give it to him?,48
78,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition would know, there is a file under round three and round four for Altone Park. Altone Park was funded in round three for $100,000 and in round four for $250,000, which has not yet been claimed. So the Auditor-General had access to the file on AItone Park.",48
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call someone from my right, I again remind those on my left, particularly those on the front bench, that when a minister is responding to a question they will observe the common courtesy of listening to that answer. Skills Formation",48
80,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the minister advise the House what additional measures are required to improve the job readiness of young Australians?",48
81,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The simple answer is: a greater commitment to implement the strategy for skills formation in this country by the key players and, in this instance, particularly by the states. The House would be aware of the important COAG meeting that will be taking place in Hobart later this week-micro reform is high on the agenda. One of the important areas of micro reform that this economy has to address-and it relates to the earlier question that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me-is ensuring that, as we continue to grow as an economy and sustain high levels of economic growth, that growth· is not constrained by a build-up of skill shortages. We as a nation have to commit now to that strategy to ensure that the jobs required in the future will be serviced by a range of skills in the workplace. If we do not commit now, the reality is that we will add to inflationary pressures unnecessarily, and we will add to the increase of imports into our economy. Much has been done to date in this area. There is an agreement with the states on a range of targets, particularly to expand the number of people going into post-secondary levels. This agreement builds on the success that this government has already achieved in increasing the numbers remaining on to year 12. In addition, we have established ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, which has the function of driving the skills formation agenda. We are committed to growth in TAFE funding. The Commonwealth, in the period 1992 to 1996, has said it will contribute an extra $1 billion in funding to TAFE. As my colleague the minister responsible for vocational training and schools indicated in the last session, we are already getting significant results in this area. That having been said, more essentially does have to be done. This is the area that COAG needs to focus on. The Commonwealth is determined, amongst other things, to seek from the states at next Friday's meeting a commitment to increase entry level training numbers as well as expedite the implementation of the national framework for the recognition of training. If we can achieve this result, it will be good for young people in this country, it will be good for skilling work force, it will be good for ensuring that we sustain our economic growth. I hope that the states respond appropriately because the Commonwealth is committed to that task. Community Grants",48
82,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's statement in question time yesterday that all applications approved under the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program were eligible for funding under the program. Did the minister tell the Prime Minister that she in fact approved a grant of $11,000 to the Pine Rivers youth band even though her department had ruled the application ineligible? How does the minister justify this grant when she told the parliament on several occasions that she had arranged that ineligible applications would not even be shown to her? Did the success of this ineligible grant have anything to do with the fact that the Pine Rivers youth band is located in the marginal Labor electorate of Dickson?",49
83,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the grant applications that the department sent over to me on its schedule were considered by it to be eligible. The grants were in categories 1, 2 and 3 and were, according to the department, eligible. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that the minister table the notes that she was quoting from in relation to that answer.",49
84,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I didn't even read any document.,49
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The procedure here is that if the minister was quoting from a document or some notes, unless they are. confidential, they are required to be tabled. Are they confidential?",49
86,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,1 was not quoting from a document.,49
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was not quoting from a document. Olympic Dam: Leakage,49
88,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What action does the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories intend to take following Western the Mining's announcement of a leakage from the Olympic Dam tailings mine?",49
89,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question and his concern on this very important issue. Last MondayMr Downer interjecting,49
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,49
91,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This shows why opposition members are still in opposition; they have their own little boyish jokes. Last Monday, I was informed that Western Mining Corporation Ltd was to announce that it had a problem of seepage from the mine's tailings retention system. The tailings dam holds water from the uranium, copper, gold and silver mining operation at Olympic Dilm. That water is known to contain radionuclides, heavy metals and acids. The tailings retention system is a critical part of the sound environmental management of the mining operation. The company now estimates that up to five million cubic metres of tailings dam water has seeped into the underground aquifer. That is no minor problem. Five million cubic metres amounts to an area the size of the city of Adelaide's square mile, bounded by its parklands, being covered by about two metres of water. Statutory obligations for the supervision and monitoring of the operations at the mine rest entirely with the South Australian government under the terms of the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982. But certainly the trends, the potential causes and seriousness of the problem have not been disclosed to the Commonwealth. Mr Downer-When did you first learn about it?",49
92,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member listened to my answer, he would realise that I have told him. Mr Downer-We knew about it six months ago.",50
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,50
94,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To date, the information available on the nature and causes of the breakdown of effective environmental management at Olympic Dam is that provided by the company in its media release on 14 February. The questions that must be raised relate to when the company first suspected that it had a problem, given that ground water levels have exceeded expectations for something like three years; whether the design and management of the tailings dams h!lVe been adequate; and whether changes in the method of depositing tailings contributed to the problem. The Commonwealth has certainly not been kept fully informed. Clearly, the company ought to have informedMr Downer-Frank Blevins knew six months ago.",50
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,50
96,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The company should have informed the Commonwealth of this problem as soon as it was aware of the problem. Clearly, current arrangements at the mine in relation to consultation between the company and governments are not adequate. The disclosure of potentially serious problems is inadequate. I have sought from the South Australian government a full report on the problem and how it is being addressed. I expect a report from it later this week. When I get that, I willMr Downer-You got one from Frank Blevins six months ago.",50
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume her seat for a moment. The honourable member for Mayo has been interjecting incessantly on this side of the House. A number of options are available to me. I suggest that he sit there and be quiet.,50
98,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said, I have asked the South Australian government for a report on it. When I receive that report, which should be later this week, I will discuss this matter with my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. We will then make a decision on what further action is necessary. Clearly, the consultatiO'n arrangements must be improved. It is a matter that I will report on further to the House. Mr Sharp- Mr Speaker, I ask that the minister table the document that she was reading from.",50
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister was reading from a document. Is it confidential or notes?,50
100,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is confidential. Medicare,50
101,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. Further to an answer given by the Prime Minister yesterday, I raise a question affecting a constituent of mine from Warrnambool. Can the minister explain why a woman who is scanned for suspected breast malignancy is eligible for a Medicare rebate but another woman, advised by her doctor to have a mammogram before undergoing hormone replacement therapy for osteoporosis, is denied a Medicare rebate for the screening?",50
102,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The details of the issue of MedigateOpposition membersHa, hal",50
103,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The details of the issue of Medicare rebates is clearly a matter for the Minister for Health. I would not laugh about such an important issue. The issue is a very serious one. As the honourable member knows, the Prime Minister responded in detail on that question yesterday. The issue in relation to the government's treatment of breast cancer is one that both the Prime Minister and, I am very pleased to say, his wife have really taken a leadership role in. There are many facets to this issue of breast cancer. First, I think every woman in this House and every woman in Australia is aware of the problems and the misery associated with the issue of breast cancer. There are a range of issues associated with breast cancer, including the whole issue of screening. I think the honourable member will agree that the issue of screening is one that the government has handled very well. At the moment, the government is doing work to make sure that the screening is covering the women who are most at risk. The issue of research is one that the Prime Minister addressed in detail yesterday",50
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is a question of interjections. So far-and I am counting them off-the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women has been subject to 20 interjections without correction. The standing orders are quite clear-cut. When members are on their feet, they are entitled to be heard in silence.",51
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already remarked during this afternoon that ministers are entitled to be heard in silence. r have also asked honourable members on my left, particularly those on the front bench, to cease from interjecting. I ask them again.",51
106,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the honourable member for Wannon would like to hear my answer to the question because he, like me, believes that this is a very important issue. I discussed in general the screening issue and I talked about the research. Yesterday the Prime Minister outlined in detail the issue of research. I think all of us would want to have a lot more money spent on research but, obviously, there are limited budgets. The specific issue that the honourable member refers to does take on the issue of screening. If the woman had attended a public screening clinic, that would, of course, have been free to her. We are attempting to get more of those clinics established around Australia. As honourable members would know, these clinics are established in conjunction with the state governments. In my view, they are very valuable.",51
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, do you? That is very interesting.",51
108,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member treats these issues so trivially. I am trying to answer a question. In relation to the specific issue of the Medicare rebate, I am happy to refer that to the Minister for Health. On the screening, it is an area where we are seeing a lot more money being spent. Because of the contracts being developed with the states, we are getting screening clinics around Australia. If women who fall into the age group attend those screening clinics, the screenings are done free to the patient. Coal",51
109,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. It concerns a multimillion dollar Australian export industry. The minister will be aware of the recent price settlements reached with the Japanese for the sale of Australian coal. Can the minister inform the House whether other price negotiations are taking place? Can the minister further inform the House of the outlook for these further negotiations?,51
110,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. I also note your long standing interest in this issue, Mr Speaker. Earlier there was a settlement between the Australian coal companies and the Japanese steel industry. Regrettably, that led to a decrease in both tonnage and price of coal. That came about due to a couple of issues. As we all know, one factor was the economic downturn or, in fact, the recession in Japan. That has had an impact on the demand for steel. The production of Japanese steel is down to about 90 million tonnes. Usually it is in excess of 100 million tonnes. The real problem with the coking coal issue was that the Canadians were having long industrial disputes leading· up to this year's negotiations. Those disputes have been settIed. They were trying to get an increased share of the Japanese coking coal market, but they were not successful. The Australian industries were able to maintain market share, even though it was of a decreased amount of tonnage. A number of negotiations are now taking place and we hope that those dealing with steaming coal will conclude in the near future. The outlook for steaming coal is much more buoyant, as honourable members will know. I pay credit to the honourable member for Throsby and a number of other government members who spoke in a debate relating to this matter yesterday. I thought a number of members of the opposition made significant contributions too. The outlook for steaming coal is more favourable. Between now and the end of this century, the demand for steaming coal in our region will increase by in excess of 40 per cent. That is a very significant amount of additional steaming coal. The outlook for the price negotiations should be much more positive. Unlike the Japanese steel industry, the Japanese power generation industry has not suffered any adverse economic effects. It is doing very well indeed. I have indicated that I expect those steaming coal prices to be maintained. We are trying to break the nexus. For many years coking coal was the preeminent coal that was sold to the Japanese. As the demand for steel has diminished, we are trying to ensure that we break the nexus between coking coal and steaming coal and that we get the true market price. Over the ensuing years, many of the other Asian nations will have a higher demand for steaming coal and Australia will be able to reap the benefit. . Even though we have only five per cent of the world's resource of coal, we have 30 per cent of the world's trade. This is truly one our great industries, even if some members of the opposition do not accept it. It is worth some $7 112 billion per annum, and I am sure it will continue to be a significant factor in the economic growth and recovery of Australia.",51
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA Community Grants",52
112,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Wide Bay asked a question earlier about a specific project. I think it was the Pine Rivers youth band. Apparently, this was not .on the schedule; my department has already responded to a question from the parliamentary committee regarding the application. On the basis of representation received from the group via the local member, I decided that the application was eligible for consideration. The organisation was advised that the application received on 1 September was considered ineligible by the department due to the nature of the project. Following representation, I agreed to consider the application for funding. The decision was made after the Queensland schedule had been prepared. ' Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister was again reading directly from a document. I ask that she table the document.",52
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, I put the question, as is practice here: is the minister reading from a confidential document? .",52
114,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is. Mr Truss-That is not a confidential document. It has been tabled before the committee at public hearings.",52
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Wide Bay might wait until he gets the call. NA Question Time: Rebroadcast,52
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yesterday in this place the honourable member for Wannon asked me a question relevant to the broadcasting light of in the chamber. He indicated that, in his view, it did not come on until shortly after 3 p.m. He wanted to know what effect that would have on the subsequent broadcast of proceedings from the House. The broadcast light is operated from the Sound and Vision Office control room and provides only an indication to those in the House that the proceedings of the House are being broadcast or televised live or that the proceedings will be rebroadcast or retelevised at a later hour. In the case of yesterday's proceedings, the broadcast light was on to indicate that question time was to be rebroadcast later on the parliamentary broadcast network and also retelecast later on ABC television. The radio rebroadcast takes place under the conditions imposed by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting' of Parliamentary Proceedings. The retelecast takes place under conditions, as we all remember, imposed by the House. Under these conditions the question from the Leader of the Opposition at the commencement of question time would have been both rebroadcast and retelecast. Parliament House: Cells",52
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member for Cowper yesterday asked me a question about detention rooms in Parliament House. I am advised that the initial requirements for security accommodation were developed during the period from 1976 to late 1979, and were based generally on the proposition that security would be provided by the Commonwealth police as was the situation at that time in the existing Parliament House. The stage 2 competition brief, which was developed by the parliamentary departments and the National Capital Development Commission and approved by the joint standing committee in late 1979, set out the overall requirements for the security guard force. Included in this accommodation was provision for a police station, security coordinator's office, internal guard posts, external guard posts and security stores. These initial requirements were modified following the selection of the winning design and were amended on a number of occasions. An interdepartmental committee and a security working group provided input into security planning and both groups apparently contained representatives of the parliament. A significant change involved the addition of a second operations room and accommodation for the security force. The briefs for the two groups of security accommodation were based on the premise that the area should be similar to a typical police station. In each detention rooms were included in the first draft and were subsequently approved in the final briefs. The northern security accommodation contains male and female detention rooms, each 8.5 square metres. In the southern security accommodation there are two holding rooms, each of 5.5 square metres. I understand the parliamentary departments have always had some reservations about the use of detention rooms, but accepted that generally the accommodation required needs to be similar to that of a typical police station. It was also recognised that the accommodation had to be appropriate for whatever security force or forces were given responsibility for the building, whether those forces be police or parliamentary. The detention rooms have not been used to detain any person, nor would I expect them to be so used. I am advised that the rooms do not meet current standards. As I reported, they are currently used for storage. Papers: Tabling",53
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I seek some guidance from you regarding the interpretation of standing orders 320 and 321 which relate to the tabling of papers. These standing orders relate to a set of circumstances that arises quite frequently in this House. This matter arose a moment ago when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories sought leave to add to a question. It was plain to everybody in the parliament that the entirety of her answer consisted of reading from a document. It passes very strange to many of us how something that has been read out cannot be tabled. One of the reasons that we wanted the paper tabled was that, quite frankly, she read it so quickly that I had great difficulty hearing what she was saying and so did quite a number of my colleagues.",53
119,Unknown,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Government members interjecting,53
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It is all very well for those opposite to carry on with high dudgeon, butthat is the reason. Mr Speaker, it really insults our intelligence when, plainly, a minister gives a supplementary answer and case reads the entirety of the answer from a document and we are then told that document is confidential. Mr Speaker, I ask you a further question based on standing order 320 which states that all papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public. We have been advised by the honourable member for Wide Bay that this document was presented to a committee of the House and, therefore, is plainly within the scope of that particular standing order. In those circumstances how can a document which has been presented to a committee of the House under operation of that section and thus regarded as a public document be denied from presentation to parliament on the basis that the minister in some specious way says it is confidential?",53
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member rightly draws the attention of the House to standing orders 320 and 321, but I also draw his attention to standing order 321 that says: A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, unless stated to be of a confidential nature . . . shall, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table. I deliberately, as has been the practice, asked the minister whether it was a confidential document. You said rightlyMr Ruddock-Well, she misled the House.",54
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! The minister, when requested by me to indicate whether it was a confidential document, said that it was. Now in my particular circumstances I accept that that is the case, and that is the end of the matter. Mr Downer-That is not the case.",54

I also wish to raise a matter relating to standing order 304A which relates to disorder. Of course, misleading the House would be disorder. I draw your attention to the circumstances of the last few minutes where the minister told you that a certain item was confidential and the honourable member for Wide Bay then pointed out that it was not confidential. I put it to you, consequently, that the minister should be dealt with under 304A for misleading the House.",55
129,Mr SPEAKER,STANDING ORDERS,"In the first instance, I am not sure that the honourable member for Wide Bay nor indeed anyone in this place thought the minister, when she was giving a response when she sought leave to add to an answer, in fact, quoted entirely from a document. When asked as to the nature of that document, as is the procedure in this place, I repeat, she indicated it was of a confidential nature. That is the end of the matter. With respect to the other issue that the honourable member for O'Connor raised where he suggested that, perhaps in some way the minister may have misled the House, there are forms of this place which the honourable member rightly knows he can go to if he wishes to sustain such a charge. , Mr Lieberman-lrise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. On the matter that you have just ruled on: I agree with you that if a document is confidential then it should remain so, but in this case, sir, it is clear and on the record that the minister read from the document and it no longer remains confidential. It cannot be confidential after she has read from it.",55
130,Mr SPEAKER,STANDING ORDERS,There is no point of order. I have just ruled· on that. The discussion is closed. NA,55

135,Mr TIM FISCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In respect of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Kelly), and minister now departing, I want to say that on 10 February during my absence she made a reference to me in the form of an attack in answer to a question. I have this day, for the first time in this House, the letter to which I believe she may have been referring. I want to make it absolutely clear, to put the record straight, that, in fact, I recognised in that letter to the minister that the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program had been cancelled. Therefore, it is n.ot correct for her to imply that I was making representations in respect of that scheme at that time. NA Strategic Review 1993",55
136,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I make this statement on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who has already made this statement in the Semite. So nothing I say here today wi11 be news, but it wi11give us an opportunity to debate the matter in the chamber. I hope that after this a minister wi11 move that the House take note of the paper. That will penn it debate to proceed later on. However, I intend for debate on this matter to shut down immediately after the response of the opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), but I anticipate that there wi11 be an opportunity later on, either in this chamber or in the second chamber, to continue the discussion, as I think this statement is important. The Strategic Review 1993 was approved by government earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of published documents in which this government has presented and explained the development of Australia's defence and strategic policies over the past decade. But this document is the first major step in the adaptation of our defence and strategic policies to the major changes now under way in the regional and global security environment following the end of the Cold War. The Strategic Review 1993 looks ahead three to five years to assess the consequences for Australia's security of key strategic develwhile opments now under way global1y and regionany, and it proposes policy approaches to meet those chal1enges over the next few years. It is the first part of a two-stage process. The second ·part is a white paper, which is now being prepared for government consideration. We expect that wi11 be published later this year. It wi11 look further ahead into the next century and set long-tenn approaches to maintaining our security and managing our defence resources. For the past 10 years Australia's defence forces have been developed to meet regional contingencies, not to fight the Cold War. But the end of the Cold War has set in train longtenn processes which will profoundly change our regional strategic circumstances. We need to start adapting now to these emerging trends. Predictability in security matters has declined. Relationships are now more complex, fluid and uncertain. These are not necessarily unfavourable, but they do place new challenges on defence policy making. The changes to the fundamentals of regional security are reflected in two major trends. The first of these, flowing directly from the end of the Cold War, is the evolving role of outside powers in regional security affairs, particularly the United States. America's continued engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is not in question. Despite big cuts, America will for the foreseeable future remain the strongest military power in the world by a wide margin. America will retain strong interests in the stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region. Those interests will remain fundamental1y aligned not just with Australia's interest but with those of the region as a whole. Therefore, we are confident that America will remain strategically engaged in the Asia-Pacific region, making a very important contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the region. But it is clear that Americans do not see it as appropriate for them to shoulder alone the responsibility for guaranteeing Asia's security. They will support regional security initiatives, maintaining their bilateral relationships. Increasingly over coming years regional countries, including Australia and our Asian neighbours, will need to take responsibility themselves for the basic elements of security in the region. The second major trend in regional security is the extraordinary economic growth in the region itself. Over the next 10 years, the strategic potential of the nations of the Asia Pacific wi11 increase significantly as their economies continue to grow and diversify. Their actual military capabilities are likely to increase, with many new capabilities already being introduced. So by early next century the strategic potential'and military capacities of the nations of Asia are likely to be substantially increased. These trends do not mean that our region is necessarily becoming less secure. On the contrary, the Asia-Pacific region today is stable, prosperous and dynamic. With a few exceptions, the countries of our region show strong economic growth, stable and effective government, and a commitment to peace stability and freer trade. We have seen that commitment reflected in the development of institutions like APEC and the ASEAN regional forum. Of course, some serious problems remain particularly on the Korean peninsula and also' for example, in the South China Sea. But thcollapse of superpower rivalry has eased many tensions in the region, and effective - ooperation ha- helped to resolve longstandmg problems hke Cambodia. So we have good reason to be confident about the security of our region. But we cannot be complacent. The fundamental conditions which support Asia-Pacific security are changing, slowly but in important ways. Security in the Asia-Pacific region will ultimately depend on the maintenance of a new and more complex set of interrelationships between the nations of the region. The clear message of this review is that Australia's security, like its economic future lies in and with our region. This means that we must be a participant, not an onlooker in regional security and other areas. We rr:ust pursue our national interest through engaging with our region. The challenge for all the nations of the region is to expand their strategic engagement alongside each nation's commitment to its own national defence. These developments have important ramifications for Australia's strategic policies which are set out in the Strategic Review 1993. I will deal with these first in summary, then in more detail. The strategic review confirms that the central focus of defence policy should be our capacity for national defence. This will continue to be pursued through a policy of defence self-reliance. The Australian people expect that Australia should be able to defend itself and it is a fundamental requirement of a responsible government to ensure that the nation has this capability. The forces developed for the defence of Australia will also be able to contribute to global and regional activities consistent with our national interests. Next, a dominant theme of our defence p-licy will - e incr-asing defence engagement with the region, with a growing focus particularly on South-East Asia. Our alliance with the United Stat- also remains important, both for. the way It enhances our capacity for national defence and for its contribution to regional security. We will continue to pursue alliance activities which sustain these mutually - einforcing priorities. Finally, the strategic review concludes that we must continue to support efforts to promote effective global security mechanisms, especially through the United Nations. I turn to the opening theme of the Strategic Review 1993, which is national defence. It is clear that at the core of our ability to contri-ute t? those - ey activities I have just outhned IS the mamtenance of a highly competent Defence Force equipped with advanced technology and structured ·for Australia's unique geo-strategic environment. The Australian Defence Force of today is shaped by the rigorous application of planning principles enunciated in the Defence of Australia 1987. The most important of these principles is that we must be confident of b-ing able to .deal in a timely way with circumstances m the future. Moreover our capability to defend our own territo;y is central to our standing in the region and to the r-le we can playas a partner in regional security. Our strategy for the defence of Australia remains one of defence in depth. This strategy and our force structure planning give priority to p-esenting any adversary with a comprehenSive array of military capabilities capable of independent defensive and offensive operations. Emphasis, therefore, is given to clearly focused intelligence and surveillance operations, to strong maritime and air defence capabilities and to highly mobile and capable land forces which can deal with hostilities quickly on our own terms. The capabilities for these roles detennine the ADF's overall force structure. To optimise our force structure, the develnot opment of the ADF will give a particular opportunities emphasis to the key principles of joint ations, the promotion of competence and professionalism, the selective advanced technology and a rigorous approach to preparedness. Major expansion of force projection capabilities by other nations for direct attack would require long lead times which would be clearly evident to us. Our intelligence monitoring and analysis plays key role in assessing warning time for major conflict. A commitment to the defence of Australia includes a commitment to the industrial tionships strength of this nation. The development of our deftmce science and industry are importtheir ant elements of our self-reliant defence capabutes bility. Without support from defence science and industry, the sustainability of our combat support capabilities would be quickly eroded. The government is committed to developing in Australian industry an ability to support and maintain Defence Force equipment and, where appropriate, to produce it in Australia. The close relationship between defence industry and defence science will be an important factor in our ability to deliver technological advances demanded by our defence requirements. As a result of this government's support local industry, defence is now better able draw on Australian industry. This is reflected in the considerable increase in local content for defence systems and equipment from 30 per cent a decade ago to 65 per cent today. Defence depends heavily on Australian industry for the provision of goods and services. Local shipbuilding and electronics industries are playing a major role in the delivery of many of our major defence platbeen fonns such as submarines and frigates. Detions fence is also looking to industry to provide maintenance and support of equipment and, through the commercial support program, to provide a range of support services, such as catering and base support. I turn to the next theme of this review, namely regional engagement. The recognition that our future security lies with our region, against it, provides us with significant to enhance our national interests operby contributing to regional security and . enmeshing ourselves in this economically application of dynamic region. We intend to expand and accelerate our strategic engagement with our nearer region alongside our primary commitment to developing our self-reliant capacity for the defence a of Australia. We are establishing closer relations with nations of the Asia-Pacific region-especially our neighbours in South East Asia-across all aspects of national endeavour. The enhancement of these relawill greatly strengthen our security. Their proximity is a factor in our security and position as major trading partners contrito our national well-being. Australia in turn has much to contribute to regional security and the capabilities we have developed for our self-reliant defence will help support peace and stability. During the preparation of this review, we undertook an unprecedented series of consultations with the countries of our nearer region. It was importanf that we understood regional views and perspectives, and that our thinking the was understood and appreciated by our neighbours as a positive contribution to our mutual security goals. The same approach was taken with our for alliance partners. This forward-looking, open to approach is a tOuchstone of defence thinking under this government. It has paid significant dividends in our developing relationships with our region. The result is that Australia is better prepared than many other countries to face the realities of the post-Cold War world of today, a world that is more regionally focused than before. . Nonetheless, the Asia-Pacific region has changing rapidly in line with the aspiraof individual nations. Australia, as an active member of this region, must make the necessary adjustments to keep pace. In South- . East Asia, we are developing defence relationships based on the concept of strategic partnership. We have long stressed the need for Australia to strengthen its linkages with its neighbours and comprehensively engage with the region. We aim now to move beyond the framework of existing cooperative activities to consider new opportunities, including shared training, defence science and industry ation and procurement. This will increase our understa-ding of regional defence developments and encourage effective and responsible planning for self-reliance that will add to the strategic strength of the region as a whole. Clearly, the particular nature of the partnerships which develop will vary from country to country over time. Our relationship with Indonesia remains central to regional engagement. Priority will be given to the development of personal and professional relationships among senior officers on both sides, combined exercises, personnel exchanges, training and other activities which foster long-term mutual understanding at all levels. The five-power defence arrangements remain relevant to our defence policy objectives of promoting regional security and are an important element in Australia's national engagement with our nearer region. Throogh the Malaysia-Australia joint defence program and defence science and industry working group, we have a well-established and mutually beneficial defence relationship with Malaysia. With Singapore, the relationship has broadened substantially to include access to our training areas such as the Delamere air weapons range and Shoal water Bay and to the collocation of Singapore Air Force personnel and 30 aircraft with existing Australian personnel at RAAF Pearce in Western Australia. This agreement, totally funded by the Singapore government, is a valuable extension of Australia's defence links with Singapore. These increasing defence force and defence industry links with regional nations are an important indicator of the growing sense of regional strategic community. It serves our interests and that of regional countries to pursue the development of such links. Such activities represent the type of openness that is one of the building blocks of regional stability and security. More broadly, the Association of South East Asian Nations will be central to efforts by regional countries to achieve workable and common approaches on regional security issues. The establishment last July of the ASEAN Regional Forum was cooper- an important step in this regard. With New Zealand, we will seek to maintain a strong defence relationship based on the long standing commitment of each nation to the security of the .other. Our efforts to promote our shared defence interests and commitments will be based on our program of closer defence relations and the coordination of our policies throughout the region. We will also maintain strategic commitment to Papua New Guinea and the other south-west Pacific states, with a focus on cooperation, which assists in promoting national resilience and increases the capacity of these nations to deal with security problems. Further afield, the increasing power and influence of the major Asian powers such as Japan, the People's Republic of China and India, require Australia to develop constructive contact with these countries in the security field. In particular, we need to understand their interests and gain their understanding of Australia's objectives in enhancing regional security. The continuation of a US strategic role in the Asia-Pacific region remains a critical element for the future security of Australia and our region. Our alliance relationship with the United States is the next key theme of the review, with an emphasis on its importance in the context of a shared commitment to security in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia's defence relationship with the United States helps maintain US strategic links with this part of the world and thereby contributes to regional stability. It is also of enduring significance for our national strategic posture. Our alliance with the United States continues to be an important factor in the development of Australia's defence capabilities. Both countries acknowledge the continuing importance of our security cooperation under the ANZUS treaty, including the continuing relevance and value of the mutual security obligations embodied in the treaty and our close consultation on issues of mutual security concern. The nature of the relationship continues to evolve, as it has over the past five decades, but it has grown ever stronger. This is a reflection of the depth of our shared values. While Australian industry is increasing its ability to support the Australian Defence Force, a number of weapons platforms and technologies in our defence inventory are purchased from and supported by the United States. We could not afford to produce such systems locally. The Joint Defence Facilities and our intelligence relationship with the United States remain valuable factors in our security and they continue to make a major contribution to global and regional security. Australia's defence science activities benefit strongly from cooperation with the United States, both bilaterally and through the technifunding. cal cooperation program. The final theme of the Strategic Review 1993 concerns our support for the United Nations and wider national efforts to promote mechanisms that contain the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An Australian contribution to international efforts to keep restore peace is consistent with our interests. Our participation in peace support operations is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts, one of our major foreign policy goals. When peace support operations occur within our own region, Australian involvement also reinforces our position as a participant in and contributor to regional security, which is one of our major defence goals. Working together with regional states on peacekeeping operations-as, for example, in Cambodia-adds to a sense of regional security and reinforces our capability to act in concert in other situations if needed. But there are limits to the amount of peacekeeping to which we can commit. Our level of contribution should not blind us to one basic point: such activities are supplementary to the central role of the Australian Defence Force in the direct defence of Australia and its interests and the promotion of those interests within our neighbourhood. Each request we receive for our participation in a peace support operation must, therefore, be considered on it own merits and with a very clear understanding of its implications for our national interests. Finally, a word about resources. In recent years Defence has made highly innovative and successful reforms to maximise efficiencies and maintain investment and capabilities broadly in line with our long-term defence policy, despite significant reductions in financial guidance. These efforts will continue, and intensify. But the maintenance of a self-reliant defence capability that can protect Australia, contribute to the security of our wider region, and support the United Nations will require continued commitment by the Commonwealth and the people of Australia to adequate sustained defence In conclusion, the Strategic Review 1993 is the first comprehensive post-Cold War assessment of Australia's strategic outlook. Work has now begun on the Defence white paper, to be released later this year. It will take account of the key assessments and broad or policy framework in the strategic review and from these develop detailed planning guidance for Defence into the first decade of the next century. It will review and, if necessary, revise our basic planning concepts to ensure they fit our evolving strategic environment, and provide planning guidance on force structure development, management of regional and alliance relationships, and industry, science and personnel policy. This strategic review and the white paper which will follow build on the defence policy developed by this Government over the past decade to provide a clear and rigorous basis for Australian defence policy into the next century. I present the following papers: Strategic Review /993 and Ministerial statement, 22 February 1994.  That the House take note of the papers. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Reith speaking for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.",56
137,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I consider it a great honour to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the coalition parties on defence issues. In my time on the front-bench since mid-1987 I have been fortunate to have had many good jobs. This is the eighth job that I have had and I would have to say that it is one of the best. The maintenance of Australia's national security is the foremost responsibility of the Commonwealth government, so our parties have always accorded the defence portfolio a very high priority. It will continue to be accorded a high priority by, the coalition. Although I have only 15 to 20 minutes available to speak, I appreciate the opportuniI ty to briefly comment on the Strategic Review 1993 which has been tabled in the parliament today. It is important that there be a public and parliamentary debate on these issues. I welcome also the commitment from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that the debate today will be adjourned to another time-perhaps in the second chamber where I may get a second go. I know that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-one of my predecessors in this portfolio-want the opportunity to speak. As these are my first remarks in the House on defence issues, I make it very clear that, where the coalition supports a government policy on defence issues, I on behalf of the coalition will not hesitate to say so. Such declarations from the opposition are never controversial and so receive little media coverage. But it is important that the coalition's support for Australia's defence effort is fully and publicly recorded. This is not bipartisanship, but it does recognise the importance of public support for the Australian defence effort. The coalition's policy document entitled A Strong Australia, an excellent document for which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo was so largely responsible, details our approach to major defence issues. The honourable member for Mayo is in the chamber and I again note his continuing interest in these issues. To score a political point at the time of the election the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, went to great lengths to point out where the coalition's defence policy explicitly endorses existing government policy. He enjoyed making his political point but, in doing so, he obviously does not appreciate that it is in the national interest for the 'coalition to publicly support those aspects of policy with which we agree. Obviollsly, where we do disagree with government policies, we will not be slow in challenging the government to address its reasons. Time is short, so now want to turn to the Strategic Review 1993. Although it is old wine in a new bottle and is really entirely predictable-I predicted it myself on Sunday and in an article yesterday in the Canberra Times-the coalition does agree with some very important aspects of the strategic assessment. The end of the Cold War is now officially acknowledged in the government's strategic thinking and is recorded in this document. That is an important official assessment. It is important because it provides the basis from which a number of assessments can be made in respect of the global security position and, critically, as that impacts on Australia's region. This recognition is certainly well overdue. This review is the first such review since the end of the Cold War. We in the opposition have repeatedly called for the government to acknowledge one of the defining moments of the 20th century and certainly the end of the 20th century-the collapse of the Soviet Union and the implications of that both globally and regionally. In 1992, as we made this call on the government, it scoffed at the suggestion that it should update its strategic review. The minister was saying, 'That is pretty obvious; we will do that in 1993'. Yet it is only because of continued opposition pressure that finally, two years later, we have this belated recognition of a critical fact in the strategic assessment. Following the logic of the thrust of the strategic assessment brings us from an assessment following the end of the Cold War to considering regional issues. That brings me to the second aspect of this report that has the endorsement of the coalition. There is no question that the end of the Cold War has both created uncertainties and provided some beneficial results. For example, in our own region, the near resolution of the Cambodian conflict has arisen as a result of the fracturing of the USSR sponsored clientstate relationships and obviously the relationship with Vietnam. That is a beneficial result. But some uncertainties have been generated as we have seen the end of the great ideological battle of the 20th century between the two economic systems. It means that in our own region there are differential consequences, but those consequences need to be factored into the thinking which underpins Australia's strategic assessment. In this context, the government has now officially endorsed for the region the 1992 policy initiative of the coalition entitled 'Cooperative regional defence'. That document is perhaps most significant for its acknowledgment of the importance of such a policy stance in our future relations with our regional neighbours. Such a regional mechanism, in our view, should seek to complement rather than replace the network of existing security alliances of individual countries of the region. I stress that a regional mechanism can never be a substitute for a strong Australian Defence Force capable of independent action. Cooperative regional defence needs to be a carefully worked out program developed in consultation with regional partners to ensure that it is more than a rhetorical flourish. I say in passing that the Strategic Review 1993 was prepared during the calendar year 1993, and we certainly welcome the transparent approach adopted by the government by being prepared to discuss with some of our neighbours the contents of the document prior to its public release. That is a low cost but important means by which we can build a close and working dialogue with our regional neighbours. I endorse that aspect of the preparation of this document. Before going on to financial issues which are commented upon towards the end of the strategic review and which were also mentioned by the minister in his tabling statement, I flag a number of matters which invite further comment and analysis arising out of the review. Of the 60 pages of the document and the 15 pages of annexures, only three pages-admittedly a stand-alone chapter, chapter 4-were devoted to the alliance with the United States. The minister in his tabling statement said that the alliance with the United States is a key theme-obviously it is and one which we very strongly endorse-and that it has grown stronger in recent years. We not only have initiated the cooperative regional defence concept but strongly support it. In doing so, we would not want in any way to distract from the strength of our relationship with the United States. That is an enduring aspect of Australia's security arrangements. We would go forther than the government and say that a number of practical, sensible things· could be done which would enhance what is already a strong relationship. The coalition policy document for the last election listed a series of measuresincluding, for example, the pre-positioning of equipment by the Americans in northern parts of Australia as one small but useful measure which could be undertaken after consultation with the Americans and which would generally enhance the relationship. I have no doubt that Australia and the United States have a strong relationship, which obviously has bipartisan support, but I do not think there ought to be any gilding of the lily. Where opportunities to improve that relationship can be undertaken, they should be undertaken. From time to time we have cameo events which make us wonder whether or not the language of the report is as succinct, precise and q:mcise as it ought to be. For example, recently in the Senate the Minister for Defence referred to his expectations about the future of Nurrungar. A few an days later, his statement was contradicted by military authorities in Washington. That issue receives a very bare mention in this strategic assessment. It does get a mention by the minister, but I think a clearer statement from him as to the future of those facilities at Nurrungar would be welcomed by the parliament. The second aspect of the very bare chapter on the United States is the trading relationship and the end of GATT. I mention it because the export enhancement program has been a matter of controversy and public debate in Australia. I would have thought that, as this document has just been endorsed by the cabinet in 1994, and as GATT was concluded at the end of 1993, some passing reference to the prospects of a diminution in the EEP in the future might have been made in the three pages of chapter 4 in respect of trade issues. Trade issues as they impact on the USJapanese relationship are mentioned elsewhere in the document. I think they could have been usefully mentioned in chapter 4 in respect of Australia's alliance with the Americans. The strategic review can also be looked at from a point of view of what is not in the document. One of the measures which I have noticed is the reference to Australia's strategic review in 1989, during which there was a lot of discussion about community involvement in Australia's defence effort. Obviously, the defence effort is a multifaceted effort. In this document, we properly see mention of the defence industry and the work of Australian scientists backing up our defence effort. There should also be a general reference to the importance of community and public support for the defence effort, but it does not get a mention in this document. Perhaps there may be some embarrassment in some quarters of the government about the closure of certain bases around the country where there has been a community backlash because their opportunity to participate in Australia's defence effort has been reduced. A third factor that ought to be mentioned is the question of the air-sea gap to our north. On a first reading of this document, there seems to be a potential shift in thinking as to the control of the air-sea gap as opposed to previous strategic assessments. A policy of denial seems to be a more accurate description of the general approach which our strategic planners take to those areas to the north' of Australia. I only flag it; it is only a question at this stage. On my second reading of this document, I flagged a number of points, which I think further debate will elucidate. A' fourth point to be flagged is how this strategic assessment. will impact on the white paper. I suspect that, from the government's point of view, this two-stage process has its benefits, as the assessment ends up being not quite right. In the white paper we might see a little shift in that assessment in order to match the final policy position. The honourable member for Groom will correct me if I am wrong, but I think they call that situating the appreciation, as opposed to appreciating the situation. Mr Taylor-That's what you call a flexible response.",61
138,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have only had this job for three weeks, and I am catching on very quickly.",63
139,Mr SINCLAIR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"When you know theacronyms, tell us.",63
140,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"When I know the acronyms, I will tell everyone. That is an important point, because this document says that this strategic assessment is for a threeto five-year time span. It forms the basis for the white paper, which sets out the government's policy on equipment purchases and the general stance of the defence force, yet the white paper is likely to be predicated on a 10or IS-year time span. So we have a document produced in 1993 which gives a strategic assessment. The government says the white paper will be out this year. If we·assume that the white paper will come out in early 1995, which is probably more accurate, this assessment will be two years out of date. It has only a threeto five-year time span. If the white paper is clearly predicated and premised on this document, as it is said to be, it seems to me that the two-stage process of the strategic assessment may create some difficulties. Only time will reveal that, but it is an important point to watch. The document is longer than the last one; it touches on many issues and is perhaps a more comprehensive effort. A lot of other issues and assessments are made in this document which I think need further examination. For example, one colleague said to me that some of the comments about PNG and Bougainville were blunter than expected. I am interested to hear more of that assessment. I conclude by mentioning the money involved in this review, because it is one thing to have an assessment and an ongoing program, but, ultimately, these things all have to be paid for. A lot of people close to the issue will be asking themselves whether this is just a case of champagne tastes on a beer drinker's income. Reading between the lines, I have a suspicion that whilst this document approaches the strategic issues in the way that it does it may be softening us up for some further defence expenditure cuts in the future. That seems to me to be the thrust and the general direction. It is one thing to make an assessment, but the government has made these assessments before. It has been talking about a cooperative regional defence for 12 or 18 months, and this is the first official statement. As the honourable member for Mayo has said on a number of occasions, if we look at how much money the government has actually put into closer regional cooperation in the ASEAN area, we find that it has been peanuts-$15 million one year; $16 million the next. A budget is coming out in May. If we do not see a greater commitment, all of this will be hot air and all the headlines in the last few days will be of interest today but fish and chips tomorrow. The broader point is that if we are to have comprehensive and adequate defence policy, commitment and capability then they have to be paid for. That has implications for the coalition as well. In my view, we have a good record. A fair measure of defence expenditure is to equate it as a measure of gross domestic product. During the Fraser years, defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 2.4, 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. In 1983-84 it started at 2.6 for the first four years, and then they have been 2.3, 2.1, 2.12.2,2.3,2.4 and 2.3. If the figure remains at 2.3 or less, it will mean that during the Hawke-Keating years defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP never rose above that spent during the Fraser years. Furthermore, except for the first four years of the 13-year p'eriod of the Hawke-Keating government, defence expenditure has been lower than that in any of the Fraser years. We were quite right in the last election to argue for expencliture restraint and for a recommitment of funds to a combat end, but I think we are also right to review it, because the government, after saying that the cuts were vand!llism, has made cuts. The strategic review requires a further review. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA Taxation",63
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Mayo proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: . The threat posed to economic recovery by the government's refusal to rule out further tax increases. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",64
142,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published one of the most miserable sets of data that I think we have seen in this country in a very longtime. I suspect it will not receive a great deal of publicity because we are getting increasingly used to this sort of bad news in Australia. The Bureau of Statisties today revealed that the number of long-term unemployed in Australia has tripled over the last four years. It is really worth our while reflecting on that barren statistic-that the number of long-term unemployed has tripled over the since last four years. One of the most damning indictments of the Hawke-Keating years is that they allowed that sort of underclass to develop in our society. In 1973, 3.6 per cent of the unemployed were long-term unemployed. In August 1993, 36.5 per cent of the unemployed were long-term unemployed. It is interesting to compare Australia's record with that of other countries. The Labor Party has tried to transmit a message to Australians, 'All right, we have high unemployment in Australia but everybody else has high unemployment, so what?'. One of the enduring features of the debate about unemployment in this country is going to be the fact that we have a disproportionately high level of long-term unemployment. In the United States, the long-term unemployed make up around 11 per cent of totalunemployment. The figure is 36 1/2 per cent in Australia. In Canada, the figure is similar to that of the United States and, in Britain, the long-term unemployed make up about 28 per cent of the total unemployed. Again, I remind the House that, in Australia, it is now 36.5 per cent. So for all of the Labor Party's denunciation of the Thatcher years and these sorts of things the fact is that, in the United Kingdom, the underclass that long-term unemployment has created is proportionately very much smaller than the underclass the Labor Party has created in Australia. This will, of course, be an important issue to the voters in the Fremantleand Bonython byelections in particular, because in those electorates-more, I suspect, than in Mackellar and Warringah-reside the unemployed and in particular the long-term unemployed. But there is another issue-a very important issue-that we will be focusing on in the Fremantle, Bonython, Mackellar and Warringah by-elections during next month and that is that this government was elected on a program not to increase the burden of taxation. It said that there would be no new taxes if the Labor Party were elected but that, if the Liberals and the Nationals were elected, we would get the GST. We all know the government ran an outrageous scare campaign about that. Let us forget the scare campaign and just focus on what the Labor Party said, and that is that there would be no increases in tax.",64
143,Mr GEAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Naughty us.,65
144,Mr DOWNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Canning thinks it is a joke to tell 11 million Australians that the Labor Party will not increase tax and then to deceive them months later by increasing taxes in a highly regressive way in a budget. He thinks it is a joke that, after the budget, the government says there will not be any further increases in tax when, a few months later, ministers such as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) go on television alluding to new taxes that are .going to. be introduced or increases in tax. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time yesterday refused to rule out the possibility of any increases in tax or any new taxes. I think that kind of political morality is utterly reprehensible. It is one of the reasons-if you like, the overwhelming reasonthat Australians are so cynical about the political process in this country. Every time there is an election the present Prime Minister, the once Treasurer, goes to the electors and promises that all will be sweetness and light if Labor is re-elected. No sooner is the election out of the way than taxes go up and promises made are simply abandoned. Honourable members may be interested to reflect on the political strategy behind what the Labor Party has been doing. That was all revealed in an article written by Dr John Edwards. Those on the other side of the House will know who their mate John Edwards is. He is the Prime Minister's economic adviser. In an article which was published in a book called Governing in the 1990s, he basically let the cat out of the bag. He revealed what Labor's strategy is. I thought it was an extraordinarily candid article. He said that' economic policy under Labor has: ... involved a good deal of opinion management, often of a sophisticated kind, especially the exploitation of public fears or widely held misconceptions to advance objectives which would otherwise be difficult to attain. He went on to refer to the. process as-and I use his word-'manipulation'. He said: . .. with one rationale for action giving way to another more sophisticated one as each was successively undermined by fact and experience. He added: Very often the personal success of politicians or the continued electoral success of the government depends on the ability of the caoinet members and their officials to persuade us to see the world they wish us to see it and then, when reality intrudes, to persuade us to see it in a somewhat different way without notiCing the change or being annoyed by the contradiction. They are not the words of the opposition; they are the words of the Prime Minister's economic adviser. These words basically summarise clearly the quite devious, insincere and dishonest way that the Labor Party has managed economic policy over the last 11 years and I think, in particular, over the last 12 to 18 months. We have a situation now where members of the Labor party, particularly those on the backbench but some of the ministers and cabinet ministers as well, are saying that they need increases in spending. There are new programs that they have to put more money into, such as programs for the long-term unemployed, regional initiatives and the so called Mabo social justice package. After 11 years in office-it is not as though it is a new government-government members have suddenly decided they had better. focus their minds on unemployment. After 11 years they have decided it is about time they gave some thought to regional Australia. After 11 years! What is the Labor Party's answer to any problem? It is to increase ,spending. Government members always want to throw money at a problem. It does not matter where it comes from, as long as a dollar is spent it must be a good thing. But how are they going to do it? How are they going to raise the money in order, to do this? The left of the Labor Party, which includes the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), a number of other cabinet ministers and, of course, a significant proportion of the backbench, told us at the weekend what its members want to do. They want to effectively increase the company tax rate; they want to impose what they euphemistically describe as a jobs tax-that is just a tax rise; and they want to increase as well a range of other income taxes. When we ask members of the cabinet such as the Treasurer (Mr Willis)-today we have the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)-or the Prime Minister whether they will rule out these measures proposed by ""the left wing of the Labor Party, they refuse to do so. They will not rule those as increases out despite the fact that they promised Australians at the time of the last election there would be no' increases in tax. On 19 November 1992, the Prime Minister said: What I'm proposing is not to put up tax. Ever since he has been re-elected, he has done nothing but put up tax. There were tax rises in the 1993 budget. There was great community concern and indignation about it. After that budget, on 31 August last year, the then Treasurer said: There will be Jiohe then stoppedthere is still no fiscal imperative to engage in increases in taxes ... That is designed to make people believe that there will be no increases in tax. What is interesting about the Labor Party and its real policy, which is political manipulation, is that it runs around reassuring the community that there will be no increases in tax and that there will be no reductions in spending. It also runs around the community saying, 'We are going to increase spending in a range of different areas and reduce the budget deficit'. Even the Assistant Treasurer, with his rudimentary knowledge of arithmetic, would be able to work out that that equation simply does not add up. On 18 August last year, the Prime Minister said: We are not cutting outlays any further ... because it is irresponsible, it is indecent, it is unfair and it is just not smart. That statement was made to suit the climate at the time. It seemed convenient to make that statement on that day. But the plan is apparently now to increase spending and to finance that increased spendi,ng by, in the end, increasing the burden of tax on the Australian people. As I said earlier, in the end, this is all about manipulation. The Labor Party has done something that no other political party in office has ever done before; that is, it has blown out our budget deficit to a national record level. It does not matter what rhetoric it tries to bombard Australians with in its John Edwards admitted process of manipulation. It does not matter what it says. The simple fact is that have never had a bigger budget deficit than the one we had last year. The budget deficit this year will be approximately the same size. This government spends more than any government has ever spent before. In real terms-not in nominal terms-since 1990-91 it has increased spending by around 20 per cent. It is foreshadowing in the years ahead a lower rate of increase in spending in real terms-but it is still going to increase spending-and very large increases in tax in real terms through the same period. Despite the fact that this government spends more money than any government has spent before in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia-no government has ever spent as much money as this government; no government has ever run such a big budget deficit as the one this government has run in the last couple of years-ministers are running around saying that they still want to spend more money over and above that. Members of the Left of the Labor Party are at least coming clean by pointing to the new taxes that they want to introduce. All those miserable people ran around during the last election pretending that they would not increase taxes. The rest of the Labor Party members are scratching their heads thinking, 'I wonder if there isn't a more cunning way we Gould increase the burden of taxes on Australians without people realising it'. The fact is that this government has betrayed the Australian people by increasing taxes. It is planning to betray them yet again in this forthcoming budget. We can be sure of one thing in this budget: over the next financial year the tax take by these people will be substantially greater than the tax take over the previous financial year. Instead of getting into his usual puerile, personal denigration, which is he is about to do-it is all he ever does-I challenge the Assistant Treasurer to guarantee that the burden of tax in this country will not increase in the next financial year. 1 give the House the guarantee that he will not do it. The burden of tax next year will be higher than the burden of tax this year. The government will find all sorts of ways of dressing we that up. The issue in Fremantle, which is just down the road from the honourable member's electorate, is to put in Carmen Lawrence and encourage the Labor Party to increase taxes still further. He will tax people until they squeal and then have all sorts of excuses why, unfortunately, this had to be done. Today's unemployment figures are a matter of shame for the Labor Party. Its record is one of creating an underclass of misery in this country. Its solution is to whack up taxes on Australians and create still more misery and deceit. (Time expired)",65
145,Mr GEAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"People could be excused for thinking that they were at a Monday evening Liberal Party meeting. There was the same old rhetoric. Nothing changes throughout this place. One could go back over the speeches of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) for the last four or five years and find no change. There is always the same old drivel. The backbench members sitting behind him have gone to sleep. They have switched off; they have heard it all before. Those in the Liberal Party have no shame. A year ago, the honourable member for Mayo was talking about taxes. He was going to put a 15 per cent tax on everything a year ago. But listen to him now. Of course, he is now a reformed tax person. He does not have a policy, but he does not like to remember his position in the past. Think about the way in which those opposite went about formulating since the election that policy. Mr Ruddock-They don't believe you any more.",67
146,Mr GEAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You were not asked about it. This great tax policy of the Liberal Party was hatched in a secret room. Not one member of the backbench was asked about the tax policy to be taken to the next election. The instincts of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) were right-he at least got it right-but he changed; he should have stuck with his instincts. The simple fact is that the honourable member for Mayo got everyone down in the party room, got out this big dead cat of a policy and chucked it in. The marginal members of the Liberal Party would have needed smelling salts once they had seen his policy. The people of Australia knew what he was on about. He was about raising taxes. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in the party room this morning that only two members of the Liberal Party have served in government. One of them, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), is the world's worse Treasurer. This is how far the Liberal Party has come. In 1994, he is still a contender for the leadership of the Liberal Party. He is the world's worse Treasurer! When he was Treasurer in 1983-we will always remember this-he presided over the bottom of the harbour tax systems. We were the laughing stock of the Western world. Only in Australia, they said, could the rich have option of paying tax. They were not our words-they were not Labor Party wordsthey were the words of the royal commissioner. The system is different today and the honourable member knows it. The honourable member for Mayo mentioned Fremantle. In my home state of Western Australia, they will not have a bar of the honourable member for Bennelong. They remember when he went back and tried to get the bottom of the harbour tax schemes. The fundraising committee for the Western Aus-' tralian Liberal Party read like a who's who of the bottom of the harbour tax system. That is why opposition members from Perth will always vote for either Bronwyn Bishop or the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). They will never vote for the honourable member for Bennelong in Western Australia because they remember what a useless Treasurer he was. They will never forgive him for going back on the bottom of the harbour scheme. The honourable member for Mayo does not understand the imputation system. He has difficulty in getting his facts straight on compliance costs. We on this side of the House are wondering what will happen when Bronwyn Bishop comes into the house as the new member. Will he be leading the debate in these MPIs or will she? Let us look at the economy. Listening to the honourable member for Mayo would make one think there was doom and gloom all over the place. But the simple message is this: consumer confidence is up; business investment is up; company profits are up; business expectations are up; and retail trade is up. Let us go through a few of them. Consumer confidence is at a six-year high. In the last eight months the index of consumer confidence has gone up 20 per cent. Company profits are 90 per cent higher than they were in 1991. Busines!,! expectationswhich is very important in terms of business investment-for the March quarter are all up. Retail trade in the December quarter is once again up by almost two per cent. Job vacancies are up. The trends of the ANZ, ABS and DEET figures all record strong growth in recent months. In fact, in January employment the went up by 22,000 and over the year to January it was up by 187,000. All this done with inflation at two per cent! We can see that the economy is growing particularly strongly. Employment growth is up; consumer confidence is up; and private investment is picking up-all with an inflation rate of two per cent. Something the opposition could never do in government was to get inflation into single figures, let alone down to two per cent. The opposition, of course, is always intent on talking the economy down. Anyone who listened to the honourable member for Mayo would think that they were in a different country altogether. The simple fact is that, around here when the opposition talks about the economy, no-one is listening. No-one could care what those opposite say about the economy. In fact, around here the Leader of the Opposition is invariably known as 'double dip Hewson'. He first made the prediction of a double dip in November 1992. In that month he made the leap from recession into depression when he said: This country has been thrown into a prolonged recession. I think we are now in danger of drifting into a depression. On a number of occasions in January and February 1993 the Leader of the Opposition started to predict that unemployment would go to 12 per cent plus. None of those predictions ever came true. But not content with that, in February and May of 1993 he was back to his double dip prediction again. He said: All this talk about how the economy is growing very strongly is just dead wrong. Of course, with the benefit of hindsight we can see who was just dead wrong: it was the Leader of the Opposition once again. On all of the predictions that he has made about the economy, he has been wrong on every occasion. The matter of public importance today also talks about taxation-not that we got on to it all that much in terms of policy intent of the opposition, because that is something it is very shallow on. Mr Thckey-We are more interested in hearing the policy intentions of the government.",67
147,Mr GEAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will tell the honourable member about the policies of the government. I am glad he is here to listen to this. He sat through most of the debate at the time and opposed a lot of it. I can remember those divisions over the changes we made to the taxation system to put some decency back into it. The simple fact is that, since we have been in government, we have changed the taxation system. It is a much more effective, efficient and fairer tax system now than the riddled mess that we inherited back in 1983. As I said, back in those days it was optional whether the wealthy paid tax at all. Another royal commissioner pointed out that the fastest growing industry in Australia was the tax avoidance industry. How is that for a record on taxation? And those opposite wonder why they have been sitting in opposition since 1983. Since we came into government we have broadened the income tax base and we have lowered the tax rates. In 1983 the top tax rate was 60 per cent. It is now back to 47 per cent. But, more importantly, when we became the government in 1983 the bottom tax rate was 30 per cent; now it is 20 per cent. This was all done by broadening the tax base. We always remember the tax reforms that went through the parliament, although I am not sure whether the honourable member for Mayo was here. When we put through the capital gains tax provisions, we had to do it fighting the Liberal Party all the way. In fact, the opposition tried to make an election issue out of it in 1984. As the government of the day, we said that we would keep all our options open. We remember back in 1980 when those opposite ran a shameless campaign. At that time they lied to the people of Australia. They said that we were going to put a capital gains tax on their houses. Nothing could be further from the truth. The federal government of the day stuck with an open policy and open intentions in terms of the capital gains tax. It is now in; it is a fair system; and it is now part of the taxation system. It is not challenged by anybody out in the community. It is only people in the Liberal Party who want to change the capital gains tax. Of course, there was also the fringe benefits tax issue where people could structure their incomes so that they paid only tax on the cash component of it. Opposition members opposed that here and they opposed it in the Senate. This is the statistic that hurts-I understand why the honourable member for Mayo is leaving. He is always talking about the fact that we are a high taxing government. Why, if we are such a high taxing government, are we the lowest taxed nation in the DECO? Back in 1986 Australia was the sixth lowest taxing country in the OECD. Today we are the lowest taxed country in the OECD. We have achieved that position with a comprehensive social program that has lifted pensions, that has seen Medicare maintained and that has seen all of the income support in terms of jobsearch allowance not only maintained but increased-and with all of those reforms that we have made to the taxation system. If we have a look at the government's fiscal strategy, we see that the last budget set the parameters for the next three years or the medium term. We wanted to make sure that the federal government gave the fiscal stimulus when it was needed; that is, as the economy is growing. We added a fiscal stimulus at that time with a view to winding back the budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That has been accepted not only in the community but also more widely by the business community. At the time, after the Liberal Party had dealt itself out of a deal by . opposing everything, the business community came out and said that the budget strategy was correct and they endorsed it. The simple fact is this: we never ever hear from the opposition any proposals about what it might do in government. It has been just about a year since the election. There is absolutely nothing we could ask any opposition member about any of their policies. I will pose a question for the next speaker. Those opposite talk about high taxes. The fact is we have brought business tax down from 46 per cent to 33 per cent, along with a dividend imputation system to make sure that the profits on companies are not taxed twice. Those opposite were going to lift the rate to 42 per cent. Talk about a high taxing party. The opposition is the high taxing party. It went to the last election with a 42 per cent company tax rate. Maybe the next speaker can tell us a little bit about the opposition's tax policy, if he knows anything about it. Is the opposition going to keep that policy of lifting the company tax from 33 per cent to 42 per cent or is it going to do something else? What is it going to do? Nobody around here would know, of course. When we talk about lowering taxes, it is not only personal taxes that have gone down but, importantly, company tax has gone down. With a dividend imputation system in place, we know that we are giving Australian businesses the best chance of making sure that they compete out in the wider world. That is complemented by other policy initiatives which include: the 150 per cent deduction for research and development; pooled development funds; concessions to assist investments in small businesses; 10 per cent development allowance for large projects; 10 per cent investment allowance for qualifying plant and equipment ordered before 1 July 1994; accelerated depreciation, particularly for assets with long effective lives; increased write-off allowances for hotels and factories from 21/2 per cent to four per cent; the introduction of a 21/2 per cent write-off allowance for structural improvements; and tax advantages for infrastructure borrowings. All of those elements have been put in place, along with a much more competitive and fairer taxation system, to make sure that Australia is a more effective place in terms of its business and to make sure that people out in the wider community understand that Australia does have a fair and efficient taxation system. The honourable member for Mayo, who submitted this matter of public importance today, seems to think that he could ask a question in question time yesterday, race out and do a doorstop and claim that the Prime that Minister refused to rule out tax increases in the budget. Robert Garran reports that the honourable member for Mayo made the claim that this is going to be a great issue in byelections. The simple fact is that the Liberal Party has never learnt that it cannot impose issues on by-elections or elections from here; what it really should be doing is going out and listening to people to see what they believe the issues are in by-elections. Was it not revealing when the Liberal Party picked its candidate for Fremantle? It said, 'Local issues will be important, won't they?'. The candidate said, 'Yes, they will'. The next question asked was, 'What are they?'. He replied, 'I don't know'. The Liberal Party is so good that it must go looking under rocks for the sorts of people who stand in byelections. The by-elections around Australia will be fought on issues such as unemployment and who is believed to be better placed to run this country. I predict that the Labor Party will do well in all of the elections that it contests. It will not be because of anything that is said in here; it will be because the people out there understand that we have a government in place that knows how to govern. By contrast, the opposition has no policies. It has three or four leaders. It has absolutely no hope of doing any better in these by-elections or at the next election. (TIine expired)",69
148,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One thing that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has just told the House for certain is that these byelections will be fought on unemployment and this government's record. The people who will vote in their electorates over the next month or six weeks will reca11 how very carelessly this government handles the truth. We are not a110wed to ca11 the government liars in this place. We cannot say that it te11s lies. We cannot say that it lied about taxes at the last election. But in my previous place of employment my boss used to say to me, 'This fellow handles the truth very carelessly'. That is exactly what this government does. It has made that a trademark of its performance in governing this country over the last 10 years. It handles the truth very carelessly. matter whether government members are talking about economic figures, economic forecasts or unemployment figures. They put a spin on it to suit themselves. At this stage the Australian people are starting to wake up to what it is all about. The Assistant Treasurer spoke about the so called economic recovery. He espoused different forecasts and reports from different organisations about consumer confidence and business confidence. I do not know where he gets his information from, but I am sure it has come from the cocoon of the bureaucracy in Canberra. If government members go into the electorates and talk to sma11 business people, the PAYE salary earners, they will discover that these people do not know when the recovery is coming; they have not felt its arrival yet. So we ca11 it a so-called economic recovery. If we are to have this recovery, there must be business confidence and consumer confidence. I disagree with the Assistant Treasurer that the recovery exists now. The people I talk to are not telling me that. There must also be solid private investment. It worries me that private investment is the missing link in the current so-called economic recovery. The private sector is being Jorced to rely totally on foreign savings to fund investment at a time when competition for the world's savings is at an all-time high and when the risks in investing in Australia are high and getting higher because of our large current account deficit and foreign debt. After more than 10 years of this government, we have seen nothing but increased taxes and increased spending. This is a high taxing, high spending government that I am quite sure is the. greatest impediment to economic growth and recovery in this nation at the moment. The Assistant Treasurer talked about our position on taxation in relation to the DECO and the Western world. The Pacific rim is becoming our trading area. Why do we not compare ,ourselves with the South East Asian nations? Under this Labor government, taxation revenue increased from $45.1 billion in 1983-84 to $89.2 billion in 1992-93. That figure has almost doubled while the It does not Labor Party has been in power. Levels of taxation in Australia are almost twice as high as the average for the east Asian region. For example, according to the latest International Monetary Fund data, . central g·overnment taxation in east Asia in (' 1990 averaged 14.3 per cent of GOP compared with 24.7 per cent in Australia in the same period. With state and local government taxation revenue included, tax as a proportion of GOP in Australia was 31.4 percent in 1990-91. How can businesses operate under that strain? How can PAYE salary earners operate under that strain? The Assistant Treasurer was talkif)g about the changes to the taxation regime that this government has introduced. What he did not talk about were the changes to indirect taxation that this government has introduced. That is where it is picking up the revenue and it will continue this year. The people of Australia may as well be aware of it. This government must urgently address the issue of increasing taxes and must put a hold on its policy of high taxing and high spending. The question must be asked: when will this government make a believable commitment to the people of Australia not to increase taxes? In particular, the government must reject pushes for more taxes on business in the upcoming budget-pushes from sections of the Labor Party and the labour movement which have absolutely no idea what it takes for the private sector and for individuals to generate income and, ultimately, wealth for this nation. They do not understand what it takes to generate that income and wealth. Increases in business tax will have two effects: they will make Australia far less competitive and they will leave Australian companies with fewer resources to invest and, ultimately, to employ people. We heard from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) about the terrible indictment of this government that unemployment is. This government has overseen the worse 10 years in Australia's history of unemployment levels. Today we heard the terribly sad figure that 36 per cent of the total number of people unemployed in Australia are long-term unemployed. This nation will have to deal with that for many years to come. It is something for which this nation will remember this government for many decades to come. The Labor Left must wake up and recognise that an increase in company tax will cost jobs, not create them. The jobs tax will cost jobs, not generate them. When will the Labor government make a believable commitment not to increase taxes? On 16 January 1994, Mr Ian Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: It is just a nonsense to continue with a wholesale sales tax, excise and payroll taxes, when their effect is to push up the cost and therefore the price of goods and services we want to sell to the rest of the world ... To maintain a tax system that increases costs is asking business to compete with the best in the world with one hand securely tied ... The tax law must be simplified. Tax law has grown enormously both in its size and complexity and the sheer cost of compliance by business is crippling. This operates as a significant restraint on any growing busineSs. Taxes on businesses are not only too high but also too complex. I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which recently released a report recommending changes to simplify the tax laws. This Labor government must show some real leadership and simplify the tax laws and not just shelve this report to gather dust. If the government does not simplify the tax system urgently, it will continue to be a greater burden to business than the archaic and overcomplex tax system that it oversees. I understand that the Labor Left has recommended for this year's budget an increase in company tax. I also understand that it wants a restoration of the 60 per cent marginal tax rate for employees who earn more than $75,000, as well as the welldocumented jobs tax; The fuel excise continues to rise this year. This government must review further tax increases on fuel excise that will occur on 1 August this year-a further 2c a litre for leaded petrol and Ic a litre for unleaded petrol. It is criminal. The so-called good news Treasurer (Mr Willis) could address this issue in this year's budget if he had the desire to do so. Fuel increases will be damaging to commerce and industry, particularly in regional and rural areas of Australia. It will make regional Australia less competitive and it will reduce the export potential of Australia. This is a sad indictment of this country. I come back to the comments of the Assistant Treasurer when he referred to the way the government had restructured the taxation system. It may have restructured the direct taxation system, but let it be known that it has certainly restructured the indirect taxation system. In the Labor Party's term in office, we have seen federal government revenue on fuel rise from about 7c a litre to 41c a litre. When we are paying 69.5c a litre for fuel in Sydney, the government is getting 4Ic a litre. How much is being spent on roads? Nowhere near that much-probably about 7c or 8c a litre. Where is the rest going? It is going to prop up the government's big spending programs that it does not have the guts to address. It is worth repeating and stating as clearly as possible in this public forum that if the coalition were in government it would not increase the burden of tax in Australia. We see that sales tax is going to rise again later this year. Again there will be more indirect taxes. Prior to the last election-and this shows the careless way this government has handled the truth-we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the then Treasurer say, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax', 'I do not thin k the incidence of tax should rise' and 'We will not be introducing new taxes'. Those statements were made prior to March 1993. We have seen nothing but the opposite since this government was re-elected. The people of Australia do not believe a word this government says any more and nor should they. (TIme expired)",70
149,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is incredible that the opposition could in this House today question the spending and taxation priorities of this government. For members of a party that put forward a $23 billion tax' initiative at the last election to come in here and claim that this government is the highest taxing government that we have had in years is incredible hypocrisy. Those opposite put forward the GST-a 15 per cent tax on everything. The GST would have made 70 per cent of wage and salary earners in this community worse off and 60 per cent of selfemployed people and farmers worse off. It is incredible, particularly given their record, those opposite can come in here and complain about the taxation policies of the government. The previous coalition government was one of the highest taxing governments in this country's history. It had a high minimum rate of tax of 30c in the dollar and a high maximum rate of tax of 60c in the dollar. Those rates of tax have all been brought down by this government. It was the government' of those opposite that made tax optional for all of the smarties in this community and threw the burden of tax right back onto the average wage and salary earners in our community. That is the record of those opposite and of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) when they were in government. Tax was optional for the rich, and the smarties and it was paid by wage and salary earners. It has been left to this government to get those high marginal rates of tax down. What occurred in this House some time ago when we proposed to cut the marginal rates of tax for those earning between $20,000 and $38,000 from 38c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar was that it was opposed by the Liberal and National parties. Those opposite opposed tax cuts for average workers in this community. So they have no credibility when we are talking about tax. Those opposite certainly have no credibility when talking about spending. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) on Four Corners masqueraded as a nice, compassionate guy-a sensitive New Age person, mowing his 3,000 acres with a small Victa; a man of the people-yet he comes into this House and tells us that we need to have Asian levels of taxation. Well, Asian levels of taxation would mean cuts to the revenue in this country of between $11 billion and $20 billion. So when those opposite go to Fremantle and Bonython they should tell the people there what programs they are going to cut. Those opposite should tell them that they are going to cut the family allowance and the additional family income payment. That amounts to $5 billion. They should tell them that they are going to cut age pensions. That that amounts to $8 billion. They should tell the unemployed in Fremantle and Bonython that the opposition is going to cut off their benefits after nine months. They should tell them that the opposition does not believe in labour market programs and also that it is going to cut labour market programs by $1 billion.",73
150,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member should learn to tell the truth. At no stage is it valid to argue that cutting pensions is the policy of the coalition. It is not the policy of the coalition to throw people off the dole after nine months.  point of order.",73

154,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You cannot shout people down. That is absolutely and disgracefully misrepresenting the policies of the coalition.  Speaker. He deliberately ignored the chair on two occasions.,73

158,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was a very effective time wasting tactic by the honourable member for Bennelong. So let us have a look at what the opposition has said about policy. What those opposite have hidden in the cupboard is one big GST. They cannot meet the sorts of commitments that they talk about in this House unless they bring in a GST and that is why it was in Fightback. So what has the coalition had to say about its position on Fightback? On 30 November last year the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said on Lateline: . . . John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction ... that we took to the last election .... the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles. Kerry O'Brien asked him: You weren't always quite so coy about this spectrum question. In 1986, you told writer, Craig MCGregor: 'I'm clearly on the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry. I like competition. There's nothing like putting your balls on the Well, there is no doubt he likes the competition with the 56 members on the opposition front-bench. He certainly likes that competition. The basic point is that the Leader of the Opposition is still committed to Fightback. The Lateline interview continued: KERRY O'BRIEN: But you haven't changed philosophically? JOHN HEWSON-No. The basic direction's the same although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now. We all know why that is the case. Members of the opposition front-bench are now all running around pretending that they have thrown Fightback out the door, that they are now compassionate, that they do not oppose labour market programs, that they do not oppose family allowance payments and that they do not oppose pensions and all those things that the taxation policies of this government deliver to people who live in places like Fremantle and Bonython. Further in that interview it is very instructive:. KERRY O'BRIEN-... what are the principles and the directions of Fightback that still prevail? JOHN HEWSON-Well, we still stand by the need to cut government expenditure ... KERRY O'BRIEN-Massively? JOHN HEWSON-Well, massively is your word. KERRY O'BRIEN-Well, ten billion over three years ... JOHN HEWSON-Well, obviously, we're reviewing a lot of those cuts ... But let's understand it. The issue was a smaller and more efficient and more responsive public sector. That is the policy of the Liberal Party. So the policy of the Liberal Party has not essentially changed. The Liberal Party is still committed to massive public sector cuts. So when those opposite go out to Bonython and Fremantle they should tell the people what programs they are going to be taking away. Those opposite should tell the people, secretly, that, if this country were ever unfortunate enough to have the Liberal Party on the government benches, the only thing that it is really committed to is Fightback and the GST. When the honourable member for Mayo comes into this House and says that we line'. should have Asian levels of taxation, as put forward by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), those opposite should go out and explain to people in Fremantle what that means. It means cutting the revenue by $10 billion to $20 billion, and all of the programs that were mentioned before have to be in the gun. Those opposite have a dreadful record in relation to tax matters because they are the high taxing parties. We are the lowest taxing country in the OECD but we can deliver a social welfare safety net through Medicare, labour market programs, the family income supplement, the home child-care allowance and child-care rebates that the people in this community really appreciate. We can deliver those benefits to people. Those opposite want to take them away. So those opposite should make issues of those things and put those issues forward in the forthcoming byelections. Please do that. The government will put forward its record on tax cuts to average wage earners. They were tax cuts that those opposite opposed of $10 a week for people on average weekly earnings. There has also been a cut in the corporate rate of tax. Those opposite come into this parliament day after day and raise issues to do with sports grants. One of the great reforms of this government in the area of taxation was the averaging of taxation for sports people. It meant the averaging of taxation over five years for sportsmen who have a short period in which to earn their income. So those opposite should not pretend that they are concerned with sport in this country. They should not pretend that they have some interest in sport as they fawn all over famous sports stars at venues all over the country. When those opposite were in government they never had any knowledge of or did anything about the taxation problems of sports people. The Labor: Party is the party of tax reform and we have a record of tax reform. When we are talking about the issue of unemployment we should really judge the credentials of those opposite. The essence of Fightback was the abolition of labour market programs-all of those programs that are so absolutely essential to the long-term unemployed. Those opposite had never mentioned the words and had never heard of long-term unemployed until we put the white paper process on the agenda. We are mature enough to recognise that the strong rates of growth that are emerging in this economy will not be sufficient to create jobs for the long-term unemployed, because the jobs will predominantly go to new entrants to the labour market and to people reentering the labour market-that is, they will be soaked up by a rising participation rate. The opposition has no approach to deal with those unemployed who are left over. Through no fault of their own, those people cannot be the beneficiaries of sustained growth. The opposition stands out there with the Ian Spicers and Judith Sloans of this world, and all of the other economic fundamentalists, and says that the sorts of schemes that we need for the long-term unemployed are make work schemes and useless. That really reveals just how uncaring the opposition is and how little it has changed since Fightback was brought down. The people involved in the by-elections in Bonython and Fremantle need to be aware that the Liberal Party, when it is all said and done, is still committed to a GST and is still committed to the principles of Fightback, and that if Australia were ever unfortunate enough has to have a Liberal government those are the principles which would be put in place and the people that would suffer would be average wage and salary earners and the unemployed.",74

160,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"by leave-I move notice No.1, government business, as amended, relating to proposed amendments to the standing orders, as follows: That the following amendments to the standing orders be made: (1) Standing order 106A (Statements by Members): Omit ""106"" and substitute ""101"". Standing order 193 (When division may be taken): Omit ""5.30 p.m."" and substitute ""after questions without notice."". (3) Standing order 215 (First reading and explanatory memorandum): After ""In the case of a bill presented by a Minister"" insert ""other than an Appropriation or Supply Bill"". (4) Standing order 217 (Day fixed for second reading): At the end of the standing order add: ""Provided that, in the case of Appropriation and Supply Bills, the motion for the second reading of such bills may be moved immediately after the first reading. The debate on the question shall then be adjourned to a future day."". (5) Standing order 104 (Precedence to government and private Members' business): . Omit ""At the conclusion of consideration of private Members' business"" and substitute"" At the conclusion of questions without notice."". Mr Tim Fischer-Is this an amendment to the amendment?",76
161,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"It adds a fifth amendment relating to the conclusion of private members business which updates the current arrangements, as applied prior to this Monday, to for incorporate a division within a reasonable 1994.) period. Honourable members will recollect there was a prohibition on divisions until a certain time on a Thursday. This has now been shifted to an equivalent position on a Monday-equivalent not in terms of the time the day but in terms of the hours being sat to that point. I indicated to the House when I moved these changes some time ago that, from time to time, there would be a requirement for finetuning. The first two proposed of amendments have stemmed from crossreferences that were drafted when a number of options were being pursued in placing the various elements in the business routine for sitting Mondays. The alteration to standing order 106A, members statements, is simply a crossreferencing change. The changes proposed to standing orders 104 and 193, relating to deferred divisions on sitting Mondays, have their basis in the need for a cross-referencing change. The opportunity has been taken to provide for such deferred divisions to occur after question time, whereas the translation of the sessional orders previously in force would have located deferred divisions in the time set aside for members statements. As a maximum of only 15 minutes is provided for these statements, divisions at that time, as currently conducted, would substantially erode the time available. Suggested amendments 3 and 4 relate to appropriation and supply bills. The changes to the initiation of legislation agreed to by the House result in ministers presenting bills and explanatory memorandums and, after the first reading, moving for the second reading to be made an order of the day for a future sitting. Subsequently, at that later sitting when the second reading is moved, debate may, and normally would, ensue immediately. These arrangements would not be appropriate for the appropriation and supply bills generally, and for the presentation of the budget and the main opposition response in particular. The amendments proposed will enable the Treasurer to continue to deliver the budget speech on the presentation of the main appropriation bill for the year and for the opposition response to be made at a subsequent time. When, as I did the other day, I receive feedback from honourable members on the operation of the standing orders there might be a need for further machinery changes in the future. Honourable members should reflect on how the budget is normally presented in this place and the fact that 'we do not really desire to alter that-and that in itself is going to present a few problems come 7.30 p.m. on the Tuesday of the relevant week. It is· obvious that we cannot have a situation where the Treasurer stands up and presents the bills, sits down immediately and the next day, or a week later, gets up and presents the budget. Nor would it be terribly sensible if we did not have an arrangement that enabled the opposition to reply;",76
162,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,I am not too sure about that.,77
163,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"You are not going to have it, whether you want it or not.",77
164,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"If you are the Labor Leader of the House, you get the numbers.",77

166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STANDING ORDERS,"Order! The honourable member for Gippsland! I appreciate that the comments of the Leader of the House were provocative, but I do not think there is any need'for further interjections from those on my left.",77

168,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,I apologise to you. Mr MCGauran-And to the people of Australia?,77
169,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"And to the people of Australia for upsetting the honourable member who has disrupted these proceedings as a result of my provocation. The other changes to the standing orders do not require too much more explanation than has been given. If we actually observe the standing orders as they stand at the moment, we will probably have to knock out 90-second statements from time to time-members seem to enjoy thoseand, therefore, we will have to shift those divisions to after question time that Monday. There is an unavoidable problem with the grievance debate. There was a problem with the grievance debate being at 12.30 p.m. in the old system. We are supposed to shut down question time as close to a quarter to four as possible and grievances are supposed to be heard by 5.15 p.m. If we actually stick with that we will have a bit more time for grievances than we have had hitherto, so it is not too bad.",77
170,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"These changes are of themselves fairly unexceptionable. I do not know that I can make a fiery, impassioned and substantive speech about each and everyone of them, but I take this opportunity to address one or two issues in this quiet procedural interlude. Firstly, I reiterate the concern that the opposition still harbours about all of the changes which have been made by the government to question time and other arrangements relating to the proceedings of the House. If ever anybody had any doubt about whether there was substance in our objections, we saw it today at question time. We saw a totally unsatisfactory, obscure and, I think, perplexing situation. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wanted to ask a perfectly legitimate question about natiopal security matters. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was the senior minister on dutyalthough, interestingly enough, I noticed that he was not bold enough to sit in the Prime Minister's chair. I have never known the minister to be, how shall I put it, an inconspicuous person. I have never known him to be a shrinking violet when it came to taking his due political place. I was, therefore, a little amused that he was being so coy that he did not take his position in the chair. I thought that the ambience of question time today would have been disappointing to those who believe in a robust and fully accountable question time. One of my colleagues remarked to me on the way out, 'Talk about the second XI; it was about the third or fourth XI'. There is something very lopsided in the rosters that have been prepared by the government for appearances by ministers at question time. I think the House should be aware that when the Leader of the House, in accordance with the newly adopted standing orders, sent the roster of ministers to me I sent back a four-part message to him. The first part reiterated our total rejection of the idea of a roster. The second part asked whether he would give an assurance that when he appeared in the parliament as the senior cabinet minister at question time he would answer questions not only in his capacity as Leader of the House-not too many questions go to him in his capacity as Leader of the Housebut also in his capacity as Minister for Finance. I would venture the view that understanding orders he has no alternative but to do that. Mr Beazley interjecting",77
171,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"I am grateful that, by interjection, the minister confirms abide by standing orders because a view was put around when this list was first published that the Leader of the House was going to somehow or other subdivide himselfMr Tim Fischer-To become a eunuch.",78
172,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"--':To become a political eunuch at question time and not be here as Minister for Finance but somehow or other be here as Leader of the House. I am grateful that he will not try to perform that considerable biological achievement and that he will be here representing both his responsibilities. We welcome that assurance. The third part of the message raised the question of whether, in the spirit of what was originally intended by the now retired member for Bonython, the Hon. Neal Blewett, a roster system would operate on the basis that, if the government received due notice from the opposition that a particular minister should appear at question time on a day that that minister was not rostered for attendance, the government would respond to that. That would be on the understanding that, if a minister was given notice to attend but was not asked any questions, perhaps on the next occasion such a request was made the government would not feel disposed to it. As I have said before, when I first discussed some of these matters with the then member for Bonython, he raised with me the possibility of there being a roster and I said, 'That will cause us a lot of trouble'. He said, 'We appreciate that it could work only on the basis that if you wanted to question somebody we would have to deliver up that minister'. The standing orders state that the roster has to be drawn up in consultation with the Manager of Opposition Business. I tried to exercise my rights understanding order ISlA. I thought part of the consultation was for me to go back to the Leader of the House and say, 'Would you please take our concerns into account?'. I put those matters to him. With very great regret, my powerful advocacy appears to have fallen on completely deaf ears.",78
173,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,No. I decided that I should that he will answer the questions.,78
174,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"It is very interesting. In the spirit of accommodation, which the Leader of the House takes upon himself during this debate, perhaps he would like to explain to me in terms of standing order ISlA, which states that the roster shall be prepared by the Leader of the House in consultation with the Manager of Opposition Business, why it is unreasonable, in the spirit of that consultation, to say-if we have a minister in our sights and we have a particular reason for questioning that minister-to the government, 'I don't like the roster, but we accept that you have used your numbers to impose a roster on the parliament'. We will continue to argue against a roster, but surely to goodness it is not unreasonable for the Leader of the House, even at this stage and in the spirit of that standing order, if consultation is to mean anything, to consider delivering up that minister. For example, if we were to go to the Leader of the House at 9.30 in the morning and say, 'We want to question Ros Kelly at 3 o'clock in the aftemoon'-I just pluck her name out of the air as a minister we might want to questionsurely it is not unreasonable for the Leader of the House to deliver up that minister. I can understand people on the other side arguing, 'We come along as ministers; we sit here all day and we do not get asked any questions'. A principle of accountability is involved there. But when there is a clear intention to ask a question 0'£ a minister I do not think it is unreasonable for that minister to appear. I continue to press the Leader of the House on that. If he is just going to say 'I do not agree with that' and not go through any process of consultation, perhaps he would like to buy me a beer and explain why it would be impractical. He might like to meet the spirit of the standing order instead of treating it as the piece of empty sophistry that it has apparently been. I rest my case on that issue. I raise the operation of standing order 321. The Speaker and I had an exchange about this at the end of question time today. Everybody will be aware that during question time today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was asked a question and she came back at the end of question time and added to her answer. It was plain to everybody that she was reading from a document. The entirety of the addition to the answer was taken from that document. Added to that, she read it at such a rate of knots that it was impossible for a number of people on this side of the House to hear what she was saying. We were left to conclude that that was deliberate. I certainly could not follow what she was saying, and many of my colleagues nodded when I made that point to the Speaker. We then had the ludicrous situation that she said it was a confidential document. Having insulted our intelligence by reading the totality of her supplementary answer, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), that by saying that the document had been tabled before the committee, revealed how she had misled the House. We have had trouble with this standing order before. It is plainly unsatisfactory that the question of whether or not a document is confidential should be determined entirely by a unilateral statement from the minister that she was quoting from the document. The standing orders· ought to be amended so that it becomes an objective test. That will put the acid on ministers in future not to falsely assert to the parliament that a document is confidential when plainly it is not. It was obvious on this occasion that she had been given a briefing note in anticipation of certain questions, yet she had the nerve and the audacity to say that was a confidential document. I can understand that there will be occasions when ministers quote from genuinely in-confidence and secret documents. I have no argument with that, but if they equally have no argument with being open and accountable they will not object to this change to the standing orders that I am proposing. I will be moving an amendment-I will hand up that amendment in the appropriate form in a moment-which proposes: That the following words be added to the motion: 1/(6) Standing order 321 (Quoting documents): Omit 'stated to be""'. It will then become an objective test. It will mean that a minister will not come into this parliament, as ministers day after day do in this government, and falsely say that documents are confidential when plainly they are not confidential. That particular standing order has been dreadfully abused by members of this government. The extent to which it has been abused by members of this government was revealed very dramatically today when the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out that the document the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories quoted from had been tabled before a committee of this House, yet she actually had the nerve to say it was confidential. How on earth can it be confidential? The Speaker had no alternative but to say, 'The standing orders say ""stated to be"" and I am the servant of the standing orders'. Therefore, that standing order is stupid. The an as on this occasion. The law is the standing orders and the law ought to be changed. It ought not to be possible for a minister to stand up at the dispatch box and say that something is confidential when that document is not confidential and for the Speaker of parliament not to be able to bring that minister to account. The very simple change we are proposingthere are many other changes to standing orders that could be proposed-is that we take out the words 'stated to be'. That will mean that, in future, ministers will not lightly get up and say 'This is a confidential document' when plainly it is not. We will not have the ludicrous situation of everybody knowing that it is not confidential and the minister saying that it is. That situation is really making a mockery of this parliament and it is making a mockery of the procedure in relation to confidentiality. I do not mind a proper provision for confidentiality. I do not mind for a moment acknowledging that there are documents which contain commercially confidential information, but for a minister to have a briefing paper that has clearly been prepared to protect her against a political attack because of her incompetent administration and when the relevant document has actually been tabled before a committee of this parliament and for her to have the gall, the nerve and the contempt to get up here and say that it is a confidential document shows what she, her Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House think about treating this parliament seriously. As far as this minister is concerned, we are such a mob of mugs that she thinks she can actually say that something is confidential when it has been tabled and made public. Standing order 320 makes it very plain that all papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public. This document was presented to a committee of the House so, as the standing order states, it is then deemed to be a public document; yet the sports minister would have us believe that it is confidential. What is worse, she can get away with that kind of deceit and that kind of law is dishonesty because of the provisions of standing order 321. I think any fair-minded member of this House would acknowledge that in those circumstances the only thing to do is fix up standing order 321 so that the minister cannot mislead this parliament again this on the confidentiality of documents. I use those words very deliberately because that is what she did and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) caught her out. I think it is a disgrace and I think this standing order ought to be amended. Therefore, I move: That the following words be added to the motion: //(6) Standing order 321 (Quoting documents): Omit 'stated to be'.// I hope that the Leader of the House would, in the spirit of consultation contemplated by standing order l5lA, take on board and agree, without the necessity of a division, to incorporate this amendment so that when we are back in government after the next election ministers on our side will not even be tempted to allege that a document is confidential when it is not. (Time expired)",79
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STANDING ORDERS,Is the amendment seconded? .',80
176,Mr SINCLAIR,STANDING ORDERS,"I second the amendment. I would like to say a few things about the motion now before the House. It is becoming more and more apparent that the changes to the standing orders are there to protect the executive from the parliament, not to subject our democratic institution to some improved process. The former member for Bony than and my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) do not remember that being the purpose of the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Procedure. The sad part about the changes was apparent at question time today. There is little doubt that today's question time was an absolute farce. With only a few ministers on the front bench and with a significant matter of major public moment newly arisen with respect to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service being raised before this chamber, we were told incredibly that the answer was being given in the other chamber-that place of the 'unrepresentative swill'. I find that an absolute contempt of the House of Representatives. I find it appalling that there is nobody in this place at question time apparently with the authority or the ability to utter any significant comment about major matters of public importance newly arisen. That to me was the first sign of failure of these changes to standing orders that we are now addressing. That is not the only issue. There was the question of the inquiry into the affairs of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). Again, that is a matter which has arisen as a result of a finding yesterday by the Australian Federal Police an,d by a statement issued outside the parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there will be an inquiry. The Prime Minister made a commitment to an inquiry. He does not seem to understand that the former minister was a minister of this parliament. He was not a minister out there for the press or something. He is the honourable member for Maribyrnang and was appointed a minister by the Prime Minister from within this House. He resigned from his ministry from within this House. To not be able to be told about the processes of inquiry into whether or not he has breached the disclosure obligations to this House strikes me as yet another example of how the executive of the Keating Labor government is running away from the proper scrutiny that our democratic processes have written into past standing orders. The third thing I point out is quite apparent. We have been talking about the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is impossible for a minister to run away, where there is a continuing matter of inquiry which has been unsatisfactorily answered and with new matters arising day after day, and for there to be no apparent opportunity for that minister to be questioned on successive days simply because that minister has not been rostered on. That makes an absolute farce of our process. I agree entirely with my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) when he suggests that at the very least there ought to be in the consultative processes written into the standing orders an opportunity for the Manager of Opposition Business to consult with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)-not just be directed by him in some perfunctory way-and for him to come to some form of agreement which allows a minister to attend question time when not rostered. Frankly, already, at first blush, the changes to the standing orders have not addressed the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Procedure. They have not addressed the requirement to make the executive accountable or responsible. On that basis, I see no reason for them to be preserved. As I said on other occasions when this matter has been before us, there are two elements that I find objectionable. The first is that, ultimately, whether or not the standing orders in this place work depends upon the ability of the person in the chair to feel able to address whatever issue is before the parliament without fear or favour. I find the circumstance of people tending to be appointed and dependent on their continued appointment because of the party process a reflection on the chair. I know it is all very well for me to assert that in a climate where neither side of the House has yet agreed to have an independent Speaker, but we have had extraordinarily independent Speakers in this place from that side of the House. I regard former Speaker Harry Jenkins as an excellent Speaker. I regarded the authority he exercised from that chair as being one where he was quite able to tell members of the government, as with those on this side of the House, whether or not he thought a particular issue should be pursued in an appropriate way and to hold members accountable if he did not. So, too, was the late Billy Snedden. Billy was quite prepared to assert his authority against the Prime Minister, as we all know. They did not enjoy exactly the most harmonious of relationships. That in no way affected Billy Snedden's ability to be a very good Speaker. That is what it is all about. If the person the chair exercises, as I know you have, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, authority in a distinct and appropriate way without fear or favour, then I do not believe changes to the standing orders are necessary. There is always an unwritten authority by the person in the chair. That person under our standing orders has absolute authority over the conduct of the affairs of this chamber. If people assert their authority, no one of us has an ability to do anything about it. The only authority is within the mechanisms of the Labor Party. The Labor caucus, we know, will assert its authority and the Prime Minister will call that Speaker to task. I find that a gross abuse of parliamentary process and that, of course, is in no way amended or restricted by these changes to the standing orders. I find that very regrettable. The second matter I find regrettable is that, for all that the Leader of the House has said about these changes to the standing orders being able to be amended at some subsequent time, all the changes should have been made as sessional orders. I do not believe it appropriate to fiddle with standing orders. We are flat out trying to find out which is a new standing order, which is going to be a continuing standing order and whether or not a particular one will be permanent or not. The Leader of the House even today when introducing these few amendments has identified the fact that there will be a need for some changes, even within the practice of the government. I do not accept that the intent of the government is necessarily that the standing orders should not be changed again. That being so, I think it would have been far better to have used the practice that has become custom in this place of changes being sessional orders and not standing orders. One other aspect of questions without notice that I want to address is that I find it unfortunate that people in this place do not go back to the antecedents of the development of our peculiar questions without notice procedures. It was not until, I think, the beginning of the 1950s that there were any standing orders that provided for questions without notice in this place. They had developed from in the time of the establishment of oUf federal parliament by way of grace and favour of then Speakers and subsequent rulings of Speakers. That enabled as free an exchange as possible-for example, I refer to the United Kingdom House of Commons. That was part of our developing and individualistic Australian institution. For our part, on our side of the House, we think we need to be Australian. We can see no reason for our being subservient to the United Kingdom and its practices. I find it incredible that the Prime Minister has used, as the basis for his changes to question time, the fact that the House of Commons has some procedure which allows for prime ministerial questions. 'The man who would be emperor' teJls us that he would like to do the same. The whole thing is an absolute farce! Mr Howard interjecting",80
177,Mr SINCLAIR,STANDING ORDERS,"Precisely. What an absolute farce! He who would be more Australian by changing our monarchy, by changing our flag, says, 'The Brits do it and, therefore, so must we'. How ridiculous can you be! That is the only rational reason we have heard. As we have heard on other occasions, the House of Commons sits twice as frequently and, even under its system, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is available for questioning at least twice as much as the Australian Prime Minister under our changed procedures. I am very unhappy about the new processes. I believe that today's question time illustrated that they are not working as far as the accountability of the ministry is concerned. I do not believe that any changes to standing orders should be there only on the premise that they are there to protect the executive from the parliament. That to me is the only basis on which they have been introduced in their present form. They are not the changes recommended by the former member for Bonython, Dr Neal Blewett. They are a government adaptation used on the premise, as the Leader of the House has just acknowledged, as Mick Young once said, 'When you have the numbers, you might as well use them'. Frankly, I find that regrettable. As the honourable gentleman will recall, he too will enjoy his time in opposition shortly. When he does, he will accept that there is on which the arguments can be advanced. I turn now to the motion that my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong has advanced. There is no greater farce under the Labor regime than the way in which ministers have resorted to the protection claimed understanding order 321. It is absolutely ridiculous for a minister to read an answer word for word and then say, as some have on other occasions, 'Oh, but they're only notes'. If honourable members look at standing order 321, they will see that it says nothing about the fact that they are only notes; it says 'a document'. It is not printed words, it is not written words-it does not specify-it says 'a document'. As far as I am concerned, notes are a document, and there is absolutely no reason why notes relating to public affairs should not be a document within the meaning of standing order 321. But today's example by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) really trumps them all. Has there ever been anything more ridiculous than to have successive replies read verbatim and then for the minister to claim that they are confidential? Then, to cap it all, when the minister came in and wished to add to her answer, she read from a document, and then we found that that document had been tabled before a committee-but not just before a committee; before a committee in public hearing- In other words, that document had been exposed not just to the members of the committee but to the world at large. It was a public hearing, House television was there and the document was available for inspection. Standing order 320 states: All papers and documents presented to the House shall be considered public. We all know that proceedings before a committee are equal to proceedings before the House. So the presentation of a document to a committee of the parliament is exactly the same as presentation to the House. Standing order 320 says that the documents are public-thanks to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who identified the document and said that it had been tabled in public session-and the minister says, 'No, I another basis declare it confidential'. I find it interesting that at the same time we are debating these standing orders, there is another matter shortly to come before this chamber which will allow those confidential papers, cabinet minutes, to be revealed after 50 years. I do not intend to debate that subject now for I am in favour of that motion. But I do wish to say that, with freedom of information, and with the nature of our society becoming more open, I find it totally repugnant that the government relies on a ministerial claim to confidentiality. It is an absolute farce for a minister to read something and claim that it is confidential. There is a very real problem in our society that, if people are going to claim confidentiality for matters that are not commercial-inconfidence, everybody is suspicious of why they wish to hide whatever that document contains. There are problems in matters that are commercial-in-confidence. I would accept that that is an acceptable area for matters to be declared confidential. Equally, I would accept that matters pertaining to national security are matters which, rightly, have become confidential. But even there we have had the farce for successive years where one can read the records of the United States Congress and find matters that are disclosed that we are told out here by this ministry are confidential. I confess to having done the same myself, so I had better refrain a little on that basis. But there is a problem. Let us accept that the in this day and age the confidentiality of documents of whatever character needs to be carefully considered and applied not on individual ministerial discretion and certainly not in response to standing order 321. On that basis, I believe it only appropriate that we amend standing order 321 by omitting the words 'stated to be' so that the standing order will now read: . A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, of a confidential nature or such as should more properly be obtained by address, shaH, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table. I think it is important that documents be available to the public. I do not believe that it is appropriate for ministers, by individual fiat, to act in the way that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories did today. I believe that misleading the House is a fundamental flaw and a fundamental sin. Were we to follow the words of that godfather of the Labor Right, then I am afraid that minister would have resigned long ago. But she seems to have another claim to continuity. Be that as it may, I believe that standing order 321 needs to be amended. I totally support the motion of the honourable member for Bennelong. I suggest to the Leader of the House that he too, on calm and cool reflection, would find those words more appropriately omitted from that standing order than being included. Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (6.08 p.m.)-I rise to support the comments of and motion moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and seconded in a most admirable fashion by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Standing orders are the essence of the proceedings of the House of Representatives; they are the essence of parliamentary democracy. Changes to standing orders are not lightly embarked on. Yet here we have the first patch-up job to the major change to the standing orders which occurred a fortnight ago and which the House is still labouring under as it adjusts to the new standing orders. In addition to the confidentiality aspects of the tabling of documents, there are two other areas of continuing concern: the amending of standing orders, which the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has brought before the chair at this moment, does not yet embrace any alteration to a bill which is not an appropriation or supply bill and which is going to be declared under the government's option as being one to be dealt with by the House as a whole and not having a seven-day factor built into the apparatus. The Leader of the House will probably respond by saying that is not unless the case now. I point out very clearly to members of the public and to the House that, if a bill is recommended to go to the second chamber, it will have a seven-day delay factor built into the apparatus. If a bill is going to roll on in the main chamber, the. government-no matter what the opposition thinks about it, in a sense-can, in fact, roll it through at a fairly fast rate of knots, without a seven-day factor built in. We have this quite curious anomaly in the construction of the standing orders as they exist today: a seven-day delay factor if a bill goes to the second chamber, but that is not so on other types of bills if they come through the main chamber. I highlight that matter to the House. It is a matter of concern. It will always rely on the convention or practice to some extent that will be pursued by the government, and we will be watching that closely. The only other matter that I will raise, because I know that others want to speak in this debate, relates to the routine of business on Mondays, which is very different from the routine of business on the other three days of the week. Only on Mondays do we have private members business for 1112 hours or thereabouts, the grievance debate for 11/2 hours, and 90-second statements which, as members on both sides of the House have alluded to, have been welcome additions in recent years. When the government decides to construct the sitting weeks so as not to commence on a Monday but on a Tuesday, it cuts back on private members business. The draft parliamentary sittings for the House of Representatives circulated by the Leader of the House show that this year the House will not be sitting on a Monday for four sitting weeks. Therefore the protection of, and activities relating to, private members business, 90necks-or second statements and the grievance debate will be lost for those sitting weeks as the standing orders are constructed. That was case for the very first sitting week this as it will be the case for the sitting weeks beginning on 21 March, 2 May and 22 on August. I put it to the Leader of the House that would be a very nice and comforting gesture, showing the esteem and goodwill with which he approaches these changes to standing orders, if he were to consider a further patchtable up and amendment whereby, when the House does not sit on a Monday, Monday's routine of business will apply on a Tuesday. That will protect the rights of private members and will provide for a grievance debate and, at the very least, the 90-second statements. How can the Leader of the House deny the House the constructive colour of the 90-second stateto ments which have become part of the furnibeen ture, and a very appropriate part of the ture? I have even heard you, Mr Deputy minister Speaker, speak admirably about the 90-second statements. My two points are relevant and valid to the very patch-up job the minister is on about. top of the inconsistency with the seven-day rule is the fact that Monday is knocked out a number of key parliamentary sitting weeks this year. That is something that the House ought to be very conscious of when it delibertime. ates on these further changes to our standing orders.",82
178,Mrs SULLIVAN,STANDING ORDERS,"Moncrieff) (6.13 p.m.)I rise to support the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He has described the situation that arose today in question which led to the amendment. I support the amendment and in so doing point out that the government now has no bona fides at all on the subject of standing orders and the implenew mentation of standing orders. I found it just a little nauseating when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) made a Technically reference to something that Mick Young had the said when first elected to government; gloatingly said that if you have got the numgovernment's bers you might as well shove it down their words to that effect. I admit that that is paraphrasing, but that is the approach which is taken. Frankly, it is a disease which the is spreading on the government side-a year, disease of arrogance and contempt. That contempt for the opposition ultimately flows into contempt for the Australian public. The Minister for the Environment, Sport it and Territories (Mrs Kelly) showed that same behaviour today when she acted as has been described. She clearly read from a document when adding to an answer. When asked to the document, she claimed that it was a confidential document. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) pointed out that it was nothing of the sort; it was a document that had been made available to a committee at a public hearing. Hers was the same kneejerk, contemptuous reaction that one gets from ministers these days when they are requested table documents which they have clearly reading from in answer to questions. furniToday it came out of the mouth of the without any thought in her head that she of all people should have known that it . was certainly not a confidential document. Concern was expressed here yesterday On about the new standing orders and the so called seven-day suspension. I was interested of to look at the words of the Leader. of the House in yesterday's Hansard, because I felt a little chill when I heard him say them at the This· is bearing in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I was a member of the Procedure Committee-as, indeed, were you-and I know what was said in private discussion in relation to the proposed changes to the standing orders, and what a grotesque version of that report's recommendations is actually now time part of our standing orders. As a 'for instance' of what we are speaking about, in relation to the so-called seven-day rule, and answering a concern about the effect of the standing orders on procedures and on the timing of handling of bills, the Leader of the House said: speaking we could debate the next bill next day, not immediately. Standing orders would have to be suspended to debate the bill he immediately . . . Obviously it is not the intention that that is how the chamber should proceed, so we shall look more closely at the standing orders to work out ways we might get around it. ... it was determined that there should be that gap to allow detailed consideration by the opposition. It would not be the intention of the government to take advantage of the fact that we could introduce legislation one day and debate it the next. There is no particular reasonHansard did not record that I then said, 'You will think of one'; it can nowwhy we should, any more than in the old way we would have introduced legislation, done the second reading straight away and then brought it on the next day. Generally speaking, there has always been an allowance of at least into the next week, if not strictly the seven days. There will be no intention by the government to walk back from that. I draw to the attention of the House-it will be debated further at another time. I am surethat a matter listed on the Notice Paper for discussion today has had some amendments moved to it which have now been circulated in the House. The opposition shadow minister was informed by the relevant minister's office at 12.30 p.m. today that these substantial amendments to the bill were going to be moved today. The matter was due to come on for debate at 5 o'clock today-we are a little behind schedule at the moment, as the Leader of the House is aware. The shadow minister had received no indication that these amendments were to be moved; he had received no information about them at all. They relate to certain matters that impinge on the states. We have now discerned that the state ministers had believed that they were going to be informed about these amendments next week. Some of them did not have the details as at 12.30 today. When the Leader of the House was requested to defer consideration of the bill until tomorrow so that the opposition could have a chance to take into account the actual content and import of these amendments, the message that was received back was 'no', because the government wanted the bill to be before the Senate tomorrow. As it happens the bill will not be before the Senate tomorrow. But so much for seven-day rules and bona fides. There is no particular reason that the bill had to be in the Senate tomorrow. It does not have to. It has been on the table here for four months. I will say more about that later. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) pointed out, if the government had bona fides about the standing orders, it would have made changes by way of a sessional order. Once things are in the standing orders they do not get changed easily. Over the years there have been attempts to make changes to the standing orders and it has never happened. We can experiment with changes through the sessional orders, find out how they are working and then move on from there. That is a reasonable way to do it. The honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, also on the issue of bona fides, that he had an understanding . about what consultation meant in relation to ministers appearing in this place. However, the procedure actually followed and detailed by him does not approximate to anything that lor any reasonable person would call consultation. Sadly, it is a matter of copping it sweet,· as we have heard a number of times from the Leader· of the House in relation to procedures, ministerial statements-all sorts of things. When there has not been a reasonable, logical answer, he has got up and shoved it down our necks. The thing that worries me is that a government that starts to behave with that sort of arrogance towards not only opposition members-whoever they may be-but also this parliament is a government that will visit grief on the Australian people. When debating associated matters during the last sitting week, I pointed out my concern that what the government does is very poorly reported in this country. I have seen how that affects a government's behaviour, and I have lived with it. I have lived with an administration whose members believed that their minister would never properly be brought to account at question time, much less by the press-it took a royal commission. Employees of government went out and wreaked evil acts on members of the public. I am referring, of course, to the Queensland police force. I do not want any smart answers from the Leader of the House about the colour of that government, because it is happening now in Queensland-but once again we have a silent press. We have a scandal about the disbursement of public money by a minister. Is it not amazing how the changes to question time suddenly become urgent when the government has a real scandal on its hands that people are really paying attention to? Members of the Australian public are really paying attention to it because sport affects them like virtually no other issue. They are interested in where the sporting dollars go. It has caught the public's imagination. There are other issues that this government arrogantly brushes off day after day-issues that should be matters of great public concern. Ever more frequently now, it seems, the government rolls measures in here that take away from the ability and authority of this chamber to do what it should do, which is not to advance the Liberal Party, or the Labor Party, or the National Party, or any other political party, but to advance the nation. Very recently someone close to the system both here and in the United States commented to me that if politics were carried the way that it is here then that country would not be the country it is now. I think there is substance in that. Whilst that might be a subject for another time. I note that the Leader of the House raises his eyebrows-it would be worth debating, if we ever got the opportunity in here to debate an idea, but that rarely happens. The way business is conducted in this House, the rules that govern it and the way it flows outside are matters of great concern to me and, I believe, to other members-not only members of the opposition. The much laboured report of the Standing Committee on Procedure is a good instance of that. Government members recommended m\ltters which have not been reflected in these standing orders. These standing orders have moved a long way away from the recommendations. The honourable member for Bennelong has put forward a proposal to give some teeth, reality and real meaning to a standing order which is flouted daily in question time by ministers of the government. It will be interesting to see whether the government has any bona fides on that sort of change. Of course not. The Leader of the House would have exercised his mind only on how he could have scored some debating points in the course of this debate and not on how he might have addressed the subject. Sometimes I think the Leader of the House actually does care and have some concern about this place. Sometimes I think he would like to see it function well. The times I think that are when he does not reply to the debates, when he seeks to make some cheap debating points, when he knows in his own mind that he ought to be ashamed of the job he has been given to do here. ",85
179,Mrs SVLLIVAN,STANDING ORDERS,"I have just been reminded of that by the honourable member for Sturt. I am sorry about that, because I think there are good people on both sides of this parliament who genuinely want to see it function well. I do not believe that any real attempt to do that under this governmentwhether or not it is this amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong-will out there in ever be successful.",87
180,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"I will respond to the proposed amendment to the standing orders and subsequently close the debate. There has been a pretty reasonable discussion up to this point. I can understand a fair degree of the frustration and bitterness of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), after 11 years in opposition, but the changes to standing orders do not deserve the strictures directed at this government. There are areas of honourable debate over whether or not those opposite quite like the changes we have made to question time. If they do not work over the next few months, we will look at them and try something else. Those changes were written into the sessional orders. Virtually the only objections that the opposition has raised to any of the changes to the standing orders that we have brought during the last couple of weeks in response to the Blewett report have not been to the changes we have put into the standing orders but to the changes we have put into the sessional orders. So, contrary to the words of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), when he enjoined us to contemplate these things within the framework of changes to sessional orders, by and large we have not made changes to standing orders where there has not been consensus. I now tum to the opposition's proposed amendment to a standing order which predates this government. The right honourable member for New England would have us believe that at the time it was devised governments did not use their numbers in this place. That is not my recollection of his role of Leader of the House-when he exercised it from time to time. Perhaps as the years go by, however, memories grow dim on both sides and we have a much more forgiving attitude towards our youth than would have been the case at the time when perhaps that pomp was roundly and cheerfully exercised, whatever the objection of the. opposition of the day. The standing order refers to a statement that a document from which a minister is reading is confidential. I am amazed that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) believes that the particular document the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was quoting from was a document opposed to an issue that had been before the committee. I was sitting next to the minister and it was not possible for me to see the detail of the document, as it evidently was for the honourable member for Wide Bay, who was sitting on the opposition back benches. Although I cannot necessarily say for certain, because I was not examining the document, it looked to me like a standard ministerial briefing with the appropriate confidentiality attached. The fact that that part of the document dealt with an issue that had been considered by a committee is neither here nor there, because what establishes the confidentiality of the document is not what is read out by the minister but what exists in it elsewhere. Quite clearly, if the entire document were confidential, the minister would not be reading from it in any shape or form in the parliament. The point to be considered about confidentiality is whether or not other aspects of a document, the advice to a minister, are of a confidential nature. I have a memory of what it is like to be in opposition-hardly anyone on this side of the House now does, but I do at least - and I can recollect numerous occasions when ministers quoted. It was standard practice. Mr Sinclair interjecting",87
181,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"Nonsense! When we were in opposition, when a minister stood in this place, picked up a document and read from it at question time, instantly the relevant person on the opposition side would stand up and ask for it to be tabled. It is the normal, sensible thing for an opposition to do. Just as frequently, whenever that was asked of those opposite when they happened to be in government-a long time ago now-they protected the document with confidentiality. Sometimes the document was tabled, as is sometimes the case now, but far more often in both cases the document was kept by the minister. The honourable member for Wide Bay may have X-ray vision-and very long vision at that. If he has, I suggest he exit this place and sell his talent because he will do a heck of a lot better out there than he has ever managed to do in this place in terms of advancing his own interest and perhaps too the interests of the nation. He is truly a very special person! We will not support this particular change to the standing orders because there is no requirement for us to do so. It is a standing order that is in place; it is not a standing order that is abused. It has been used in exactly the same way by this government as it was by its predecessors. The honourable member for Moncrieff, who just sat down, talked in depressing and tired terms, as I am afraid is increasingly her want in this chamber, on the treatment having been meted out by the government. At the same time, we had the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) stand up in this place and ask us to shift private members business, particularly the 90-second statements, to another day. Again, my lengthy memory of this place does not cause me to recollect any time when I was in opposition having an opportunity to raise those matters. The opportunity did not exist.",88
182,Unknown,STANDING ORDERS,Opposition members interjecting,89
183,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"We had notices of motion. I recollect that notices of motion would just disappear after the first two or three general business Thursdays in every siting. They took about half a morning when they were called on. The old Notice Paper used to bank up like· nothing on earth. After about three sitting periods they would disappear straight out the backdoor and were not called on. The best we got from the government in those days was the grievance debate. That was, in fact, all that we got with any regularinobody ty at all. I take on board the suggestion that some part of private members business be shifted into what is now government business time. Hopefully, what is merely an accident this year will not be repeated each year. While I am going across the functions, it was a Labor government that established the House of Representatives committee system. We do not know whether the new second chamber will work because we have to do a fair bit to get it up and then we have to wait for a period of time till we get some material before it to see how it operates. If it operates how we anticipate it should operate then there will be a substantial improvement in the conduct of business in this place, thus allowing the degree of bipartisan attention that the honourable member for Moncrieff suggested we should have for the general consideration of material in this chamber. These are not the acts of an arrogant government. Any of them-the private members time, this particular proposition-are not the acts of an arrogant government. I challenge anybody to actually sit down and look at the histories of parliaments in Australia since Federation to see whether there have been more dramatic changes made in favour of private members business and the capacity of a government to operate than the changes made by this government. I do not accept those strictures. The proposition was put that if the US were like us then the US would not be the sort of country that it is. I am not absolutely certain what point is proved by that. I am not absolutely certain, as I have wandered around Washington from time to time, that that is actually how I want the living environment in this country to be. I know that the US Congress as a policy making outfit has atrophied. It is a major issue of scandal and concern in the United States that it has atrophied. We can get a 100 per cent critical view of the executive operating in the US Congress if we take the executive out of the parliamentthere is no doubt about that. That is entirely a plausible outcome; whether or not the nation would survive effectively is another question. Everybody owes the US a living; owes this country a living. Whether or not atrophy in our system would be tolerated by the rest of the world as atrophy in the US system is tolerated is another matter altogether, and that would be a debate of course for that day, were that day ever to occur. Great play was made by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) on the effectiveness or otherwise of the roster and how this enabled ministers to run away from the great issues of the day or that great issues would arise and nobody would be there to question. I understand the strictures of not wanting to be British, that is fair enough. That is news from the National Party, but I am glad to have those strictures put upon us. What happens in the House of Commons? Is the House of Commons an ineffective body, one incapable of handling the major issues of the day because the Prime Minister is only there twice a week and is not there for the other two days of sittings, and the secretary for foreign affairs turns up once every three weeks to answer questions? The minister for education in the British House of Commons turns up once every two or three weeks. Has the system collapsed in the British House of Commons? Is it a ridiculous, ineffectual place as a result of the fact that ministers appear once a fortnight for questioning, including ministers concerned with state security? Obviously, the British House of Commons has gone to the dogs! The ministers are not available. The British secretary for foreign affairs is not available on a daily basis for questioning on what is happening to Britain's security services. The Prime Minister is only available twice a week. Do not come on with this nonsense about the fact that it sits twice as much as we doit does. If we take the appearances by our ministers pro-rata to the appearance of ministers in the British House of Commons, we would not be having ministers rostered on twice a week, we would have ministers rostered on once in every two-week session and on occasions twice. That is what we would be doing if we went pro-rata with the British House of Commons. The Prime Minister's question time in the British House of Commons goes for 15 minutes, not 45. I notice that whatever complaints opposition members raise about the way in which the roster operates at the moment, they still managed to just about double the number of questions they have asked in the entire year of the Prime Minister. They doubled it in one day under this system. So they are not really having much trouble coming to grips with the opportunity to question the Prime Minister. So there we have it. There is so much cant and hypocrisy around this place, which is indeed depressing after opposition members had so much time and opportunity to make their points. There is absolutely no substance to the complaints of the opposition. I can understand their bitterness on that, but the fact of the matter is that there is at least as much accountability-in fact, a great deal more accountability-of individual ministers that people want to question. A particular minister is capable of being questioned four times in a fortnight instead of, admittedly under the previous system, seven times in a fortnight. But it scarcely lets them off the hook, if that is the way the opposition wants to talk about it. If we did go to the British House of Commons situation where they appeared once a fortnight, if that, we might say that ministers are being let off the hook. Nobody seriously challenges the British House of Commons, nor should they challenge our system where much better availability of ministers is the case under this new system. So there is no need to address those concerns. There is ample opportunity to question ministers where there are serious issues involved. There is ample opportunity to raise security issues where they are matters of concern. Question time is not the only form of the House that is available to question ministers. I think honourable members have ample time. The honourable member for Moncrieff raised the question of what happened with the set of amendments to this particular bill. The seven-day gap would make no difference to the circumstances about which she was referring. In fact, the gap is very considerably greater than seven days. There has been no suggestion from the committee or anyone else that the government would not move amendments at the second reading phase immediately the second reading phase was brought on or shut it down for 24 hours once it decided to move amendments in the second reading phase. That has not been suggested by anybody. But they are the sorts of circumstances which she is complaining about, not the gap between the first reading and second reading, which is at issue here. I move: That the question be now put.",89
184,Mr HOWARD,STANDING ORDERS,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker: I just wondered whether the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), with indulgence, would specifically respond to the point I quite seriously raised about our giving the government. notice requiring the attendance for a specific purpose of a minister who is not rostered-under pain of not being able to raise the matter in the future-would the government consider allowing that minister to appear. It seems to me to be a fair accommodation, in this period of operation of that standing order, of a legitimate opposition interest and it was something that was raised in good faith by the former member for Bonython when he first raised this matter with me.",90
185,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS," Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence: we dealt pretty thoroughly in the course of the debate with exactly this sort of circumstance. The sessional orders in this case were in the process of being changed. We presented the argument that we thought-as I did then-there was enough time to quiz any particular minister in four question times. The situation still applies. Question resolved in the affirmative. Question put: That the words proposed to be added (Mr Howard's amendment) be so added. The House divided. [6.45 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 October, on motion by Dr Theophanous: That the bill be now read a second time.",90
186,Mrs SULLIVAN,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"Moncrieft) (6.53 p.m.)The coalition reaffirms its view that individual home ownership is a basic foundation of the Australian way of life. We have always supported this concept and continue to do so. The purpose of the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill is to amend the Housing Assistance Act 1989 under which the states, with financial assistance from the Commonwealth, deliver housing assistance for rental housing and home purchase in accordance with the tenns of the 1989 Commonwealthstate housing agreement which is usually referred to as CSHA. The bill amends these appropriations in subsection 7(3A) of the act so as to decrease the appropriation for 1993-94 by $38 million, increase it for 1994-95 by $17 million and increase it for 1995-96 by $17 million. I understand that these changes have been endorsed by state and territory ministers. In his second reading speech, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services said: This bill is also consistent with improved cash management arrangements for the CSHA which have been negotiated successfully with the states the Commonwealth government. These arrangements provide for improved accountability for Commonwealth funds which are provided to the states under the CSHA. Whether the objective of improved accountability is achieved remains to be seen. It is certainly fervently to be desired. Accountability for Commonwealth housing funds has been the subject of strong criticism by the Auditor-General. For example, his comments on aspects of the Commonwealthstate housing agreement, which were tabled on 31 September 1993, contain damning comment on housing policy under the federal Labor government and the current minister. The Auditor-General's audit report No.6 of 1993-94 at page 26 states: One aspect that is frequently overlooked by departments and agencies is the need for clear identificagovernments tion, measurement and reporting of Commonwealth obligations of exposure under the agreement. In the case of housing, for example, data currently available to the department is insufficient to determine both the true levels of subsidies provided under the various housing assistance schemes and the overall exposure of the Commonwealth under its obligations to meet any shortfalls in the ation of those schemes. The shadow minister for public housing and community service, Senator Tambling, has pointed out that these comments compounded criticisms made earlier in ANAO audit report No.1 of 1991-92. In that report the Auditor General commented critically on a range of housing and planning issues and agreements between the Commonwealth and state governments. Furthennore, questioning of officers of the then Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services at recent Senate estimates committee hearings elicited an admission that the department has not responded to the Auditor-General's recommendations with any degree of urgency. The billions of dollars of Commonwealth revenue spent on public housing make this an important issue, both to the taxpayer who is footing the bill and to the many Australians in need of housing assistance. The Industry Commission's report on public housing is another shocking report card on Labor's housing record. Alann bells should be ringing around Australia about the diabolical mess by public housing is in. The commission suggested a number of reforms to the operation of the CSHA. One major refonn dealt with a radical redistribution of power between the states and the Commonwealth with respect to housing provision. One of the main problems with the CSHA identified by the Industry Commission is an overlapping and blurring of Commonwealth and state responsibilities for the operation and accountability of the agreement. According to the Industry Commission report: The Commonwealth is a partner with joint responsibility but little real control over the effectiveness and efficiency of the programs. It is currently trying to inject greater accountability into CSHA programs through performance monitoring. Shared responsibility also affects incentives facing governments. The CSHA funding arrangements reduce the incentives to provide services at least cost. State do not receive any financial benefit from cost savings because they must match Commonwealth payments. Indeed funding on the condition that the monies must be spent may provide a perverse incentive ... The lack of clearly defined objectives under the CSHA weakens the incentive to make decisions transparent. oper- A key issue of concern to the Industry Commission was the need to strengthen the role of the states in housing matters and the need for better and clearer delineation of the respective roles of each level of government. More specifically, the commission advocated that the Commonwealth's role be restricted to that of the provision of income supportessentially, the provision of rent assistanceand that the states be responsible for public housing and that the CSHA be replaced by bilateral agreements in line with these changes as from 1995. When the report was released on 13 January, a joint statement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) acknowledged the Industry Commission's emphasis on greater account!lbility by the federal government. The press release stated: The Commission concludes that more transparent funding and institutional arrangements and greater clarity in the objectives and responsibilities of Commonwealth and State{ferritory government, will be necessary to enable the optimum mix of assistance measures to be identified. One would think that, after a decade of power and a number of reports' recommendirig reforms to the efficiency and accountability of Commonwealth-state housing agreements, this Labor government might have got it right by now. Unfortunately, this is not the case and those in the greatest need are the ones missing out on assistance, for example, those people eligible for public rental housing, various home purchase assistance schemes, community housing, mortgage and rent assistance and the provision of crisis accommodation, as well as those who are supposed to benefit from pensioner and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rental housing assistance. The Industry Commission pointed out that two per cent of the federal budget goes towards housing assistance each year and even a small improvement in the performance of housing authorities would yield large benefits. Public housing authorities own and manage about 370,000 dwellings in Australia-nearly six per cent of the nation's housing stock-which means that reform would have a big impact on the housing and property sectors. The commission recommended major restructuring of public housing authorities to improve their management of Australia's $30 billion worth of public housing. For example, the commission claimed that the state and territory public housing authorities have been too insulated from the real world of property management and that they could improve both their performance and the provision of housing to needy families. A major recommendation was to split the functions of housing authorities into two parts-a property management agency, which would run housing stock and be run on commercial lines, and an agency to rent subsidised properties. The commercial agency would manage and maintain the housing on either a fee for service basis or a contractual basis. Housing stock would be valued at current· market prices rather than the initial capital cost, which is not a meaningful figure. This splitting of the roles of housing authorities should make the provision of public housing more accountable. Further, being free from the function of building dwellings and managing properties would allow for more concentration on meeting the welfare priorities of public housing. Nevertheless, the key public housing issue still remains; namely, waiting lists and stock levels. Notwithstanding the large amount of money devoted to public housing through the operation of the CSHA, there is still a substantial shortfall in the provision of adequate accommodation for those in need. It is estimated that the current public housing stock in Australia is approximately 370,000 dwellings or 5.6 per cent of all housing. The state and territory breakdown of public housing stock numbers as at June 1992 is as follows: in New South Wales, 124,500; in South Australia, 63,000; in Victoria, 61,400; in Queensland, 38,900; in Western Australia, 35,300; in Tasmania, 14,200; in the Australian Capital Territory, 12,300; and in the Northern Territory, 9,300. In addition, it is estimated that there are between 12,000 and 15,000 community and cooperative houses spread throughout the states and territories. The latest available figures on waiting lists for public housing for each of the states and territories are as follows: in New South Wales, 64,895; in Victoria, 52,522; in Queensland, 24,448; in Western Australia, 14,694; in South Australia, 43,520; in Tasmania, 4,539; in the Australian Capital Territory, 6,615; and in the Northern Territory, 8,061. These figures are as at June 1992, except for New South Wales and South Australia, where the figures are as at June 1991. It is noteworthy that the states that had Labor governments for several years, mainly Victoria and South Australia, were the ones with the highest proportion of population waiting lists for public housing. Excluding New South Wales and South Australia, where the 1992 figures are not available, four of the other six states and territories experienced substantial increases. in the number of people on waiting lists between June 1991 and June 1992. Over that period, waiting lists in Victoria increased from 44,634 to 52,522, in Queensland from 22,507 to 24,448, in the Australian Capital Territory from 3,731 to 6,615, and in the Northern Territory from 6,167 to 8,061. These figures indicated that few inroads were being made in the backlog of demand for public housing and that some states and territories-most notably, Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory-were falling further behind in the provision of public housing. The steady increase in unemployment to more than one million after the dates I have mentioned has meant thousands more Australians have been added to those already in need. The recession we had to have, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), undoubtedly increased dramatically the already shamefully long waiting lists. I now tum to the future housing needs of Australia's population. The national housing strategy identified a number of trends that may influence the type of housing required in the 21st century. As these trends accelerate, it is possible that the number of inappropriately housed people will increase, unless there are changes in the type of housing provided. Figures provided by the Bureau of Immigration Research clearly illustrate the strong trend to an older population. The median age of the population has risen from 22.5 years in 1901 to 32.5 years in 1991. According to the Bureau of Immigration Research, in 1901 only four per cent of the population was aged 65 or over. By 1961 this figure had risen to 8.5 per cent and in 1991 to 11.4 per cent. It is estimated that by 2031, 20 per cent of the population will be in this group. Despite this ageing population, the predominant housing style is still detached accommostate dation on large, often quarter-acre blocks. Such housing may not be appropriate for a number of older people who have no children and especially frail aged people who are living on their own. I speak from experience. My own electorate includes the most popular retirement region in Australia; namely, the Gold Coast. The decline in availability of specialised accommodation for the frail aged in particular has led to many of them feeling isolated and impossibly burdened by a once loved home. Tragically, this can lead to a feeling that life itself is a burden-a lonely struggle to cope. A strongly emerging housing trend on the Gold Coast has been for developers to switch to building multiple complexes of townhouses. This certainly economises on land; however, it is no more appropriate for elderly people. The need for them to constantly cope with the physical demand of staircases in the course of daily life is not only inappropriate but also downright dangerous, given their susceptibility to crippling, and sometimes deadly, falls. Clearly, local councils need to give urgent consideration to how they can expedite the provision of an adequate diversity of appropriate housing as well as associated infrastructure and services. All too often local regulations and charges are a hindrance through inflexible, even punitive or greedy, requirements. The national housing strategy identified two further social demographic trends that housing policy makers will need to consider; namely, women's changing role and the tendency towards smaller households. When referring to women in the work force, the strategy says: The strong upward trend in the proportion of women in paid jobs is expected to continue into the future, with 60 per cent of Australian women projected to be in paid employment within 15 years time (compared with around 40 per cent now). This will create a growing need for housing that is well located in relation to such services as training and child care. The government's attitude to the urban dweller is of concern to me. I refer to the proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to examine the role of cities and regions and to suggestions that urban sprawl should attract special financial penalties. As someone whose electorate is part of the fastest growing region in Australia, I am all for forward planning of infrastructure and services. However, I am utterly opposed to the Deputy Prime Minister trying to impose a building code which dictates and limits the size of our homes. For example, the Labor Party's housing policy, released during the 1993 federal election, states: Almost half the households today have only one or two people living in them. Yet 80 per cent of our housing comprises buildings with three or more bedrooms on large blocks of land. Whose business is that, other than that of those who choose to live in them? Even making allowance for the unsatisfied needs of some of our elderly citizens to whom I have already referred, it is not the business of - government to pass judgment on whether households of one or two people should occupy homes with three bedrooms. I agree with the President of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, Mr Ray Milton, who responded to the Deputy Prime Minister as follows: Any new form of tax or rates penalty on people living on new estates in city fringe age urban sprawl simply won't work, and will cause unnecessary hardship to lower income households. He went on to say that the Deputy Prime Minister's preoccupation with urban sprawl was based on social engineering, not community planning. He said: Most of the material we have seen in favour of restricting so-called urban sprawl has been little more than expensive government propaganda. An Australian's home has always been regarded as his or her castle. Whether a person is building or purchasing a home, its number of rooms and the number of people living in it should be the prerogative of the home owner and not some meddlesome government. I now tum my attention to the fact that this afternoon proposed amendments to this bill together with an explanatory memorandum were tabled in the chamber. I inform the House that the shadow minister for housing and community services, Senator Tambling, was informed by the minister's office at 12.30 p.m. today that it was the government's intention to introduce these amendments. The normal courtesies such as consultations with shadow ministers to enable further consultations with party committees and other interested people have not been observed. The shadow minister then contacted various state housing ministers on the ground that these amendments were supposed to have been agreed to by them and he was informed that a number of them had not received copies of these amendments. They were apparently under the misapprehension that the item was to be placed on the agenda for a Commonwealth-state housing ministers conference next Monday. The opposition then made a request to the government that debate on this bill be deferred until tomorrow so that it could have an opportunity to have basic consultations and to get some basic information and briefings on the subject. That request was declined. The request was forwarded through the office of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I referred to this matter a while ago when we were debating the bona fides of the government with respect to the proposed changes to areas to discourthe standing orders. The response given to the opposition in relation to this matter was that this bill could not be delayed. I point out that it would have caused no real dislocation in the debate. Prior to question time today, a debate on the appropriation bills was under way. That debate was adjourned before question time. There was a substantial list of speakers ready to speak in that debate but time did not permit it. It would have been a very simple matter to have resumed the debate on the appropriation bills now and relisted this matter for tomorrow. This bill has been in parliament since the middle of October last year. That is the priority the government has given to debate on this bill. Today the government arrogantly whacked in amendments to this bill. There was no consultation and no notice given to the shadow minister before 12.30 today that there _were going to be any amendments to this bill. The government then insisted that the bill must be debated and voted on today. The answer to the opposition's request for a delay was that the bill was to be debated in the Senate tomorrow. There was no reason whatsoever given for why it had to be debated in the Senate tomorrow. It is not going to be in the Senate tomorrow. I can assure the government that, even if we had not had the previous debate on standing orders, it would not be in the Senate tomorrow. That is not going to advance in any way. the knowledge of opposition members when they come to look at this bill and the amendments of substance that are before us. It is not going to enhance the debate. I make the point that there is no need for this bill to be in the Senate tomorrow. There was no reason why this bill could not have been deferred until tomorrow and basic courtesies shown to the opposition. The Leader of the House alleged earlier today that I appeared bitter, despairing, tired or depressed. I will put the bitterness aside and hot even comment on that. I am tired. I am fed up. I have had 11 years of this pompous nonsense and I am fed up, as are many people, with the government getting away with it-but that is a subject for another day. I am fed up with the fact that the minister never listens to the debate. I have nothing against these advisers present, but I have ministers come into the House to reply to a second reading debate and have incorrect information put into their hands which they have read into the record. I can remember occasions when that has happened and I deplore it. I deplore even more the fact that the ministers do not even bother to respond to the debates. Will the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) enter the debate? Will he acknowledge the debate? Will we ever know whether he took into account anything that was said here? Of course not. He has the disease I referred to earlier-the Keating disease; the arrogance and contempt shown for not just the opposition but the chamber and the people outside. It is not contempt for the Liberal Party. It is not contempt for the opposition of this parliament. It is contempt for the institution. If there are no answers, no accountability and no reasonable courtesies shown here then the parliament operates only in name, not in form. I referred earlier to my state parliament of some years ago when we had a government that clearly considered parliament as an inconvenience to its rule and treated it as such. That is exactly the way parliament is being treated now and these amendments are a prime example of that. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House: (\) deplores the haste with which the Government has prepared its amendment to the 8i1\; (2) regrets the Government's failure to observe the normal parliamentary courtesies and consultations necessary for proper consideration of legislation; and . (3) seeks an assurance from the Government that the normal courtesies necessary for proper consideration of proposed legislation in this chamber will be observed in future"". Under the heading 'Financial impact', the amendment's explanatory memorandum mentions the addition of a new subsection I5(2A) and that the new section 15 will not result in any additional Commonwealth outlays. The opposition has no information on how this new section is going to affect state outlays. That information has not been given seen to us by the government in its explanatory memorandum and we have not had the opportunity to get an assessment from state governments of how they might be affected. Obviously, the minister is acting incompetently, with undue and suspicious haste. There is no need for this haste. That is the reason for my moving the amendment to the motion for the second reading. We will vote on this amendment and the government will vote it down. I hope that in future the House and the opposition are not treated in the same contemptuous way as the minister-who after all is the Deputy Prime Minister and of whom one would expect higher standards-has treated us on this occasion.",91
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ruddock-Yes, absolutely.",96
188,Mr OCONNOR,HOUSING ASSISTANCE,"I support the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 which seeks to amend specific appropriations made under the Housing Assistance Act of 1989. For the period 1993 to 1996, it gives effect to a number of decisions announced in the 1993-94 budget concerning the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. Labor in government has laid before the Australian people a comprehensive and integrated national housing policy agenda like no other government before it has done in the post-World War II era. The overriding objective of that housing agenda has been to ensure that all Australians have access to secure and affordable housing which is appropriate to their needs-be they in the private rental market, as public housing tenants or as home buyers. The effective operation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is central to the achievement of that objective. Under the terms of this bill, the Commonwealth will make available some $1.25 billion under the CSHA in 1993-94. This will comprise $1.042 billion as a planned budgetary allocation and some $89 million in unpaid funds that are carried through from 1992-93. The size of this funding is an indication of the economic and social significance of the government's commitment to public housing and community housing and its support for crisis accommodation and housing for special needs. The bill gives effect to a number of decisions announced in the last budget relating to the CSHA and it involves the rephasing of $25 million, which was originally brought forward to 1993-94 from 1994-95 and 199596, for the purposes of employment generation. It also involves a rephasing of $10 million under the community housing program which was originally to be available for payment in 1993-94. It also involves a one-off . adjustment of $3.5 million to new 1993-94 funds for the crisis accommodation program. All of these proposals are consistent with the government's continuing strong support for public housing, crisis accommodation and community housing in Australia. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) had some fine words to say on the floor of this parliament about the fact that government proposes to make an amendment to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill. But it is really a case of crocodile tears from the honourable member for Moncrieff. Time and again opposition members come into this House and waste the House's valuable time with procedural motions and endless debates that have no real relevance to the nitty-gritty of the meaningful legislation that is passed through this place. There has been adequate consultation with the opposition in this regard and it is very important that these measures be passed through this parliament today. So let us not have any more of these crocodile tears about the government ramming particular amendments through this place and the opposition being a little bit offside and unprepared. Any honourable members opposite worth their salt would be pretty well prepared for any sort of contingency in their policy area that is brought onto the floor of this parliament and they would be able to respond fairly quickly to it. The major amendment proposed to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 will be introduced by the government tomorrow. Effectively it amends section 15 of the Housing Assistance Act 1989 and basically deals with the matching ()f untied grants provided by the Commqnwealth to the states. The amendment to section 15 of this act sets out provisions for the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state in 1994-95, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with the provisions of the existing CSHA. . New section 15A sets out a provision for the Commonwealth minister to waive or reduce the obligations of a state or territory to match the balance of untied assistance provided by the Commonwealth to a state or territory for housing assistance from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs. This provision will apply the only for 1993-94 and 1994-95. Such determination will be made only where the minister, after consultations with the relevant state minister, is satisfied that the state is unable to match the balance of untied grants from the value of home loans made. This new provision will mean that where the Commonwealth minister is satisfied that circumstances warrant the action outlined above the Commonwealth will not have to reduce untied grant funding, as required under the act for public housing in 1994-95, in a state that expects it will not be able to meet its home lending requirement under the CSHA. The provision will also enable the minister, in 1993-94 and 1994-95, to determine that a state has met its matching obligation and therefore will not have to recover financial assistance already provided as required under this agreement. As the honourable member for Moncrieff has already informed the House, this new section 15A will not involve any additional Commonwealth outlays. The amendment being proposed in this bill has been brought about by a situation in the states where demand for home purchase assistance products has significantly declined. This has primarily been due to the attractiveness of commercial products in our current economic situation. Recently in question time the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) outlined to the House how housing affordability has improved because of the general economic circumstances that have been engin-ered by this government. I refer to the low level of interest rates prevailing in the economy at the moment, particularly for housing, the low level of inflation and, of course, lower housing prices that are being brought into the marketplace due to the recessed conditions that have existed over the last couple of years. The CSHA requires the states to match untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with half the matching assistance to be provided through states grants and the other half in the form of loans made under approved home purchase assistance schemes. The CSHA provides that, in situations where the matching requirements are not met by the states, as in 1993-94, the Commonwealth can seek recovery of financial assistance already provided. The Housing Assistance Act also provides that, in situations where a state is not expected to meet its matching obligation, the Commonwealth may reduce its untied grant funding. I guess this is an option for the Commonwealth in the present situation in respect of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. But it is not a course of action that the Commonwealth is prepared to entertain for the following reason: were the government to pursue these options it would simply mean that less money would be made available for public housing and, given the current strong demand for public housing in this country, such an action would Tun counter to the government's policy of providing affordable housing to those in need of assistance. Another important factor to take into account in this situation i- that in past years some states have increased their lending in excess of their matching requirements. They have demonstrated to a degree their bona fides in this regard and I guess it is time for the Commonwealth to demonstrate some sympathy with the states' position. Also, in current situations where changed economic and market conditions are indeed beyond the control of the states, it would be somewhat unreasonable for the Commonwealth to pursue the aforementioned options under the CSHA. There is also a danger that if states are forced into increasing their lending through this program at this particular time we may see more loans being made to marginal clients which may not be in their long-term economic interest if economic circumstances change. This new provision to allow the minister to authorise untied grants where there is some expectation that they will not be matched by the states is simply necessary because, under the act's current provisions, the minister would not be able to authorise the full level of grants for that particular year. This would mean a reduction of funds for public housing being made available by the Commonwealth and would run counter to the government's desire to maintain and expand the public housing stock in this country. Let me make some general comments on some major elements of the CommonweaIthstate housing agreement, which in effect sets out a framework for the cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states on housing matters. The CSHA represents a clear commitment by the Commonwealth to provide, where possible, an expanding stock of public housing and an increased supply of affordable housing. This agreement should not be seen as a framework in splendid isolation from the general macro-economic settings which have produced low interest rates, low inflation and attractive levels of housing affordability not seen in this country for a long time. The policy breadth of the CSHA can be understood when one fully appreciates that it provides finance for home purchase assistance schemes, public housing, mortgage and rent relief schemes, and specific assistance schemes targeted at the disadvantaged and the needy. As far as Labor in government is concerned, we have put our money where our mouth is in meeting our social justice agenda. As I said before, in 1994-95 over $1.125 billion will be committed through this agreement to housing. The CSHA, as it stands, guarantees funding to the states for housing until the end of 1995-96 and, in return for the stability and security of this financial commitment, the states have agreed to reforms to planning and cash management arrangements that will improve the accountability of the state housing authorities and also make their services more responsible to client needs. Improved consultation, planning and reporting arrangements will ensure that this government's objectives in the housing area are adequately met. As I noted earlier, the appropriations give effect to a rephasing of $10 million for the community housing program. I would like to briefly touch onaspects of this program which was given a fiscal stimulus in the 1992-93 budget. The aim of the governmel)t is quite clear and that is to double the size of the community housing stock to at least 25,000 units by the tum of the century. We view this sector as being well placed to meet the housing needs of low income earners and those with special needs in the community. Debate interrupted. NA",96
189,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Hinkler, Mr Bert",99
190,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"On this date 66 years ago, squadron leader Bert Hinkler landed his Avro Avian at Darwin airport, completing one of the greatest solo flights of all time. He left Croydon in England on 7 February 1928 and landed in Darwin on 22 February-15 th days later. That flight electrified the world and made Hinkler a celebrity overnight-somewhat akin to the astronauts of today as, indeed, he was in his own era a great celebrity and a great pioneer of aviation. He went on from there to conduct a magnificent circuit of Australia-a lap of honour, if you like-where he was feted by prime ministers, premiers, mayors and shire chairmen. He was granted a civic reception on the steps of the old Parliament House in 1928, only a year after its opening. That was not his only famous flight. In 1921 he flew from Sydney to Bundaberg-8 3/4 hours-on one tan k of fuel and landed on the Foundry green near his home in Gavan Street, north Bundaberg. The photo of his taxiing to his mother's home in Gavan Street is one of the great historical photos of Australia. That record stood until comparatively recent times. Both those planes, the Avro Baby which he flew in 1921 and the Avro Avian that he flew in 1928, are now exhibits in the Queensland Museum. Hinkler played a significant part in British and Australian aviation. Little-known facts are that he was the first person to fly solo across the South Atlantic, he was the first person to fly the South Atlantic from west to east and he was the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a light aircraft. He also developed an aircraft known as the Ibis, which was the forerunner of the late Buccaneer and was perhaps 20 years ahead of its time. He was killed· in 1933 attempting another record to Australia, crashing in the Pratomagno Alps in Italy. He was buried in Florence by the then fascist government-a tribute to an Australian perhaps for whom they had no great love but who was recognised as a world hero. He was buried with a state funeral in Florence in 1933. I have a connection with him in that, with Tom Quinn and Lex Rowland and later with Stan Lohse and Merv Purkiss, we brought his house from Southampton in England to Australia brick by brick and erected it in north Bundaberg using the original architect's plans. That was probably one of the most significant relocations in Australia's history. The house now stands in the. new botanical gardens in Bundaberg, exquisite in its decor, and it has been responsible for the sourcing of 3,000 items of historical aviation memorabilia. 'f,his man was resourceful. He was underfunded, yet with all the drawbacks he had an indomitable spirit and he ranks with Kingsford Smith as one of Australia's greatest aviators and certainly Australia's greatest pioneer aviator. Tonight, two-thirds of a century on, it is fitting that we should remember this man after whom the Hinkler electorate is named-an electorate that I am intensely proud to represent. Waterfront Reform",99
191,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I stand to support the Sydney wharfies. The Sydney wharfies and the Maritime Union of Australia are taking action against the casualisation of their jobs. This action has been forced upon the workers in the stevedoring industry by their employer, Australian Stevedores, which is determined to reduce, by compulsory redundancy, permanent jobs and replace them with casual employment. These jobs have not gone; they are being casualised. This comes about after some 4,600 jobs have been shed. That represents over half of the work force of 1991. The industry position agreed to by all parties in the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority was for 3,000 workers to leave voluntarily and, to ensure the rejuvenation, 1,000 new young workers were to be recruited. To date, only 250 have been employed and more than 4,600, far in excess of the required 3,000 figure, have voluntarily left the industry. Mr Corrigan, the Chairman of Australian Stevedores, and Mr J. Sweetensen, the Managing Director of Australian Stevedores, have openly stated on more than one occasion the enormous gains in productivity and efficiency since the introduction of the waterfront reform process. Why then have these employers attempted to enforce compulsory retrenchments? This can only be answered in two ways: their desire to casualise the industry on terms inferior to award conditions of permanent employees and-the key question-their attempt to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. The union recognises that the industry has peaks and troughs due to the ups and downs of the economy and irregular shipping. However, it demands that the right to negotiate with employers at the level of supplementation will not be dictated by the employers as solo to how many supplementary employees should be employed. By these very actions they are attempting to drag the union back to the bad old days of the bull system of pick up-the destruction of the roster system and the right of employers to pick heads. That degrading system of employment was defeated in 1943. Permanency of the industry, embraced by the employers, came about in 1967 and has continued to operate effectively ever since. During the waterfront reform process, the union delivered tremendous and unprecedented gains to the employers and the shipowners. The union is prepared to negotiate, by agreement, further reforms which would result in increased cost savings to Australian Stevedores. However, a real job is a right, and a real job is a permanent job. Casualisation takes away this basic right. Casualisation leads to impoverishment and a lowering of conditions and award rights. Casualisation is being at the beck and call of employers when and wherever they want. Casualisation means a loss of conditions that have been fought for over many years-things such as sick pay, annual leave and long service leave. Casualisation is intimidation of workers. Casualisation is an attempt to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. It will not be accepted and it will not work. The union has a grand record in its microeconomic reform of the waterfront: 21 awards replaced by a single award; enterprise agreements in all major workplaces; the work force slashed from 8,872 to 3,818-a 57 per cent reduction; productivity more than doubled; average crane rates up 57 per cent; days lost in disputation down from four per cent in the 1980s to 0.1 per cent; and stevedoring charges reduced by an average of 30 per cent. In anyone's books these people have been tremendous in what they have done. To tum around and see them having their jobs casualised by an employer which has no regard for their integrity is outrageous. Anyone who wants to know about what is happening in the waterfront should read the book by Rupert Lockwood Ship to Shor:, which is a record of the history of the mafttime unions in Melbourne. There is a lesson to be learned by the Labor Party, and that is that we have to back these people because they are the heart and soul of what it really means to be part of the labour movement. They are indeed true believers. Discrimination",100
192,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (7.40 p.m.)According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 February, Mrs Denise Annetts, 29, who last month claimed she was excluded from the Australian women's cricket team's tour of New Zealand because she is heterosexual and married, has decided to retire from international cricket.",101
193,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Disgraceful.,101
194,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is disgraceful. Mrs Annetts holds three world batting records, has a test average of 81.9 and a limited overs average of 41.7. She was described by the Melbourne Age cricket journalist Peter Roebuck on 17 January this year as 'a considerable cricketer, one of the greatest women batters to· play for Australia'. He went on to say that she had scored well in the recent trials Perth and her omission from the team 'was a shock to her coach and most other players'.",101
195,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,And to the community.,101
196,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Aid to the community at large, as the honourable member corre-tly says. It is indeed unfortunate that the nahon should lose such an excellent cricketer, but the circumstances of her going are even more unfortunate. As many in this place would know, Mrs Annetts's departure hinged on the fact that she was unable to appeal against what she believed was discrimination on the grounds of her being heterosexual or, dare I say it, 'normal'.",101
197,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Outrageous ..,101
198,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is outrageous. Whether her complaint was legitimate or not may never be known because the New South Wales anti-discrimination board, which was incorporated to ensure equal treatment for all, cannot investigate Mrs Annetts's claims since they are not within its particular avenues of complaint. Presumably, those responsible for legislation to ensure that everybody is treated equally did not envisage discrimination against heterosexuality. My aim in raising the issue tonight is to highlight, through this rather unusual but extremely apt sports illustration, what is happening in the community. All around us, the splendid ideal of justice for everyone has been hijacked by vocal minority groups that appear to have achieved not just equality but privilege. Marion, Groves, in her article entitled 'When normal is made deviant' of the Sunday Herald-Sun of 23 January, makes a point when she says: Through positive discrimination we are fast reac-­ ing a point where white, married, non-ethnic heterosexuals will become the neglected underclass, without entitlement to consideration, subsidies or legal protection reserved for the minorities. This may seem extreme, but there is increasing evidence that it is the people of the mainstream, or norm, who need to be defended now. Denise Annetts is a glaring example, but there are many less prominent cases, especially among Australia's thousands of middleand working-class families. They realise that they are being discriminated in against in almost every way, but feel increasingly powerless to do anything about it. They know that noisy activist minorities from among radical feminists, anti-growth greens, militant Aboriginals. or social engineers control the Australian federal government and therefore society. They feel that this process has been going on for so long that normal mainstream thinking no longer counts in this country. They fear that decent behaviour and standards which have protected society over the centuries are fast disappearing. They feel threatened and powerless. It is fitting that in 1994, the International Year of the Family, as we are all very much aware, something positive should be done to redress such an unacceptable situation; something that goes deeper than glossy images and mouthed platitudes. Labor's handout policies are not the answer. They are at least in part the problem. The future of Australia depends on the sound traditional philosophical base of the Liberal and National parties' pro-family policies. Australia now needs policies which discriminate positively in favour of the mainstream, be it Mrs Denise Annetts or other average Australians. Goodna Christian School Education",101
199,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (7.43 p.m.)Last Friday night, 18 February, I had the opportunity to attend the Goodna Christian School in my electorate to perform the opening of stage one of the new technology building. It was certainly a very important occasion for that school community and I was very pleased to participate in it. From a very humble beginning in February 1977-this particular school started off with 56 students and only three teachers-the school has grown into an institution which caters for 732 students from year 1 right through to year 12. It is certainly a great record for that school in such a short time. Success like this can be achieved only through a great deal of hard work and diligence. That was quite evident to me at the Goodna Christian School on Friday night. The often intangible nature attributed to success such as this is the attitude, dedication and commitment of those associated with goals like this one.",102
200,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,And family values.,102
201,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Family values as well, which is once again quite evident there. I thank the honourable member for his interjection. Students acquire their attitudes to learning and society at school, attitudes that stay with them throughout their lives. That is very much evident, again, at this school. It is a shame that too few Australians realise just what a diverse educational system this nation actually has. In Australia, nearly one-third of all students attend non-government schools. This is in comparison with Britain, which has approximately seven per cent, and. the USA, which has approximately 11 per cent. With the provision of funds for projects like this new technological centre, the Keating government is continuing to support the· growth of non-government schools to continue the provision of the very best quality schooling for all young Australians. The Commonwealth is firmly committed to a dual system of education, one which provides a strong system of government schools while at the same time giving parents the choice of non-government education for the children. A particularly important aspect of education is parental involvement. According to a recent survey by the Australian Council for Educational Research of over 7,000 Australian schools, it was clearly identified that a high level of parental involvement is a key factor in effective schooling. The Goodna Christian School, I am pleased to say, enjoys this high level of parental involvement, which is a great credit to those parents involved. That, once again, was quite evident at this function on Friday night. The government believes that the students of today must be skilled members of Australia's work force into the 21st century. We are all well aware of the need for that. Our future prosperity as a nation will depend on their being able to acquire the skills and knowledge that will equip them for the challenges of the future. Schools s-ch as the Goodna Christian School, along with the many other fine schools in my electorate, and I am sure many other honourable members' electorates as well, are already on the way to providing just the sort of people needed to meet these challenges with confidence. To this end, the funding necessary for the construction of the manual arts, woodworking, metalworking and welding facilities at this school was most welcome as it, along with the school's contribution, will also enable construction of a finishing area and preparation and storeroom. This project; has cost some $538,000 to which the Commonwealth actually contributed $390,000. Obviously, the rest of the money was raised by the school itself. I am sure the parents involved with the school made a big contribution to that. Also, there was a lot of voluntary labour involved in the school. When I had the opportunity to inspect the facilities after the opening, some of the workbenches actually made by some of the teachers, students and parents during the school break were shown to me. I congratulate the school and its principal, Mr Chris Meadows,"" and all those people involved with this school on making these facilities the success they are. A technological centre like this is very important for our young people in the future as we all are well aware that we need more tradesmen in these times. Often during times of high unemployment, which we have unfortunately been through, we do not always see our employers training as many apprentices as they should. I welcome the initiatives by the Goodna Christian Scheiol and put on record my sincere appreciation for the way it conducts itself and for the warm welcome it gave me and others on Friday night.",102
202,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I think I have been in this place long enough now to look at what truth means. We always hear about what dastardly deeds are committed in this place, but today I looked at the definition of truth. The dictionary states: genuine; actual or factual; something that is true; a proven or verified fact. It is probably a bit unfashionable to talk about these things. A couple of the ministers today erred a little from that standard of the dictionary definition of genuine, actual or factual, a proven or verified fact. A minister commented today in question time on the rising water tables at Olympic Dam. She was talking about the radiation level",103
203,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Was that Ros?,103
204,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I think it was the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She criticised the Western Mining company and the state government. It is on the public record that the previous state Labor government knew what was happening. Western Mining has come out and has made all the possible public statements that are reasonable and is monitoring the situation very closely. As I have indicated, the radiation level in the water is no different from that which naturally occurs. Another example, which I thought tested the definition of 'truth' fairly well, is when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talked about the real estate of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan).",103
205,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,He wasn't here today.,103
206,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"No, I am sorry, he was here yesterday. I stand corrected and I thank the honourable member. The Prime Minister mentioned that the honourable member for Barker had not mentioned his real estate. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, the Prime Minister had failed to mention his piggery real estate as well. Another example of 'truth' today was when the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) talked about taxation. His proud claim today was Truth that this country has the lowest taxation in the world. But there were no supporting figures and there was no discussion about the actual structure of employment in the country and no discussion about small business and the failure rate, about agriculture, or the way indirect taxation falls on small business. We all remember the promise that there would be no increase in taxation, the l-a-w one. Truth, genuine, actual or factual, is still fairly carelessly handled in this place by some. In conclusion, I think that without truth in politics our national values are eroded and democracy is the poorer for it. Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology",103
207,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Fisher) (7.52 p.m.)Tonight I wish to take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House one of the most extraordinary collections of fine arts antiquities in Australia. I would also like to congratulate the Abbey community residents in Caboolture who give their time and energy to ensure the success of one of Australia's most unusual museums-in fact, it is unique. The Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology, situated in the shire of Caboolture in Fisher electorate, has become an international drawcard for the region. It has now been open for about seven years and attracts nearly 40,000 people each year from around Australia and overseas. Some material at the museum dates back 500,000 years, and the history of the collections housed at Caboolture's Abbey Museum is as rich as the collections themselves. Any history of the Abbey Museum must make reference to its founder, the Reverend John Sebastian Marlow Ward. This unique museum owes its rich and varied collections to the imagination and ability of Ward, one of England's most eclectic and visionary collectors; in fact, Queen Mary made donations of material to the museum. Ward was born in England in 1855, the son of an Anglican priest. He was deeply spiritual and in 1929 formed a mixed monastic community which, following in the tradition of the medieval Christian abbeys, adopted a program of education and preservation of heritage. In 1934 Ward founded Britain's first social history museum, the Abbey Folk Park, near London. He concentrated on preserving the traditional heritage of England, which was rapidly disappearing in the wake of industrialmade isation and change. By 1940 he had collected more than 40,000 items. The bombing of London in that year forced the closure of the Abbey Museum and Ward and his followers emigrated to Cyprus where he died in 1949. Terrorism again forced members of the community out of their home and they arrived virtually penniless in Sydney in 1956 and 10 years later moved to Caboolture. It was not until 1978 that a decision was made to resurrect the museum and make the remains of the collection available to the public. Building commenced in 1983 and the Abbey Museum was opened in June 1986 by Sir Gordon Chalk, a former Liberal leader. I was priviand leged to be present at that opening when previously the member for Fisher. The excellent work of the Abbey Museum's director, Michael Strong, the staff and community helpers has in a shprt period once again brought the Abbey Museum international acclaim. This international respect is the witnessed by the increasingly valuable donations of material which are being given to the Abbey Museum-for instance, material from the famous Merton Priory founded by Thomas Becket in AD 1150. Also on its way to Caboolture's Abbey Museum is an Anglo Saxon skeleton, a gift from the Lincolnshire cqunty council, to acknowledge the contribution of the Abbey Museum in the exhibition of the Magna Carta during Expo 88. The museum's collections include British Bronze Age material and an Islamic and Byzantine collection. Other significant pieces include the early prehistoric collections, which date back 500,000 years, and those from medieval Europe and Roman Britain. The museum is in two sections. On entering, visitors are led through a time passage which explores history, technology, art, social and philosophical concepts, unfolding to insights of prehistoric hunters and farmers, to Bronze and Iron Age Europe, Roman Britain, Viking life and on through medieval and Renaissance periods to the 18th and 19th centuries. The second section encompasses both the ancient and classical worlds. Other displays are devoted to other parts of civilisation. The collection is still predominantly that by John Ward and in line with his monastic community in the early 1900s. The Abbey Museum provides an excellent educational facility. An average of 800 students per month visit the museum from schools all over Australia. The museum is, however, in much need of further funding to construct a second wing, which would greatly enhance the facilities and educational resources on offer. The museum has also pioneered the rescue of Aboriginal sites in the Caboolture shire. It also stages an annual medieval tournament, which is fast becoming one of the most important historical festivals in south-east Queensland. Thousands of people attend each year and generally some 250 'knights' in full authentically reconstructed armour take the field. This year I was honoured to be invited to open it. The museum and its related work offer a singularly valuable addition to Australia's heritage. During my first term in parliament in the mid-1980s, I was able to assist the Abbey Museum in obtaining a CEP grant which enabled much work to be done. I have given the museum my continued support throughout the years and I have watched it develop to a museum of international standard. I hope in the future to see additional funding made available to this important facility so that all Australians and school students have the opportunity to travel back through the centuries and enjoy the richness of history and art which is on display at Caboolture's Abbey Museum.

211,Mrs KELLY,TERRITORIES PROGRAM,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2)(a) The respondents were the Commonwealth of Australia and the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. (2)(b) The applicants claimed that the addition of the Conservation Zone to Kakadu National Park by proclamations made under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 amounted to an acquisition of property, ie mining leases, and that the proclamations and the legislation pursuant to which they were made were invalid because just terms for the acquisition had not been provided as sections 51 (31) and 122 of the Constitution and/or section 50(2) of the Northern Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1978 require. (3) FrenchJ of the Federal Court held that the first applicant was the lawful lessee of mining leases MLN 23-28, 78-89, 751-756. (4)(a) The Attorney-General's Department has advised that a mining lease could be declared invalid in the event of invalidity of the legislation relied upon to grant the lease, non-compliance with in that legislation in granting that lease, or conduct which the law specifies is ,conduct which, if engaged upon or omitted, will lead to invalidity of the lease. There are no ""circumstances"" which test the validity of a mining lease. (4)(b) See answer to 4(a). (5) 20 acres. (6) FrenchJ held that MLN19 expired on 31 December 1988 and had not been validly renewed as renewal required the consent of the Minister administering the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and this was not sought or given. (7) See answer to (6). (8) With reference to the proclamation of 1989 the answer is no. With reference to the proclamation of 1991 the answer is yes. (8)(a) The proclamation of 13 November 1989 amended an earlier proclamation of 5 April 1979. The effect was to take land from the Conservation Zone and incorporate it into Kakadu National Park. the The land included land which had been the subject of Mining Leases Nos. 86 to 89 which are not in the Coronation Hill area. The proclamation of 21 June 1991 increased the area of Kakadu National Park by including in the Park land which had been the subject of Mining Leases Nos 19, 23 to 28 and 751 to 752. Only Mining Leases 19, 751 and 752 are in the Coronation Hill area. (8)(b) The proclamations were made under section 7(8) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. (8)(c) No. The question of validity of proclamations has been reserved for decision by the High Court. (9) Mining Lease No 19, when originally granted, was expressed to permit the mining of silver and lead, and later copper. Mining Leases Nos 751 and 752, when originally granted, were expressed to permit mining for gold, copper, uranium and any by-products. (10) The proclamation of 1989 had no effect. The proclamation of 1991 included land which had been the subject of Mining Leases Nos 19, 751 and 752 in Kakadu National Park whereupon the prohibition on mining in section 10 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation AQ 1975 applied. (11) Yes. (12) Whenever valid Commonwealth action constitutes an acquisition of property within the terms of s.51 (31) of the Constitution.

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The scope of the question is not clear. In this answer 'conference' has been defined as a meeting on a major strategic issue conducted by the Department at a venue not on its premises with more than 15 attendees. This approach has excluded meetings related to the progressing of ongoing departmental business, training activities and internal planning and committee meetings, seminars and workshops. (l) The Department has held fourteen conferences. (2) The Department of Employment, Education and Training does not maintain consolidated records of all conferences. The following list of conferences held since November 1992 is based on the records held by individual Divisions and State and Territory administrations. It shows the date, location, aggregate costs, number of persons attending and their classifications and the number of - xternal speakers and their cost The aggregate costs include the cost of the venue hire and any travel and other allowances paid to staff attending. The number of persons attending· comprises external speakers, non-departmental participants and departmental officers listed by classification.

Breast Milk Substitutes (Question No. 718) Mrs GALLUS asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 13 December 1993: What action is the Minister's Department taking to ensure the (a) implementation of World Health Assembly Resolution No. 39.28 of 1986 in Australia, (b) compliance in Australia with the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes referred to in the resolution, (c) implementation of World Health Assembly Resolution No. 45.34 of 1992 in Australia, (d) responsible marketing and distribution of infant formula by manufacturers and distributors in underdeveloped countries who also trade in Australia and (e) use of breast milk substitutes is (i) occurring only in the absence of the availability of breast milk and in the best interests of the' health and welfare of infants in underdeveloped countries and (ii) being promoted with that purpose as the primary goal.",108
212,Mr HOWE,I GAA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The World Health Assembly resolution 39.28 urged Member States to ensure that the small amounts of breast milk substitutes needed in maternity wards and hospitals be purchased through normal channels and not through donations or subsidised sales from infant formula manufacturers and importers. A number of actions have been taken to reach the goal of June 1994 set by WHO for the implementation of this resolution: A meeting of relevant sectors-Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, nongovernment organisations and the infant formula industry was convened on 23 November 1993. This forum provided members of the different sectors with an opportunity to identify relevant issues related to the cessation of free and subsidised supplies in, Australia. Arising from this qleeting, the State and Territory representatives have agreed to ascertain External Allendees speakers Cost No Classification No ,Cost $10,687 44 1 SES 5 0 To provIde information to develop eco- 8 SOGC nomic and employment strategies for 7 AS06 Office of Labour Market Adjustment 23 Non-<lepl. (OLMA) Regions. not all claims for reimbursement of travel have been the impact of the World Health Assembly recommendation to cease free and subsidised supplies of infant formula, and to provide this information to the Commonwealth early in the new year. In addition, the ramifications of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act which prohibit agreements between suppliers or acquirers that fix, control or maintain prices, on ceasing subsidised supplies is also being studied. This is a complex issue. Until information is received from the States and Territories we cannot determine the best mechanism through which to implement the World Health Assembly resolution. (b) The Commonwealth Government has taken a number of actions to give effect to the aims and principles of the WHO Code since adopting it in 1981. The Code addresses the responsibilities of four different sectors-infant formula manufacturers and importers, bottle and teat manufacturers and importers, retailers and health workers. The responsibilities of the first two sectors are being addressed through the development of sector-specific self-regulatory agreements. The agreement for formula manufacturers came into effect in September 1992 and that for bottle and leat manufacturers is currenpy being developed. The Infant Nutrition Panel of the National Health and Medical Research Council is currently developing guidelines for health workers based on the Code. (c) Progress is being made towards meeting recommendations of the 45th World Health Assembly in the following areas: The Infant Nutrition Panel of the National Health and Medical Research Council was established in 1992 as an alternative to the recommended multisectoral breastfeeding committee. The Panel includes representatives of the food industry and consumer groups in addition to experts in infant nutrition and women's health. The Commonwealth Government responded very quickly to the information from WHO/UNICEF about the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. Information on the initiative was sent to all State and Territory health ministers bringing it to their attention and urging them to obtain the support and participation of the health care sector in their jurisdiction for its implementation. The initiative was also brought to the attention of the Australian Hospitals Association. The common breastfeeding indicators developed by WHO were used as a basis in drafting the questions on breast feeding in the upcoming National Health Survey being conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The final form of the questions has not yet been determined. Australia has commonly drawn upon the experiences of other Member States in implementing the WHO Code. Similarly, Australia has been willing to share its experiences in giving effect to the Code, as evidenced by our participation in 1991 in a review of ways in which the Code has been implemented. (d) The Commonwealth Government has no jurisdiction over the ways in which manufacturers and distributors of infant formula market their products in countries other than Australia. However, relevant articles of the WHO Code have been incorporated into the Dairy Orders of the Export Control Act, thereby regulating the quality, composition and labelling of infant formulae exported from Australia. (e) This is addressed in the above responses.
