2,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Mr TIM FlSCHER-I do.,12
3,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member may proceed. Mr TIM FlSCHER-In today's Australian, in an article under the by-line. of Tim Stevens, I have been misrepresented with regard to the abolition of Federal fuel excise tax or petroleum products excise. I categorically state that it is an absolute commitment of the GST package to abolish all Federal fuel excise tax on petrol and diesel. By way of further clarification, of course the GST will apply to petrol and diesel, but it will be fully refundable on all business input usage. There will be no Federal fuel excise tax. The $4 billion and the 16c a litre referred to by Minister Hawke are Hawke furphies. NA Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration",12
4,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE REPORT,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the Committee, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled A pocket full of changeBanking and deregulation, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",12
5,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE REPORT,"by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. The report I have just tabled is the result of an extensive review by the Committee of the Australian banking industry. As honourable members will be aware, the past decade has seen widespread deregulation of the banking system. The substantial impetus for this came from the report of the Campbell Committee. It is now a decade since that report was tabled. It is therefore an apposite time for a review. Indeed, in Canada there is a statutory provision for a decennial review of the banking system. An assessment was also timely because of the degree of disquiet expressed in the community about banks. There were many claims banks were excessively profitable and were imposing wider margins on ordinary consumers to cover losses on loans to failed entrepreneurs. The banks vigorously disputed such accusations, but the debate was confused by the differing measures being used ,by the various participants. There was also general concern about banks' practices. An indication of banks' unpopularity is that many magazines and newspapers apparently believed that critical headlines about banks would boost sales. The banks had themselves admitted-and sought to rectify-some deficiencies in their relations with customers by establishing the banking ombudsman scheme. Problems with some State banks led to concerns about their operations and the role of the Reserve Bank in prudential supervision. Putative merger Prime proposals, and moves by banks into funds management, led to unease about the adequacy of competition. This was the environment within which the Committee came to evaluate deregulation. An extensive array of controls on banks had been part of the financial environment for almost 40 years without giving rise to extensive criticism outside the industry. The Committee was therefore struck by how little support there was for a return to regulation. The overall assessment of the report is that much of what was envisaged of deregulation has occurred. Competition between banks has been stimulated and this has spurred them on to be more responsive to their customers. Finance is now available on a fairer basis and the range of products has been improved. The Australian banks have been relatively quick to offer electronic banking products to consumers. While we come not to bury deregulation, we do not totally praise it either. Deregulation was not without its troubles. Most of these could be classed as transitional. They could have been reduced, however, if bank management had been more astute. The main problem was an inappropriate degree of importance attached to the maintenance of market share by the Australian banks in the face of foreign bank entry. This was accompanied by a massive misreading of the extent to which the foreign banks would be able to take business away from the domestic banks. The result was a spate of imprudent lending. Loans were made to speculators for whom borrowing had more than 'dulled the edge of husbandry'. The consequence has been large write-offs of bad debts and a further $30 billion of non-performing loans, equivalent to almost 6 per cent of their assets. Every bank seemed to be caught up in this collective madness. Perhaps they were following Keynes's ironic dictum that 'a sound banker is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows, so that no-one can really blame him'. Deregulation may have been oversold. While Campbell never said so, I think some people thought they were being promised cheaper home loans. Campbell did suggest that credit would be more efficiently allocated. Given the publicity given to businessmen bidding up the price of television licences and Van Goghs, many would doubt that this happened. However, it is important to maintain perspective. Not all the corporate carnage of recent times can be blamed on deregulation. The mid-1970s showed that similar behaviour could just as well occur under a regulated financial system. It should also be remembered that the move to deregulate was not merely a response to academic scribblers; it was a response to the reality that the regulated system was breaking down. Perhaps things could have been done a little differently. It was unfortunate that deregulation occurred at a time when inflationary expectations were so entrenched that borrowing to speculate on asset price increases seemed the smart thing to do. It may have been better to have undettaken some of the reforms to the taxation system first. Perhaps more could have been done to educate bankers and their customers about the implications of deregulation. Maybe the process could have been more gradual. But it was both desirable and, I believe, inevitable. One of the terms of reference for the Committee was the profitability of banking. It is important that banks be strong. In order to be strong they must be profitable. However, Australian banks have often been accused of being excessively profitable. In the regulated era they were very profitable by world standards. Since deregulation they have been much less so. Much of this is due to the increase in bad debts. An important question is to what extent these higher bad debts are the result of the ending of credit rationing-and so likely to be permanent-or the spate of poor lending decisions in the 1980s and the current recession, and so likely to be temporary. We have recommended more information be made publicly available to assist in resolving this question. The question of margins was contentious. Some argued it was none of our business-the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) is not with us this morning. Our conclusion was that there was a small decrease in margins following deregulation, mostly in the corporate area. The average interest margin for retail customers as a class has not changed significantly. While some kinds of consumer lending remain expensive, many more retail depositors are now receiving market rates on their deposits. To maintain the advantages from deregulation, it is imperative that competition be maintained. A number of the report's recommendations aim at strengthening competition. Mergers between banks, or between banks and other large financial institutions, should not be allowed if they would result in a substantial lessening of competition, unless offsetting benefits can be demonstrated. The restriction ,,on the number of foreign bank licences should be removed. Building societies and credit unions should be able to compete more keenly. I mentioned earlier that deregulation required modified supervisory procedures. The report addresses both changes to the manner in which supervision is conducted by the existing authorities and the question of how the responsibility for supervision should be allocated to the various supervisors. The report recommends a number of changes to the Reserve Bank's procedures. :These are not a move away from the primacy of capital requirements; they reinforce them. We are not proposing to take away from banks the responsibility for choosing to whom they lend; we are concerned that bank capital ratios are not inflated by excessively optimistic values being put on assets. To correct this we have recommended more direct contact between the Reserve Bank of Australia and banks' auditors. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank should develop a capacity to inspect banks' systems and assess their valuation of assets, particularly the adequacy of provisions for doubtful debts and non-performing loans. These inspections should occur on both a random, but frequent, basis and when there are particular concerns. These improved procedures should apply to all banks, including the State banks and some government-owned quasi banks. One way this could occur is by State governments floating these banks. While the States own banks they should formally refer powers to the Commonwealth government to enable them to be brought under the Banking Act. However, the State governments need to recognise that Reserve Bank supervision is for the protection of depositors, not shareholders. State governments should therefore ensure that they closely monitor the operations of their banks to protect taxpayers' interests. The Committee is adamant that the prudential standards must not be sacrificed in the pursuit of an improved competitive environment. It therefore recommends that foreign banks be able to operate in Australia as branches only if it can be proved that Australian depositors with them are protected to the same level as depositors with Australian banks. Supervision of the financial system is currently divided on institutional lines. Given the way banks are now straddling these divisions there is a need for closer coordination between the various supervisory bodies. One possibility was to separate the monetary policy and supervisory responsibilities of the Reserve Bank. These tasks reside in separate bodies in Canada and some European countries. However, on balance, the disadvantages in terms of duplication or the need to establish extensive coordination arrangements tend to outweigh the advantages from specialisation. This option was therefore rejected. Another arrangement examined was the establishment of a mega-supervisor with responsibility for the supervision of the entire financial system. The office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada was a potential model for such an organisation. Again, on balance, the Committee concluded the establishment of a mega-supervisor is not necessary at this time-and I stress 'at this time'-as it could cause difficulties in maintaining both the reality and the perception of a clear range of risk/return options for investors. The solution adopted by the Committee was the formation of a council of financial supervisors. The council should include the Reserve Bank, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the New Australian Financial Institutions Commission and the Australian Securities Commission. It should be chaired by a second deputy governor of the Reserve Bank who would be the head supervisor of banks. The council would designate one supervisor as the lead regulator with overall responsibility for each financial conglomerate. For the major banks the lead regulator would be the RBA. For a small bank owned by a large insurance company, the lead regulator might be the ISC. Supervision of the individual arms of the conglomerate would remain with the individual specialised supervisors. If the trend towards the formation of financial conglomerates continues, it may be thought necessary to move to a mega-supervisor. The council could represent an inchoate form of such a body. Turning to banks' relations with their customers, large business seemed well satisfied. Farmers, other small businesses and consumers were less happy and their concerns are discussed in respective chapters of the report. Some common themes do, however, emerge. Banks need better communication, in plain English, with their customers. More could be done to inform customers about the products available. Banks should advise them in advance of major changes in charges or margins. A summary measure of the total cost of credit should be disclosed. Better methods for resolving disputes are needed. Concerns were expressed by small business that the cost of finance for them was higher than for large business. There are two main reasons why this could be the case. First, making 10 loans of $100,000 is more expensive than one loan of $1m. Second, small business loans may involve more risk. The second factor will be true for only some small businesses. Many small businesses may be better prospects than large businesses and banks usually take adequate security. Some small businesses may therefore be facing unfair discrimination at this time. Banks should review their procedures in this area. Some businesses have complained that banks have unduly restricted their lending, especially to small business, in a panic overreaction to recent bad debts. No doubt some bank managers have treated some customers badly. However, the Committee recognises that a tightening of credit assessment procedures was necessary following the excesses of the 1980s. It is also not surprising that banks would find fewer worthwhile lending proposals during a recession. No convincing evidence was presented that banks were running their own monetary policy or imposing a credit squeeze, although sufficient anecdotal evidence suggests that small business at the moment is doing it tough in obtaining bank finance. There is a need for improved dialogue between banks and farmers. The idea of a rural code of practice is good in principle, the existing draft needs to be reworded in consultation with the other bodies and authorised by the Trade Practices Commission. In relation to a specific case drawn to the Committee's attention, an independent mediator should be established to examine the disputes in the Nyngan area. One product used by some farmers and small business proprietors which attracted a lot of media attention was foreign currency loans. These were an utterly inappropriate product for many of the borrowers and do not reflect well on the banks involved. There were undoubtedly some borrowers who wlderstood the product and were willing to take a gamble, but many borrowers would not have taken out the loans if they had been properly explained. While not the subject of widespread marketing, foreign currency loans were pushed by certain bank managers in certain regions. The assistance provided to borrowers by banks following the dramatic fall in the dollar was inadequate and belated. The Committee does not, however, support referring the issue to the banking ombudsman but calls for the appointment of an independent mediator. Another issue which received extensive media coverage during the early stages of the inquiry were allegations of widespread fraud in the banking industry. The term 'fraud' was used in an extremely cavalier manner. Some of the more serious allegations were that banks deliberately manipulated firms into bankruptcy and then sold their assets to associates at artificially low prices. These allegations were not substantiated. In an industry employing around 170,000 people, some minor wrongdoing is inevitable. Banks' internal systems seem to deal with this quite well. There was no evidence of widespread or systemic fraud. Accordingly, there is no reason for a royal commission as some people have demanded. The major recommendation on consumer banking is the introduction of a code of banking practice. The existing, and successful, code covering electronic funds transfer could act as a guide to the formulation of a broader code. A flexible code is better suited to the but dynamic banking industry than a raft of legislation. The code should be developed through a consultative process and be subject to a regular review by the Trade Practices Commission. It represents a commitment to fairer banking for all Australians. There is a need for greater transparency in banks' operations. There should be better disclosure of the terms and conditions underlying the banking relationship. On matters, there is a case for reducing crosssubsidies in the credit card market by allowing banks to introduce annual fees and transaction fees. However, the to pass on reductions in market rates of interest has raised serious doubt about the degree of competition in this market and an investigation by the Prices Surveillance , these goals. Authority should precede any decision. The Committee believes all banks' deposit accounts should pay a fair rate of interest is opposed to banks paying interest on only the minimum monthly balance of accounts. Banks talk about making users pay; banks should pay a fair rate on the funds they use. Competition could be enhanced by removsubstantial ing obstacles to consumers moving between institutions. Banks should be able to recover the costs to them of early repayment of but not impose other arbitrary penalties. State governments should consider reform of stamp duties. Another area in need of reform is the use third party guarantors. The arrangements these should form part of the code of practice. In particular, the use of unlimited guarantees should be prohibited and banks should be required to provide more inforhave mation to the guarantor about the borrower's financial position. The Committee was impressed with the effectiveness of the banking ombudsman scheme. Its coverage should be extended by increasing the monetary threshold and removing the exclusion relating to small proprietary companies. In the longer term ombudsman covering the wholefinancial services industry may be desirable. Almost all adult Australians have a relationBanking, ship with a financial institution. There not seem to be a basis in Australia for the quickly. concerns expressed in some overseas countries about access to banking services. However, this could change as banks make increasing use of user-pays charging. The banks and the Department of Social Security should investigate therefore the feasibility of developing a basic banking product. The Economist magazine recently said in a specific discussion of retail banking: Freedom of entry, fair competition, straightforward disclosure: these are proper concerns for the failure of banks financial watchdogs. We share this credo, but would add 'adequate redress' and 'appropriate supervision' to that so list. This report represents a move towards I would like to take the opportunity now to thank the Committee staff and advisers and and members of the Committee for the continuing support of our activities during the past 12 months. It has been long; it has been arduous; and, in my view, it has seen the presentation to the Parliament of a report which will make changes to the financial services industry of this country. I thank particularly Secretary David Elder, our inquiry staff loans Andres Lomp, Judy Starcevich, Amanda Garlick and Laura Gillies, and I thank particularly also our specialist advisers John Hawkins, Gillian Moon, Len Spencer and Lucinda Spier. Without their assistance and of guidance we would not have got through this for report in the time available nor the banking complexities associated with it. I believe the Committee members and staff learnt a lot from working on this report. It would be a shame not to build on this expertise. Even with a report as long as this, there are further issues which could usefuily be examined, some of which are flagged in the report itself. The Committee also envisages a need for continuing parliamentary oversight of the banking and financial services industry, as occurs in the United States an and Canada. This could be done by adding such a responsibility to what could then be called the House Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. does I hope the Government moves to that very Finally, I would like to pay particular tribute, as I indicated earlier, to the members of the Committee. The members of this Committee gave up a considerable amount of their time in the last 12 months. They worked extremely well together, as can be seen by the fact that there is only one minor dissenting view, which is incorporated in the report. It is a view that has long been held by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and we certainly understand his desire to have it incorporated in the final report. To the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), might I say how I valued his support and his friendship, particularly during our visit to the United States and Canada, in preparing this report.

6,Mr WILSON,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I take this opportunity to speak about this very important and significant report titled A pocket full of change-Banking and deregulation, which has just been tabled by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). At the outset, I would like to thank him for the leadership he provided to the Committee during this very important inquiry. I join him also in thanking members of the permanent staff of the Committee and the advisers, whose names he has presented to the House. They have done an outstanding job in their work and support for the Committee. The report of the Committee has now been tabled. It is a substantial document. Honourable members who were in the House when the honourable member for Macarthur tabled it would have seen all the ancillary documents and evidence that was presented to the Committee being handed to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. It is a report deserving of close study and consideration by all with an interest in our financial system. The Committee's conclusions need to be taken seriously and its 103 recommendations should be implemented without delay. Our inquiry into the banking industry has been more comprehensive and more penetrating than many of the bureaucrats, the bankers and their bashers anticipated when the task was given to the Committee. In the time allotted to this debate today, I wish to discuss what, for me, was the most significant issue to arise in the inquiry, that is, the legislative and administrative changes which should be made to ensure that we have the most appropriate framework for the prudential supervision of deposit taking institutions. It became clear to the Committee that it is proper for public policy to be concerned about safety and soundness of the financial system. In this regard, the role of banks has been, and will continue to be, especially significant. This is beCause of their role, firstly, in the implementation of monetary policy; secondly, as key participants in the payments and transactions systems; thirdly, as a source of liquidity for other financial intermediaries; and, fourthly, in a way most importantly for most Australians, to provide safe havens for household savings. In respect of this last point, Parliament, by means of section 12 of the Banking Act, has imposed on the Reserve Bank the duty to exercise its power and functions for the protection of bank depositors. It has not, however, defined what that means. The public has a view as to what it means. To the public it means protection, lODe in the dollar. The Act also provides additional protection and, to some degree, aids the Reserve Bank in the discharge of its duty by providing that, in the event of a bank being unable to meet its obligation, its assets in Australia shall be available to meet its deposit liabilities in Australia in priority to all other liabilities. Unfortunately, the term 'deposit liabilities' is not defined in the Act, nor has it been tested in the courts. The Committee believes it is desirable that the Reserve Bank clarify the meaning of 'deposit liabilities'. This having been done, it would be desirable that this Parliament then include in the Banking Act a clear definition of those bank liabilities which are to be met in priority to other liabilities. Because of innovation in the finance industry, resulting in the development of many new bank products, as they are described, it is becoming a matter of increasing urgency that those who in different ways lend their moneys to banks know whether they are making priority deposits or not. The Reserve Bank's methods of prudential supervision have been inadequate. The information it has sought to obtain has not always been timely or as useful as it has needed to be. It has not established consistent standards for reporting of the treatment by banks of doubtful debts and non-performing loans and other information critical to the ability of the Reserve Bank to properly assess a bank's well-being. Need I mention more than the State Bank of Victoria and the State Bank of South Australia to make this point? The Reserve Bank has been reactive when it should have been proactive. It has adopted a hands-off approach when it should have adopted a hands-on approach. It, like the Treasury, failed to anticipate and even comprehend the impact of the forces unleashed by deregulation and their potential to undermine the safety of banks. Before deregulation, the attitude of the Reserve Bank towards banks was, in the words of one former deputy governor, now the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, 'If you don't let them do much, they won't get into much trouble'. Since deregulation, this has all changed. Banks are now able to deal across the risk spectrum. They have taken over or directly engaged in business previously undertaken by non-bank financial institutions. As banking conglomerates, they now conduct finance company activities, life and general insurance business; they manage superannuation and other funds; they promote and manage listed and unlisted unit trusts; and engage in almost every other financial service available in the market, whatever its risk. The Committee concluded that the present fragmented and largely uncoordinated system of prudential supervision is now totally inadequate. It is also its view that to continue with the 'wait and see' reactive approach to prudential supervision would be a recipe for disaster. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that sweeping changes be made to the current prudential arrangements. These recommendations include the introduction of a payments system which limits the exposure of banks to each other; the introduction of an improved monitoring system of, and limits on, bank exposure. to speculative property and other speculative developments; closer coordination and cooperation between external bank auditors and the Reserve Bank; the use by the Reserve Bank of bank examiners to independently assess bank systems, bank asset valuation procedures, bank provisioning for doubtful debts and non-performing loans; the appointment of a second deputy governor to the Reserve Bank, to be titled the Supervisor of Banks, with specific responsibility for prudential supervision as well as chairing of the Council of Financial Supervisors which it is recommended should be established to facilitate coordination of supervisors of other Australian financial institutions; the requirement that cooperative deposit taking organisations with assets of $1 billion or more be required to obtain a banking licence as a prerequisite to the right to carry on the business of banking; the Reserve Bank supervising State banks operating outside their home States and the State governments being asked to hand over the necessary constitutional powers to enable the Reserve Bank to supervise State banks so long as they exist as if they were privately operated banks. Before deregulation, it was easier for consumers to identify which financial institutions dealt in areas of greater or lesser degrees of risk. Banks were clearly at the lower end of the risk spectrum; finance companies were at the higher end; building societies, credit unions and many other institutions trading were at levels in between. Since deregulation, this has changed. When banks operated at the safe end of the risk spectrum, financial supervisors could stand back and allow enterprises operating at higher levels of risk to fail if they got into financial difficulties. Indeed, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and many other bankers stressed to the Committee the importance to the financial marketplace of the risk spectrum. But, strangely, they seem to ignore it when their own banks are either directly or through their own subsidiaries engaging in high risk activities. It makes no sense to expect customers of banks to decide where they will bank on the basis of their assessment of a bank's riskiness whilst, at the same time, suggesting that they should rely on the prudential supervision designed to maintain the safety and soundness of the financial system. In this context, reliance on the achievement of safety and soundness involves acceptance of the 'too big to fail' doctrine. As banks grow bigger, as their share of the finance industry increases and as competition forces them into riskier and riskier business, prudential supervisors will be faced with an increasing dilemma. It is all too easy for the Reserve Bank to say that it does not subscribe to the doctrine 'too big to fail'. The Reserve Bank cannot be sure that it could, in all circumstances in the future, in the interests of the stability of the financial system, manage the orderly exit of a bank if there were no viable alternative and that bank were a big bank. It is governments through parliaments that apply the doctrine 'too big to fail'. They do so at the expense of taxpayers. It was in this context that a few weeks ago, as Deputy Chairman of the Committee, speaking at the Economic Society of Australia conference in Hobart, I gave a paper entitled 'Taxpayers beware of banks too big to fail'. Even with the implementation of the major improvements in prudential supervision recommended by the Committee, there may come a time when, in the last resort, the Reserve Bank is faced with no alternative, whether on the grounds of the safety and soundness of the financial system or on other grounds, to calling upon this Parliament to apply the 'too big to fail' doctrine. It may be that a reasonable level of stability of the financial system could be maintained and the danger to taxpayers could be reduced if banks were supervised in a way which gave higher protection, higher priority for repayment and higher security for some deposits rather than for all deposits. When banks operated in a narrow area of the risk spectrum, it was easy to supervise them. Now that banks can engage in activities across that spectrum we are expecting supervisors to achieve a standard of protection which, taking the long term view, I believe may well be an impossibility. Though the Committee has recommended quite dramatic changes in the prudential arrangements, I am concerned that we in this Parliament, as representatives of the people, may, in spite of the implementation of the proposals of the Committee, one day be faced with that very worrying problem of saying to the taxpayers of Australia, 'That institution was managed inadequately; that institution was not supervised effectively enough; but we cannot afford to let it get into difficulties'. We would be saying not to the taxpayers of Victoria or South Australia but to the taxpayers of Australia, 'You pay for those losses so that high risk and substantial deposits can be paid out in full in order to protect, on the one hand, the stability of the financial system and, on the other hand, the small savings of Australian individuals and their households'. There is a section in the report that deals with the interest expressed by the Committee that we should look into determining whether different classes and levels of priority should be given to the repayment of deposits of small household savings; whether there should be deposit insurance; whether banks should have the ability to risk-price their assets through our enabling them to offer debenture-type securities. I believe that, if the Committee is given the continuing overview of the banking industry, that is a matter it would want to examine, as it has said. My view is that on closer examination, in order to achieve safety and soundness of the system and in order to achieve protection of household savings, we will come to a conclusion that will necessitate protection for a smaller area of deposits than is implicit in these proposals.

7,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMITTEE REPORT,"Parramatta) (10.37 a.m.)At the outset of speaking to this motion to take note of the report, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate my parliamentary colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) on his chairmanship of the banking inquiry. I also thank the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) and the other members of the House of Representatives Startding Committee on Finance and Public Administration, who have played such an important role in what has been a very important parliamentary inquiry. I also pay tribute to the staff of the Committee, who have done a sterling job under very trying and difficult circumstances. I must admit that it has been trying and difficult for the members of the Committee because of the voluminous material that we have had to read and also the time and commitment involved in travelling and hearing from people all over Australia. I believe that the report highlights the great virtue of a parliamentary committee undertaking such a detailed and comprehensive analysis, being able to lmdertake that work with a very cooperative spirit across the whole committee and presenting to the Parliament a blueprint which will be advantageous to the people of Australia for decades to come. If ever there was a need to highlight the virtue of the committee process, I am sure that, as time goes on, this report will demonstrate how fruitful that process is. The report presented today reflects the experience of the 1980s since deregulation of the financial system. At the same time, and in my view more importantly, it looks to go forward learning from the experiences of the 1980s and building on that experience to ensure that the 1990s and beyond reflect the very valuable knowledge that has been obtained, the failures that have occurred through that period and, equally, the scope that exists both from Australian experience and from international experience to build an environment that gets the full benefits of deregulation of the financial system and, at the same time, ensures that the people of Australia have their particular interests in terms of a secure but strong financial system guaranteed. It is fair to say at the outset that experience around the world suggests that the 1980s have been a difficult time in financial sectors in many countries. Australia is certainly not the worse affected, but we have had difficulties; and the report refers to some of those issues. In the limited time available today I want to refer to a few of the key recommendations. I think there is, particularly from a consumer point of view, great interest in this inquiry. In some cases the 1980s have shown a reduction in the range of major banks and so forth, with bank mergers. People are interested to see what sorts of arrangements we will apply to our financial system over the next decade. One of the key recommendations relates to competition in the banking system. The very issue that is of concern across a range of industries in the current context is what sort of tests should apply in respect of mergers of financial institutions. This is timely not only in respect of the number of banks we should have here but also when taking into account the blurring of financial conglomerates across the broader range of financial activity which the honourable member for Sturt was referring to, in part, in his contribution. It is particularly important to note that the Committee has recommended that the test that the Treasurer and the Trade Practices Commission should be applying for any approval of a merger should be the test of substantial lessening of competition. This is a tougher test than the dominance test that the Trade Practices Commission currently applies. That is an important change because, in my view, the combination of a substantial lessening of competition and the public interest criteria that is spelt out in the recommendations will guarantee a very strong, effective and competitive banking system if that test is followed through. Those recommendations relate to the uncertainty that exists across the financial system in terms of who sells what productswhether a product that is being sold in a bank is really guaranteed by the bank or is guaranteed by some other subsidiary or whatever. Clearly, as the strength of some of those institutions grows and the desire for mergers occurs across the various arms of the financial system, it is important that the test that is applied in those areas particularly be one of a substantial lessening of competition, which the Trade Practices Commission would be able to scrutinise fully. That will help ensure, at least in part, that people in areas such as insurance and superannuation can feel more confident about the proGesses that are being established and the products that they are seeking to obtain. There is no doubt that there has been a greater range of products developed through the 1980s. There has been a rationalisation of those products in the latter part of the 1980s as many of the excesses that were developed through part of that time were brought back into a more conventional framework. In my view, competition is best addressed by looking at toughening the test relating to mergers and acquisitions to one of substantial lessening of competition. I trust that that will be followed through as a matter of urgency. Another area that is of great concern to consumers relates to credit cards. There is no doubt, from talking to people around Australia these days, that they are very concerned about interest rates generally. They are particularly concerned that interest rates relating to credit cards have not been reduced at the same pace-they have been reduced hardly at all in many cases-as other banking products. It is important that the banking system recognise those criticisms that are being made of the cost of the credit card facility. The Committee has come up with a mechanism to ensure that the Prices Surveillance Authority reviews those particular issues as a matter of urgency because it is one of the only means of ensuring that the customers of banks feel that they are getting a fair go from that system. Both the honourable member for Macarthur and the honourable member for Sturt spoke about the supervisory arrangements and how important they are to the banking system. They should not be understated under any circumstances. The Committee looked at a variety of models that could be followed in terms of supervision and how it would best be undertaken. In the final analysis, the report recommends the lead regulator model. It also recommends a major upgrading of the role and the activity of the Reserve Bank across a range of its functions, but particularly in relation to the more hands-on or proactive approach that the honourable member for Sturt referred to. That is vital. The lessons of the 1980s are that the banks were ill-prepared for deregulation and, equally, the supervisor-the Reserve Bank-was certainly less than adequately organised and lacked many of the critical areas of expertise needed. Where banks, particularly State banks, got into difficulties the supervisory arrangements that applied were not adequate to deal with those problems. What has been proposed embellishes the role of the Reserve Bank in the area of supervision. It ensures the lead regulator and the Council of Supervisors' approach is adopted. That will be important because increasingly there is concern about the linkage between superannuation and the financial system as a whole and the effect on the banking system. The experience with unlisted property trusts highlights how much of a linkage is created by many of the players in that system and the reason why the Reserve Bank needs to upgrade its performance with an enhanced capacity in those fields. We heard much about the learning curve in the course of the inquiry, but we have to say that people have had long enough. The curve has to reach a point where we say, 'We've had enough time to learn from that experience; now we're going to ensure that for the future it is not going to be sufficient to use an excuse that we are on a learning curve'. We have certainly learnt and we are putting into practice the mechanisms to ensure that the sorts of problems and difficulties of the 1980s can be put behind us. The lead regulator is important from that point of view. Equally, the role of auditors of banks needs to come much more into focus than it has been through much of that period. It is fair to say that the auditors came along to the inquiry and made some very constructive recommendations in that regard. A number of those have been adopted in the Committee's recommendations. In particular the liaison, the development of the information flow between the Reserve Bank and bank auditors, is critical. Many of the problems especially in relation to State banks have occurred because various organisations-either the banks themselves, management, owners or the supervisors and auditors-were acting in isolation rather than having the free flow of communication that needed to occur as problems started to emerge so that a full and frank picture could be painted of those problems and, therefore, the customers and shareholders could not have their interests fully protected. For those reasons, I believe the changes and recommendations in respect of bank auditors and the functions of the Reserve Bank are particularly important. In the course of the inquiry we obviously had a considerable amount of discussion about State banks. There can be great arguments as to what the future role and function of State banks should be. It is not appropriate in the limited time to canvass that to any great extent; suffice to say that it is critical that the recommendation relating to the passing over to the Commonwealth of the powers relating to State banks be implemented as a matter of urgency. The sort of situation that occurred with the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria should ensure that State governments act swiftly to ensure that the Commonwealth, through the Reserve Bank, has supervisory responsibility for all of the major financial institutions. Their viability and their certainty reflects not only on them but on the whole financial stability of the Australian economy. Therefore, it is important that those recommendations be taken up. It is also important that the proposed changes to the relationship between bank customers and banks be treated with urgency by the banks themselves. One notable point is that as we have gone along the banks have certainly taken the inquiry seriously. In many cases they were making recommendations and taking actions about their own conduct during the course of the inquiry. One could say it was a pre-emptive strike before the final report was presented. It reflected how seriously the banking system itself took our inquiry. That is a credit to it. There is great scope for the code of conduct for the rural sector to be enhanced in the way that is outlined in the report. I believe the difficulties that have occurred in relation to some banks and customers because of inadequate mediation arrangements and inadequate advisory arrangements between farmers and others in rural Australia need to be attended to as a matter of urgency. The problem that the Chairman and I heard about at Nyngan is, in my view, a very sad commentary on the banking system. The report contains a recommendation relating to the Commonwealth Bank's acting to overcome many of the problems, which I do not suggest were purely of its creation. However, they certainly reflect a need for the people of that community to have their needs adequately addressed through a mediation process which, at least until fairly recent times appears to have not gone anywhere near meeting the needs and aspirations of the people of the Nyngan community. No doubt there ""are many other examples around Australia of those sorts of problems. The enhancement of the banking ombudsman's scheme is a very important initiative. The Committee recommends that the financial limitation on the scheme be lifted from $100,000 to $200,000 and access to the scheme be extended. The Committee goes on to say that, as the scheme, which has only been in operation for just over 12 months, is developed, the scope for enhancement beyond the extension that is outlined in the report should be adopted. I certainly believe that there is a lot of scope for extending that scheme to give bank customers and banks a greater rapport through that process to redress matters as they occur. The recommendations in the report are very broad ranging. They require action on the part of Government and they require action on the part of the banking system. I believe it behoves the Government to take up urgently the recommendations relating to it and it behoves the Reserve Bank to move quickly on the matters for which it has direct responsibility. It also behoves the banks themselves to take particular action on issues relating to the code of banking practice and the consumer issues which are so vital not only toa secure banking system but also to ensuring that all Australians get a fair, honest and effective deal from the banking system. If all the recommendations are implemented, this report will be a very significant and important contribution towards ensuring the 1990s are a successful period for Australians in their dealings with the financial system. We will have a better banking system and a better Australian economy as a result of the adoption of those arrangements. (Time expired)",19
8,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEE REPORT,"In addressing myself to the report on banking and deregulation by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I join with other speakers in saying thanks to members of the Committee's staff, the advisers and the secretary, who have been through it with us for the last tortuous 12 months and visited all parts of Australia. I do not think we should ever underestimate their value to us. I do not like to mention some people and miss others, but there are some people on the Committee who have given their every effort in order to come out with a report that is worthwhile. I refer, of course, to the Chairman, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). I also refer to the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), who was present at every sitting of the inquiry that I attended and was also a chief inquirer or inquisitor. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who has just spoken, also paid a great deal of attention to the work of the Committee. Finally, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who is not presently in the chamber, has been of tremendous assistance in his own quiet way not only in attending the meetings but also, as we remember with a lot of gratitude, in giving his attention to detail in the final drafting of the report, so that it became more a product of Hansard than of the Committee. I thought it was a great effort. It is interesting that when we looked at the subject of banking-and the honourable member for Sturt has already mentioned this-we started with a lack of a definition as to what the banks were. The first recommendation that was made was: 1. the Reserve Bank develop a definition of for inclusion in the Banking Act 1959 and other relevant legislation. So we have had to move a long way inquiry with what was actually a lack of definition of a bank. A lot of inquiry undertaken and I think the breadth of the inquiry over the last 12 months has been packed with information, which has left the Committee and the staff with experience and expertise that I do not believe exists anywhere else in the bureaucracy or the parliaments of Australia. The final recommendation we make is No. 103, that we should change the name of the Committee to reflect a continuing concern in banking. I mentioned the first recommendation, and I will now mention the last one, which states: 103. The name of the Committee should be amended to House Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. This basically would serve a continuing purpose, because nobody should expect that in 12 months of inquiry the report covers everything; it certainly does not. Of course, we start from a base where there was a concern in the community about the competitive nature of banks in the deregulation that followed the Campbell inquiry. On the surface, we saw six domestic banks become four. We also saw a State bank being absorbed by one of those major domestic banks, and one would think on the surface of it that competition had been only a secondary consequence of the effect of deregulation. On the surface it would appear to have reduced competition, not increased it. With that arrangement we have also had the difficulty of people being able to compare the product of one bank or one authority with the product of another. This leads, of course, to the necessity for transparency in transactions. So all in all, we have moved a fair way in 12 months. As others have said, while we entered into this with a certain hysteria within the community and within certain quarters that it was going to be a bank bashing exercise, I believe it has been very constructive to the banks. Faults have been revealed on both sides and a bank the banks have appeared to be more than ready to accept the recommendations, which will improve the general feeling between the in the banks and their customers. The honourable member for Parramatta was mentioned the learning curve. I can only agree with him. At the start of deregulation the banks - ere ill-prepared for deregulation. They did riot really have any competence in deciding where they were going to take deregulation. It was put at their feet, they kicked the ball, but in many cases it was very much a misdirected kick. In that respect, the learning curve that has been mentioned is not an excuse but was an actual fact of life, and I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that in future nobody can take any refuge in claiming that as a reason why we are still learning about the process. It is very important, if we are going to get the competitive nature of deregulation, that that learning curve cease somewhere down the line and people get down to constructively presenting products where competition does exist. We have seen some areas of the banking industry post-deregulation where there has been aggressive promotion of products, some of which has led to the banks not being adequately able to service those products and falling into disrepute. There is no secret about the fact that one of those products was the foreign currency loans. Even though they were in existence before deregulation, it appears that upon deregulation there was a great demand being created for them by the banks, which led many unsuspecting people into situations in which substantial losses were incurred. Through all of the inquiry there were no sadder moments than those when listening to some of those people who had been aggressively led into borrowing in that respect, where the loans were not properly managed, where the offsets were not made, and where, as a result, substantial losses were incurred. I will move to the next step: the other sad case was certainly the Nyngan case-not that I was present at the inquiry. However, I was certainly present at the inquiry at Charleville, where there were some desperate cases, again as a result of aggressive selling by some financial institutions which, having aggressively sold on the one hand, were within six or 12 months aggressively calling in debts under questionable circumstances on the other. I thought they were the very difficult areas we had to address, but unfortunately we were not able to make the recommendations that the people concerned might have expected. We could only refer them on and highlight the problems as they occurred. It would come as no surprise to the members of the Committee to hear that I found the auditors' evidence to be the most constructive and probably the best presented that we had. There has been a tendency in the results-the non-performing loans, the bad debts, and the low profits-for the auditors to be seen as being somehow to blame. I think people must realise that an audit appointment is a contract between an auditor and the client, and they report to the shareholders on the basis of the inquiries they make. One of the difficulties revealed within the inquiry was that auditors do not have any direct access to the supervisors; they have access only via the clients that they represent. I thought the questioning of the independence of auditors was going a bit over the fence. I thought the suggestion that auditors ought to be appointed to the banking institutions from a panel, and not in the way in which they are now, called into account the integrity of what I believe is a great profession which has had its learning curve, too. The most constructive suggestions we have had, particularly in the vital area of supervising banks, came from the auditors themselves. There are other major areas of concern. We have addressed the matter of foreign banks. There was an expectation that, on entry into Australia, foreign banks would open further retail outlets. This has not been the case, for the very obvious reason that the domestic banks already have that niche in the market. We have seen the contraction of retail outlets and not the expansion of them, as we expected with the foreign banks. We have found that banks have been prepared to accommodate customers through automatic tellers, electronic transfers and access to computer information. The closure of these retail outlets is regrettable, particularly in country Queensland. The evidence given by the National Farmers Federation suggested that this was being accommodated in other ways. There was a common theme that the business sector, not the rural people of Australia, was the financial expert. I will not hear that criticism, because, as we heard in evidence, if people on the land today are not business people and administrators of their own finances, they will not survive. I give the lie to the claim that rural people are not as financially adept as their city cousins. Maybe they are not as slick as their city cousins, but they are more honest and more definite about what they want. The documentation came under scrutiny as being too legalistic and incapable of being read, even by the bankers themselves. The indication that we are going to go to plain English documentation was welcomed. That is part of our recommendation. There is a recommendation about adequate disclosure of information between the borrower and the lender on page 48. . I have had concerns about the situation of guarantors in the banking market. I believe that there has been too much open-ended lending. There does not seem to be any end to the liabilities of guarantors if taken to a joint and several condition. We suggested in one of the recommendations that we close off the open-endedness of this; that guarantors should be advised of the risk they are taking in guaranteeing; and that they should be kept advised of the manner of the account. My choice for a recommendation would have been that no guarantors ought to be allowed as security within the banking arrangementsbut I know the futility of that, so I did not go ahead with it. I believe credit cards are an area of major complaint by consumers. The decrease in interest rates has not extended to credit cards. As I understand it, at the moment credit cards still attract an interest rate of 20 or 21 per cent, diminishing slightly. A comparison with the bond rate and the rate charged on normal accounts shows that something must be done in this regard. The Prices Surveillance Authority might conduct an inquiry, but we must also look at the up-front fee and the transaction charges. Another area of concern is the rural area. I believe that the rural code of conduct has to be pursued rigorously so that people in rural areas get a fairer go. I believe that there is a slight rural bias. The pastoral houses encouraged people to borrow in one month and then there were dubious circumstances, including blackmail. The QIDC, the Queensland Industrial Development Corporation, is not excluded from this criticism. We heard evidence of duress and blackmail to get greater security than was available initially, after those instrumentalities had gone out to sell the borrowings to those concerned. The Charleville experience was very interesting. People in rural areas have been ravaged by flood and drought and are now being ravaged by financial hardship during the recession. There must be a better cooperative spirit between banker, pastoral houses, the QIDC and the administration of funds to those people so that they can survive. If we lose those people from the productive area of the economy, Australia will be in much worse trouble. I am pleased that during the inquiry the banks moved to rectify some of the· very obvious problems between themselves and, particularly, the consumers. Dispute settlement-all those types of things-is being addressed, although probably not in the way we would like. The banks must realise that they can prevent justice being done in a court dispute by refusing to come to court because of the costs of those transactions and because litigation proceeds with a customer who is deeply in debt at that time. There must be some encouragement from the banks to settle these disputes and not prevent justice by keeping them out of the courts because of the cost factor. Transparency is another issue. As much as we are now reporting on the banking situation, the suggestion was that in 10 years time we will be revisiting the superannuation issue. I believe that is a matter of concern.

9,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I rise to support the motion to take note of the report entitled A pocket full of change. I join with others who have spoken this morning in thanking the staff of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for their assistance and dedication to their job throughout this very in-depth and time consuming inq\liry. It could have gone on a lot longer, but we were required to meet our obligations to the Parliament; hence the report is before us today. I congratulate the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), on his dedication to his job. He has done a tremendous job. Other members of the Committee have given as much time as they possibly could. Unfortunately, not all of us were able to give the time to the inquiry that we would have liked, but we gave all the time we could. The banking industry is an interesting aspect. We need to ensure that Australia has a strong, secure banking industry. We have that, with some minor problems from time to time. I think Australia has been fortunate in that it has one of the best banking industries in the world. That is a tribute not only to the industry in Australia but also to many people who work in the industry. When overseas comparisons are made, we find that we have a unique banking system in Australia, particularly with the branch networks that provide a whole range of services to people right across Australia. When considering the banking industry, we should ensure that its success in Australia is maintained and that financial services are extended to people right throughout Australia. We should make every effort to ensure that those services are not eroded in any way. The technology in Australian banks is probably second to none on a world basis. When comparing banking technology used in different banks around the world, those who have the opportunity to travel overseas from time to time find that it is not as good as that in Australia, and that is a credit to the Australian banking industry. The banks deserve our thanks, too, for their cooperation in the compilation of this report. Without their cooperation, our task would have been made somewhat more difficult and that perhaps would have necessitated our having to be much more aggressive than we were. Their participation and cooperation have been an important aspect of this inquiry. Earlier I mentioned the people who actually work in the industry. If I were to suggest that there was anything missing from the report, it would be an acknowledgment of the effort of the people who work in the industry. Some 170,000 people actually work in the banking industry in Australia, which is approximately 2 per cent of the Australian work force. Quite often when banks are criticised, the staff at the front line cop most of the criticism. Having actually come from that industry, I have a lot of sympathy for them because, when people have a problem, they obviously express their views at the front counter of the bank. It needs to be understood that the people at that level are not the ones who are responsible for any problems that the industry has; obviously the decision makers are in the administrative areas. I believe that in tabling this report, we should acknowledge those front line people because they constitute a very dedicated group. They try extremely hard to look after the customers of the banks in which they work, and I think it would be remiss of me today not to make particular mention of them. Certainly this report represents the majority view of the Committee. No doubt there are different aspects of it with which members of the Committee do not agree. However, overall, a lot of deliberation has gone into this report, to such an extent that I think most people are happy with it. A few minor alterations may need to be made from time to time, but I am sure we can deal with them as we go through it. The honourable member for Macarthur mentioned the role of the Committee and the learning experience and education that members and staff gained from working on the Committee. That experience is something which should be enhanced as time goes on. For instance, when the banks read this report-and I am sure they are all busy reading it at the moment-they should bear in mind that many of the members of the Committee had not had a lot of banking experience. Certainly the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and I have had experience in that area, but there should not be too much concern if some terms used in the report are not actually related to what a banker would normally relate to. The recommendations and what they mean for the banking industry itself are the important aspects that need to come out of this report. The bottom line is that the recommendations have been carefully thought out, and those recommendations are very important. There are a number of areas I would particularly like to go into, but more specifically there are three main areas. They are competition, supervision and the role of the Parliament in assessing what happens from here. Obviously, some recommendations in this report will cause some heartburn and concern for people in certain areas, particularly the area of opening up the market to more foreign banks. That is an area that I expressed some views about. I do not necessarily have reservations, but I am concerned about their supervision and ensuring that the safety of the Australian banking system is really enhanced. The Australian banking system has gone through a whole range of change, particularly over the last decade-and I suppose the word 'change' is the appropriate word to use in this regard. But the introduction of further foreign banks-there were already foreign banks here-and how they will operate needs to be addressed. Our recommendations, of course, allow for the fmther entry of foreign banks. One thing they also allow for is the exit of foreign banks, because there will be that twoway game. But, in the international community, I believe we have to move that way for Australians to have better opportunities of improved access to the banking system. The role of the Reserve Bank, of course, is going to be very important in supervising any new banks. The report addresses that issue, which will be very difficult for the Reserve Bank to handle in ensuring that those supervisory roles are actually addressed. There must be things like reciprocal arrangements with other countries taken into consideration. I believe that each bank applying for a banking licence in Australia should be considered on its merits. What is in it for Australia is really the bottom line. I am equally concerned that in the recommendations this question of the retail sector of banking arises. Back in 1985 we saw foreign banks come into Australia and fail to fulfil their obligations provide extra services to the broader community. That has not been done. In the report's conclusions-and I would have preferred to see this included in the actual recommendations-it is noted that that particular aspect should be covered; that the obligations imposed back in 1985 on any new bank wishing to participate in the broader community should still be imposed. One of the important things that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) should do in granting those licences is to make sure that new banks, particularly foreign banks, adhere to those requirements. If that is not done, we are just going to see the same thing happen as has happened in the past. There is little doubt that the Australian banks, when foreign banks came into the country, went out into the marketplace to try to protect their market share. That was probably the correct course of action, but it did result in excessive bad debts. If it is not ensured that new banks which come into the country go into the retail sector as well and participate and compete equally with the existing Australian banks, we might well see the same round of operations again. Certainly the industry and Australia itself do not need to follow that line again. We must be very careful that that does not happen. It is only reasonable to expect that the Australian banks will try to protect their share, but my concern is not only for the rural area but also for provincial centres in Australia, where we will see a decline in banking services if we allow foreign banks to come in and attack the corporate sector. Like most areas, the corporate sector is usually the most profitable, and banks are in the business of making profits. No doubt they will go that way as well. We could probably talk all day about this particular report, but time is going to beat me. Briefly touching on the process of mergers and supervision, there has been some talk recently about a merger between the National Australia Bank and the ANZ Bank. I think it would be a particularly bad thing for the banking industry in Australia to see two banks of their magnitude merge. There may to well be a better course of action, such as for one of those banks to take on another partner, whether it be a foreign partner or some other form of financial institution in Australia. However, if we have the rationalisation of those two major banks, the retail operations in Australia will be rationalised even further. We have seen the result of the mergers in the early 1980s-a decline in banking services in a whole range of areas. We did not address that at all. So we have to be very careful that a merger of that magnitude does not go ahead. That rumour has been around for a long time, but those banks would be better off, I believe, with another suitor rather than taking away the retail sector like that. It would create further unemployment in the industry itself as the previous mergers did. The role of the Parliament is the final point I would like to pick up on. The overview in chapter 23 of the report addresses that question. But I believe that in some ways that report does not go far enough in recognising that we now have financial conglomerates rather than just banks. I think there is probably a need to expand the role of the Committee or to set up a separate committee. I do not think, as the report says, that fmancial constraints should stop us establishing a new committee. Certainly the role of the existing committee should be enhanced in recognition of the fact that there is not only the banking industry; there is also the whole finance industry. There are three important wings of the finance industry: the banking sector; insurance and superannuation; and those areas where we have such factors as unit trusts, which are handled by the Australian Securities Commission. I think the report addresses those three important areas and whether we should be looking at some sort of mega-supervisor over the lot. I noticed that the report, when referring to whether we need some sort of mega-supervisor, says that perhaps down the track we may well need one. I would hope that the Treasurer may go a little further in looking at these recommendations and make the Committee larger to include all aspects of the finance industry, because banks now sell a whole range of services outside traditional banking areas and have been doing so for some time. There has been a gradual build-up over the years and banks are now almost one-stop shopping areas. So I think we need to go a bit further to try to make the Committee more representative of the whole finance industry because I just do not believe we can possibly look at the banking industry in isolation. This Committee, during the course of its inquiry, has not necessarily looked at the banking industry in isolation. We have had to look past there. Building societies, credit unions, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and the Commissioner from the Australian Securities Commission have come before the inquiry. I think that is what we need to look at. Overall, I believe that this Committee has produced a comprehensive report and that it put many hours into it. I think that the report itself should not necessarily be seen as an inquiry, but more a review of what has happened in the banking industry, particularly since deregulation. I hope that the recommendations from the report will assist, in particular, those people involved with foreign currency loans, because I have a great concern for them. I think that the report's recommendations will bring their problems to a satisfactory resolution. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in this inquiry. The honourable member for Fairfax and I joined the Committee especially for this inquiry and I know that we enjoyed our contribution to it. (Time expired)",25
10,Mr STEELE HALL,COMMITTEE REPORT,"I found serving on the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to be a pleasant experience. The reason for that, of course, was the very amicable relati()nship between the Chairman, the members of the Committee and the staff. I particularly want to pay tribute to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), as Chairman, for leading the study as he did. It has also been a time of considerable learning about the banking system and its impact on Australians right across this nation. We know that most Australians have a relationship with a bank and it is in their interests and the nation's interests to have a banking system which is viable and forward looking in its management of financial matters. The Committee's importance has been proven by the reaction of the banks to the scrutiny whilst it has been in progress. There is no doubt that the banks have lifted their game considerably in the last few months, in particular, in relation to their problem customers and to exposing to scrutiny some of the matters which they have previously tried to hide. We now find that the banking system is much more open and customer oriented. Indeed, from now on banks may be adopting the good business principle that the customer is right in preference to their pre-deregulation attitude, which was that the customer, if not wrong, was held at arm's length from the mysteries of the banking system. The reasons for having this inquiry are, I suppose, based on the fact that it has been some time since there has been one and, secondly, that we are now considering, as a parliament, the results of deregulation. The problems, indeed, have been severe and still continue to harass bank managements and are evident in banks' reports which have recently been given. The problems of the 1980s still depress bank earnings and still hang over the initiatives that banks can enter into in this current period. It has been a mystery to many people as to why bankers ceased to be bankers in the 1980s; why the banks seemed to indulge in this national period of self-hypnosis when they began to believe that business cycles had ceased to exist or had been significantly suspended; that it was an easy turbo-charged surge forward where money was made from money and one no longer had to think about underpinning the economic activity by some useful productive means. So money was lent on the value of shares without proper security. Indeed, it was perhaps ordinary, sane people outside the decision-making area who stood in awe of the capacity of leading so-called entrepreneurs to engage with the banks in this purchasing spree of the 1980s. I suppose the Committee received no real satisfactory answer from leading bankers in this country as to why they were so bereft of common sense in that decade. They simply hold up their hands and say, 'Well, we did it and we were all guilty of it'. UnfOitunately, we are all poorer because of it. It has been a difficult time. This has been magnified by the recession of the last several years. The miscalculations of the previous Treasurer in acceding to calls for further money supply after the 1987 share market crash, and the pumping up of the property boom that was the result and the subsequent crash have magnified the failures of the entrepreneurs to which I have referred. But a particular disappointment was the failure of prudential supervision during this period. It must be said that those of us who thought the banks were subject to the oversight of the Reserve Bank have felt very much let down that the Reserve Bank also seemed to be included in this national se1fhypnosis that the banking cycles were to be suspended during the 1980s. Where were they? Where was the communication of those people behind the scenes? Where was the transfer of views? Where was the Reserve Bank caution that entrepreneurs should not get 100 per cent borrowing on paper shuffling activities and shares? Why was this advice not given? Why was it not followed up by the Reserve Bank and given to the private banks in the 1980s? That is a question that need not really be answered now because, if the Reserve Bank were to ignore the lessons of that period, the mistakes would be repeated; I am sure they will not be. Perhaps the greatest disappointment of that failure rests with the State banks. There seems to be a very severe lack of communication and understanding between the Reserve Bank and the State banks' owners of the need to supervise those organisations. In South Australia we have a very disappointing spectacle of a royal commission examining, day after day, the activities of the State Bank of South Australia and its failure. We have the scene set where almost daily there is reporting of failure to manage that institution. Perhaps one of the most shocking revelations so far has been that the Managing Director, Mr Marcus Clark, left a meeting with the Reserve Bank and the prudential supervisors in 1968-or whenever it wasand did not return to such a meeting for four years. There was a four-year break in the Managing Director's contact with the prudential oversight of that bank. I notice today a further reference in the public reporting of the royal commission. A fanner director, Mr Rod Hartley, wrote earlier this year setting out progress of events over the previous few years regarding warnings which had been given about the failure of management of that bank. Mr Hartley sent a memo to the assistant to the Premier on 21 February this year. He said that as a former director of the Department of State Development and Technology and a director of the bank he had started to become genuinely worried towards the end of 1988. According to the letter, from the end of 1988 and throughout 1989 Mr Bannon was warned on 'five or six occasions that Tim Marcus Clark was acting in a dangerous way'. It went on: My advice at that time, which became more and more firm. was to strengthen the board with people now: who had sufficient financial experience to control Clark. The letter went on to say: When I left the department in December 1989, I arranged a special meeting with the Premier to tell him 'a few home truths'. I do not want to pursue that further into the labyrinth of South Australian politics, but I use those quotes to show that the board and the Premier were made aware of problems within the bank-problems which were abroad in street gossip throughout Adelaide. Only this week:, I met an accountant who told me how absurd it was that this had not been known officially when he as an accountant knew that the State Bank was the easy money of Australia. This is a quite extraordinary proposition. But what is more extraordinary is that prudential supervision failed. The Premier failed, but so did the prudential supervisors. There is a lack of communication, a lack of intent and a lack of discernment. If a managing director will not go to see the supervisors, surely someone knows something is wrong. So it went on and on, and now we have a disaster of enormous magnitude for my State, where the Government is financially paralysed and worthwhile projects throughout the State cannot be proceeded with or initiated because there is no money in government coffers. I find that example of the failure of prudential supervision the worse in this country. It ought to be an example which we must make sure is never repeated. The recommendations of this Committee in that regard should be acted upon. I have taken the trouble to put in a dissenting report in which I state my view that foreign banks should not be allowed to operate as branches in this country but should continue to operate as subsidiaries. I have done so with some thought, and I believe much of the evidence placed before the Committee supports my view. In particular, I have referred to a report in the Economist of 17 August of this year which was headed 'Home thoughts from abroad'. I have used one paragraph in my dissenting report to back up my view. I will read slightly more of it The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCl) did business in 70 countries. It was crooked in some of them for a decade and a half. Half a dozen supervisors must have suspected problems if not fraud for a number of years. Yet not until July 1991 did the doors close on what seems history's biggest single banking scandal. Another excerpt reads: Banking has become international; supervising it has not. .. The two most important groups of bank supervisors-Britain's and America's-share information (or, as in BCCI's case, do not share it enough) on an informal basis. The BCCI scandal will increase pressure for more co-ordination and perhaps for harmonised rules. But of what kind? It goes on: The choice is whether to apply the home country's or the host country's rules, or to combine either with harmonised rules acceptable to both. . . Branches are the trickiest (as the BCCI case confirms) because they require the greatest hostcountry faith in the rules, will and resources of home-country regulators. It goes on to furth-r emphasise that point, and evidence given to the Committee made that point. Had we allowed branches here, we could have easily seen the collapse of BCCI cause great distress to Australian depositors. I believe that until there is an absolutely foolproof method of international supervision of banks we should continue to apply to foreign banks in Australia bank supervisory .l,""Ules which apply to Australian banks. I cannot see why we should start to set up two separate paths for banking in this country: 'foreign banks that can be fully foreign owned and regulated in New York, London, Zurich, Luxembourg or anywhere else in the world, and Australian banks, which are properly regulated by the Reserve Bank of Australia. There is a secondary factor to this, of course. We are going down a separate path in ?wnership also. Overseas banks, quite obVIOusly, can be 100 per cent owned by whomever, whereas Australian banks are subject to strict supervisory rules as to the percentage of ownership that can be in the hands of one owner. I think it is 8 per cent, subject to special provision of 15 per cent. Why we want to start off going down two paths, I do not know. I cannot see the rationale. It is the safety of Australian depositors that counts. In addition to the safety of the depositors, there is the reputation of the Australian banking system. If ever we have had a decade that has shown that we need a profitable and reputable banking system, it is the decade of the 1980s. That is why I say in my dissenting report that foreign banks should be here as subsidiaries and not branches. In closing I would like to pay tribute to the staff who, in support of the Chairman and the Committee, made this endeavour a most enjoyable one. Debate (on motion by Mr Campbell) adjourned. NA NA The following Bill was returned from the Senate without amendment: International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991 NA BILL 1991 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
11,Mr FREE,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Public Service Amendment Bill 1991 makes a number of amendments to the officers' mobility provisions contained in part IV of the Public Service Act 1922. The mobility provisions preserve certain rights of public servants who are transferred to, or take up .employment with, certain government busmess enterprises or authorities which are staffed outside the Public Service Act. There are currently 90 such agencies. These include agencies such as Telecom, the Health insurance Commission, Austrade and the Civil Aviation Authority. When staff become redundant in one of these agencies they generally are covered by , redundancy arrangements, which can include provision for benefits such as severance pay and periods of retention in employment before retrenchment occurs. Under the mobility provisions, however, many officers and exofficers of the Public Service may also have the right to go back to work in the Public Service if they are retrenched from their agency. It is not acceptable to the Government that people with mobility rights may benefit from the redundancy arrangements of an agency and then return to the Public Service, where they may either get another job with the Commonwealth or, if no work is available have access to further redundancy arrangements-that is, double dip. The Government is also firmly of the view that the redundancy arrangements available to former public servants in government business enterprises and other authorities should not be more generous than for other staff in these agencies. The amendments contained in this Bill therefore, give effect to the Government'policy that people with Public Service mobility rights who become redundant in an agency should be allowed the benefit of a single option, that is, redundancy arrangements in th- agency, or return to the Public Service, but not both. The Government's intention to introduce these amendments was announced by media release on 29 May this year. Before explaining how the Bill will prevent double dipping, I will briefly touch on the relevant aspects of the mobility provisions. The part IV provisions of the Public Service Act adopt a two tier approach to the preservation of mobility rights, although this expression does not itself appear in the legislation. The first tier generally applies where officers of the Public Service move into employment with an agency with part IV coverage as a result of applying successfully for a job in that agency. Such people generally have first tier coverage for the first three years of their employment with the authority. First tier also generally applies to public servants appointed to statutory offices which have a fixed tenure. While on first tier, officers are deemed to be on leave without pay from the Public Service and automatically become unattached officers of their former Public Service department. As such, they may return to that department at any time. The second tier of the mobility provisions applies to a number of categories of former Public Service officers, including those who continue to be engaged in employment with a part IV agency beyond the first tier period; those on first tier who resign from the Public Service but not from the employing agency; and those who are transferred from Public Service employment as a result of the transfer of a function. Under the second tier arrangements, people cease to be officers of the Public Service but retain certain rights, including the right to apply for promotion and transfer to Public Service vacancies. As well, a person with second tier coverage may apply for re-appointment to the Public Service in certain circumstances, including retrenchment. Because of the complex nature of the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act, the amendments contained in the Bill are themselves quite complex. Essentially, however, the Bill does two things. It provides that people with either first or second tier coverage who are offered, and accept, a retrenchment benefit in relation to the termination of their employment with an agency, will cease to be covered by the mobility provisions. As a result, people will not be able to accept a voluntary redundancy payment on their retrenchment from an agency and also exercise a right of return to the Public Service, where they may be able to get either another job or access to further redundancy benefits. Instead, the Bill provides that tp.ey will have a choice of either accepting a voluntary redundancy payment or exercising a right to return to the Public Service. They will not be able to do both. The Bill also affects the operation of the Public Service redundancy award to the extent that it provides that, where people who become excess in an agency choose to return to the Public Service through the use of the mobility provisions, any action taken by the authority in relation to a person's retirement is to be taken as if it had been done under the Public Service redundancy award. The purpose of this is to prevent a person double dipping by taking advantage of benefits available under two separate awards. By way of an example, in the absence of such a provision it may be possible, under the existing arrangements for retention in employment provided by the Public Service and similar redundancy awards, for a person to have 13 months of retention in employment in an agency before returning to the Public Service, where, if there were no position for the person, a further retention period of 13 months would then be applicable. Such a possibility is clearly unacceptable. As well as ensuring that persons with first and second tier mobility rights are unable to double dip, the Bill makes similar provision for people with mobility rights arising from the repealed Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928. As I indicated earlier, the amendments contained in this Bill provide people with mobility rights who become subject to redundancy arrangements in an agency with a choice: a choice of whether to use the redundancy arrangements of that agency or to return to the Public Service. The Bill provides that this choice should be made soon after people become aware that they may be retrenched from an agency. However. as the Government is concerned that people are able to make an informed choice, the Bill also provides that people must be given information about the operation of the amendments contained in this Bill which affect them, before being required to choose the course they will take. Financial Impact Statement Preventing the duplication of redundancy benefits removes the potential for significant, and unjustifiable, additional costs associated with the restructuring of government business enterprises and authorities. While it is not possible to provide an estimate of the likely additional expenditure if legislative or other arrangements were not in place to prevent double dipping, there is a considerable potential for such costs. Current estimates suggest that there are currently some 50,000 people covered by the mobility provisions of the Public Service Act. Many of these people are presently working in agencies which are undergoing major restructuring. To complement this Bill, the Government will also be putting in place arrangements which may require legislation to ensure that all redundancy costs arising from actions taken by an agency will be met by that agency. This will include costs either arising from the payment of redundancy benefits or through the use of Public Service re-entry rights. The objective of establishing non-Budget agencies such as government business enterprises or authorities is to provide such agencies with financial independence, which includes the opportunity to access benefits and savings arising from that independence. It is therefore appropriate that they also bear the financial responsibility for the full costs of their decisions. Conversely, it is clearly inappropriate for Budget agencies to bear the costs associated with decisions over which the Commonwealth has no direct control. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. NA Economy and Employment Debate resumed from 26 November, on the following paper presented by Mr Hawke: Economy and Employment-Ministerial Statement, 14 November 1991 and on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper.",31
12,Mr RONALDSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT," It is now some 14 hours since I was first poised to make this speech, so I am extremely pleased to get the call. Before I get on to the key subject of the economy and unemployment, I will quote from an article by Michelle Grattan in this morning's Age: It is an understatement to say the Government was abysmal in Parliament. It was fumbling, halting, wrong-footed, without tactics, and, just to cap it all, without taste. It lurched from one disaster to another in an agonising two hours of pathetic performance. I was extremely disappointed with the antics in this House yesterday. It was topped off by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who sunk to the lowest I have seen anyone sink in the 19 months I have been here. One person stood out in that debacle yesterday afternoon, and that was the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He was extremely restrained. He put up with the personal abuse of the Deputy Prime Minister, which was an absolute disgrace. I hope that not only my colleagues on this side of the House but also those on the other side are appalled by the Deputy Prime Minister's performance. From the looks on the faces yesterday, I suspect that they were horrified that the Deputy Prime Minister of this country would sink to those levels.",33
13,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,Order! I suggest that the honourable member get on to the relevant matter.,33
14,Mr RONALDSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I will indeed. Speaking of deplorable, I now get on to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I have in one hand nearly 700 pages of a real recipe for this economy. I then look at the Prime Minister's document and wonder why he bothered wasting his and the Parliament's time in delivering this. Before I address the coalition's view, and indeed my personal view. on unemployment, I will briefly go through the Prime Minister's document. In the first two paragraphs the Prime Minister refers to the 'hurt of the recession'. He then says that the immediate focus of this statement is on the problem of unemployment. He talks about fundamental confidence. His classic comment is: I have not spent the whole of my 33 years in public life in the Labor movement of Australia to acquiesce in allowing the present high levels of unemployment to continue. The Prime Minister, when he was with the ACro, was a Johnny-come-lately. He is again the Johnny-come-lately on the unemployment situation. When he was the head of the ACTU, the banner headlines read 'Hawke intervenes-saves dispute'. The simple fact was that he was always there at the end of the day; he was always there at the end of the deals and the negotiations and the bargainings and he is the classic Johnny-come-lately of the 1970s, the 1980s and now, it appears, the 1990s. The Prime Minister and the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) are the ones who caused this recession. This was the recession we had to have, according to the former Treasurer. For the Prime Minister to come out and produce a Mickey Mouse document like this to try to get himself out of the mess he has put Australia in I think is an absolute disgrace. Members have only to look at the details of this program. Dr Bob Woods-What details?",33
15,Mr RONALDSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes, exactly, what details. Members have only to look at the Prime Minister's statement to see the amount of money that has been allocated-$313m-to try to get this country out of the diabolical mess it is in. The document gets worse on the way through it. He says on page 3 'nobody feels this concern more deeply than I'. That is the classic crocodile tear statement from a Prime Minister who-and yesterday's performance has confirmed this-has totally lost any grasp of the problems that ordinary Australians in this country are facing. Before my time is up I will address the specific questions in relation to the Federal seat of Ballarat. No other centre has felt the ramifications of this Government's policies more than the city of Ballarat and the Federal electorate of Ballarat. It is quite diabolical. The people there are a very, very resilient group and they are trying, but they are suffering quite dramatically. The coalition's view on unemployment, with specific reference to the Prime Minister's statement, is that there is a large number of factors we have got to look at in the broad sense before we can address the key issues of how to generate employment in this country and how we revive this economy. The campaign is a fight back campaign and it is a fight back campaign by the grassroots of this country-the ordinary working men and women and the families of this country, the groups who have suffered diabolically. I will admit they have suffered not just for the last eight or nine years under this Government, but over the last 20 years. It started in the era of Mr Whitlam, the former Prime Minister of this country, and it has gone slowly down hill from there and we are now seeing the end result of that neglect of this economy. Australians have seen living standards eroded over the last eight years under the pressures of inflation, taxation and unemployment. In the electorate of Ballarat, which I think is probably the litmus test for the whole of Australia. I know other people on both sides of the House say that, but this is the true litmus test in the Federal seat of BallaratDr Bob Woods-What about mine?",34
16,Mr RONALDSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I will not worry about the honourable member for Lowe, or the Minister who is at the table. We have seen the ramifications in a rural regional seat where there is a feeder process, and it is not a seat like that of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for example, which is very much a rural seat. This is a regional rural seat where the feeder process goes on and on. The rural centre feeds the main regional centre of Ballarat, and in tum the regional centre of Ballarat provides employment, service industries and a whole range of services. It is very much a regional rural family and both rely very much on each other to survive. Regrettably the nexus has been broken, and very dramatically broken, because of what we are seeing at the moment in the rural sector in the Federal electorate of Ballarat. My colleague the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) who sits beside me in this House is seeing those same ramifications in his seat. We have broken the nexus of that life cycle between the rural sector and the city. Once that happens we end up with the very problems that we now have in the Federal seat of Ballarat and the very problems that have prompted the community itself to start a 'Which way Ballarat' campaign. Which way is Ballarat going? That is a question that has been addressed by people right across the board-employers, employees, employee representative groups, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Chamber of Commerce-right across the whole community. The Ballarat Regional Board is looking at what we can do for ourselves. This policy, this Fightback campaign, is about letting communities fight back themselves with a bit of assistance from government, with a direction from government and with a direction so that they know where they are going. They can plan five, 10, 15 years down the track without this mishmash of government interference that we have seen under the present Government and which has all but totally destroyed any business confidence, not only in the Federal seat of Ballarat, but I suspect Australia-wide. We have seen Australian families subjected to increasing pressures. At the moment in Ballarat 22 per cent of the work force is unemployed. The members of this House, including the Minister at the table, and the Government must realise the ramifications of that on families. It is quite disastrous. Not only am I a politician, but I am also a social worker-lam sure I am not the only one in this House in that situation-because people are absolutely desperate for some assistance. If there has been any good that has come out of this recession-and it would be the only good-it would be, I suspect, that politicians have come back to the people. Politicians have been forced to come back to the people because they are embroiled in the day-today lives and the day-today fights that the average Australian is having on a 24 hour basis. There is no better evidence than in a centre like Ballarat where the social ramifications of what has happened are quite disastrous-and it is just not a matter of one or two years. Of course, this economy will pick up in due course given the right signal from government, given a bit of community confidence and given some business confidence, but the social ramifications of the unemployment levels we have, I regret to say, will be with us for five, 10, possibly 15 years, and as a representative of the people of Ballarat I find that very, very frightening. We have really got to start looking at how we not only address the economic ramifications, but also the social ramifications. When a child is born it is not stamped with a number on its head. That child is a person, the result of a relationship between two people. A person is born a human and dies a human; that person is not a number. The problem in the 1990s in this country is that we are putting numbers on people. People are becoming numbers between nought and a million, or whatever it might be. I think that is very, very worrying. It is no wonder the Australian people are in the depths of despair that they are at the moment because they are starting to think that the powers that be think they are just a number. Every single person in this House should get back to some basics and recognise that people are people, that people are not numbers. I am running out of time. The key initiatives we need to take up to get this country moving again are part of a very, very broad package and it is about time we started to support the people who have been the whipping boys and girls of this country for the last 20 years. They are the families, the workers, who have been paying a disproportionate amount of tax and who have not had all these schemes and shams available to them-the people who every day of the week get their pay slip and there it is, tax taken out. They cannot get fancy accountants to do a bit of fancy footwork to reduce their income. They are stuck with it week in, week ou-. It is no wonder under our present taxation system that Australian workers have almost given up working those extra hours. Day after day people say to me, 'Michael, what is the point of working extra hours when we are taxed so massively? We have the billyo taxed out of us. It is just not worth our while'. What an extraordinary system. This country was not built on that system; it was built on the ability of people to work hard. This country was built on its ability to deliver the rewards to those who wanted to have a go. Over the last 20 years we have seen that philosophy disappear from our culture. I am absolutely convinced that there are a lot of people out there who want to see that philosophy reintroduced. There are a lot of people who want to get on and provide for themselves and their families, but the system is constantly placing cement blocks in their way. Briefly, the package that has been outlined by the coalition to save this country is, in my view, the most impressive document that has ever been put forward by an opposition or a government in this country's history. There is no doubt that it is a recipe for recovery. a recipe for long term jobs; it is a recipe for delivering a fair go to people who have been kicked from pillar to post for far too long. The one simple measure amongst all these proposals, apart from tax relief and help to low income groups, that is going to affect the electorate of Ballarat is petrol pricing. I do not think honourable members from the cities realise what an impact the cost of petrol has on the day-today budget of people in the country. They have no idea. Whether it be farmers, business or the family, the impact of the cost of petrol is absolutely dramatic. This proposal will finally deliver measures that are long, long overdue. (Time expired)",34
17,Mr HOLLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I do not dispute the concern of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) for the unemployed, nor do I dispute the concern that honourable members on both sides of the House have for the unemployed. But I would ask the honourable member for Ballarat whether really, in his heart of hearts, he believes that putting 15 per cent on everything will do anything for the unemployed. He talked about a document called Fightback!, but the people of the electorate of Throsby have rightly named it the 'Fright packet'. That is what it really is-a fright packet. I am pleased to speak today in support of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the economy and emplbyment. As was stated in the report of the Caucus working party on employment, there is no issue of greater concern to members of the Labor Party than the current high levels of unemployment. I honestly believe that the Prime Minister's statement was a balanced assessment of this difficulty facing Australia and did indicate the correct way to deal with this economic, social and very personal problem. The measures outlined in the Prime Minister's statement built on the strategy for reducing unemployment already put in place by the Budget. They are well-reasoned and well-argued measures; different, I might add, from some of the proposed solutions put out during the past week which, frankly, were nothing more than the Opposition's illogical It is baggage of ideological prejudice. Contrast the Prime Minister's statement on job creation with the Opposition's unfounded and unproven claim that it will create two million jobs. I really do think that this is a great fraud that is being perpetrated on the people of Australia. The claim of the Opposition that it will create two million jobs is based on the very discredited 'trickle down' theory; that is, if we give tax cuts to the big end of town this money will somehow trickle down;it will somehow be reinvested in job generation. But the reality is that it does not happen. When tax cuts are given to the big end of town, what does it do? Mr Deputy Speaker, you know as well as I do that the big end of town pockets it. It does not reinvest the money, and it does not go into job generation schemes. One must question the seriousness of the commitment of the Opposition to job generation with its announcement that the training levy scheme will be abolished. Coming from an area such as I do, I have always supported this training levy scheme. Business supports it as well. Some of the comments that have been expressed indicate the surprise of business that this is going to be abolished. This scheme, so much a part of the employment scheme in some of the more advanced countries of the world, provides, funds for training and retraining-something that is sadly needed in this country. The key to providing a sustainable improvement in the employment position is to encourage investment in industry. Government policy and spending should be targeted to ensuring that new enterprises arise and established enterprises remain viable. I believe that Australia needs a clearly delineated industry policy so that, as a nation, we can develop industry needed to employ our people in circumstances that can maintain living standards and provide for improvements in this area. To develop such a policy we need to ask what sorts of industries we need in Australia. The answer seems obvious: we need to do better the things we do well. We are among the world's best miners and we are good at agriculture. We need to add value to the primary industry products we export. We also need to develop those secondary industries that our primary industries upon. As we are among the world's best miners we should be exporting mining equipment and disposables. Only last week a group of people from the CSIRO came before one of the committees of the Parliament. The CSIRO is planning to have a centre of excellence for mining equipment in the Brisbane area which will be not dissimilar to the centre of excellence deVeloped by the CSIRO around Parkville, a suburb of Melbourne. I believe that we need these centres of excellence and, hopefully, with some government assistance, this centre of excellence for mining equipment will be developed in the Brisbane area. I think that will be a great bonus. That is the sort of thing Australia should be looking at. Australia must also invest more in research and development. In order to provide a sustainable increase in the level of employment, government should provide policy settings to give industry the incentive to invest. Every encouragement should continue to be given to entice industries to invest in areas involved in the production of'internationally tradeable goods and services. Emphasis should be on import replacement and export expansion. The approval process for an levels of industry and business should be simplified through agreements amongst Federal, State and local governments. An acceleration of the development process will remove a major disincentive to investment. We should give priority to further easing interest rates. I believe that interest rates can come down more. Although I have not read the report that was released in this House this morning-but I will read it with interest-I hope that the banks will be encouraged to pass on those reductions in interest rates. I know that in the past the banks have held to the higher rates. This was very much the outline that the Prime Minister gave to this House in his statement. But what have we got from the Opposition? We saw last week that the Opposition, in a way, put out its answer to the Prime Minister. The Opposition feels that 15 per cent on everything would solve Australia's problems. If it believes that, it should look at Britain after it introduced VAT or, closer to home, it should go to New Zealand. rcly Many members of the Opposition have made the trek to New Zealand. I do not know what they saw when they went there, but one has only to look at the great social and economic problems of New Zealand to realise what a disaster such a scheme is. The Opposition has made much of the fact that, because of the sales tax, there could be a slight reduction on some goods on supermarket shelves. If the sales tax is taken off, there could be a slight reduction in some areas. But there most celiainly will not be any reduction in vegetables and meat; they will all be subject to the 15 per cent increase. The Opposition's proposal will be of assistance to those already well off; that is, those who do not spend most of their income on goods and services. The impact on business and low income earners will be dramatic. One could argue that under the Opposition's proposal we would be better off initially because we do not spend most of our income on disposables, but many people we represent do. Many people in Port Kembla, Warilla and Dapto do not enjoy the high income that we enjoy. Most of their money is spent at the supermarket on things such as fruit, vegetables and meat. They will be hit with a 15 per cent increase on every one of those items. It will also create great divisions in this country between the haves and the have-nots in society. I turn briefly to the area of infrastructure spending. The Prime Minister indicated in his statement that more money would be spent on infrastructure. I believe that more should be done on the waterfront. Yesterday, I heard the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) make a throw-away line about idle time on the waterfront. People criticise the waterfront very much. As I have said time and time again, people think that all the problems of the waterfront are put down to the Waterside Workers Federation. Anyone who knows anything about the waterfront and its problems would know that there is a whole chain and the Waterside Workers Federation is only one link in that chain. Linked to that chain as well is some of the shipping that is coming through our waterfront into Australia at the moment. I note that it is part of the Opposition's policy to open up the waterfront to foreign shipping. Last week, I spoke about a ship that was being delayed in Port Kembla. Last Friday, an Indian ship, Lok Maheshwari, came into Port Kembla. It has been inspected. The inspector's report contains four pages of the defects. That is the sort of ship that the Opposition wants to put on the coastal run around Australia. Mr MCGauran-Table it. I would like to see it.",36
18,Mr HOLLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,I seek leave to table the document. Leave granted.,38
19,Mr HOLLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Not only did the ship have defects, but it also had rotting vegetables on the deck and it was full of cockroaches. Yesterday, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) made a statement about quarantine. If we permit these ships to continue coming into Australia in this condition, we are going to open up the Australian coastline to massive health problems. They are bringing diseases into this country and we have to be much more severe on them. I tum briefly to some of the impacts of the recent statement of the Opposition and contrast it with the statement of the Prime Minister. I believe that the Prime Minister's statement clearly shows the way Australia should be going and how we can overcome our economic problems. The Opposition's policy creates divisiveness in the community. It is a policy that pensioners and those less well off will be hit with. The honourable member for Ballarat said that this was a recipe for recovery. It really is a recipe for divisiveness; it is a recip- for disaster. I, and the people I represent in the Throsby electorate, regard the policy as a fright package not a Fightback package.",38
20,Mr MCGAURAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT," The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the economy and employment sadly falls far short of what is required to solve at least some of the ills afflicting this country. Previously when the Government has been in doubt, it has predictably reached for industry statements or an employment statement such as the one being addressed by the House today. The Government is quick to find a glib phrase or trot out a public relations stunt to give the impression that it has uncovered some new direction in economic policy. Or else it has come up with some catchphrase or another to give the impression of purpose and economic coherence. In the time that I have been the Opposition spokesman on science related matters, I have witnessed the decline and fall of many such catchphrases. One former Minister for Science and Technology spent the best part of a decade exalting the profound importance of the so-called sunrise industries. That term has died off. Now we have another: the son of sunrise industries-value added industries. I do not wish to mock the future role of elaborately transformed manufactures in this economy. For reasons that I will come to shortly, the development of a real capacity in this respect is indeed critical to the nation's economic future. The Government knows this. Its only problem is that it cannot get us there. It cannot break through the obstacles, the barriers, to release the array of forces which will lead to the creation of a more sophisticated, knowledge intensive, value added manufacturing base. The impact of this persistent failure is simple enough: it is what lurks behind the macro-economic policies that brought on the recession-the decline in national wealth. Working on 1989-90 figures, Australia's net deficit of goods and services was in the order of $6.7 billion. This, in hand with other outflows, produced a current account deficit of $17.4 billion. Despite the occasional anomalies in the monthly figures, we still find ourselves staring at a net foreign debt which has kicked on from 13 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 30 per cent or so today. Just to service a debt of this proportion, Australia has to plough in almost 20 per cent of its current exports. The Government rightly hopes that Australia might come to trade its way out of this situation by altering the nation's manufacturing profile. It is hoping against the odds that somehow, if we talk about it long enough, our commodity and semi-processed materials based export capacity might undergo a meta·· morphosis and come to produce elaborately transformed materials with a high degree of value added. I understand why the Government has this hope. Some 20 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports are basic, unprocessed commodities. About three-quarters of the rest are agricultural and mining related. This squeezes the genuine level of value added merchandise in the nation's export capacity to nominal levels. So Australia still relates to international market as a price taker locked into an export economy where returns continue to erode. While the share of manufacturing in world merchandise trade has escalated dramatically over the decades, Australia has stagnated in respect of its own export production capacities. While manufacturing exports have knocked out commodities in respect of shares of world export markets over the past few decades, Australia has lived on oblivious to the vast significance of the trend, unable to change even if it wanted to. The ratio of merchandise exports to GDP in this country has been largely static since 1960. Because of this, we not only have missed the boat on capturing positions in expanding markets, but the export economy has already remained tied to markets which provide steadily diminishing returns. Unable to crack open the real forces which make for change, the Government has tried to substitute policies of its own. Hence, the profusion of administratively driven schemes which propped up a few industries, buried the capacities of others and have driven the Government further away from bringing about self-sustaining and lasting across economy reform. The Government's value added rhetoric will remain simply that-idle rhetoric. The shift of resources into elaborately transformed manufacturing is not something that has to be orchestrated by government. It should not be the result of a contrived sectoral plan or blueprint by government such as those cooked up in the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). Rather, it should be the logical outcome of advantages industries already hold in upstream commodity markets-wool and other fibres, grains, food production and metals. If further investment in downstream processing by established industries is not forthcoming it is not because management has overlooked or misjudged the opportunities against all the world trends but simply because industries in this country are stripped of their advantages the further they move into a higher risk, heavily capitalised and sophisticated production process requiring greater the emphasis dn acquired skill. In the real areas of significance-investment in human skills, investment in technology, investment in new plant and marketing and design and so forth-Australia's companies are largely not in the race. The reasons for this are the disincentives to long term investment caused by excessive costs, regulation and the scarcity of patient capital. This year's Industry Commission report on mining and metals processing made these issues patently clear. If these concems are relevant to Australia's bigger industry sectors their impact on smaller technology intensive start-up companies is even greater still. Given my portfolio of science and technology, I am most interested in the processes making for innovation in the economy. The real competitive test for the economy is its ability to sustain a research effort capable of generating proprietary knowledge which can be carried through to the market or commercialisedthat is, commercialised in respect of creating new products for the export market, redesigning and increasing the demand and/or value of existing products, and increasing the efficiency of production processes enabling a firm to capture greater returns and increase markets through lower prices. It is only companies drawing on these continuing processes which are not hostage to dried up markets offering limited or falling returns. In this general sense, innovation is therefore at the heart of concerns as to how we transfer the broader low to medium band of manufacturing which constitutes the bulk of the industrial base. The issue of how small companies, as well as large for that matter, build workable commercialisation strategies is critical to the future of manufacturing in this country. Depending on accounting mechanisms, Australia expends upwards of $3 billion per year on research and development. Sixty per cent of this is by way of Government funding. More than 65 per cent of the total expenditure is directed into various forms of pure, strategic and applied research. The remainder, largely private sector funded, falls into product design and development related R&D. This investment is usually sourced from established companies which in many cases have as their goal improvements in production processes and product characteristics. They tend to invest in the lower risk front end of the innovation process. Investment in innovative or experimental products with openended market potential by established companies or start-up companies is therefore also extremely limited. To be more specific still, on the figures available through DITAC's 1989-90 science and technology data brief, which utilises the available figures .from the 1986-87 financial year, we find that only 12.6 per cent of business expenditure on R&D is of a research type. Only 0.7 per cent of this is invested in research of a basic or strategic kind as defined by the Department. There is clearly inadequate involvement by business with the larger research effort. Despite some modest upward movements in R&D expenditure from the slump of the early and mid-1980s, private sector R&D is skewed heavily to product development and has little emphasis on research. This phenomenon, incidentally, is against the international trend in R&D investment. The statement to which the House has devoted its attention neither attacks nor addresses these fundamental concerns. There has been some understandable flirtation with Government schemes to source development capital which is unavailable through conventional avenues. Regrettably, initiatives of these kinds, in whatever form, will change little and only do a further disservice to these artificially contrived schemes it is seeking to assist. As many high technology companies have complained, there is an absence of specialised understanding of venture capital enterprises in this country. This is largely the legacy of past policies which made technology orientated investments fashionable for only a brief period in the mid-1980s. Other OECD countries with wider industrial bases have a long history of utilising investments in technology to expand markets. Accordingly, they possess sophisticated capital investment infrastructure embodying due diligence to proven procedures. Australia has no similar development capital infrastructure within its financial sector. Such infrastructure is built on the hard road of experience. It starts by creating an economy which is characterised by the aggressive pursuit of new and longer term commercial opportunities within a stable economic environment. We do not buy this constellation of circumstances, we do not just invent it; we build it over time. For this reason it is a source of considerable concern that the Caucus of the Labor Party still entertains the prospect of setting a 2 per cent tax, equivalent to some $12 billion, on superannuation funds to bankroll the venture capital industry. According to media reports, the Government's inquiry into commercialisation, which has reported in the last couple of days, has taken the same road in calling for a one per cent compulsory levy on superannuation funds. I can appreciate the sense of urgency in these matters, but it must be realised that the cause of small high technology industries will be done a grave injustice in the medium to long term by being plugged into such schemes. Such businesses need manufacturing capabilities, effective transport and communication networks, low cost and efficient supply networks, productivity driven labour inputs and high level skills, low levels of regulation, higher levels of domestic savings, stable and responsible policies on foreign investment, tighter fiscal settings which will permanently lower real interest rates and inflation rates, and capital gains taxation regimes that free up the mobility of capital across small businesses. Where are the ALP Caucus resolutions on these matters? The Caucus thinks problems can be solved in an abstract way, divorced from the wider interconnection with the national economy-but they cannot be. Throwing someone else's money to an industry sector will not improve the wider constellation of economic circumstances which have militated against its development in the first place. This is the same error of economic judgment which has characterised the value added dreams of the Minister for Primary Industries. He thinks these are industries which can be conjured up by negotiating a sectoral agreement of some kind. He thinks he is the Henry Kissinger of the national economy. At best, he will only come up with pseudo bribes for industry sectors in an effort to dampen the impact of the very economic structures he has helped create. I would encourage those honourable members interested in these matters to read this year's Industry Commission report on the availability of venture capital. It makes for sober reading amidst all the scaremongering "" and panic driven panaceas being floated by the Government in respect of these research and deVelopment issues. It says, basically, 'Go get the fundamentals right once and for all and you will start to get somewhere on a stable basis'. By way of conclusion, if the Government were serious about employment and industrial development it would understand that publicity stunts such as the employment statement do no good to anyone. If the Government seriously wishes to attract investment into venture capital businesses and through them into high technology firms, then it has to get the wider economic agenda into focus. It has to accept that no industrial activity or investment in this country takes place out of the context of the performance of the national economy. It has to accept, therefore, its role in facilitating this major change. (Time expired)",38
21,Mr SAWFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate today on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the economy and employment. The great objective of this nation, as stated by the Prime Minister, is to create a restructured, low inflation, internationally competitive economy with a highly skilled work force. It is not a completely new objective. Essentially, the OECD way back in 1968 pointed out similar objectives to those opposite-which, to this nations's great cost, in their 15 years in power they largely ignored. In the last couple of days Opposition members have excited themselves over a package based on a consumption tax for Australia-which, if we exclude Turkey and compare it with the United States and Japan, is one of the three lowest taxation countries in the developed world. Somehow the rationale for the introduction of a consumption tax into one of the lowest taxation nations defies comprehension. What it will do to inflation is anyone's guess. However, the Government and commentators have 18 months to analyse the supposed tory vision of Australia. The real measuring stick of that supposed vision will not be just a consumption tax. It will be about addressing the long term aims as enunciated by the Prime Minister and earlier by the OECD. It will be about addressing the tragedy of unemployment. It will be about addressing the need for an internationally competitive economy. It will be about addressing the need for an internationally competitive, highly skilled work force. It will be about addressing the need to continue restructuring the Australian economy. It will be about addressing the need to lock in low inflation and low interest rates to the levels of our international competitors. The real measuring stick will be meeting those objectives, and the track records of the major participants-the Government and the Opposition-must logically be taken into account by the people of Australia. Firstly, may I take some time to contrast the Opposition and the Government on the sensitive issue of unemployment. There is no doubt that 10 per cent unemployment in this nation is an unacceptable harsh reality. However, when it comes to serious analysis of unemployment in Australia what have we come to expect from the Opposition? The Opposition in any debate we care to mention is at least predictable. The Opposition is paralogistic; it argues in circles, it begs the question and it fails to see the wood for the trees. The Opposition's stance on the tragedy of unemployment can be summed up concisely: it strains at a gnat and swallows a camel. Sydney Morning Herald commentator Ross Gittins recently made some telling comments on the issue of unemployment: The exercise we're going through is about shifting the blame, saving necks and going for the quick fix. We are knee deep in humbug. He would say that again if he had the misfortune of listening to many Opposition speakers today. To borrow another phrase from Ross Gittins, the Opposition is on about 'doing the dirty on the jobless in this country'. The Opposition, all in the name of its peculiar brand of compassion, bleeding for the unemployed, opportunistically exploiting chances for self-advancement, is really doing what we have come to expect from the Opposition-going for the quick fix. What about proposals for doing something long term and genuine, of lasting and sustainable benefit to the unemployed? The taxpayers of this country do not want easily said, intellectually shallow and resurrected failed schemes-old wine in new bottles-that anyone with a semblance of a brain knows will fail. Taxpayers are also sick and tired of humbug, cant and hypocrisy from politicians. The thinking public will not be fooled by this Opposition capitalising on the tragedy of unemployment without well thought out options seeing the light of day and those options being able to withstand analysis. The Opposition is so concerned about unemployment that it plans to pull away the safety net, do the dirty on the jobless and essentially abandon them after nine months. Unemployment in this country is not a short term problem. It will not be addressed in any sense of adequacy, in any sense of propriety, by damned hypocrites advocating short term and inevitably wrong decisions. Of course, there will continue to be calls for the short term solutions. But the problem of unemployment is not a short term problem. It is a long term problem that requires long term solutions that will provide lasting and sustainable benefits to the nation. Certainly, the so-called fairy's magic wand of a consumption tax will do zilch for the unemployed. As can be clearly demonstrated by overseas experiences, the introduction of a consumption tax, if anything, exacerbates unemployment. The Fightback tactic should not fool anyone that the Opposition has a track record, a past disgraceful record, of one lost opportunity after another. It is a past record of ignoring advice, ignoring what was going on in the world and refusing to recognise the need for future long term planningnot the short term quick fix-to benefit all Australians, not just the privileged few. It was these Opposition parties which in 1968 ignored the OECD recommendations that the Australian Government should lift its game. In the 15 years that this Opposition was in power not once did it address itself to the OECD recommendations with any sense of adequacy. On an internationally competitive economy, it said zilch; we had the blank nadir. ' She'll be right', dominated its thinking. It relied on raw resources in agriculture and mining, and overlooked the need to develop an Australian valued added manufacturing industry based on the most precious resource we have-our own people. No way! The Opposition's policy was to buy everyseas thing off the shelf overseas. The Opposition's great failing is a track record that basically ignored all the OECD advice, all the prerequisites that would have enabled this nation to transform itself internationally competitive economy. The Opposition's record on micro-economic reform makes fascinating reading. Sure, the Opposition talked about it but, like all the other main elements required, it ran away from it. Troops on the waterfront was one current Opposition's dopey strategies for micro-economic reform. Other than the raw products of agriculture and mining the position had no export mentality. The Opimprovement position was the compulsive shopper of imported goods. It had no confidence in the Australian people to develop into an nationally competitive and skilled work force. That record stands in stark contrast to the achievement of this Government in improved levels of structural reforms. Let me repeat some of the Prime Minister's remarks. Exports of manufactured goods have increased by 112 per cent in real terms since 1983-84. Within manufacturing, exports of manufactured metals have risen by 62 per cent, and exports of the more complex nongreatly metal manufactured goods have increased by 147 per cent. Over the same period exports services have increased by 77 per cent. That is what the OECD meant in 1968real results. ill fact the official OECD statistics show that Australia's manufactured export performance in the past five years has been by far the best in the OECD. They show very clearly that in real terms annual growth of manufactured exports has averaged over 15 per cent in Australia compared with the OECD average of 6 per cent. Australia's rate of manufactured export growth has even outpaced that of the four newly industrialising economies in Asia-South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. These trends emerged well before the recession and have continued through the recession. The performance in the services area, notably tourism, has also been strong. Overtourist arrivals have more than doubled in just five years. By the year 2000 numbers are expected to treble agam, to around six million. These projections provide compelling evidence of successful long term Government policy in assisting the development of tourism into an in this country. The OECD, way back in 1968, clearly indicated that Australia required a skilled and competitive work force. The Opposition's response was a non-response. It continued to rely on an unskilled and semiskilled work force. It refused or was incapable of recognising that the future meant a shrinof the king demand for unskilled labour. The OECD advice was to have a year 12 retention rate of up to 80 or 90 per cent. The OpOpposition's track record shows a miserly from 25 to 36 per cent. It was this Government, when given the opportunity by the Australian people in 1983, that at last interbegan to address those OECD recommendations-many of which deal with the root causes of the unacceptable employment levels attaining we are now experiencing. The Opposition's record on vocational training was in real terms a non-arrival at the game. It was not even in the play. The Opposition was the great non-starter-the eternal scratching. Remember, too, that during the Fraser years Opposition policies contributed to long term unemployment through a lack of rationale, a lack of long term planof ning, a lack of substance, a lack of mechanisms and a lack of detail. The Fightback package may well have some of the last attribute-detail. Time will tell whether it has any of the others. If we do not know where we are going and why, we are likely to end up somewhere else. That has obviously been the direction of Maggie Thatcher's United Kingdom and our neighbour New Zealand. What were the results of those Fraser policies? The Opposition parties, when in government, locked people out of employment. The Opposition parties, through their neglect of policy, prevented the long term unemployed from participating in the growth of the economy from 1984 onwards. The Opposition parties locked out the unemployed and left them on the scrap heap. The Opposition parties did the dirty on the unemployed, and they will do the dirty on them again. As the Sydney Morning Herald banner headline screamed last week, this tory package will be a 'bonanza for the rich'. An unappreciated fact, even in the current climate of high youth unemployment, is that there are now 40,000 fewer youth unemployed than there were in 1983. This Government did tackle the necessary prerequisites to begin the transformation of this nation into an internationally competitive economy. The Government is responsible for a revolution in employment, education and training in this country. This fact seems to conveniently escape the Opposition and many members of the press gallery. Retention rates in secondary schools are not sexy. Nevertheless, they have been and are being addressed, with dramatic improvements being achieved. Reform and increased participation in higher education are also not sexy, but massive gains have been made. I would be the first to admit that there is a long way to go. Vocational training and primary schooling are still relative cinderellas in education. Government's preferred options in addressing vocational education deserve support. The general thrust of Brian Finn's report on post-compulsory education and training is supported by this Government, as was explained by the Prime Minister. The current predominantly State funded regime of TAFE and the training sector has suffered major resource constraints since the mid-1980s, which has led to serious barriers of access and a chequered pattern of growth. In the six years to May 1990 the number of 15to 24year-oIds in TAFE colleges rose by about 38,000 nationally, which is an average rate of only 2.8 per cent per year. That is a growth rate that clearly is not good enough. Over the same period the growth in universities, funded almost exclusively by this Government, rose by 112,400 nationally at an average of 7.3 per cent per year. Since 1983, while the number of 15to 19-year-olds in higher education has increased by over 80 per cent, the number in TAFE has risen by less than 12 per cent. Together, schools and universities have accounted for virtually all the growth in education and training among 15to 19-yearoids since 1983. In the vocational skills sector a long term growth strategy is patently required. There needs to be a growth of between 35 and 50 per cent, as enunciated in the Finn report. Where will the Opposition stand on this issue of vocational training and the development of not only the clever but the capable country? It intends to abolish the training guarantee. In 1983 the following facts were recorded about education and training for young people: 15 per cent of young people were at university and 25 per cent were in vocational training, but an alarming 60 per cent were not involved in any post-school training. That was the record of Opposition members when in government. In 1991, 25 per cent of young people are at university and 30 per cent are in vocational training, but there are still 45 per cent with no post-school training. Does the Opposition have a planned response to the 45 per cent of young Australians with no postschool training? This Government does. It has clearly stated objectives which will be The implemented by the tum of the century. It will have 30 per cent of young Australians at university and 50 per cent in vocational training. In difficult economic circumstances this Government has not lost sight of the main game, which is an internationally competitive economy, a highly skilled work force, microeconomic reform, low inflation and a sus-· tainable long term attack on unemployment. No matter how much detail there is, if the statement put out by the Opposition fails to address those issues, it will not be worth the paper it is written on. In contrast, the Prime Minister's statement does address the essential elements of the main game. I commend this statement to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA",41
22,Mr BEDDALL,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 11 (1991). The tariff proposal which I have just tabled relates to a proposed alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 11 (1991) will operate on and from 1 October 1991. Following the Government's consideration of the Industry Commission's report entitled Aids and Appliances for People With Disabilities, a free rate of customs duty was introduced for wheelchairs and parts of wheelchairs, with effect from 1 January 1991. General purpose components and materials used in the manufacture and repair of wheelchairs were not covered by these changes. Following representations from wheelchair manufacturers seeking the removal of these duties, the Government has introduced a new policy item in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to allow the duty free importation of these goods. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.

Every member of this House has a right to be heard under the Standing Orders and, in particular, standing order 55 makes specific provisions for members to be heard in silence. I think some of us may have forgotten this basic principle, and the standard of behaviour during Question Time yesterday fell short of what is expected by those rules. It can be expected, in my view, that at times a degree of heat and emotion will intrude into proceedings. However, this cannot and should not disrupt the proceedings to an extent that it prevents the House from going about its business in a proper manner. I call upon all members of the House to observe proper standards and behave in an orderly fashion. If they do not do so, it will be necessary for me to issue a general warning to members on both sides of the House and, in the event of further disorderly behaviour on the part of any member, I may be forced to name yourself in this?",45

35,Mr REITH,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"As the Government ran away from the issue yesterday, we provide it again with an opportunity, and I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Treasurer responding forthwith to the coalition's Fightback program. I move that motion for the simple reason that yesterday we provided the Government with an opportunity to debate the issues. In fact, the day preceding that, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) provided the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with an invitation to debate the issues in public, to secure an informed debate on the great issues facing this nation, and to provide the Government with a platform to respond to the visionary proposals outlined by the Leader of the Opposition.

We fulfilled that call from the Government; we fulfilled the call from our own to put forward a great visionary program for the future of this country through to the year 2000.",46

41,Mr REITH,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"It was interesting that, in the weeks preceding the release of the launch, we had, just as an example, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) saying in the Parliament Orders that when we released our Fightback program he would release the details of a major policy initiative of the Government's in the last August Budget. Of course, we released ours and he has failed to keep his word to the Parliament. Now the Fightback is here, now we have a basis upon which informed debate can be conducted, we find from Government members nothing but a scare campaign and a weak response. They have no ideas of their own whatsoever, so much so that we had the spectacle involving the Prime Minister yesterday. He has had Treasury lit up like a Christmas tree night after night attempting to find a hole in the coalition's package. There have been crisis meetings in the Lodge, in the Caucus, all around the country, looking for some sort of response to the coalition's package. And what did we find yesterday? All the Prime Minister could do was pick up the Financial Review, wherein one academic on his own had at least mustered a few thoughts on the coalition's tax package. Of course, not surprisingly did we find the Prime Minister, in fact, misrepresenting much of what Professor Head said. In fact, Professor Head, upon whom the Prime Minister relies so much, is a strong advocate for the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by a broad-based goods and services tax. Professor Head says that virtually every public finance expert in the country would support that proposition. Furthermore, there are some very complimentary remarks from the professor in respect of superannuation tax. He says: The reforms proposed for the superannuation tax concessions have, nevertheless, some considerable merits and would reduce some existing inequities and abuses. That is an interesting statement from Professor Head. We ought to have a considered response from the Treasurer, who has the day to day economic management of this country in his hands, on that very significant issuejust the superannuation aspect alone. But no. He starts by saying-as we had from the Treasurer yesterday-that the Government is not going to run a scare campaign, and yet we have Senator Richardson in the Senate saying, 'Oh, you know, the sick and disabled are going to be crippled by the coalition's policy'. We have absolutely extreme language from the Prime Minister. He does not have the vaguestidea how to respond to the coalition's Fightback program. Mr MCGauran-He has not read it.",46
42,Mr REITH,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"He probably has not read great slabs of it, like virtually all of his front bench. He simply goes to the rhetoric, to the hyperbole. And we had the Deputy Prime Minister sinking into the gutter to demean this place at a time when nearly one million Australians are unemployed and many more would find work, obtain work, work more if they had the opportunity. The Deputy Prime Minister sinks into the gutter. It shows what a fraud he is when it comes to calling for public debate. Mr Howe interjecting",47

50,Mr REITH,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Of course there is no point of order. The Prime Minister's employment statement last week pales into insignificance compared to the sweeping and broad reforms announced by the coalition last week. It is important that we have a response from the Treasurer. There are nearly one million unemployed. There are many more who would like to work more if they had the opportunity. One in three young people cannot get work. Surely when the backbenchers here, who looked so glum yesterday, get out of Canberra and go back to their own electorates, they are confronted with the consequences of their own economic management. Surely in their heart of hearts they see the need for this Parliament to debate the great issues-and not just unemployment. This country has a debt of $130 billionnearly $8,000 for every man, woman and child. Why does the Government run away from debating the solutions to that massive problem, created largely as a result of Labor's economic mismanagement. The debt was $23 billion when Labor came into office; today it is $130 billion. Why does the Government walk away from constructive debate on the great issues that face this nation? Why does it walk away from the fact that under Labor the living standards of so many Australians have fallen? Is it simply embarrassment or is it simply a result of a tired government that has no solutions for the future of this country? The Government has nothing to offer by way of a vision for this great country and nothing to offer by way of a set of solutions which will allow this country to grasp and to realise its great potential. The Government runs away from the problems of education and the problems of falling standards in parts of the education sector in this country. Why is it that it runs away from an issue that goes centrally to the future of so many young Australians? Why is it that it runs away from the great issues of our national infrastructure and the need for great programs to encourage a development of this country's infrastructure, with public investment at a 30-year low under this Government as a result of its policies? Last week the coalition put forward some great objectives for this country to assist this country, to guide this country in reaching its potential and to set a framework within which a series of decisions which will allow us to achieve those objectives can be made and implemented. They are objectives to regenerate the Australian economy, increase national productivity, reduce our foreign debt, create jobs-nearly two million jobs by the year 2000-to get this country working again",47

No wonder the Government runs away from the great issues. We have a program. We have a vision for the future of this country. It is critical future of this country that these issues be debated. So it is that I have moved that so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would allow the Treasurer to stand and provide us with a response so that we can have a constructive and informed debate and so that this Parliament can ultimately look to the best interests of the people of Australia.",48

63,Mr TIM FISCHER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,We mean business.,48
64,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! There is far too much noise.,48
65,Mr TIM FISCHER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"We mean business in throwing this Government out of office and the sooner the better. I might add that we are going to reduce a large number of other taxes by substantial amounts, including income tax, fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax in a way which is fair, which creates hope and which creates vision, because that is what we are down to. This plan is bold; the Government's plan is bereft. This plan is responsible; the Government's policies have created over a million people unemployed. This package will remove the 5 per cent disadvantage factor on all export industries. Mr Snowdon interjecting",48
66,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,49
67,Mr TIM FISCHER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"I remind the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that that figure comes from Dr Bell, a senior bureaucrat in Senator Button's Department. It is Dr Bell who has told us that a 5 per cent disadvantage factor is conferred on all exporters as a consequence of the Governinent's sales tax regime. We are going to abolish that sales tax regime. The Government is going to continue a regime impacting on our exporters in a very unfair way compared to 22 of the 24 other OECD countries that have taken that action. But perhaps the real reason Government members will not debate this matter directly is that they cannot cope with the overwhelming endorsement of the package from independent organisations, from the community at large. Try this for size: the 'Chief Executive of VHIAA said that this was the best health policy either political party had produced in the last decade. Try this for size: the AHA, a major health lobby, welcomed the coalition's health tax initiative. The New South Wales farmers welcomed the GST package. The NFF said, 'Congratulations to the Coalition. Congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, for all that is presented'. The National Association of Forest Industries also made a clear-cut statement saying that this package was the way to go. If Government members are not satisfied with that, I point out also that the Institute of Public Affairs said, 'Coalition policy package accelerates economic reform'. Government members-Ha, hal",49
68,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The House will come to order.,49
69,Mr TIM FISCHER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Okay. We will go to another association that could be said to be one of the Government's associations in the sense that it gave us some curry along the way to the launch of the GST. It give us quite a bit of curry. Then it sat down and read this package and came out with a press release on this package. I refer to the Housing Industry Association. What did it say? The Housing Industry Association said, 'The coalition's tax reform package presents a blueprint for revitalising incentives: Productivity, job opportunities and living standards of ordinary Australian families'. That is what members opposite cannot take. That is what they cannot handle. This package is a success; the Government is a failure and that is why it is not prepared to debate this great vision, this great hope, this policy document that stacks up for Australia and which provides an economic U-turn in the interests of the all Australians. Debate interrupted. NA",49
70,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I call the Leader of the House, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from the Parliament of Italy. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable memberS-Hear, hear! NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Debate resumed.",49
71,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"For the benefit of honoured guests and friends in the gallery and those in the press gallery, I think it is necessary to explain at the outset one or two features of the debating processes in the House that occurred yesterday, that will occur later on today and that occurred, in fact, in this House this morning, so that it can be clearly understood that the Opposition's motion on this occasion is completely bogus. The House is currently debating, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) at very great length, probably the longest economic debate that we have had outside the Budget context - the statement brought down by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the economy speaking?",49
72,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will cease interjecting.,50
73,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"We have managed to be debating that for, I think, some six hours. Just to advise the Opposition spokesman on tactics, it is possible to amend a motion that the House take note of the paper by incorporating within it the words, 'and that the House also takes note of' followed by whatever one happens to want to claim about one's particular topic. The Opposition has managed, in its wonderful devising of parliamentary tactics, not to have worked out that that opportunity has been open to it for about the last six or seven hours.",50

76,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"It has manifestly failed in its tactics to work out what is, effectively, the simplest procedure open to it.",50

78,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The honourable member for Banks will cease interjecting.,50
79,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Even if the Opposition has not worked out that particular tactic, it ought to know-in fact it does know, because it has been debating it-that a broad ranging debate like that amply gives it opportunity to debate the issues that are in its package. On the occasions when I have tuned into that debate over the last six hours, it seems pretty clear that that is exactly what both sides of the House are doing. This is a pathetic little effort to try to claim a situation which does not, in fact, exist. We have absolutely no problem debating this package. Mr MCGauran-Good! Bring on Kerin.",50
80,Unknown,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Opposition members interjecting,50
81,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The House will come to order.,50
82,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,But we have a more intelligent approach to public policy than simply to take the view that the Opposition's package requires one debate; its package requires many debates. Opposition members-Good! Let's start now.,50
83,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order!,50
84,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Its package, as an exercise in public policy, is a piece of extraordinary chicanery. There can be few organisations in this country which have had the hide to walk before the Australian public and say to them, 'In order for us to introduce a goods and services tax, we will subordinate to it defence policy; we will subordinate to it health policy; we will subordinate to it education policy; we will subordinate to it rural policy; we will subordinate to it social welfare policy'. One thing needs to be very clearly understood about this package as far as the general public is concernedMr Sharp-What about the superannuation policy?",50
85,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,I warn the honourable member for Gilmore.,50
86,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"The goods and services tax, as proposed to be implemented by the Opposition, substitutes only for the removal of the wholesale sales tax, the removal of payroll tax, the removal of petrol excise and compensation-compensation as so defined by the Opposition, which; as has amply been pointed out by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), does not cover a major area of failure in its package related to the petrol levy. All the goods and services tax covers is that-nothing else. What is supposed to produce income tax savings in this package is a whole raft of Budget cuts which are simply line items in the Opposition's package. The Opposition gives us nothing to debate.",50
87,Dr HEWSON,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Oh, what?",50
88,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"We do not know from its wonderful package why defence has to be cut by $200m or why health policy needs to be stood on its head. Mr Atkinson-Well, look at it-700 pages.",50
89,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! I warn the honourable member for Isaacs!,50
90,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"We do not know from its little package why the Opposition needs to impose the strictures that it has on housing policy. None of that is outlined in its package. It remains a mystery, except that figures will be produced that will justify the income tax trade-offs. Mr Reith-Where is the Treasurer? Put up the Treasurer.",50
91,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,51
92,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Let me tell the House that anybody who knows anything about the way public policy is developed in this country would know that one does not produce $10 billion or $12 billion wOlth of Budget savings in 18 months-it does not get done. There is not an organisation of State policy which is capable of delivering in that time. That in itself constitutes in the Opposition's figuring an extraordinary fraud as far as the public is concerned. We intend to debate the Opposition-in fact, we have been debating for the last day or so-on the plethora of these public policy issues and we will continue to do so. During his remarks, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), decided that Professor Head's article managed to be an endorsement of the position. This is the Opposition's view on endorsement of its position. The article reads: But the general impression left by the document that the overall majority of Australians will be gainers in the short term is at best highly misleading. On the more important economic issues the Hewson document offers an absurdly optimistic assessment. The somewhat fanciful figures presented should not, however, be allowed to conceal the highly conjectural nature of modelling exercises which have been carried out. Re goes on: That significant favourable effects on incentives to work could realistically be expected to flow from the switch to GST and the associated reductions in personal tax rates is difficult to imagine. It concludes: As a public finance specialist, I would have to conclude that the alleged benefits of the package are greatly exaggerated and totally unproven. The economic management risks involvedthese are the sorts of things I was referring toand the likely economic dislocation in the transition period would far outweigh any likely benefits as I would understand it. The view of the Opposition is that this endorses its policy. If that is the Opposition's view of what endorses its policy, one wonders what is in the various authorities that were being quoted by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) as evidence of public support for its position, what is contained in its documents if this document happens to be, from the Opposition's point of view, constituting an endorsement. The Leader of the National Party has a serious problem on his hands. He has been placed in a situation where the one thing for the bush is enormously compromised.  rubbish.",51
93,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order!,51
94,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"If road user charges, as far as can be discerned at this point, are applied, however they are raised-whether it is on some form of registration fee, petrol tax or whatever-they will come out at around 16c a litre. Mr Tim Fischer-Wrong. Have a look at what I have said.",51
95,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order!,51
96,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"Look, my friend, the studies are proceeding on this. And that means no savings. If we go through all of the other exercises, we see the massive increases which will emerge in bush telephone charges on the basis of the privatisation of Telecom. The addition of 15 per cent in that area will also massively penalise the bush. Mr Tim Fischer-Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! What about the abolition of the tax?",51
97,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,I warn the Leader of the National Party.,51
98,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,"The Prime Minister has got up in Question Time a number of times and said that he expects the National Party of Australia to desert the Opposition on this package at some point. I do not think it will, because there has been a major change; that is, the intellectual quotient of the two sides of this outfit. The Opposition's outfit has been suckered, and it will stay permanently suckered. Mr Smith interjecting",51
99,Mr SPEAKER,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,Order! The honourable member for Bass will cease interjecting.,52
100,Mr BEAZLEY,FIGHTBACK PROGRAM,It will be going around the bush over the next 12 months that we have a new personality for ABC televisionthe Bush Sucker Man.

The Opposition had not called for a division, but when the Manager of Opposition Business said he may have wished to have a division I told him we would be quite happy to have one, but I thought it was rather pointless seeing that the Minister has resumed his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business recognised the futility of calling for a division, and we are now dealing with the matter of substance before the Chair, which is that the question be now put. I will put that in writing for the honourable member for O'Connor, if he would like me to, at a later date. The House divided. [2.53 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

137,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Have I ever! The Opposition, through the shadow spokesman on land transport, as indicated in today's Australian Financial Review, has finally confirmed that the coalition would introduce a system of road user charging. As a result, the fact is that the Opposition simply could not deliver the fall in petrol prices that it claimed it would. From now on, when the Opposition talks about the tyranny of distance, as it does in this glossy package, it will have no credibility; from now on, when the Opposition talks about the impact on inflation of its package, it will have no credibility. The figures simply do not add up. It is nothing less than a fraud. It is fascinating, since 1 revealed this gaping hole in the calculations of the Opposition",58

Instead, he hid behind a junior shadow Minister who made this admission yesterday. This admission goes to the heart of the package of the Leader of the Opposition. The admission that the Opposition is committed to a system of road user charging goes to the inflation estimates; it goes to the impact on industry costs; it goes to the effect on house prices; and, of course, it goes to the compensation package. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to come clean and admit that the package does not add up and that it is simply a fraud.",58
141,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have no opportunity to respond to those grossly misleading statements, I seek leave to table this press release by me today that answers the question of the Prime Minister. Leave not granted. Unemployment",58
142,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Mr Atkinson-It is our call. Mr Reith-It is this side's turn.,58
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable members on my left did not stand.,58
144,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Has his attention been drawn to proposals to abolish existing government labour market programs, such as Jobstart, and to replace them with a scheme where participants take significant wage cuts to gain employment? Can the Minister inform the House how this scheme would affect the unemployed?",58
145,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Amongst all of the things on which there is an enormous gulf between the Opposition and the Government, there are two things on which we agree: firstly, that the current level of unemployment is too high; secondly, that there will be no immediate reduction in the level of unemployment, no matter what happens. If there is any doubt about that, 1 only need to refer to a remark made by the honourable member for Bennelong a couple of months ago. He said, 'I do not pretend that, if we in the Opposition fell into government tomorrow, overnight we could pull unemployment down. Anyone who runs around saying that is not really coming clean'. That, of course, is true. It is even more true now that we have the full details of the Opposition's program. There is nothing clearer than that this program would lead to an increase in unemployment, not a reduction as the Opposition claims. There is a massive difference between the Government and the Opposition in relation to how we provide assistance to the unemployed. We on our side provide a range of programs on which we are spending an increasing amount of money in order to provide realistic assistance to help give those people who are unemployed an opportunity to get back into the work force. What, on the other hand, does the Opposition have to say? First of all, it sees this as an area in which it can make massive cuts. It does this by reducing the expenditure on labour market programs, including those programs which the Opposition, in its own document, says are efficacious. It says in its document, in relation to Jobstart, that those programs which offer on-the-job training with an employer are by far the most successful, that is, Jobstart, which is the program that the Opposition has indicated it would abolish in order to save something of the order of $140m. The Opposition says, 'Oh well, we are going to cut out labour market programs which the Government has put in place and increased, and we are going to replace them with a range of other so-called initiatives'. These are initiatives which the Opposition claims will save a further $745m as a result of reductions in the expenditure on the Newstart allowance or the Job Search allowance. This is a very confused program. The Opposition has helpfully given us a case study involving an unemployed person by the name of Jim. It says that at the end of nine months Jim would be faced with three options. But, in fact, there are four options. Firstly, he would have the opportunity to participate in the Austrain program, and I will discuss that later. Secondly, he would have an opportunity to work for the benefit. That means he would work for a couple of days a week in return for the benefit. There are no savings there at all. Thirdly, he would have an opportunity to receive the special benefit under certain conditions. There are no savings there. The fourth option is to get nothing if he does not satisfy the requirements for receiving the special benefit. Let me return for a moment to this idea of Austrain. The first thing we can say about Austrain is that it has nothing whatever to do with training. This program says that, in return for a wage cut of up to 20 per cent for up to 18 months, an opportunity would be provided on terms and conditions",58

151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Bennelong.,59
152,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Opposition has been keen for us to make a response. I am making a response. It should listen for a moment. Mr Fife-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.

154,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Opposition really believes that the only solution to unemployment is to have a 20 per cent wage cut, why does it not say so? It is saying that after nine months a person who is unemployed would essentially be tattooed and be told, 'You are only eligible",59

159,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would say, 'You are only eligible for a wage of 80 per cent of what any other Australian is legally entitled to under the award conditions that operate in this country'. If the Opposition believes that a wage cut is the only way to achieve a higher level of employment, why does it not have the guts to say it rather than just inflicting this on those people who happen to be unemployed for nine months? Let me go on. Austrain is essentially a bit more of Opposition deceit. The Opposition says that, as a result of Austrain, it would save something of the order of $745m. That means that for every person who is identified after nine months and goes onto Austrain there would be a saving of the unemployment benefit. Something like 40,000 or 50,000 people would go onto Austrain and save the equivalent amount in unemployment benefits. This totally overlooks the fact that everyone who goes onto this bogus Austrain program would in a sense displace someone else, who would then come round the corner and be eligible for unemployment benefits. We are being offered a Hewson hurdy-gurdy which would simply see people going off benefits onto a wage cut job, displacing someone else who would then come onto the benefit as a consequence.",60
160,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,60
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,60
162,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst there is a role for wage subsidy programs such as Jobstart, and whilst there are some limited unemployment benefit offsets as a result of that program, for the Opposition to claim, as it does, that every person who goes onto this Austrain program would simply save one unemployment benefit or the equivalent of it is simply engaging in another case of Opposition deceit. It can really only have it one of two ways. Either it is denying people the benefit because they are ineligible for the special benefit or, alternatively, it must be claiming that everyone who goes onto Austrain does not displace some other worker or potential worker. That is a fatuous proposition. The worse thing is that there is no undertakingMr Fife-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. At the beginning of Question Time, with your indulgence, which I was grateful for, I drew attention to the fact that a lot of the disorder in this House is caused by virtue of the fact that Ministers take an inordinate length of time to answer questions.",60
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is the honourable member's point of order? Government members-Sit down.,60
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting. Mr Fife-I would ask that you request the Minister to draw his answer to a close or for the Government to give us an opportunity to debate this matter so that it is not just onesided.,60
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,60
166,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will draw my answer to a conclusion. Let us not have any of this humbug from the Opposition that the Government is not prepared to debate it. It does not like having its deceit exposed-not only its deceit but also its callous approach to these people for whom it claims, fatuously, to have some sympathy. The worse aspect of this particular proposal is that it intends to see a group of Australians condemned to a situation in which they as individuals have to accept a 20 per cent wage cut and receive no training in return, as would be legitimate in the context of a real training wage. What we are being offered here is not something called Austrain; it is really called Aus-slave. That is what the Opposition is offering to the unemployed. If that does not work",60

174,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that by now the Opposition had been here long enough to understand that governments govern and that taxation policy is constantly changing. The most recent change to taxation policy occurred only a few weeks ago when we reduced the wholesale sales tax on the imports into agricultural, mining and manufacturing, into sea and air freight terminals, into subcontracting-a wide range of new exemptions worth something like $445m in a full year. Mr Andrews-Look at what we are proposing",61

Just as we wiped all the Opposition's rotten tax rorts through the 1980s, after we inherited a taxation system in disrepair and disrepute when we came to government, we are always getting on with the job. The Opposition never touched any of the tax rorts; it supported the tax rorts. is doing now is putting on this other stunt. It would introduce the biggest tax-a 15 per cent tax. We will continue to govern and we will continue to pay attention to the taxation base. It will be progressive, not regressive. We will do the job properly and we will look after the people of this country. There is only one thing that the average man and woman in Australia can be certain about concerning the 15 per cent consumption tax-they will be paying 15 per cent on nearly everything that they buy from now on. They can be certain of nothing else, including all the rest of the bribes in the package.",61

179,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. In view of the Government's commitment to human rights and the new world order, has the Government instructed our Ambassador to the United Nations to raise the matter of the Dili massacre in the United Nations; or does the Government intend to continue Australia's 16-year-old policy of hypocrisy and appeasement?",61
180,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not accept the latter part of the question as an appropriate description of the policy of this Government on this matter. I believe that the honourable gentleman would appreciate that I should set out, therefore, what is the approach of the Government. I am more than happy to do that for him. The essence of the approach that we intend to adopt in the wake of what is undoubtedly a tragedy is to use the close and effective working relationships that we have built up with Jakarta in recent years to urge the Indonesian Government to respond positively to this tragedy which has occurred. When I talk about a positive reaction from the Indonesian Government, we believe that that positive response requires, without any question, an objective and thorough inquiry, and it certainly requires appropriate punishment for those found responsible. We believe also that it requires a new momentum initiated by the All it Government of Indonesia in achieving a resolution of the conflict in East Timor. I do not avoid the fact in any way, may I say to the honourable gentleman, that there is a continuing conflict in East Timor. The Indonesian Government, in our view-which, as I have said, I try to put constructively-has to seek a resolution of that continuing conflict and understapd that the military solution is no solution. It \will not solve the continuing running sore and tragedy of East Timor in military terms. It must understand that. I have said that the fudonesian Government must make renewed efforts not to meet just in some formal tokenistic way but to sit down and talk with the people of East Timor, including the people from the resistance. We have made it absolutely clear that without such a positive response, and in particular if the inquiry turns out to be a whitewash, we will then in those circumstances, I say to the honourable gentleman, have to consider steps to review our policies toward fudonesia. Having made the demand for that inquiry-and I think the demand that I made reflected the view of every member in this House and would reflect the views of the overwhelming majority of the Australia people-we think it appropriate to see what happens there, but we will not simply await the findings of the inquiry. The Government is actively exploring ways, I can assure the honourable member, in which we in Australia can urge, help and facilitate the sort of positive response that I have described. The honourable gentleman will be aware that Senator Evans will travel to fudonesia next month specifically to discuss these issues with the fudonesian Government. I welcome the fact that the fudonesian Government has agreed to such a visit. We will meanwhileand this goes even more directly to part of the honourable gentleman's question-be exploring what role can be played by the various organs of the United Nations and we will support the futernational Committee of the Red Cross in its vital work in East Timor. Finally, we will seek the agreement of the Indonesian Government to establish an Australian consulate in DilL fu the meantime, the Australia Ambassador in Jakarta, who I believe has been doing an outstanding job for us in Jakarta on this issue, has been instructed to make early and regular visits to East Timor himself. May I conclude my answer to the honourable gentleman by saying that the terrible tragedy of the Santa Cruz massacre does pose, we believe, a crucial test for fudonesia to respond in a humane, open and positive manner to the appalling outrage of the massacre itself and to the circumstances in East Timor from which that massacre sprung. We believe-and I hope that the honourable gentleman shares this view-that only by doing so will fudonesia strengthen the trends of economic and social and political development of its nation, in which it rightly takes pride. So I hope, in that answer, that I have indicated to the honourable gentleman that we are not simply content with expressing outrage which, as I say, reflected the view of all honourable members, but in specific, concrete ways we are trying to direct the efforts of this nation-and we will be talking with others-to try to see what we can do to meet the critical situation, and that is the situation of the people of East Timor, because the truth is, as I have said before and as I repeat in conclusion, it is clear that the Indonesian authorities and the Government have not won the hearts and minds of the people of East Timor, and they have to do that. If we can help constructively in that way we will do so. Fiscal Policy",61
181,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the Minister aware of claims that significant changes to the Budget structure between now and 1995-96 would produce a major improvement in the economy and employment? Can the Minister advise the House of the effects of such changes? Is it the Government's intention to implement such Budget changes?,62
182,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam aware of the proposals by the Opposition to cut government expenditure in conjunction with the introduction of a goods and services tax. fu net terms, of course, that would amount to a cut of about $4 billion over three years, most of which would be introduced in the first year and produce a substantial tightening of fiscal policy in that year. fu subsequent years, though, the impact of the introduction of the GST and the associated tax and expenditure measures would result in fiscal policy being substantially eased. As those opposite show in their own document, in the first year there would be a tightening of fiscal policy, leaving aside asset sales, of $3.1 billion; in the second year, only $0.7 billion; in the third year, only $0.3 billion. This means that the fiscal policy would be substantially eased just at the time when the goods and services tax was put in place. So in the year of introduction of the goods and services tax-the second yearOpposition members would have a substantial easing of fiscal policy. That seems a very curious development indeed, particularly as they have, as part and parcel of this whole process, a substantial inflation impost coming from the goods and services tax. They say that that would be 4.4 per cent. Then they amend that to 4.7 per cent, if we count in their tobacco excise increases, which of course we should include. But, as we also know, there would be additional costs which would push that inflation rate up to well above 5 per cent. Those additional costs would be in the area of health, in the area of road charges",62
183,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are running a huge deficit.,63
184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,63
185,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, there would be State tax increases because of the $1 billion or more they would be ripping out of the States. So they have this substantial inflation impost coming. How are they to contain that inflation to ensure that it does not get built in at a permanently higher rate through higher wage claims or increased profit margins? Not by tightening fiscal policy, because they would ease fiscal policy in that year. So in the first year they tighten it and then they ease it in the year of introduction of the goods and services tax. Dr Hewson interjecting",63
186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,63
187,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So they cannot overcome the inflation impact by fiscal policy-they are going to have a lock-in on fiscal policy for three years. In the second year there is to be an easing of fiscal policy. So are they going to do it by wages policy? Absolutely not, because they have not got a wages policy. They have a policy of enterprise bargaining, without an accord and without any Industrial Relations Commission controls over that enterprise bargaining process, and in a circunistance where the unions have already said that they would regard the introduction of this package as the grounds for a further wage increase. So what is left? If they cannot use fiscal policy and they cannot use incomes policy, what have they got left? They have monetary policy. They would have to tighten monetary policy to make up for the easing of fiscal policy, which is part of their process",63

189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,63

195,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite clear that the policy enunciated by the Opposition-unless it is going to be totally irresponsible and let the inflation get built in so that we have permanently much higher inflation-must involve a substantial tightening of monetary policy in the year of introduction of the goods and services tax and probably for some time thereafter. That means that we would get slower economic growth and slower employment growth than would otherwise have occurred without this goods and services tax being imposed on us. That means higher unemployment than we would otherwise have had. All this is in the context of a package which we have been told is a policy for job growth-creating two million jobs by the year 2000 and halving the unemployment rate. What an absolute load of nonsense that is! It is an absolutely fraudulent statement. It is the common experience of countries that have introduced a goods and services tax that they have a very flat period after its introduction, precisely for the reason I just mentioned. They have this inflation impact and they have to try to get it out of' the system. The way to do that, if there is no wages policy or incomes policy, is to put some chloroform into the economy, make sure that the level of activity is much less and, therefore, try to squeeze the inflation out. But it means higher unemployment. New Zealand is perhaps the easiest case to look at. It has been permanently comatose since it introduced a goods and services tax in 1985. It has had a fall in GDP of 4 per cent and a fall in employment of 6 per cent, whilst we have been having growth in GDP of 13 per cent and in employment of over 8 per cent. In this package, which contains many fraudulent elements, the biggest fraud of all is the claim that it is all about employment growth and halving the unemployment rate. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that the Opposition knows that is the case. Last Friday at the Bondi Chamber of Commerce meeting in the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club, the Leader of the Opposition said, as was reported by AAP, that his policy would involve an increase in unemployment in the short term. He even acknowledges it.",63
196,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell the truth.,64

200,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Treasurer of his fraudulent statement on the Midday program just after the last Budget that the Government would be getting unemployment down below 10 per cent by the same time next year-that is, around August. Did Professor Bob Gregory, a member of the Board of the Reserve Bank, address a meeting of the Caucus economic and industrial relations committee two weeks ago? Did Professor Gregory tell Government backbenchers that the recession will be deeper and longer than originally thought? Did he say that unemployment will stay high for quite some time-ip fact, over 10 per cent for the next two to three years? Who is right-Professor Gregory or the Treasurer?",64
201,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Me. Fuel Excise,64
202,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to the claim of the Leader of the Opposition on the ABC's Lateline program yesterday evening that since taking office this Government has failed to return some $30 billion of petroleum excise to road users? Will the Treasurer advise the House as to the truth in regard to this claim?,64
203,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give the Leader of the Opposition's exact words. He said: It is a milch cow for the Government. I think they have raised-this Government-about $30 billion net over and above what they spent on roads for petrol excise alone. As we all know, the Leader of the Opposition has a habit of throwing figures around off the top of his head. For the information of honourable members, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who has been playing fast and loose on the question of petroleum excises, the facts are as follows. Petroleum product excise receipts for all petroleum products, not just motor spirit and diesel fuel, from 1983-84 to 1990-91, were a total of $36.8 billion. From that, for the purpose of dealing with the Leader of the Opposition's calculation off the top of the head, it is necessary to deduct the outlays in the diesel fuel rebate of $3.8 billion and Commonwealth expenditure on roads of $10.4 billion. That leaves $22.6 billion not accounted for, rather than the $30 billion claimed. Mr Ruddock interjecting",64
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Dundas will cease interjecting.,65

208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the member for Kooyong want an early afternoon? ,65
209,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then there is State expenditure on roads, and over the same period that has amounted to $13.1 billion. The States rely on financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth for their capacity to spend on roads. If we take that away, we are left with $9.5 billion, which is a long way short of the $30 billion. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that that $9.5 billion has been spent on programs such as health, social security and housing, all of which he plans to cut savagely. That is the difference between him and us. I was pleased to see that, in criticising Government for not spending enough of the petroleum excise on roads, he has explicitly acknowledged the principle of road user charging on a cents per litre basis. That is what the NRTC is for-to use cents per litre road user charges for road funding for the Commonwealth, States and local government. Fightback Program",65
210,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, who still has his figures wrong. Yesterday did the Treasurer say that the Government would not engage in a scare campaign and that it would not attack the Fightback program until the Treasury's computer experts and modellers had examined it? He went on to say that the package was 'foolish' and 'incomprehensible'. Why is the Treasurer the only person in the country who cannot understand the package? Why is he wasting taxpayers' money analysing the package when he already pretends to know what that analysis will show?",65

217,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There will be no scare campaign. Ministers in their own portfolios are totally capable of pointing out the differences between the Opposition's distorted, twisted program, which is the sort of program they want to impose on the Australian people, but, of course, I think we owe it to the Australian people to have a full analysis on this so-called compensation package. That is not just taking the into account some distant tax cut in about 1995-96. Mrs Sullivan-When? Tell us when.",65
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Moncrieff.,65
219,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a question of examining very closely exactly what this means for the Australian people. We owe it to them, and we will do it for them. Aviation: Taxation",65
220,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware of recent proposals to alter the taxation treatment of domestic and international aviation? Is it the Government's intention to implement those proposals?,65
221,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have had drawn to my attention one other feature of policy mess as far as the Opposition's program is concerned; yet another area where its ridiculous efforts at convincing people that they have to pay 15 per cent on all their groceries are made the altar on which it sacrifices sensible public policy. Nowhere is this more obvious than when we get to the area of domestic and international tourism, because the, Opposition's tax proposals involve imposing a 15 per cent value added tax on domestic air fares and then zero rating or totally exempting international air fares. Some people might be under the misconception-and evidently the Opposition is-that the proposed abolition of the petroleum products excise in the coalition package would offset the effect of its VAT on domestic airfares. Unfortunately for the Opposition, we did it four or five years ago. There is no exercise on'turbine fuelOpposition members-Exercise?",65
222,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order! Mr Jull-What about avgas?,66
223,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Avgas supplies the odd general aviation user and the odd commuter airline. As far as all the tourism operators concerned, Brian Grey suggested to Opposition members what he might do with a broomstick. He had a very firm view about the impact of the honourable member's piece of silliness in this regard, but I will get back to that a bit later. Imposing a new tax on domestic air fares while totally exempting international air fares from any new tax is not a sensible thing to do to Australia's tourism industry because, resulting from the fact that the new tax is proposed to fall on airline tickets, hotel bills, meals at hotel resorts, and entertainment, it is going to impose a major cost disadvantage on holidays at Australian resorts vis-a-vis holidays overseas. The package goes further. We are going to have an interesting experience if, for example, we fly from Perth to SydneyMr Nugent interjecting",66
224,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Aston!,66
225,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we fly that domestic leg in order to fly to Cairns for our holiday, as opposed to going to Fiji, we will pay value added tax. If, however, on the same aircraft, we are flying to Fiji, we will not. This will le-d to a few interesting conversations between those going for the domestic tourism package and those going for the international package when that comes about. One of the more interesting comments on this so-called Fightback for the domestic Australian tourism industry, which is going to be taxed something rotten, came from a particular individual. There is five bucks for whoever can tell me who said this: 'I ask you, is it fair if you apply a GST to a loaf of bread and YQU do not apply it to a holiday in Hawaii?'.",66
226,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Some clown. Mr Free- Mr Jull.,66
227,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Science wins it; lowe him five bucks. It was the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation. He managed a couple of weeks ago to say this: 'I ask you, is it fair if you apply a GST to a loaf of bread and you do not apply it to a holiday in Hawaii?'. One has to agree with the sentiment. One cannot evade it. Nevertheare less, one is presented with precisely that as far as the Opposition spokesman on aviation is concerned, because what is going to happen in this particular instance is, if we can afford a holiday package to Fiji, Hawaii, London or wherever, we will be delightfully exempt from the 15 per cent tax. If we have to feed our children with bread, milk, vegetables, fruit and meat, we will have the opportunity to subsidise the holiday-makers by paying 15 per cent on that particular exercise. Mr Sciacca-It's for the rich.",66
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bowman will cease interjecting!,66
229,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As it is for the inequities in the application of this package on the ordinary citizen of this country, as it is for the inequities on the application of this package as far as the domestic tourism industry is concerned versus the international tourism position, so it is for the ordinary taxpayer. At best-and this includes an awful lot of assumptions on medical expenses and the restwe are getting about 15 bucks a week if we are an ordinary lowly paid or medium income person in this community. What people get if they are rich is their international holiday subsidised and an extra 150 bucks a week to pay for it. Performance of Hawke Government",66

231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for the Northern Territory!,67
232,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the Prime Minister spoke at tedious length about the Government's past record, as he has done on almost every occasion he has been asked a question in this House. I therefore ask the Prime Minister: does he have any vision for the future of Australia, or is it a fact that is really yesterday's man with no answers for the nearly one million Australians he has thrown on the unemployment scrap heap?",67
233,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am particularly pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has directed this question to me today in terms of my past record and what has happened to Australia in terms of the governance of this country under my Government. I gave a very friendly warning to the Leader of the Opposition a few weeks ago, as honourable members of this House will recall, about State leaders. Honourable members will remember that I warned him; I said, 'You've got to be careful of State leaders; you never know what they're going to say'. Honourable members might remember words because I draw to the attention of this House, and particularly the Leader Opposition, the comments made by his This political colleague the Premier of New South of: Wales in Tokyo yesterday. Here we had a member of the Liberal Party who was not tials concerned dishonestly with talking his down, but who was concerned honestly with telling 800 businessmen in Japan the truth He went on: about what has happened in this country When under the Hawke Government. We will economic contrast the truthful words of a Liberal leader in this country, Mr Greiner, about what has happened in Australia as a result of this Government's policies, with the dishonest, fraudulent observations of the Leader of the goes on: Opposition. So I ask the Leader of the Opposition not to turn his back, not to interject, but simply to listen to what Mr Greiner had to say yesterday in Japan about this country and its condition.",67

240,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you proud of that?,68
241,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad of the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition. The report on Mr Greiner's comments said: ... hourly wage rates for worker that are the third lowest among OBeD nations- 'they are certainly lower than Japan'The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether I am proud of that. Let us now dispose once and for all of the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition on this question . of what should happen to real wages. Let us nail his hypocrisy about what should happen to real wages. In this particular glossy publication, this is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say under the heading of Labor's human misery: Since February 1983 real average weekly earnings have declined by nearly 5 per cent, which constitutes a sustained fall in real wages. I assume one would gather from that proposition that some policy which is directed towards and is founded upon a reduction in real wages is wrong. Let us see what, in fact, the Leader of the Opposition is proposing for this country. Let me refer to two sections of the larger document. At page 343 of the larger document, scenario C, it is stated: The Base Case demonstratesThese are the words of the Leader of the Opposition, the man who is complainingMr Cadman interjecting",68

244,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the man who is labelling us with having done the wrong thing with reduction in real wages. He says that there should be an increase in real wages. I refer to page 343 of the large document, which states: The Base Case demonstrates the important role that lower real wages needs to play in tackling Australia's unemployment problem over the medium term. Those are his words-a commitment in the Hewson policy to the need for lower real wages 'in tackling Australia's unemployment problem over the medium term', What does he promise in terms of the end of this decade? What will have happened under the Hewson policies by the end of the 1990s in regard to real wages? Always go to the supplementary papers, Mr Speaker. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of what he says at page 19 of the supplementary papers: In scenario CAnd, Mr Speaker, this is the 'high road'; this is the best case outcome that the Leader of the Opposition is talking about. What is the situation he promises for Australia at the end of the decade? The supplementary papers state: In Scenario C, employee real wages fall by only 0.3% ... In other words, here is this man-the hypocrite-who gets up and attacks this GovernmentOpposition members-Withdraw!",68
245,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! It might help the debate if the Prime Minister withdraws that comment.,68
246,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw that. I will simply say that there is this contradiction, a contradiction which attacks Labor for having had lower real earnings and which promises that between the time the Opposition would get in, which it will not, in 1993 and the end of the decade it would, in fact, have lower real wages",68

In the past decade, strikes have declined by 70 per cent and three-quarters of all Australian fi.rrns have had no strikes at all. He concluded on this point: Co-operation has overtaken confrontation. Workplace reform and wage restraint are routine. Mr Speaker, there you have the answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question to me. He said, 'What about your record?'. I answer that question out of the mouth of Mr Greiner, who points out what has happened in this country which has transformed Australia from the uncompetitive, introspective nation that it was when we took over in 1983 to one in which we have created an economy which is capable of having had in the last 12 months a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports.

Is the Minister aware of recent claims of substantial potential reductions in the price of petrol? Do these claims withstand objective analysis? What are the Government's intentions on the matter of petrol pricing?,69
267,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I should point out that, far from the promises that have been made in relation to fuel cuts being a vision, they are in many senses an illusion, because what the Opposition, in particular the National Party, has failed to do is to tell the whole story. The Leader of the National Party has been running around the country saying that what is intended by this package is that a coalition government would wipe out all excise on fuel-one side of the story. Opposition members do not tell the story, nor do they cost what will come back in by way of road user charges. Let us just go to the document that people on the other side like to allege that noone on this side has read. There are a number of us who, in fact, have.",69

It then goes on to say, at the top of page 83: These changes to the arrangements for road funding will ensure that all revenue raised by user charges will be spent on road maintenance and construction. It also says that the body to have responsibility for determining the level-to take it away from political vagaries-will be the National Road Transport Commission. The simple fact of the matter is this: if members on the other side-in particular, those representing the rural constituencywere prepared to look at the detailed responses that were given yesterday and today by the Prime Minister, they could not come away from the fact that what we are looking at is an additional 16c, which we have said we will not increase, but will absorb.",70

276,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is why the presentation of exempting or cancelling out fuel excise is such a dishonest presentation. It is a dishonest presentation because it does not give the true picture. Recently the Leader of the National Party had the gall to go on radio and say that what this package does is to put the big '0' into deregulation in this industry. I tell the Leader of the National Party what it does: it puts the big '0' into dishonesty. The sooner that there is a proper understanding of what is proposed in total, not just the simplistic view about fuel excise and its exemption but - he is walking out of the House-what is involved in terms of road user charges, then they will see through the fraudulence of this presentation. They will recognise that it does not offer them significant gains and, in fact, in relation to diesel fuel, it offers nothing more than we already offer. We will be taking that message to the rural constituency because those on the other side, particularly members of the National Party, will not and they will be judged accordingly.",70

It is a phrase which, if I did inadvertently use under my breath, I would admonish myself for, as I would admonish any other honourable member here who used such a phrase. As I say, I do not think it is a phrase that I used. Does the honourable member for Braddon have a further question?",71

One is that we should purchase copies of this document from the Liberal Party at $35 per document. The other proposition is that my Department should produce it by photocopying. I think it would be more appropriate that my Department produce It by photocopying. However, if the Leader of the Opposition is willing to make available to all honourable members copies of the document it would save my Department a considerable amount of money. Conduct in the House",71
296,Mr FIFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask whether you are aware of reports claiming that supporters of the Prime Minister were yesterday furious about conduct in the House. I ask whether you have been spoken to by the Prime ter or any senior Minister and whether the Speaker regards such action as a gross reflection on your great office. I Speaker, what steps you are taking to ensure that this does not happen in the future.",71

311,Dr KEMP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In this morning's Sydney Morning Herald an article by Tom Burton headed 'Cost Concern is Sheer Hypocrisy' claims that I wrote to the Minister for Finance e Mr Willis) last year seeking guidelines on costing Opposition policy proposals. The implication in the story is that I initiated the request. This is a distortion of the facts and a mischievous interpretation of the letter's contents. To set the record straight it needs to be established that an offer was originally made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in a letter to Dr Hewson on 17 July 1990 in which he wrote: In the context of developing policy and costings, the Opposition should look closely advantage of existing avenues of access to the Public Service. In particular, I reaffirm the Government's offer of the assistance of the Department of Finance in costing options proposals consistent with the trend in election campaigns to which I referred earlier. Accordingly, I wrote to Mr Willis and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, Keating, on 16 October 1990 seeking wife guidelines under which the Department would operate in relation to requests from the Opposition. I also wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education and TrMning (Mr Dawkins) and his departmental head, Mr Taylor, seeking further information in this relation to the Prime Minister's offer. On June 1991 Mr Willis replied setting out a represented? number of guidelines relating to any request from the Opposition. These made plain that there was a serious issue of confidentiality in relation to requests and, in view of this, I decided to take no further action. There has been no hypocrisy on our part. The hypocrisy is with the Government which has sought to use a completely unrelated matter",73

Despite the fact that the Prime Minister brings that policy document into the House each day, it seems that he has not read very much of it. He would only have had to get to page 9 to see, quite clearly: A Liberal/National Government will ... transfer responsibility for road funding and charging to the National Road Transport Commission with the Commonwealth to retain responsibility for national highways ... Clearly yet again the Prime Minister has got it wrong.",74

(2) That the House invites the Senate to meet with the House in this chamber for this purpose. (3) That, at the meeting of the two Houses for this purpose: (a) the Speaker shall preside at the meeting; (b) the only proceedings shall be an address by the President of the United States of America, after which the Speaker shall forthwith adjourn the House and declare the meeting concluded; and (c) the procedures of the House shall apply to the meeting so far as they are applicable. (4) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. (5) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting concur and take action accordingly.",75
340,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"The Opposition is delighted that President Bush is coming to Australia and we wish to do all we can to cooperate with the Government in making that visit a resounding success. In particular, we strongly supported the idea of an historic joint sitting of the Parliament to mark the President's visit and we are therefore very supportive of this motion. However, I express one disappointment about one particular matter. Today I wrote to the Prime Minister (Me Hawke) suggesting that, given the importance and uniqueness of the occasion on 2 January, it would be appropriate for him and me to make short statements of welcome to the President in addition to the formal welcome by the Speaker. I pointed out to the Prime Minister that there is no precedent to guide us in this matter but that the occasion would warrant the leaders of both sides of this Parliament making short statements warmly welcoming the President I was not proposing major speeches by each of us but simply short messages of welcome. I am very disappointed that the Prime Minister has not responded to my proposal prior to this motion being moved.",75
341,Mr TIM FISCHER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"I support strongly the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) with regard to this historic motion. I add that I welcome the fact that the address to the joint sitting will take place in a parliamentary chamber. As the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), my colleagues and I have argued over the last few weeks, this always should have been the case. It was not going to be the case. I also hope that through this motion we will lay down a convention so that, when appropriate, there will be other occasions when joint sessions of Parliament are convened when special visitors come to this country, to afford visitors the opportunity to address both the House and the Senate on the floor of the House of Representatives in accordance with at least one precedent in this regard. I support that it very strongly the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to this motion.",75
342,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE," Very briefly, in light of the request by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I suggest to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that he reconsider the form of words in paragraph 3(b) of the motion. If we pass today a motion which says that the only proceedings shall be as specified, it would preclude the consideration by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of a proposition which I think all honourable members would accept as reasonable. One of the concerns we have all hadcertainly those of us in the rural communityhas been the extent to which it might be possible for matters of wide public concem to be expressed during the President's visit. This would be an ideal opportunity for matters of public policy to be addressed, even if in short form, by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I strongly support the text of the letter by the Leader of the Opposition and suggest that it would be advisable for the Leader of the House to accept some slight modification to part 3(b) of the motion so that the Leader of the Opposition's request can be accommodated.",75
343,Mr FIFE,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"I will be very brief. I did not intend to rise to speak on this motion, but, in the light of the words spoken by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I want to say that I have made some inquiries and I understand that 3(b) of the motion would not preclude a brief statement by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I seek from the Leader of the House, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, an indication that that is the case. I would like his assurance that the motion presently before the House would not preclude the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) from speaking briefly.",76
344,Mr BEAZLEY,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"in reply-I am happy to have that checked with the experts on Standing Orders, who are on neither side of the House but who are there, the Clerks. I would have thought that the motion precluded it. Mr Fife-Preclude or not preclude?",76
345,Mr BEAZLEY,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"Would have precluded it. It would be the Government's intention that it should be precluded. I appreciate the spirit in which the remarks have been made by the Opposition on this matter, but the view of the Government is that basically this is an occasion for the House and that the people of standing, as far as the House is concemed, are all members of the House, not simply the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and that the person selected to speak for the House under our Westminster tradition is the Speaker. Therefore the remarks of welcome on behalf of the House should be made by the Speaker and not by any other member of the chamber, be that member the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. The Government further has the knowledge that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will be able to address the President at length at the formal dinner on, I think, the night before the proceedings in the House. Mr Fife-After that, isn't it? That is the point. Mr BEAZLEYI am not sure when it is. It is one or other. Whatever, the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister will have an opportunity to address the President at length as part of their words of welcome and anything else they might care to say. The equivalent of this situation is roughly what occurs in the United States when a distinguished foreign visitor is invited to address a joint session of the Congress. Of course, at those joint sessions the person who presides, and the only person who makes remarks, is the person who presides over the House of Representatives. That is the equivalent of what will happen here. It is not meant to be any form of disrespect to anyone in this chamber, be it the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. The intention here is to ensure that the House is properly represented in the welcome, as opposed to the parties being properly represented in the welcome, and that is why we intend to proceed down that road. My view would be that item 3 (b) actually precludes any address by others. It reads: the only proceedings shall be an address by the President of the United States of America, after which the Speaker shall forthwith adjourn the House and declare the meeting concluded. My reading of that-and I do not think it is an unreasonable reading-would be that other members will not be able to address the meeting. M .. Peacock-You can amend it.",76
346,Mr BEAZLEY,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"-lam not going to, for the reasons I have already outlined. I do not think it is sensible to have that procedure in this place. I think this is one of those occasions where we have the Senate meeting with the House, and this is a House function, not a function that relates to the formal party divisions in the House. The Government and Opposition, as political forces in the country, will have an opportunity to deliver their words of welcome later.",76
347,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"The question is that the motion be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I think the ayes have it. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, come on.",77
348,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker",77
349,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,What is 'come on'?,77
350,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker",77
351,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"No, there is no indulgence. I have closed the debate.",77
352,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to move an amendment.",77
353,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"No, the matter has been closed. I had better advise the Leader of the Opposition that he is out of order in terms of procedure. The matter has been dealt with. The second reading",77
354,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,So you are not granting an indulgence? Is that what you are saying?,77
355,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"No. Members on the honourable member's side have had plenty of opportunity to rise, but no-one indicated until this point any intention of moving an amendment. The time has passed. The question is that the motion be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye",77
356,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"With due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker",77
357,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,to the contrary no; I think the ayes have it.,77
358,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"We only just got the argument that the Leader of the House was putting. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, you're like a racehorse, with great respect. I have never seen a person in this chair act like you have just acted.",77
359,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"The honourable member should not reflect upon the chair. I make this point to the members of the Opposition. Members of the Opposition rose during this matter and put a variety of viewpoints and questions to the Leader of the House, and the Leader of the House has responded. At no stage was the Chair advised of any intention of moving an amendment. At no stage was the chair advised.",77
360,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence",77
361,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,I will grant indulgence for the Leader of the Opposition to put up a proposition,77
362,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,The Manager of Opposition Business was asking whether (3) (b) precluded or did not preclude statements by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The answer has only just been given. That is why I was seeking your indulgence. We only knew that that was the Leader's interpretation,77
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,In which case why did the Opposition not foreshadow it at the outset?,77
364,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,Because we were of the view that it did not preclude it. We have now been told that it does. On that basis I am simply seeking your indulgence to seek leave to move an amendment to omit (3) (b).,77
365,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"The Manager of Opposition Business knows perfectly well that if he wishes to draw the Chair's attention to a matter he has always had that opportunity. Despite his previous remark, that is true. There was no indication from the Manager of Opposition Business that there was any intention to move an amendment.",77
366,Dr HEWSON,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"The Manager of Opposition Business was working on a presumption that the motion did not preclude statements by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. In fact it was only just clarified by the Leader of the House that in fact in his view it did preclude them. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, on that basis I was seeking your indulgence so that I could move the amendment to omit paragraph (3) (b). Mr BEAZLEYI raise a point of order. Irrespective of whether or not the Leader of the Opposition was waiting for me to conclude, the matter is concluded and, if he wants to move a subsequent motion, he gives notice of that and it is debated at the appropriate time.",77
367,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"I have just been advised that there was some advice sought at lunchtime. The Chair was not advised as to this point. However, if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to have leave to move an amendment, I will ask the Leader of the House whether he will grant leave.",78
368,Mr BEAZLEY,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"No, there is no leave.",78
369,Mr SINCLAIR,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am seeking an indulgence rather than a point of order. I want to point out that this is quite a unique occasion and I urge the Leader of the House to consider this: our system is not the American system. Their Congress is different to our House of Parliament. The Speaker here is not the immediate inheritor of the office of President as the Speaker would be in America on the death of the President. Their Speaker is the Vice-President. There is an entirely different constitutional structure. I do urge Leader of the House to consider that what he is doing today is going to be very much a precedent for the future. Even though he has taken this position, could I suggest that he consider it, because I think that certainly the Prime Minister should take the opportunity to consider the letter written by the Leader of the Opposition.",78
370,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,I will inquire again of the Leader of the House: is leave granted for an amendment to be moved by the Opposition?,78
371,Mr BEAZLEY,PROPOSED ADDRESS TO THE,No. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 NA Motion of Censure,78
372,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"Taking up the offer of the Leader of the House at the start of Question Time, I seek leave of the House to move a motion of censure of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin): that this House censures the Treasurer for failing to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation, the Fightback package. Leave granted.",78
373,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I move: That this House censures the Treasurer for failing to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation, the Fightback package. The coalition has shamed the Treasurer to his feet today to debate the one and only visionary set of policies that will set this country on a course to realise its full potential. Has it not been like dragging and pulling teeth to get the Treasurer to debate the issues which confront the nation? He has been more protected than the pay packets of Armaguard in the last few days. On Sunday we had the Treasurer-in the waiting up on national television. On Monday we saw the former Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) wheeled out to defend the Government. On Tuesday we saw the Treasurre- er-in-waiting up again protecting the Treasurer. Today we had the huge bulk of the Leader of the House standing there to defend a Treasurer who has floundered and who is unable to find his feet and is unable to make a contribution to the great issues of the day. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) would not have been so slow in getting to his feet to put his point of view. He might not have had an argument, but he would have been there at least putting an alternative point of view. This man, the Treasurer, has unfortunately lost his confidence. He has lost that sense of direction which the country so desperately needs at a time of very great economic and social distress. I understand it in a sense because he gets conflicting advice from the Reserve Bank and from the Treasury. He has the honourable member for Blaxland attacking him in the press gallery and in the Caucus. He has a Prime Minister who is only interested in one job, and that is his own. He has the right wing faction, the left wing faction and the centre left faction, all jockeying for position as the factional fighting goes on and as the leadership tensions rise. I invite the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery to look in the chamber. There is not one member of the Government sitting in here to support their Treasurer. Not one of them is prepared to come into the chamber to support what they must see as the swinging carcass of the short term, not too long to last Treasurer of Australia. I couched the censure motion in terms of the failure of this Government and this Treasurer to address the issues constructively and in an informed and measured way. I did so because the Government's response so far to the Fightback program has been one of gross deception and constant misleading of the Australian public. It has been lying to people about what is being proposed. It done nothing but bluster and put forward fraudulent propositions. In question after question and answer after answer we saw that tactic of misrepresentation and fraud, as evidenced in Question Time today. For example, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that he was quoting from words of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the supplementary papers of Fightback! in respect of certain scenarios about unemploybased ment. He said that they were the words of the Leader of the Opposition and were by the Leader of the Opposition. That is just plain dishonest. Anybody who bothers to open the document will see that it says quite specifically that these scenarios are not exact projections of the coalition's policy platform but simply indicative or illustrative of the of reform agenda and outcome of such broad sweeping reforms if they were to be adopted. The document states: It highlights the clear advantages that lie in the Liberal/National refonn agenda. Its analysis does not, however, portray the detailed outcomes which would be achieved by the implementation of policies. The Prime Minister knows that, and deliberately misled people as to what that documentation attempted to show. On the petrol and fuel tax issue, he is going around the country saying that there is a hole in our package, knowing full well there is no hole. The only hole is the one he has just fallen into. It is outrageous that, at a time when we have nearly one million people unemployed and many more wanting to work additionally if they had the opportunity, we have the sort of lies and deceit that are being perpetrated by this Government. The truth of the matter is that we are going to abolish that fuel tax, that Federal excise. We are going to abolish the lot. The motorist is going to pay 19c or thereabouts less per litre of fuel. It will be 26c or less for those running businesses and using fuel. Every dollar is accounted for. The Prime Minister knows that, and he deliberately misleads people when he says otherwise. ' Those opposite have been running another deception in the last few days on payroll tax. has The deception has been this, 'Look, the consumption tax is just a big payroll tax. So why would you abolish payroll tax?' Anybody who knows anything about good tax design knows that the payroll tax breaches all the principles of good tax design. It is regressive; it is on a narrow base; it is heavily imposed upon our exporters, thereby making Australia's export industries less competitive than they would otherwise be; and it is at variable rates in the States. It is not a broad alternative consumption tax. It is just a lie when those opposite put that proposition endorsed as they go round the country. What extraordinary hypocrisy it is as well, because it was only a few short years ago that people in the Labor Party were calling for a national campaign to abolish the tax on sort employment-the payroll tax. In 1977 those opposite actually fought an election on the basis of the abolition of payroll tax. The State Premiers in recent months have been calling for the abolition of payroll tax. But now those opposite, and the Treasurer, have the gall to say that they no longer oppose payroll tax. By our definition, they now are publicly supporting payroll tax. When I sit down and the Treasurer stands to speak, let us hear the latest rationalisation of his views on payroll tax. We say payroll tax is a tax on employment and it ought to be abolished. We take the words of the Prime Minister just a few short years ago when he said that if payroll tax was abolished, it would create literally 100,000 or a couple of hundred thousand jobs. Is that the view of the Treasurer? Alternatively, what is his view now? With inflation, what incredible hypocrisy it is for members of the Government to be saying that our package is inflationary. Yes, it will have a once-off price effect, but it will not be built in and have an ongoing effect at all. We simply put the argument that those opposite put just a few short years ago when they advocated a broad based consumption tax, then at 121/2 per cent. The truth is that inflation under the Government is unfortunately going up again. This is shown by the Treasurer's projections issued in the recent Budget. On the levels of unemployment, both now and projected, Government members are just lying. They are just deceiving the Australian public.",78
374,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,I think it would help the debate if the honourable member for New England withdrew those terms.,80
375,Mr SINCLAIR,TREASURER,I beg your pardon? Mr Cadman interjecting,80
376,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,The Chair does not need the advice of the honourable member for Mitchell. It would help if the honourable member withdrew those terms.,80
377,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, are you talking to me or to the right honourable member for New England?",80
378,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,I am talking to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,80
379,Mr REITH,TREASURER,I say it is a lie to say that the unemployment figures are better than the Government has been saying they are.,80
380,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"The honourable member used the term 'you are lying', and that is what I asked that he withdraw.",80
381,Mr REITH,TREASURER,Why should I withdraw?,80
382,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,The Chair is asking the honourable member to withdraw.,80
383,Mr REITH,TREASURER,You are asking me?,80
384,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Yes.,80
385,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I withdraw. I say that it is a lie-I presume that is within parliamentary procedures-for any person to suggest that the unemployment projections of the Government are better than they are, because a document fell off the back of a truck just a few short weeks ago to reveal that the advice the Government has been getting on unemployment projections is that it will go higher than the Government has been saying it will; that it will stay higher for longer than it has been saying it will; and that the number of long term unemployed, now about 210,000 Australians-those unemploye<.t for 12 months or more-will go to something like 300,000 or 350,000. When people lie about the circumstances of our country and when they deny the reality of what has happened to literally hundreds of thousands of Australians, they attempt to dismiss the need for the major, sweeping reforms of the sort we have advocated in the last week or so. It does no justice to those who are unemployed if we deny the existence of the problem. That is basically what those opposite are doing. They are not prepared to be realistic about our circumstances; they are always saying things are going to be better. We can go back to the classic comment in 1987 of the then Treasurer, who said that we were entering the 'golden age'. It is a sick joke to go back to some of the Government's claims about the benefits of its economic reform. I ask honourable members to remember what the ex-Treasurer said in 1988. He said that he was going to 'bring home the bacon'. That was a sick misrepresentation to the Australian public. It is not honourable members here who suffer directly as a result of that; it is the hundreds of thousands that those opposite throw onto the scrap heap of unemployment; it is those single mums and their young children who are on the treadmill of life and on the Government's system of dependency with no opportunity to get off it. Before the last election, the Government had the audacity to go to the Australian public and say, 'We shall not let there be a receSsion'. That was a straight lie. That has typified the sort of economic management that we have had from the Government for years. Of course, I was very interested in the Treasurer's response today in Question Time. In the last week or so, Professor Bob Gregory, a member of the Reserve Bank-he ought to know what is going on in this country-told the Government's Caucus Committee that the recession is deeper and longer than was originally thought and that the recovery is going to be much slower than normal. Why does the Treasurer not have the decency and honesty to stand up here and tell the Australian public what our real circumstances are, instead of slinking off to Bangkok and telling a few international bankers? He denied the reality of our circumstances back in Australia. It is a disgrace and a lie for people to say that our package is a bonanza for the rich. The truth is that we have shown people that we will truly look after the genuinely needy in our society. In the document which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) released last week, we actually did the sums. Never before in Australia's political history has an opposition produced such a comprehensive, detailed analysis of what it is proposstraight ing. We did not hold anything back. Some of the best people in Australia assisted us with the policy and the work required to put that package together. We did not hide and deceive people about what we were trying to do; we just tried to give people an honest statement of what had to be done and how we went about the calculations which formed the basis for those sweeping reforms. One of the chapters, which I am very proud of, reveals that we have done more for the genuinely needy than Government members have ever dreamt was possible. We have tightened up the abuses and the rorts, but one of the great features of this Fightback program is that we have shifted resources to the low income and middle income earning Australians. That will be the powerhouse of the turnaround of this country. Our job is to provide a framework which will give people incentive and rewards for their efforts and then give them the opportunity to go out there, earn that bit extra, work that bit harder and reap the rewards of their efforts. The Fightback program is not just about tax; it is about the future country that we want in Australia. I am very confident about the future of this country. I do not want to overstate the benefits of the package, but I am very happy to be caught out overstating the capacity of the Australian people to rise and meet the challenge of our difficult economic circumstances and tum this country around. That is why we have slashed personal income tax by $13 billion. Ninety-five per cent of Australians will basically never pay more than 30c in the dollar in tax. That is going to unleash potential, opportunity and incentives in this country in a way that we have not seen for probably 20 or 30 years. That is why we have moved in the capital gains tax area. Under this Government, if a person starts up a small business, works hard in it and after three or four years decides to sell that business and invest in a bigger business-we want to encourage people to invest in the future of the country and employ people-he will be taxed. At a time when he is trying to get a few dollars together to make the business grow, the Government slugs himfrom the Federal Treasurer, from the Australian Tax Office. We are going to move away from a lot of that slugging of small business. We are not going to tax small business; we are going to encourage it. We are going to give businesses a massive shot in the arm. We are going to abolish seven taxes which are heavily imposed on Australian businesses and which mean that many people who do not have that viability will be unemployed. We are going to be pro-business and pro-development to give people the opportunity to get back to work. We are going to lift about $20 billion worth of tax off the business community. For a long time, particularly on the protection debate, the Government has said that it is reducing protection. But businesses are not in a position to fight back against those who compete against them by way of imports. Under a coalition government, businesses are going to be able to fight back. Under Labor, businesses are sent into the international ring of competition with both hands tied behind their backs. No wonder they take a belting. The same thing happened with the Whitlam Government. It lowered protection overnight and many people went broke. Under a coalition government, the opportunity will be provided to be the best in the world. We will abolish that wholesale sales tax which is not only a tax on business but is a hidden consumption tax. The hypocrisy of these people opposite is unbelievable. In 1983, the hidden consumption tax brought in about $3 billion; now it brings in about $10 billion. Yet the Government says that it is opposed to consumption taxes. The Treasurer loves consumption taxes. He has been feeding the revenues to the Federal Treasury for years. Honourable members will remember that in 1985 the Government, which was publicly in favour of a consumption tax, did not proceed with it simply because of the veto of the trade unions. We will abolish nearly $6 billion worth of payroll tax-a huge boost to Australian business-and we are also going to abolish the petroleum products excise. There has been a lot of debate about that in the last I think it is one of the great parts of this package because it will lower costs of transport around Australia. It will lower costs of many things because the cost of transport is built into the system in many different ways. A few years ago, the Industries Assistance Commission presented a report to the Government which advocated a major change in our attitude to the petroleum products excise. We are not just making a major change; we will abolish the lot, lock, stock and barrel. That will really tum this country on. We are a big country; we ought to have low transport costs. This will be a major measure to achieve that. We also need to encourage people to save more than they have in the past. The centrepiece of the Fightback program is the changes that have been made to encourage both long term and short term savings. The Treasurer ought to give us a considered view about the proposals we have for short term savings. I say that because a couple of weeks ago some Government backbenchers were advocating a short term savings scheme. People have talked about these ideas for years in Australia, but nobody has ever had the courage to put them together as part of a package. I think it is a great idea. It is directed principally to low and middle income earning Australians to give them a chance to earn interest without tax in their bank accounts. I think that will be a great plus. Of course, our superannuation changes will remove the rorts that Labor has allowed to grow up under its complicated superannuation scheme. The Fightback program is a great program. It is a solution to Australia's problems. It has a vision for this country in the year 2000. It commands the respect of all those who want to be in public debate and it demands from the Treasurer a considered and informative contribution to the debate, not the silly scaremongering foolhardy comments that we have had from him so far.",80
386,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Tim Fischer-I second the motion and few days. reserve my right to speak.,82
387,Mr KERIN,TREASURER,"Over the last two days, we have seen a series of political stunts in this House which have been masterminded by the Opposition. It has been a campaign of deliberate disruption. The first thing that I would like to say quite plainly is that governments govern and that we will continue to govern. Members of the Opposition say in this motion that the only policy agenda before the nation is theirs. Then they accuse me of not wishing to respond in a measured and informed way. Let me just deal with that. There is a very big policy agenda before this nation-that is, the work of the Hawke Labor Government, which is continuing. It is the work of a government which has done more in so many areas than any other government has ever set out to do. It is something that this country will always be proud of. I assure the honourable gentleman opposite that I will certainly respond to the Opposition's election manifesjo in a constructive, measured and informed way. I assure him that this will take place over the days, weeks and months ahead to the next election. Parliaments are not just for debating opposition election manifestos. We understand the tactics behind this series of political stunts. Part of the reason for these tactics is that the public gets the idea that it is the Government's fault. That is why the Opposition does it. After 8 1/2 years in opposition-the Liberal Party hardly having won an election on the mainland in that time-the Opposition has finally come up with a comprehensive document, the 'Frightpack' document. With this document it wants to transform Australia. It wants to transform the order of this House. It wants to transform the channels of debate in this House for publicity purposes, to get more publicity for its 'Frightpack' document. The Opposition does not want a Question Time. It is not happy with the open slather that we are very happy to give it in matters of public importance. It does not accept at this very time the ongoing debate on the economy and employment resulting from the statement that the Prime Minister (Mf Hawke) brought down a couple of weeks ago. It does not see that as giving it every opportunity for selfpromotion. It is a wide-ranging debate. It is quite nonsensical for the Opposition to say that we are not prepared to debate this issue. I have been quite prepared to address any motion from the Opposition. I was ready yesterday and I am ready today; I am ready .any time. When will the Opposition learn? We are not going to allow this arrogant Opposition to run the Government or run the House. We are not going to allow the Opposition to duck Question Time or to prevent honourable members from asking questions. This is not going to be turned into a debating House for the Opposition's election manifesto. That is not the purpose of this House. When will it ever learn that the time to bring on a motion such as the one we are now debating is after Question Time? When we were in opposition that is what happened. We knew how to work the House; we knew what the procedures were. It is sensible and rational to allow the backbenchers on both sides of the House-not that the backbenchers on the other side get much of a show-to bring on motions such as this at that time. We have heard all this nonsense about the Government's bringing on a scare campaign when the Opposition introduces its consumption tax. We are not doing that; we are not mounting a scare campaign. We believe that we have to soundly and sensibly tell the Australian people what the implications of this great hoax are. The Opposition makes the accusation in this rather stupid censure motion that the Australian Labor Party has no policy. I suppose it is a bit of a change. Over the years, the Labor Party has been charged and countercharged by the conservatives, who only believe in governing when in government and using all the bureaucracy and bureaucratic advice available to them. They have always accused us of having too much policy, of being obsessed with policy. If the Opposition wants to know what our vision is, what our policy is and what our platform is, I should point out that we go down to Hobart or to some other venue every two years and thrash through policies. The Australian Labor Party from the grassroots upMr Tim Fischer-Uranium policy?",82
388,Mr KERIN,TREASURER,"Yes, we have a very good debate on uranium policy. We have an excellent debate on uranium policy. But we have a debate; we do not let some god professor come in and take over policy making and hire a string of academic economists to give the Party a policy from the top down, as the Liberal Party does. We start at the grassroots, we go through the branches and we go through the various organs-State electoral councils, Federal electoral councils to State conferences. The weekend after next I will be attending the New South Wales State conference. That is the way we formulate policy. It is not from the top down. We do it properly and we have a very open, tough debate. The Liberals have always accused us of having too much policy and being too obsessed. It has always worked on some elitist arrogant principle with respect to policy. I repeat: the Parliament will not be transformed into a place to promote or debate an Opposition's election manifesto. It is a place for all members. Let us look at yesterday. When we finally got to the matter of public importance, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the Opposition's greatest random cliche generator, said virtually nothing. It was a visit back to home week, pointing to all the good chaps and all the good lasses on the back bench-Bill, Jack, Tom, Mary and all these people, the good fellows. This was supposed to be a matter of public importance. He addressed it completely stupidly. Let us look at this 'Frightpack'. The Opposition says that there is vision in it. The only vision is division. Mrs Jakobsen-Hear, hear! Absolutely right.",83
389,Mr KERIN,TREASURER,I thank the honourable member. She knows-the women in Australia know-the realities of what happens when a consumption tax is introduced and the compensation comes further down the track. The women who go to the supermarkets and the women who go to the shoe shops and buy shoes for their kids know that it will cost them. The women of Australia know this. Mr Tim Fischer-It's a scare tactic.,84
390,Mr KERIN,TREASURER,"That is not a scare tactic; the women know. This 15 per cent consumption tax is the centrepiece in a concoction of policies using the $27 billion to be raised to bribe the population as a blind for introducing the whole New Right agenda. It all goes back to the economic action package, the picket fence and the 1987 package. All that stuff is in there. At last the Opposition has found a way to get it all together, to bring in the whole New Right agenda. I turn to the spending cuts to pay for the so-called compensation that will come from tlus new tax package. Yesterday in the matter of public importance debate I showed that there is no economic need for the consumption tax. If the Opposition wants to get into government-if it ever got there-and is prepared to impose all the spending cuts on the community, there is no need for the consumption tax with compensation. The Opposition's aim is to wipe out most of the policies about which there has been a large measure of agreement in this country. It wants to abdicate from government. Yesterday I pointed out that there was no analysis of the causes of Australians' problems, yet we are getting on with the job. I emphasise tltis question of abdication from government. What are the arms of Government economic policy? Once upon a time there was an exchange rate. The world has changed and we now have a floating exchange rate. That weapon has virtually gone. We can only influence that with other arms of policy. One of the key arms of economic policy is wages policy. What does the Opposition want to do there? It wants total deregulation and destruction of trade unions in any central form. It wants little unions in every little workshop around the country-every little shop, every little place. I do not know whether it wants a union per workplace, or per room if there are three people in a room. It wants to destroy the trade unions in this country. And, of course, it is feasting on the misery of unemployment at present. We should look at the attachments in the great 'Frightpack', where we will see a claim that the manifesto of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will provide two million jobs by the end of the century. The Government is conducting a detailed analysis of the Opposition's so-called scenario C, the high road scenario. The Opposition's modelling, the Murphy model, apparently dealt with the GST in this scenario by way of assumed efficiency gains. The model does not have the capacity to deal with it directly. There is no jump in the CPI or other prices associated with the introduction of the consumption tax. There is no Opposition modelling of other changes to direct and indirect taxes other than those due to the reduction in government expenditure. Therefore, that scenario-and I sympathise with the Opposition, as the Murphy model has its limitations, as do all models, so I am not particularly critical of the Murphy model-does not consider the possibility of subsequent flow-on effects or other variables. I will be going through these matters more thoroughly when the Government's analysis is complete. The implications are indeed very interesting. That is what the Opposition is going to do about wages. The otht;r arms of economic policy are monetary and fiscal, but I might as well mention what the Opposition intends to do if it ever got into government on some of those essential public policies which are very much part of the real income-the social wage-of men and women in this country. It is going to wipe out superannuation; that will go back to being voluntary. It is not going to address the question of Australia's having an ageing population, so there will be no security in old age. There is no move to take on that pathfinding exercise that we embarked on. It is not going to do that. It will transform the health system in this country back to the same tired old nonsense. We put up with it during the Fraser years. According to the Leader of the Opposition, these are years of Whitlamism; there have been 20 years of Whitlamism. The then leader of the Government, Prime Minister Fraser, had seven changes to Medibank. It has now become Medicare. So when they get into government-if they ever get there-they are going to set about destroying that again. That is a simple example of how hopeless they are. In relation to monetary policy those opposite think they are going to hand it all over to the Reserve Bank; the Reserve Bank is going to get more independence, they say. So what does that leave? It leaves fiscal policy. That equals cuts, cuts, cuts; not jobs, jobs, jobs. The working men and women of Australia have to understand that these are part of the transitional costs to get to the Utopia where all the accent is on the individual, where all the accent is on this so called private enterprise; there is no infrastructure, none of the usual services provided by governments in any other modem mixed economy. No; that is what it is all going to be. Everything is going to be sold, fellows; we will give ourselves a big new tax, we have a lot of money and this all just happens. The biggest problem in this whole package is that it assumes away people. The only sort of person becomes the rational economic man. That is the only sort of person: onedimensional man, with no other values. Do not be concerned about the environment; that is not economically rational. They are after the onedimensional man. People are suddenly going to behave differently. Christopher Skase's back is suddenly going to get better. We can have, suddenly, six successful Estate Mortgages. Some of our entrepreneurs and tycoons are suddenly going to pay tax in Australia instead of us having to continue to chase them down. What is all this based on? It is based on a series of myths. All the pressure, with the CPI effect and the inflationary effect, is going to fall more and more on tougher monetary policy and tougher fiscal policy. There is no other way-and Australian people had better realise that is what they are facing. Let us look at some of the myths in this document. The first myth is that living standards have fallen in recent years. I came in here and tried to inform the Leader of the Opposition on that, but there it was. And he repeats it again. He says that living standards have fallen in recent years. Since 1983 real household disposable income has risen by 24 per cent. Real per capita income has risen by over 10 per cent. The next myth is where the Leader of the Opposition says our international competitiveness is deteriorating; our foreign debt is on a par with the Brazils and Mexicos of this world and we will be unable to service our debt. Again, the Leader of the Opposition got this one wrong. Fact: as I explained to the House on 5 November, since 1982-83 our new competitiveness has improved by over 17 per cent. Fact: on the latest data, relative to the size of the economy Australia's gross external debt is below the OECD average. Let us be clear about the drivel being spewed out here: on average, the eight major debtors-including Brazil and Mexicohave debt to GDP ratios that are on average around Ph times Australia's. Fact: at June 1991, Australia's net debt servicing ratio was 19.7 per cent. That is the internationally recognised indicator of capacity to service debt and is significantly below the Opposition's claimed danger zone of 25 per cent. So do not tell me about scare campaigns. The Opposition is very capable of waging the worse scare from campaigns and it is going to give people bigger scare if it ever gets into Government. As to the next myth, the Leader of the Opposition says that Australia has a relatively big Government and big taxes. The fact is tax burden has fallen in recent years. On latest data we are now the second lowest taxing country in the OECD. Only Turkey is lower. (TIme expired)",84
391,Mr TIM FISCHER,TREASURER,"The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has certainly run time and we have run out of patience with regard to his producing any sort of comprein hensive response to the Fightback package, even at the initial stage, before he gets his computer print-outs and before he gets massive tome that he is expecting as a result of the huge amount of work the scenes in Treasury and Finance. Let us put it in perspective. The real of the matter is that the reason we are having this debate in relation to the censure of the Treasurer is that the front bench was stung one particular remark during Question Time. The remark was that Keating would not have ducked out. Government members have been ducking out. A funny thing happened. It was at that point that we had the indication by Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that indeed TItanic. the Government would now have a change of heart, it would participate in a decent debate, by degrees, on the Fightback package, would allow our censure motion to proceed and, furthermore, it would allow five speakers a side. But there had to be that type of jection to sting the Government into finally facing up to a debate on the Fightback pack1991 age. What have we had from the Government? The Treasurer is now leaving the chamber. is an embarrassment to the Government. The fatal sign of any Minister in a Labor negative Government is when the leaks are going into sion. the Australian Financial Review. That started last Monday. It is time we looked for a new Treasurer. The drip, drip, drip mechanism which is destroying the credibility, the confidence, the capability and the standing of the Treasurer has started not from our side, but his own side. That is manifest for all to a see. We know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and others are stalking jobs at this time. They are getting the ready for what is going to happen inevitably the in February and around about the Ides of March when perhaps this will come to a head. We are ready, because we have the policies, we have the documentation and we have the alternative strategy for this country, whereas this Government has a series of atrocious blunders, demonstrated by all the activities out of last week and demonstrated by all that happened in this House yesterday, culminating the gross breach of parliamentary standards by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) yesterday, for which he still has not given the the House a decent apology, and culminating further in the inadequate performance by the going on behind Government today. The Government likes to tell us that it has truth policy. Let me remind it of the three cornerstones they would have us believe is their policy. Firstly, there was the industry by statement cobbled together in March of this year. Some fantastic statement! It dropped from view without trace. It took months for the Government to produce some of the sales tax legislation arising from that industry the statement. It was all about tinkering on the Then we had the second cornerstone that it Labor would have us believe is going to revolutionise the country and get us out of this horrific recession, this designer recession intergiven to us by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). I am referring to the Budget, the first Budget of Treasurer Kerin. That dropped even more quickly out of sight than the industry statement. It was a He totally flat Budget and no response at all. Indeed, it added to underconfidence and the attitudes associated with the reces-Finally, a couple of weeks ago we had the famous jobs statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and that vanished off the horizon even more quickly than the other two. So the three cornerstones of Labor's policy effOlts this year have failed. It has been a hopeless trifecta which has been knocked right out of the ring by this comprehensive Fightback package which we bring to the nation with pride, with determination, and with a galvanising unity conferred on the community by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It is a package which has already drawn massive support from the VHIA, from the AHA, from the New South Wales farmers, from the NFF at the national level, from the forestry industry, from IPA, from the Housing Industry Association, the National Council of Independent Schools Associations, the National Catholic Education Commission, the Retail Council of Australia and the ANZ group, just to name some. Let me quote a couple of statements from those independent organisations, who do not necessarily like our brand of politics at and who have attacked us on some occasions. Try this for size from the NCISA. The Chairpredicted man, Dr Peter Macarthur, said: The Opposition's refonn package acknowledges the critical role of education in Australia and this must be welcomed by all education sectors . . . Then there is a classic statement from Mr Gerry Gleeson, Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, comed, on behalf of the catholic education The journalist: sector, several announcements associated with the GST package. The Retail Council of sense? Australia said in its media release: Retailers applaud the Coalition's visionary tax package. They made it very clear-cut in a press release, available to the honourable member for to say, inter alia: Capricomia (Mr Wright) and others. Mr Wright-Tell us what the Catholics said about the GST?",86
392,Mr TIM FISCHER,TREASURER,"Then the ANZ Bank welcomes the coalition national savings strategy, when Mr Will Bailey saysMr Bevis-Keep quiet, you mug!",87
393,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! The honourable member Dear Ric, for Brisbane will remain silent.",87
394,Mr TIM FISCHER,TREASURER,"Is the honourable member saying Mr Bailey is a mug? Mr Bevis-No, the one beside you.",87
395,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! If honourable members on both sides of the House, and particularly on my right, continue to interject I will have to deal with them. I would prefer not to. The Treasurer was heard in relative silence and I was not forced to intervene. I believe the Leader of the National Party is entitled to be heard in the same silence.",87
396,Mr TIM FISCHER,TREASURER,"Mr Will Bailey said: It is an important step forward in confronting and resolving Australia's economic problems... These measures represent a comprehensive and co-ordinated response to Australia's savings problems. This is exactly the sort of approach that is needed to boost savings. I could go on to quote others. Let me just quote one. Mr Bruce Lunn, Secretary-General times of the Australian Automobile Association, speaking on ABC radio last night, as I he might when I was speaking just ahead of ABC's PM at this time last night, said: It would appear that the Prime Minister's statement of track costs, or road costs, of 16c a litre appears to be an aggregate from the Inter-State Commission report which takes into account Commonwealth expenditure, State expenditure and local who welgovernment expenditure. So the Prime Minister is double counting in a Mr Lunn: Well it looks as if he has double counted. In respect of the package, Mr Lunn went on Well for the motorist, for the average motorist, it looks a very good bet. .. It is time to get behind the rhetoric of the Government. Guess what has happened. A very interesting letter has just fallen off the back of a truck. It is from the Treasurer to Dr Charlesworth, Chairman, Caucus economic and industrial relations committee, and it is dated 26 November. It says: Thank you for your letter of 6 November in which you advised me of the resolution by the Caucus ... Committee to request a report on the wholesale sales tax treatment of the heavy vehicle road transport industry. That is point one. The Government is feeling the heat on the sales tax equation. A Caucus committee wrote to a Minister, after carrying a resolution, requesting an investigation into the impact of that sales tax. The letter continues: I recently asked for a discussion paper from my department on this issue, and I am pleased to be able to offer the paper to your Committee. . . I would draw your attention to the data limitations. . . My preference would be not to provide any sales tax exemptions for inputs to services, such as road freightacknowledging problems as he goes. Then in another paragraph Treasurer Kerin says: . . . Moreover, providing a sales tax exemption would send mixed signals to the industry at a time when road user charges for heavy vehicles are being developed. Interesting. To continue: This would hinder the efficiency objectives of the road transport reforms. . . For all these reasons, would prefer to maintain the present wholesale sales tax treatment of the heavy vehicle road transport industry. The coalition is not prepared to maintain the sales tax regime on the transport industry, which is wrecking the viability of the trucking industry. There is sales tax on spare parts, on vehicles, on lubricants and on freight services. We, and only we, are offering a clear-cut commitment to abolish all sales taxes. We will abolish the trifecta of sales taxes on trucks-out; the sales tax on spare parts-out; the sales tax on freight services-out. Seven taxes will be completely wiped out by the Fightback package when it is implemented by the next coalition government, when Prime Minister John Hewson is in the Lodge. It is a comprehensive package. Queensland is very sensitive about this issue. Well it might be, because Queensland pays more sales tax per capita, pro rata, by degrees, than any other State because of its decentralised economy. It has an horrific transport task and it is hit hard by these sales taxes on the transport industry; it is hit very hard by diesel fuel excise. We have done some research into history. I acknowledge the help of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament, who has brought to my attention what Premier Goss said on this matter before he became Premier. On 8 September 1989 he said: I supported the Consumption Tax at the Tax Summit because it is so efficient. That sort of tax could sweep away a number of inefficient and expensive ways to collect taxes ... There we have the Labor Premier in Queensland supporting a consumption tax, but having to put up with a gutless mob down here that does not have the courage to proceed with a goods and services tax. The coalition does have the courage, the plan, the boldness, the determination and the energy to deliver this package. Our program actually addresses savings as an issue, whereas the Government has not done so. On the very day we launched the package, a certain Labor Government member who has been in the House for a few years, and who II will not embarrass by naming, came up to me and said, 'Tim, I just want you to know that what you are doing on savings is absolutely correct. We should have done it, and I support that part of the package'. Those were his words, volunteered to me in the hall just beyond this chamber, the words of one of the Government's own spelling it out in the way that the nation will spell it out when it gets to the ballot box in a few months time. It will remove the Government from office and deliver the mandate for this program. OUf progra1Il does give incentive for savings, which is something the Government has never done. Our program specifically targets world best practice as an Australian aim. That is something this Government has never targeted, as the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), has pointed out on a number of occasions. Our program emphasises jobs rather than welfare dependency. Our program is all about deregulation in a proper way rather than the Government's approach to more regulation, more intervention, more legislation and more bureaucracy. aUf program specifically targets education so that we have a means to reach the world best standards. The shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), can be rightly proud of his supporting role as architect of this package. Under a Liberal-National government the best will be our target, not second best or tenth best, or nearly worse, which seems to be acceptable under the Hawke 'near enough is good enough' approach to consensus politics. This Government has done so much damage that it should be removed from office as quickly as possible. This Government lacks courage; this Government lacks energy; this Government lacks ideas; this Government lacks vision. It is on this side of the House that the ideas for the future of Australia are coming from. This side of the House is the only side giving leadership-from opposition-establishing the policy agenda for this nation in comprehensive terms. All the Government can do is dance on our turf and dance towards its destruction as it does so. I plead with the Government to stop sitting on its hands, to reconsider all its rhetoric of 1985 and to accept our offer to afford to it, in the national interest, at a time when one million people are unemployed, the opportunity of bipartisan support for the legislative passage of a GST so that we might do something that is right in the interests of Australia-something which over 50 other countries already have, something which 22 out of 24 OECD countries have, and something which the Government did not have the courage to do, even though the Prime Minister, the Treasurer of the day and many others proposed and argued for it in 1985. We have the courage, we have the conviction, and we have the correct policies to give Australia a new start. The sooner we are in government to implement this proposal, the better for the sake of the nation.",87
397,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"The proposition before the House which seeks to censure the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) proceeds from the quite absurd proposition that it is the responsibility of the Treasurer, or any member of this Government, to respond to the ravings and drivel of the Opposition. The Opposition has every right to propose an election manifesto; it has every right to propose some policy alternatives to those which the Government is pursuing. But there is no obligation on the Government to respond to any timetable that the Opposition might set in terms of when, if ever, we should respond to the propositions as put forward by the Opposition. The great failing of the Opposition, over the eight or nine years in which it has been languishing in that unhappy state, is that it has taken until now for it to come up with anything which can under any circumstances be called an alternative set of policies. For all of those years, whilst the Government has been proceeding apace to change the face of this country, to give this country, Australia, some sense of economic respectability in the eyes of the developed world, the Opposition, of course, has been all over the place. Opposition members have had no idea of what they have wanted for Australia. They have had no idea about how they could in some way bring any coherence into their prejudices, their failure in the past, to bring about some form of comprehensive approach for a modern Australia. At least they have now brought forward something about which they are happy. But as time goes on and as more of the duplicity, more of the deception, more of the exaggeration and more of the dishonesty is understood about this set of proposals, the more the people of Australia will realise that this is not a program to build a modern contemporary twenty-first century Australia. Anyone who looks at this package can trace its parentage fairly accurately' and fairly precisely. The parentage of this package lies partly in the United States under the Republicans, particularly the Republican former President Reagan and the ideologues who came in with him to run his treasury and particularly to run his budget office. Of course, the other part of the parentage of this package comes from Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Anyone who examines the progress of those two economies will realise that that is not a piece of history which we in this country wish to repeat. Indeed, if we compare the progress of the United States and the United Kingdom with that of the Australian economy during the 1980s, we realise that it is not we who should be trying to learn anything from the United States or Great Britain; it is they who should be trying to learn something from us. It is Australia which has blitzed the world with this Government's approach to restructuring, with its ability to reduce real labour costs, with its ability-not as a result of any international pressure but because of a clear identification of its own self-interest-to reduce the level of tariff protection in Australia. It is we, the Australian Government on behalf of the Australian people, who have been leading the world crusade to achieve a more fair and open world trading system. So we do not have to learn from the United States and Great Britain, which are both still grappling with the consequences of gaping trade deficits, which are still having to cope with the problem of gaping fiscal imbalance of .budget deficits, which are still having to deal with the consequences of their particular labour markets, and so on. So there is no particular advantage for Australia in learning from the experiences of those two economies. Then, of course, we get closer to home, as my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) reminds me, to find another source of inspiration for the Opposition's package-at least as it relates to the imposition of a consumption tax. That, of course, is our unfortunate sister country New Zealand. Despite the enormous advantages it had of an open labour market with Australia, despite the advantages that come from basically a free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand, the free flow of goods, the free flow of investment and so on, which is increasingly opening up between Australia and New Zealand, it is of course experiencing a period of declining real income, great unemployment-unemployment which has not been paralleled in New Zealand-and of course an enormous disruption which has been brought about as a result of that major change to its taxation system. Try as I might to look for international examples, the kinds of paeans of international excellence in the economic arena, I do not find those paeans in the United Kingdom, the United States or New Zealand, which are the three countries, the three systems, that this Opposition has decided to emulate in this particular package. There are some countries which have done well during the 19808 and they are the countries that have approached the questions of restructuring, of working with industry and of working with the labour movement. Those are the countries which have done well. If we look through this particular package, the one thing we find standing out like a beacon is that the Opposition has identified the working men and women of Australia as the enemy. Where in this statement do we find any suggestion that there mighi be some advantage in working with the organised trade union movement in Australia? Where in this document do we find any suggestion that some of the solutions to our problemswhether they be on the shop floor, in the factories, in the laboratories, in the schools or even in the minds of Australians, and whether they relate to better working practices or to restructuring the way in which work is done in the workplace-might just come from asking the individual working men and women of Australia for their suggestions and their cooperation as to how these things might be achieved? But, no, throughout this document we find repeatedly the ideology of the Opposition, particularly as now enunciated by the honourable member for Bennelong e Mr Howard), that the obstacle to a more competitive Australia lies with the unions and, therefore, the working men and women of this country. What the Opposition has yet to understand, despite nearly a decade of example of what can be done, not only here in Australia but also in other successful economies around the world, is that we can achieve great progress by working with intelligent men and women who also happen to be workers in this country. They now have a better appreciation of what is needed in this country; a better appreciation of the imperative of competitiveness; a better appreciation of the fact that there is no future for their job, or for their sons and daughters, unless this economy becomes more competitive. I can tell honourable members that the one thing which will discourage their cooperation, the one thing which will of course destroy the progress that has been made-maybe not fast enough, but made nevertheless and will continue to be made over future years-is this idea of dividing Australian against Australian and telling the workers that they are the problem in this country. We only have to look for the real clue to what the Opposition is on about in its approach to the unemployed. Despite much rhetoric, despite much windbaggery on the part of the honourable member for Bennelong and others about the importance of industrial relations and reform of the labour market, we find very little of that in this document. We see a paragraph here or there, a page or two out of 600 pages or whatever it is. So, to find the kernel of what this particular program is on about, we have to find what the Opposition's solution to unemployment is really all about, and I made some observations about this earlier today. Essentially members opposite are saying that the only solution to a higher level of employment in this country is, of course, a massive cut in real wages. They are not prepared to come out front and own up to that in terms of the work force as a whole. But they are prepared to pick on those people who are the most vulnerable, those people who are unemployed and have been unemployed for nine months or more. It is that group that they have decided to identify and say, - As a result of your crime for being unemployed for nine months or more, you can accept a job at only 80 per cent of the level which the law says you should be paid'. This, of course, is the guts of what this collection of parties is on about. They want to persecute the workers and particularly persecute the unemployed. They can pursue that policy if they like, but they embrace the enormous risk of losing the cooperation of the trade union movement in Australia and the ordinary working men and women in this country. The coalition knows that the working men and women of this country have voluntarily engaged and embraced the idea of wage restraint because they have understood that it is important for Australia to become more competitive. They have done that in the context of the accord, a document and an approach which the Opposition is all too ready to disparage. But I think it should look very long and hard at its particular approach. The honourable member for Bennelong, of any member in this House, knows how difficult it is to conduct economic policy in this country. He knows the limits of power which exist with the Commonwealth Parliament and he ought to know now, if he did not know before, how important it is to embrace the idea of cooperation rather than pursue a policy of confrontation. I would urge him in that context to rethink his approach in this area. But let me pursue this idea of labour market programs, because I find one of the most despicable aspects of this particular approach is that it says that the unemployed have to embrace a cut of 20 per cent in order to get what is, in any sense, no kind of job at all. Not only that, but whilst the Opposition calls it Austrain, there is no mechanism or commitment to provide real training. I know what the honourable member is going to say in a moment. He is going to say that we have already embraced the idea of a training wage and, indeed, we have in the context of the 10bskills program and in the context· of the training and skills program, TASK. But what we have said in both those cases is that there must be legitimate, recognisable structured training as a part of that training wage. We are not asking workers to accept a lower rate of pay in return for some mickey mouse form of training. We have asked them to accept a lower rate because they are not working full time and because part of their week is engaged in trainingtraining which we are prepared to support and to subsidise. This package purports to be all about creating more jobs in Australia, but the approach is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed, first of all, because it decides to persecute the unemployed themselves. Rather than giving them a hand up out of their circumstanyes of employment, it wants to drive themifurther into the ground under the heel of some Liberal boot. It also fails to recognise that the task of restructuring in Australia, far from being complete-and with that I agree with the Opposition, and who would not-will not come from a process of confrontation and denigration of the labour movement, the trade union movement, and ordinary working men and women of Australia. It is only going to come through a cooperative and sensible approach. (Time expired)",89
398,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"I start by saying that I agree very much with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who has just finished speaking, that the salvation of the Australian economy will not lie in the adoption by any government of this country of policies of denigration and persecution of and confrontation with any section of the Australian community. That is self-evidently the case and I have no argument with that proposition. I say in the same spirit to the honourable gentleman that the economic salvation of this country will not be achieved by either side of politics clinging to outworn ideas about class conflict and outdated shibboleths about what may have been divisions in the Australian community decades ago, but which no longer exist. It is of no relevance to Australia's current economic problems to indulge the rhetoric of the 1930s or the 1940s. It is of no relevance to the challenges that this country faces to talk as though we are still in some kind of class-ridden society. Australian society of the 1990s is very different from Australian society of the 1930s or 1940s or, indeed, of the 19605 and 1970s. . I say to the House that the overriding reason that the coalition's Fightback program has been so emphatically embraced by the Australian community is that the Australian community believes that the Opposition has some understanding of the challenge that lies in front of us, as distinct from obsessions about those things that have gone before us. That is the great strength of this Opposition program. In their hearts, all of those people opposite know that we have struck a chord with the Australian community. They can indulge their false bravado; they can invoke their scare tactics; they can cheer each other up; they can egg each other on; but they know that deep down we have struck a chord with the Australian community. They know deep down that the average trade unionist is very tired of this Government. They know deep down that in the heartland of the Labor Party this program has had far more appeal than they ever dreamt possible. Mr Hand-It is a can, and you know it.",92

423,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"MinisterMr Hand-In deference to you, I withdraw.",93
424,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"Now that we have cleared that up, we can resume a rational debate about the future of this country. The reason that this document has struck a chord with the Australian people is that deep down the Australian people know that we are fair dinkum about their future and that the Labor Party is the party of the past so far as the next 10 years of this country is concerned. They know that by voting for it they will not be voting for anything new. They will be voting for past attitudes and prejudices; they will be voting for class shibboleths; they will be voting for a tired and failing group of people who, whatever energy and vision they may have had in 1983, 1984 and the middle years of the 1980s, have lost all of that energy and commitment. Let me say to those who sit opposite that I am not so prejudiced and not so one-eyed as to deny that the present Government has done a number of things that I never believed a Labor government would do. I am not so stupid and ignorant as to pretend that Australian politics has not changed enormously over the last 10 years. All of us on both sides of this House have been mugged by the economic realities that face this country. All of us are far more rigorously accountable before the bar of public opinion than our counterparts may have been 20 or 30 years ago because the margin of risk in this country is much greater. We are far more potentially vulnerable now as a nation than we were 20 or 30 years ago. The level of our foreign debt is far more pressing and daunting than it was 20 or 30 years ago. Our levels of unemployment are much higher. Our economic vulnerability around the world is infinitely greater than it was. All of those things place a much heavier burden on all of us in this Parliament. What the Australian public is now requiring from both sides of politics is not rhetoric or politics, but some kind of constructive vision or plan as to what we intend to do with this country over the next 10 years. It is because the Fightback document fits that description, it is because it is not a shallow, flimsy, insubstantial document that the Australian people have warmed to it. If honourable members opposite are at all honest, they will acknowledge that it has frightened the political daylights out of all of them. It has done it for the fundamental reason that the Fightback program is a very comprehensive and responsible economic package. We have not promised unfunded tax cuts. We have not promised limitless economic growth. We have not made unrealistic projections about the future of the Australian economyDr Charlesworth-1\vo million jobs.",93
425,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Perth interjects 'two million jobs'. The Government keeps saying that it created 1.4 million jobs in six years. On that basis, we will easily exceed the two million projection by the year 2000. Do not start interjecting about my leader's prediction of two million jobs. It is easily obtainable with the levels economic growth we are going to achieve. This may well be a speech and a censure motion about the present Treasurer, but I am going to take out a bit of political insurance. I want to say a couple of things about the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), because I think the real winner on the other side of the House out of the Fightback program is the former Treasurer. I think the response of the Government, the response of the present Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the response of others on the front bench has been so fumbling and feeble that the number crunchers are out. I reckon Laurie Brereton is back on his motorbike and I think the number crunchers from the New South Wales right are already going around the corridors of this place gathering up the numbers. They would be saying, 'If Keating had been there he would have been ripping into it'. The honourable member for Blaxland would be sitting there trying to give the public appearance of the silence of a Trappist monk. But all the time he would be hoping and praying that the Government continues to fall over. The honourable member for Blaxland probably came in today hoping that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) would repeat his performance of yesterday. He probably came in today hoping that the Prime Minister would give a long-winded, incoherent, hysterical first answer to a first question from the Opposition; because the man who has a vested interest in the failure of the Government's political response to the Fightback program is the honourable member for Blaxland. If the Opposition goes, as it certainly will, to the Christmas recess with an opinion poll lead of 15 or 20 per cent, one can imagineMrs Jakobsen-Oh, pigsI'",94
426,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"Those on the other side of the House scoff. The honourable member for Cowan is gone; the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand) is retiring and the electorate of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) will be returning to Liberal of Party hands on the strength of the opinion polls that are coming out at the present time. You mark my words, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the Opposition goes to Christmas as we surely will with an opinion poll lead of 15 or 20 per cent, the rattle of political death around those Labor Party barbecues over the Christmas season will really be something to behold. They will be ringing up; the phones will be hit; the boys will be out from the New South Wales right and they will be going around saying, 'You may not like him; you may not be able to give him away in the working class areas of Australia; he may need a Gregory's directory to find Bankstown but he at least cannot be any worse than the present bloke'. If there is one thing that has been the political commodity and asset of the honourable member for Wi!1s (Mr Hawke), it has been his fabled popularity with the Australian people, his alleged capacity to credibly say to the Australian people, 'I understand the Australian man and woman far better than anybody else in politics. I have a special empathy with the ordinary men and women of Australia'. That has been the claim of the present Prime Minister and yet we have seen over recent months, especially over recent weeks and most particularly by reason of his response to the Fightback document, that any credibility the Prime Minister may once' have had on that score has long since gone. Not only is he now leading a party clearly trailing the Opposition in the opinion polls, but his 'own fabled personal popularity has long since crumbled. I will tell you why it has long-since crumbled, Mr Deputy Speaker: people no longer believe that what he is saying is relevant to their problems. One thing one has to do in politics is remain relevant to the problems of the nation and to the problems of the people. The Prime Minister has lost his rapport with the Australian people. Despite the loathing and contempt that the people out there in the suburbs of this nation feel for the former Treasurer, and however much they visit upon .him the principal blame for the high levels of unemployment we have, however much they blame him above everybody else for the recession we had to have, however much they remember the promises he made about the economy and the boast about how they would be lighting candles in cathedrals in economic honour if this were a European country, despite all of those shattered illusions and broken promises, the Australian people are so desperate that, come this sobering realisation that they are headed for the political scaffold; come the sobering sible understanding that they have fallen down in public esteem; come the realisation around the Christmas barbecue that unless they 'do something' they have no hope even of retainingDr Charlesworth-You got knocked off when you were a winner.",94
427,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Perth interjects. He is gone no matter what happens. The sort of swing that will occur will be lapping into hitherto impregnable Labor seats. When the Australian public finally comes to that realisation-mark my words-they may well say, 'Despite the fact that you cannot give him away, the other bloke has run out of steam. He is exhausted, he is failing, he is tired and he leads a confidence-shot Ministry, a disintegrating parliamentary party.' They will in desperation say, 'We might as well give it a go'. I say to them: just mark my words. Those 66 Labor members who voted for the Prime Minister in June will have second thoughts in March, April or even February of next year. Just in case Government members may think that their agony will be relieved and that their pain will be eased if they change horses, just remember that there are a few people on this side who remember the honourable member for Blaxland. We remember what he did to the Australian economy. We remember his colossal conceit, his soaring arrogance and his insensitivity to the suffering of the ordinary Labor man and woman that he has pledged all his life to effectively represent. If members of the Government do in desperation turn to him they should not imagine that that is going to relieve their agony. The truth is that nothing will save the Government at the next election.",95
428,Mr WILLIS,TREASURER,"Any attractions that the Fightback package might have for the vast bulk of the Australian people would come his because of the way in which it has been fraudulently represented to them. Once they come to truly understand what the package involves, there will certainly be much less enthusiasm than might initially have been the case. This package is economically irresponand socially reprehensible; most of all, so far it is a fraudulent package. Let me illustrate the point in relation to its major claim, which is that this is a program to give us a big increase in employment-two million jobs by the year 2000-and a halving of the unemployment rate. The very first page of the documentation says: By providing a dramatic boost to productivity and economic growth, the reforms set out in this document are designed to provide two million new jobs and have the unemployment rate by the end of the 1990's. That is the basic claim. That is what it all condenses down to, so we are told. The basis for that claim of two million jobs-rounded up a little bit-and the 5.2 per cent unemployment rate, the halving of the current unemploYPlent rate, are scenarios contained in the docUmentation. Those scenarios contain a base road, a low road and a high road. Those opposite say the high road represents their policies. Page 340 of the document says: The third scenario-the ""High Road""-illustrates the implications for the economy of implementing policies that tackle Australia's serious structural economic problems. It requires the implementation-as a matter of urgency-of all the key reforms identified in this document. I emphasise that it says 'all the key reforms'. Quite clearly, one would expect that scenario C is in fact a modelling of all the documentation which is here-certainly all the key reforms. But when we look at scenario C, as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) indicated in his remarks this afternoon, the key reforms are not there. The most fundamental key reform of all is the GST. We assume that that is regarded as the most important. It is the linchpin of the reforms. Mrs Bailey-Just a part.",95
429,Mr WILLIS,TREASURER,"It is not? It is just a part? Presumably it is a key reform. It is not there in the scenario. As the Treasurer has mentioned, it is simply not modelled. The Opposition has simply assumed an increase in efficiency and rolled through the model. But the impact of the GST in terms of its inflationary boost and the enormous macroeconomic problem trying to overcome that is not represented in the document in the scenario. The exactitude of the figure of two million jobs, which comes from the figure of 1.8 million jobs, which was churned out of the economic model, and the halving of the unemployment rate to 5.2 per cent, comes from the running of a scenario which does not encompass the goods and services tax. It is not there. How can those opposite possibly say to the Australian people that they are producing a set of reforms which will provide two million jobs and a 5.2 per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 when this is based on a model which does not include the key reform? What an absolute fraud that is .. How fraudulent can those opposite possibly be? Yet that is what they have done. We had here today the beginnings of the walk away from the scenarios when the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opp-sition (Mr Reith), said in his remarks in this debate that these are only indicative of what the policies would produce and are not meant to have any exactitude. But the figures are exact when we get to unemployment and employment growth: two million new jobs and a halving of the unemployment rate by the end of the 1990s. That comes out of the scenario which does not include the goods and services tax. Let the people of Australia be aware at the very outSet that what is being represented to them by the Opposition is absolutely untrue and is not justified in any way by the scenario on which it bases the claim. The key reform is not in the scenario. Let us start with that and let us accept the fact that those opposite would impose on the Australian nation the enormous macro-economic problem of having to deal with the inflation boost of over 5 per cent. In the near future we will tell people what the rate is likely to be. It certainly will be more than 4.7 per cent. That inflation boost will create an enormous economic problem which will have to be sorted out. The people opposite are simply assuming that away. It is not in their scenario. When they are confronted with that problem, what do they say? They say it will just wash through; it is a one-off. They say we do not have to worry about it; it will flow through the system. How do they know it will flow through the system? What guarantees can they give about that? They can give none. We have to confront the fact that the Opposition is proposing this policy just as this nation, for the first time in 20 years, gets its underlying inflation rate down to the level of 3112 per cent. By the end of this year the rate will be well under 2 per cent, but we are not suggesting that is the underlying rate; the underlying rate is a bit more than that. But we will have extremely low rates, the lowest for 20 years. The rates will be lower than those of our major trading partners, which is an enormously important part of being competitive. The Opposition is proposing this policy just as we make that structural change, with a very good chance of locking it in, because the accord gives us a guarantee from the unions that they will support a wages policy which will give us a price outcome comparable to that of our major trading partners, and just as we achieve the possibility of the most important structural change of all, which is to keep the inflation rate at or below the level of our major trading partners and to do it in the long term, something we have never been able to do before. Just as that is achievable, those opposite would come along with their policies and blow it all out of the water, completely destroy it. They would push the inflation rate back up to somewhere near double digit inflation and they have no idea how they would stop that being substantially built into the future inflation rate except the age old remedy of flattening the economy. That is the only remedy they would have. They have not got an accord, of course. They have not got an income policy. They have not got a wages policy. They would not allow the Commission to have any role. They would simply rely on economic forces, and the economic forces, of course, would have to be modified considerably by dampening of the economy to ensure that inflation did not get built in. They are the kinds of policies that are being presented to the Australian people as responsible economic policies, policies which are supposed to promote economic recovery in this country. Yet clearly they prejudice the most important structural change that this nation can make, and is making. An enormous structural change is within our grasp. To throw that away with this kind of approach is incredibly irresponsible and incredibly absurd. It is not just a matter of inflation. It is the fact that, with the need to flatten the economy to deal with that inflation, we would not get anything like the two million jobs those opposite are talking about. For some years we would have to have lower growth than we would otherwise have had, just to ensure that the inflation impost was pushed out of the system. We would get much less employment growth and much higher unemployment. That is the kind of outcome that the policies of those opposite must imply. It is not just that their policies could imply that outcome; they must imply that. That is why virtually every country that has introduced a tax of this kind has had the experience of a flattening of its economic growth rate for at least a year or two afterwards whilst it adjusted to the higher price level and tried to stop the inflation rate being permanently increased. The program the coalition has put forward is an incredibly irresponsible economic program and one which this Government will certainly make sure that the people of Australia fully understand. But this is also a policy which is supposed to provide us with a vision for the future, a vision of the year 2000 in which we can all rejoice in some halcyon future. Let us look at what those opposite offer for the year 2000. Under the Opposition's policy, we will have no increase in real wages between now and the year 2000. That is part of the vision for the future: the work force can look forward to no improvement in real wages in the whole of the 1990s. That is part of the scenario. We see a vision of the future in which there are substantial reductions in the safety nets which have always applied in this country, particularly under this Government. Historically, it has been part of our culture to provide substantial safety nets and not to have the kind of gross poverty which many other developed countries have. We have ensured by the policies that we have pursued what, whilst we have tightened our social security policies by increased means testing and various other welfare policies-despite the fact that we have tightened eligibility-we have ensured that it has all been done with compassion and that those who need assistance will get it. But that is not what is offered here. This is an attack on many people who are simply the disadvantaged and the deprived. It is an attack on the unemployed. It is an attack on the disabled. It is an attack on the sick. It is an attack on single parent families. It is an attack on Aborigines. It is an attack on newly arrived migrants. It is an attack on low income people in terms of the services they get through public housing and public transport. It is a kind of approach to the bottom end of the scale in this country which says, 'You are far less important than the rest of this country and we are not going to look after you in the future in anything like the way you have been used to in the past because we are going to remove those safety nets which are so important. We are going to persecute the unemployed'. For instance, it is an absurd policy that, after six months, one must get a certificate signed by two employers each fortnight to take to the Social Security office to prove one's continuing eligibility for unemployment benefit. It means that millions and millions and millions of these certificates will need to be signed each year. That is part of the policy of the Opposition. It is a ridiculous policy and one which will certainly not be successful, because there is no way that employers are going to cooperate with it once they realise what is involved. I do not know what the Opposition would do then about the savings, but it will certainly mean for a while the persecution of the unemployed. While those opposite are saying that they are directing most of their assistance to people on lower incomes, in fact a look at the income tax cuts shows that there will be an after-tax gain in income of 4.8 per cent up to $20,000 a year. But at the top of the scale, at $75,000, we are looking at 14.7 per cent. So it is 4.8 per cent at the bottom and a 14.7 per cent increase in after-tax income at $75,000. It tails off slightly after that, but it remains lot higher than 4.8 per cent. At $100,000 it is about 13.8 per cent. What those opposite are doing is giving the great benefit of their tax cuts to the people on the highest incomes. It is traditional Liberal Party policy to look after their supporters. At the same time they stand here and say, 'We really care about the unemployed. We really care about the low income earners'. It is absolute nonsense. Mr Hawker-It is about jobs.",96
430,Mr WILLIS,TREASURER,"Do not give us that rubbish. We have spent the last 10 minutes--maybe the honourable member was not herepointing out that the Opposition's policy in relation to jobs is a complete and utter fraud, that there is nothing in the policy which is going to produce two million jobs or anything like that and that the policy is going to lead, for several years certainly, to higher levels of unemployment than would otherwise have been the case. It is a policy which says that it is great to tax food and it is great to tax the basics of life, and at the same time as those opposite are doing that they will reduce the price of luxury cars, like Ferraris, of furs, of jewellery and of international holidays-those sorts of luxury goods and services. It is great to do that for the rich, but they do not do that in terms of expenditure on people on lower incomes. It is also a policy which encourages an incredible explosion in health costs. This absurd policy of allowing gap insurance and virtually encouraging doctors to charge the AMA schedule of fees will mean an incredible increase in health costs in this country. Under Medicare, we have been able to keep our health costs contained in a way which is internationally very acceptable, and that will no longer be the case under this kind of approach. This so-called Fightback rubbish that has been put to us is simply that, and the people of Australia should understand that the illusion that is being dangled before them of nice big tax cuts or other forms of compensation is simply that-an absolute illusion. The reality of life is that this is just the old traditional Liberal Party using new kinds of a speak to produce the same sorts of results which look after the wealthy and make it a lot harder for people on lower incomes to get through their daily lives. It is a policy which maintains no growth in real wages for the next 10 years and is clearly not a policy in the interests of Australia. (TIme expired)",98
431,Mr HAWKER,TREASURER,"I would like to start by reminding the House what the motion before the House is: That this House censures the Treasurer for failing to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation, the Fightback package. I bring that point back to the House because it was very obvious that in that speech from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) there was one thing missing. Throughout that whole speech-and I listened carefully-not once did he defend the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Not once did he defend his colleague. If that does not tell us something, I do not know what does. It makes it very clear that he has aspirations. It makes it very clear that the present Treasurer will probably go down in history as the shortest term Labor Treasurer for many decades. It is very interesting to note and it is very significant, and I think all honourable members should take clear note of that. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Finance seemed to get himself into a total lather about all sorts of things, but nothing of any substance. We had this rambling rhetoric. He even resorted to swearing at one stage, which I thought was unparliamentary, but it seems that the Deputy Speaker missed that one. The Minister for Finance found it necessary to have resort to swearing and I think that shows just how desperate the man is. He seemed really to be reverting to the good old fashioned Labor rhetoric, the sort of thing we used to hear in the 1960s. Clearly, we are seeing Labor reverting back to those 1960s years. Those opposite have realised that they have failed. They have realised that it is no longer within their grasp to provide responsible, decent government in this country, and they are now reverting back to type we saw in the 1960s, when clearly they were seen as irrelevant, as they are going to be seen by the rest of this nation over the next decade. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Finance made a lot of noise about having got inflation down. I would ask: 'At what price?'. Is this the way to get inflation down-by driving one million people out of their jobs, and probably at least 50 per cent more than that, when we take those who are underemployed? That clearly is nothing to be very proud of. To drive inflation down purely by sending people out of work does not seem to be the way to run a country. I do not think that is a record that anyone should be very proud of, least of all that Minister. I think what we really saw as he got himself further and further into a lather was clear desperation, the sort of desperation we are now used to from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-yesterday's man. He comes in and he speaks about yesterday. That is all he ever talks about. Even honourable members on his own side wince. One can watch the back bench wince when the Prime Minister gets up to try to answer a question, and all he can do is bring out the sad record of the past. What we really found from the Minister for Finance is that Labor no longer has any vision. Those opposite do not know how to answer the vision that has been put forward by the coalition. They have no ideas. They have run out of ideas. They are a tired government. In fact, all we could hear was a string of negatives-negative rhetoric: just more and more of the same dreary, dull misery that this Party opposite wants to keep this country in. It really is becoming the hallmark of Labor. I do not believe that resorting to scaremongering is going to get them anywhere in trying to present to the people of Australia the sort of Government alternative to what the coalition is putting that the people want to see. It is interesting, as I said, that the Minister for Finance would not even defend his Treasurer. I suppose it goes without saying that we do not see the Prime Minister in here to defend his Treasurer, either. I think that tells a pretty big story, too. Clearly the Government is rattled and clearly the Prime Minister has run away to skulk in his little hideaway, and clearly the Treasurer has very few friends left. I think that was made very clear when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), got up to move the censure motion: it was very noticeable, and very notable, that the Treasurer, when he was sitting here awaiting his tum to try to defend himself, did not have one single member of the Government here to support him-not one. He was sitting here on his own. There was not one other member of the Government here. He was there on his own, a lonely man. It is understandable why he might feel rather lonely. When you look at it, he has had six days now to try to find his way through the Fightback package. Dr Charlesworth-I was here.",98
432,Mr HAWKER,TREASURER,"The honourable member was the first to come back in. It is little wonder that the Treasurer has found it so difficult to try to defend his position. For six days now he has been trying to find a hole in the Fightback program and he has not been able to do it. It is little wonder, considering the quality and the effort and the vision in that document. The Treasurer must be a very unhappy man. The fact that he has been trying to avoid facing the Parliament is fully understandable. The only way the Opposition has been able to get him on his feet to try to defend his position is by having him face a censure motion. Clearly this demonstrates how rattled he is. I understand why. We know that last Friday night the Treasury was lit up like a Christmas tree. Everybody was back working overtime trying to find a hole. What did they find? Those opposite have had extreme difficulty in finding anything. These Treasury boffins have been working full time on this job, and no doubt they are having difficulty. keeping up with the work they are supposed to be doing. They have been poring over the documents and have had their computers whirring. The Government talks about being computer driven and yet the Government seems to be relying solely on computers to find something to look at. Clearly the Treasury boffins, and the backroom minders likewise, are having real difficulty. The only hole that the Prime Minister has found in his efforts so far is the one that he has found to fall into. Clearly the Government has had some difficulty. It is worth reminding honourable members yet again about the 20point plan that is in this Fightback program. The Minister for Finance talked about the fact that there is a goods and services tax in our plan. We do not resile from that point, but it is one part of a 20-point plan. It is worth looking closely at the 20-point plan. The first point is that we have given a clear-cut commitment to price stability. Not only have we said that we are going to do that but also we are going to back it up with action; we are going to make sure that the Prices Surveillance Authority is beefed up so that we keep that price stability. The second and a very vital point-my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has proposed this over many years-is that we are going to have labour market refonus that will achieve a more productive and more rewarding workplace. That means that we are going to create some employment. With nearly one million people out of work and probably as many again underemployed, is it any wonder that the people of Australia are now tunling to this package and saying, 'Here is a coalition that is prepared to give real vision, real leadership, and is prepared to take this nation forward for the next decade'? The third point in the plan is that we are going to have lower and fairer taxes. We have made that very clear. There will be a 30 per cent reduction in income tax, a massive cut. The wholesale sales tax, that iniquitous hidden consumption tax that Labor tries to run away from, will be totally abolished. That is the one that Labor has jacked up over the last few years while trying to avoid anyone finding out. When we talk about compensation, have we ever heard the Government talk about compensating the pensioners for what it has done with its consumption tax? When has it ever talked about that? The next point is that we are going to reduce capital gains tax for small business. I am sure the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is green with envy about that, because he was in charge of a parliamentary committee which made the recommendation to reduce capital gains tax for small business. We are going to do something about it. We are going to abolish the lump sum tax on superannuation, another very important point that encourages people to look after themselves. Another very important point-I cannot understand why the Government is so silent about it-is that we are going to give the States the chance to abolish payroll tax. Mr Snowdon-And then you are going to give them a 15 per cent consumption tax.",100
433,Mr HAWKER,TREASURER,"I find it very hard to understand why the Labor Party says it cares about the workers, but when it comes to the tax on employment",100
434,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Mr Jenkins)Order! The Parliamentary Secretaries will cease interjecting.,101
435,Mr HAWKER,TREASURER,"When it comes to the tax on employment, it seems to find it very hard to understand why we have taken the lead. Not one Government member is man enough to stand up and say, 'What a good id-a'. Clearly, it is going to help people to get mto work. It has been estimated by one of the major employer groups that at least 170,000 jobs will be created by that one changegetting rid of payroll tax. We have also made it clear that we are going to abolish th- petroleum pr-duc-s excise. That is something that everyone m this country realises is a very sensible move and is long overdue. It recognises that the tyranny of distance is a very significant problem for people living in this country. yve are also going to reduce the taxes for l-pOrt cO.mpeting businesses, and we are obVIOusly gomg to take the tax off exports. We have also made it very clear that we will be introducing a number of measures against tax avoidance. We are going to encourage people to save. We have a very comprehensive package on savings. It is one that has met with universal approval and has shown that we care not only about what is going to happen tomorrow but also about how people can look after the-el­ ves and their children in the future and gIve their children the start they believe they should have. It is a start which this Government is denying them. We have made it clear that we are going to provide a health system which gives real security to people. It is very important to note that Labor talks about its Medicare but it very conveniently overlooks the hospital queues that are now getting longer and longer. We are now starting to see all the problems of Medicare. We have made it very clear that the family and pensioners will be looked after. We have said that we will compensate pensioners for any increases in tax, and we will be indexing pensions so that they will have no fear about any changes in the future. We have a comprehensive package which shows how we are going to reduce government waste, and we are going to stand up on the question of privatisation. We will be following the tariff reform package through to the year 2000 to make sure that we have a world-class manufacturing sector that is able to compete in export markets. To show that we are fair dinkum about this, we will also be introducing some anti-dumping measures, which my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has been working on. Those measures will make it clear to the business world and to those who are importing that we are fair dinkum about having fair rather than unfair competition. We have talked about major infrastructure reforms, which time does not permit me to go into now, but they are very important. The most significant one is that we will get the cost of land transport down. It is a very important reform that is dear to my heart. It is a proposal that I think those opposite will find very difficult to live with because all the truckies are coming out in support of it. Since those opposite are a little bit concerned about this, let me give them a few examples of - he reactions that are around. The Australtan Livestock Transporters Association has said: The Opposition announcement of the goods and Services refonn tax package promises long overdue reforms for livestock transporters and the whole rural community ... The package is all. the more impressive for the detail and comprehensIve sweep of its vision . . . They are great words. The New South Wales Road Transport Association had this to say: The Road Transport Industry has been made a centre piece in John Hewson's taxation reform designed to make Australia a better, more competitive country ... We particularly welcome John Hewson's recognition that Au-tralia h- - o -)Ver­ come the disadvantages of dIstance If It IS to recover economically. . . They are very strong and clear words that show we are on the right track and have support in the widespread community. The Treasurer deserves to be censured for his weak effort and for the fact that he has come up with no constructive response after all these days and after all the efforts of the Treasury boffins working over the weekend with the lights on all night and computers whirring, trying to find weaknesses. It is clearly time that the Treasurer was well and truly censured, because his performance has been abysmal. The performance of the Government has shown quite clearly that the time has come for change. The fact that we do not see the Prime Minister here to support the Treasurer and the fact that the Minister for Finance cannot even find the words to help the Treasurer show that this Government mows that one of the first casualties over the next few weeks is going to be the Treasurer himself.",101
436,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TREASURER,Strong words are not an adequate solution. Mr Cadman interjecting,102
437,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member for Mitchell should be careful.,102
438,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TREASURER,"If Australia needs this election manifesto, then it also needs some substance. If one listened to the contribution today by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is often a very constructive contributor in this place, one would have found that we had a political speech. I understand that he is dissatisfied, because he could have been in the top job if he had not been knifed in the back. Unfortunately for him, because of circumstances beyond his control, he does not have the top job. The Fightback! document is an election manifesto. There are 18 months until the next election. It is a long-distance race, and we are just in the first lap. I am delighted that it is being introduced now. Had it been introduced six weeks or four weeks before an election, it would have been superficially attractive and could have been a winner. But it will be tom apart. There are holes everywhere. For the Opposition, it represents a minefield. I say to the Opposition that there is a long way to go. There is a direction; we have a direction in this country. When we came into office, we wanted to make this country more competitive; we wanted to make a country which looked outwards; we wanted to make a country which was fairer; we wanted to restructure our country to make it more efficient. In a lot of ways that has occurred. As long as I have been in this place, every time we have tried to introduce a measure which would increase the fairness or the efficiency, we have had difficulty from members on the other side of the House. We all remember the assets test, which would increase the efficiency with which we paid benefits to pensioners. That was opposed in an election. We all remember the introduction of the capital gains tax, which was something that would increase the fairness and integrity of the tax system; we all remember the fringe benefits tax, dividend imputation and deregulation. We remember all of the things that this Government has done. In fairness to the honourable member for Bennelong, I must say that he said that the Government had done some things that he never believed it could do. I am saying to the Opposition that these things can be achieved in this country by cooperation, but they probably will not be achieved if we have division. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) came into this place and effectively destroyed the two million job story. The Opposition has not put the GST, the consumption tax, into the figuring. It changed the figure of 1.8 million to two million, just like that. Yet the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is already suggesting that the immediate effects of the introduction of this package will be an increase in unemployment. He is saying that. So let us and the people out there understand what this package means. It means no wage increases during the nineties. Workers must understand that. It means tax cuts for the wealthy. It means that someone on $50,000 will get a tax cut of $82 a week and someone on $25,000, which is half that salary, will get a tax cut of $22 a week. So double the salary and get four times the tax cut. That is the Opposition's fairness; that is the Opposition's vision for Australia. It says that it will create two million new jobs, but nowhere does it substantiate that claim. What the Opposition says it will do-and we can be deadly certain about this-is tax food, clothing and housing. The Housing Industry Association has estimated that that will add $10,000 to the cost of a new house. The Opposition will cut taxes on holidays and luxury goods. Again, the Minister for Finance has indicated that. Here we have a package which is justified, apparently, by the fact that Australia's economy is in diabolical straits. Let us look at the performance. As I said at the beginning of my speech, one of the important facets of structuring and restructuring this country was to improve manufactured exports. If one looks at the performance, one sees that manufactured exports between 1983-84 and 1989-90 have increased by 17 per cent. That is if one excludes things such as iron, steel and aluminium. We are not talking about those areas where traditionally we did well and had a good market; we are talking about things that are more complex than that and the manufacturing of which and the marketing of which are more complex than that. Last financial year, the increase in those manufactured exports was 25 per cent. We are talking about a total of $9.5 billion in manufactured exports in that area now, or 15 per cent of our total exports. Seven or eight years ago, it was 10 per cent. This is a significant shift in Australia 's export performance towards manufacturing. If one looks at the items that we are manufacturing, one will find that things such as scientific instruments, electrical machinery and even apparel exports are increasing significantly. One finds that, while the justification for this new package is that we have to be more efficient and improve our export performance, that has been occurring. Another justification for the package is that in Australia we presently have very high taxes. High taxes are mentioned in the manifesto document on page after page. If one looks at what is actually occurring in the world, one sees that Australia is the second lowest total taxing country on the basis of percentage of GDP in the OECD. Only Turkey comes below us. There is no validity in the claim made by members of the Opposition that we are a high taxing country. It is not true. We even come below Japan and the United States when it comes to total tax take. In the OECD, only Turkey has lower taxes than we have in Australia.",102
439,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,That was true 10 years ago.,103
440,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TREASURER,"No, that is the latest figure.",103
441,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,That was true. I have the book.,103
442,Dr CHARLESWORTH,TREASURER,"No, that is not true. If one looks at the tax mix and says, 'Okay, we rely too much on income tax', then Australia is still in the bottom third in the OECD. We are in the bottom third when one talks about marginal tax rates and reliance on income tax. So there is no justification when we look at those figures as to why one has to do this. 'Then we look at the suggestion that the present wholesale sales tax system allows us to target items according to whether they are luxuries and according to whether we believe that they are the sorts of things that should be taxed at different rates. It allows us to exempt food, clothing, housing, materials. The suggestion is that that system distorts the choice of production and processes and the choice of goods produced. Again, if one looks at the Treasury figures and the article by Mr Dodds that I will quote from in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, one finds that the Treasury says that for all inputs on wholesale sales tax the cost of production in agriculture, forestry and fishing is 1.07 per cent; in mining it is 1.52 per cent; in manufacturing it is 1.26 per cent; in electricity, gas and water production it is 1.26 per cent; in construction it is 2.21 per cent; and in services it is 1.64 per cent. The point that I am trying to make is that there is very little distortion. There is remarkable symmetry in those figures. Indeed, it is not the case, as is suggested by members of the Opposition, that this tax represents a huge distortion for producers and manufacturers. There is no evidence to suggest that that is the case. The Opposition suggests, of course, that the iniquitous, undesirable payroll tax will be eliminated by the introduction of the consumption tax and thereby we will increase the efficiency of taxing. Value added directly or indirectly by labour is what is taxed, and it is exactly the same as the consumption tax. In fact, the consumption tax and payroll tax are indistinguishable. The suggestion made by members of the Opposition is again a fallacy. The whole foundation of its tax structure and the whole reason for developing the program it is wanting to develop is falling apart. As we go through the next 18 months and as we day after day look at this package more closely and scrutinise it, we will find again and again that there are huge holes in it. If a small business association thinks that this is the best thing since sliced bread, I would ask it to think about those small businesses that have a payroll of less than half a million dollars. They do not pay payroll tax at the moment. There is no payroll tax for them. There is no truth in suggesting that suddenly all of those small businesses, particularly those which are exempted from payroll tax in most States because they have a payroll figure of less than half a million dollars, will benefit. There is no impost of payroll tax presently, but what they will find with the consumption tax is that there will be a huge impost. There will be a value added tax on the labour component, whether it is direct or indirect. So the suggestion that in some way this is some sort of a panacea in respect of the efficiency of our taxing is again wrong. Look at international experience and Australia's circumstances at the moment. Nick Greiner, of all people, was saying yesterday in Japan that we now have low inflation in Australia-the lowest inflation for 20 years. We have come to that position not without considerable pain in this country. It is important that we hold onto our position. The timing of the goods and services tax is absolutely absurd. It is the last thing we need now in this country. The last thing we need now is a blow-out in inflation. It is unambiguously the case that low inflation countries are the countries that are doing best in trade and best in employment growth. If Australia is to do well in those two areas, which are absolutely critical to our future, it is absolutely important that we have low inflation during this decade. The Opposition's proposal would blow that out of the water. All of those gains, hard won as they have been, will be lost. The suggestion that the CPI increase will be 4.5 per cent is again mythical. I only need to turn to the document to emphasise this point. For a start, the Opposition is going to cut $1 billion from the States. There is a suggestion that the States will not increase their charges. As if they would not increase taxes and charges! In relation to education and health costs, the following statement is made on page 45 of the document: We estimate that the price of health and education services will fall by up to one per cent. The Opposition will introduce a goods and services tax and supposedly the price of health will fall by up to one per cent. It is suggesting that, for instance, we will be able to buy gap insurance and the doctor will be able to charge us whatever he likes. The AMA schedule of fees is 30 per cent above the set of fees that we have at the moment. Yet we are told that the cost of health care will fall. This proposition is absolutely absurd. Nobody believes it and no-one should believe it because it is wrong. It is clear that if doctors are able to charge what they like and if people pay for gap insurance-which is a nonsense anyway; it only allows the doctors to charge more-we will have the sort of blow-out in health care costs that we have seen in the United States and the cost to the CPI will be substantial. We have already suggested that there will be a significant increase in inflation. The relationship between interest rates and inflation is clear. The fact that the Opposition does not have a wages policy is also very clear. It is absurd to suggest that these increases in inflation will not flow into interest rates-thereby into the cost of mortgages, rents and other costs that people have to pay-and wages. It is clear that there will be a significant inflationary effect. This will occur through health costs, cuts to the States and increases in interest rates. It will occur as housing costs, mortgages and rents increase; it will occur for a whole lot of reasons. The cost to Australia will be significant, the cost to workers will be significant and all of the gains that we have made during the 1980s will be lost. One other thing that I want to address very quickly is the suggestion that by reducing the excise costs on petrol we are going to produce some sort of panacea. It needs to be understood that there are price elasticity effects from reducing the price of petrol. It is suggested that there will be a 25 per cent increase in fuel consumption. Besides all of the environmental costs, this increase in petrol consumption represents $1.5 billion a year added to our current account deficit. I am trying to point out that once again what we have is a package which is made up of mirrors and smoke. It is a package which will fall apart over time. We have a long time to go. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, this is a long distance race and we are only on the first lap. During the next months, day after day, as we go through this package, bits of it will fall to pieces and the coalition's vision will be blinded. (Time expired)",103
443,Unknown,TREASURER,Sitting suspended from 6.34 to 8 p.m.,105
444,Mr SINCLAIR,TREASURER,"Prior to dinner and throughout most of this afternoon we have been talking about the only subject that most Australians are discussing these days. Incredibly, though, it is the first time that this House has had a considered opportunity to deal with the whole substance of the issue. Yet what are we doing? We are not dealing with the issue itself; we are dealing with a censure of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin). The motion states that this House should censure the Treasurer for failing to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation-the Fightback package. For about three hours we have been going from side to side looking at where and why the Government has lost the vision. If we thought that it was only in this place that the debate is in progress, I can tell honourable members that over the dinner break I happened to hear some appalling statistics from the Bureau of Statistics, released today, which indicated that in the last few months the number of Australian families with no member of the family in the work force has risen from 21 to 25 per cent; that over the last few months the number of husbands out of work has risen by 69 per cent; and that, of those families affected, 75 per cent have no family member in the work force. We have more than one million people out of work. It is in that climate, with the Fightback program having been launched so effectively by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) nearly a fortnight ago and the House resuming after having been in recess for two weeks, that I would have thought the first thing the Government would have done would be to come back into the House and say, 'Look, we have a vision; we know where we are going'. But as everybody will recall, we had a so called employment statement-which indeed is quite a misnomer-by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) immediately before the House rose. That might never have been made; it did not deal with the substantive issues. It was totally peripheral to the fundamental debate. Yet the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have failed to come into the House and say, 'Look, we recognise that things are tough, we see that there are alternate programs, but we want to tell you why we are not accepting them'. But that is not the way it has gone. We have had all this hint and innuendo. We have had this suspicion and, as the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) said before dinner, it is all shifting and covered by a smokescreen; it is all part of a thimble and pea trick. I compliment the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). I think it is the most comprehensive package that I have ever secn produced, not just in economic terms, because I guess many budgets are produced in that way, but it has brought a whole new philosophy to the people of Australia. It has done exactly as John Curtin would have done. Many Government members like to claim him as one of their guiding stars. He used to talk about the light on the hill. The light on the hill is pretty well extinguished for the Labor Party. One would not even think that the Government knew where it was going. We have seen successively worse unemployment figures; we have seen record bankruptcies; we have seen many of our major and significant companies produce balance sheets that are way behind the figures that might be expected. It is no use just talking about the 19808 and saying, 'Look, that was a decade of extravag-nce, of greed', or whatever epithet one likes to apply to it. The reality is that it was the decade of the Labor Party. Since 1983 the policies of this country have been those of the Australian Labor Party. They have been the policies of Prime Minister Hawke, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and, latterly, Treasurer Kerin. It is Treasurer Kerin against whom this censure motion is addressed. The first thing I wanted to do was to say to the people of Australia that the Labor Party has lost its way, whether we are looking at overseas debt or at export earnings. In 1989 a massive 69 per cent of GOP was needed just to service that exploding gross foreign debt. It really is appalling when one moves around the bush as I do-not just in the cities but in those smaller country towns-to see the number of people who are wondering whether or not they can survive. This Labor Party, which once used to pretend it was a party for the working man, has deserted those who work; it has deserted those who labour; it has deserted those who have children, whether they are one-parent or two-parent families. The Labor Party has forgotten about the people who elected it. This debate is properly a censure of the Treasurer, who has failed to come into this House to address the first genuine hope that Australians have had for a long time. People need to understand that the package is not just proposing a new goods and services tax. For a long while, like many people, I looked at the package and thought, 'Well, goodness me, if it introduces only one new tax, what is it going to do'? Of course, it starts from a premise involving two areas that the Labor Party has failed to address. The first is microthere economic reform. Sure, we have had rhetoric and we have produced figures about what is happening on the waterfront. I guess even the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) might have been in Singapore recently. If he has been he would have seen how dramatically they have improved their performance in contrast to ours. I think it would be a good idea if the Minister got out. He has made a mess of AQIS. I noticed the appalling statement he produced on that. But that is for another day. Perhaps we ought to censure him tomorrow. He deserves it.",105
445,Mr GRIFFITHS,TREASURER,Ask me a question tomorrow.,106
446,Mr SINCLAIR,TREASURER,"We are happy to return tomorrow. We will be talking about a number of matters tomorrow, as the Minister would know. The important thing we want to understand is that micro-economic reform has stalled under the Labor Party. It is essential that micro-economic reform be put in placewith none of this rhetoric. An important part of the package involves cutting down in a number of areas of gross extravagance pursued by the Labor Party. I have heard all sorts of arguments about the $10 billion reduction in expenditure that the Government says is going to be impossible to achieve. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was pooh-poohing the idea, saying 'You can't possibly cut by that amount'. The reality is that unless we do cut by that amount there are going to be a lot more bankrupt Australians, there are going to be a lot more unemployed Australians, and there are going to be a lot more major companies going into receivership. Those on the Government side cannot apply disciplines forever to the private sector and expect government to continue to grow fat. Unfortunately, micro-economic reform cannot take place until there has been significant privatisation, until there have been significant cuts in Federal, State and local government expenditure, and until there has been radical reform of work practices. There is a second part to our program-it is not even a major part of Fightback-and that is our industrial relations policy. I know there has been a bit of an emotive concern out in some sectors, really egged on by a few of these Labor members, that somehow this is all going to be bad for them. Those who are opposed to our industrial relations policy seem to have forgotten that, sadly, over the last few years the trade union movement has increasingly been a movement looking after its own hierarchy; it has not been a movement looking after the people of Australia. We hear a great deal of rhetoric about those who are still in the unions and in the work force. They have been pretty silent about their fellow members who, as a result of work practices and shady deals, have been thrown onto the shelf of unemployment. That is a tragedy, because there is an important place in Australia for the trade union movement. I have always had a great deal of personal respect for Bill Kelty, but I am afraid he seems to me-like the honourable member for Blaxland-to have been set aside, to have been forgotten, in trying to develop some sort of a rational alternative to the accord. That is the important part of our industrial relations policy. As one who was involved in the days of the wages pause back in 1982-83, I pay full credit to the Prime Minister for the manner in which he found a way, through that national economic summit, to get out of that log jam of the wages pause.",106
447,Mr GRIFFITHS,TREASURER,You did not at the time. That is misleading.,107
448,Mr SINCLAIR,TREASURER,"The Minister would not even know. He was a babe in arms, and he still is. When he grows up I will bother responding. The point is that at that time. I did give credit where it was due; I said that the national economic summit was the only way. The Government was bereft of ideas; it had no policies. It had no labour policy, no wages policy and no tax policy; it had nothing to offer the Australian people except the national economic summit. I said at the time, 'There is one thing you can say for Hawke""'-he had nothing else but he had a summit, and that summit was the only way you ever found to move towards an accord'. That was achieved by a few shifty deals and by knocking a few industrialists who should have known better into the negotiations that made the industrial accord. Of course, he is not a Hawke supporter. He is all there for the honourable member for Blaxland, but that is another shady deal. Those factional compromises that are a product of Labor today are one of the reasons that this censure has to go through. The industrial relations policy that we offer is one that finds a way out of the accord. The accord locks us into unemployment, as evidenced by those appalling statistics from the ABS I referred to a moment ago. We seek micro-economic reform and an industrial relations policy as a launching pad for a total tax and economic policy that will begin as of 1 October 1994. We have presented a total package in which seven taxes are abolished and another significant group of taxes is modified. Then we have the prospect of two million more jobs by the year 2000. I do not intend in my remaining few minutes to go into the details of the Fightback package. I complimented the Leader of the Opposition by saying that I think this is the best thing that has happened to Australia in years. The sad part about the Government is that, while the Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa, was acclaimed in some quarters-goodness knows why-for some of the changes he made in the rural sector, they are a major contributor to the disaster that faces the Australian family farmer today. Dr Harry Edwards-He didn't win one issue.",107
449,Mr SINCLAIR,TREASURER,"Not only did he not win one issue; he has left a heritage of absolute disruption and decay in the marketplace. There is now no stability in any of those industries that are under stress. For generations there has been a concept that there ought to be some backstop. But the backstop has gone; the wicket-keeper has thrown it all away; he has switched to become the Treasurer. All I can say for Australians is pity help us. We have a Treasurer who failed as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What eatthly chance is there for him to produce a package to answer this comprehensive Fightback light on the hill? The important part about tonight's debate, following as it does this extraordinarily inadequate defence by the Treasurer, by successive Ministers and by a few Government backbenchers, is that, as the motion says, they still have failed to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation. I think it is time that we had a look at the future. I have spoken to many people who are quite distraught at the enormous difficulties they face under policies that people such as the Minister for Resources, who is at the table, are pursuing. Let us consider AQIS. I have never known a disaster greater than that over which he currently presides. It is appalling that he is not even prepared to delegate authority to abattoirs and meat works to inspect their own product. What he has done adds enormously to the cost of killing animals around Australia. We all know about the appalling work practices in this area. He has come in here with a half-hearted package and said that everything will be all right. But he is like the Treasurer-he does not know where to go. He is filling; he is trying to get things patched up-trying to think whether it might get him through for another couple of months. He has produced a survey of the industry. He says, 'That's great. We have accountants telling us what to do and I have picked up a little bit of it'. That is what the Treasurer is doing, but the Treasurer has not even picked up that little bit of it. The difficulty is that this House - not only this House, but Australiadeserves better. As we come to the end of 1991, we are told that we have the President of the United States coming to Australia. I was at a function earlier tonight with some Chinese representatives and one from Papua New Guinea. They said to me, 'It is sad. You have a great country with enormous resources and wonderful people. You have this magnificent edifice, the new Parliament House, but you have no hope'. China, in spite of Tiananmen Square and the disasters in human relations, is moving ahead economically. We were all appalled by the East Timor affair the other day, but Jakarta is booming and Indonesia is booming. They will have 200 million people by the turn of the century. What we want are two million more jobs. We want progress. We want the light on the hill. We want to censure the Treasurer for his total incompetence, his inability to address the problems of the nation adequately, and the Government as a whole, including the Prime Minister, for failing to come into this House to provide a comprehensive alternative package that might give all those distressed Australians some hope for tomorrow.",107
450,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"This censure motion is a fraud, just like the Opposition's package is a fraud. It is unfortunate that I have only 15 minutes to speak, because I would like to speak for about three hours, to go through this sham piece by piece. I remember hearing from my family criticisms of Chifley and Curtin, when they were in government, similar to the criticisms we are hearing today. So those on the other side who have the audacity to praise Chif or Curtin ought to go back in history and remember that, when Menzies was hiding under the bed and the Japanese were coming down towards Australia, it was the Labor Party that led this country and freed us from that threat. Where was the Opposition then? It was under the bed. Let us not forget that. After the war, what did they do to Chifley? They persecuted him. Let us in this House not forget that, today or any other time, and let no person on the other side try to praise the memory of Chif or Curtin when their forebears on the other side ran them down, dragged them down and persecuted a great man, in Ben Chifley, from 1946 to 1949 and then supported the propositions of people such as Menzies who voted him out in 1949. Let us get that straight for a start. There is only one party that understands about the light on the hill, and that is the Australian Labor Party. That will not be taken away from us, nor will the propositions, the views or the beliefs in a future for this country. There is no doubt that Australia is facing tough times. The Western world is facing tough times. We are in a world recession. The way to get out of it is to have a bit of courage and make some sensible decisions, as the Government has done. The way to get out of it is not to go down the path of this new package put forward by the Opposition, which would redistribute wealth to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. If we look at every recession we have faced from 1890-91 to this day, it has been in tough times that the Opposition has put forward the views and ideologies about attacking the working people of tills country to get them to carry their share of burden. The working class people of tills country have done that in the past, but they are not going to be traded off as pawns in the ideologies of the Opposition and as servants of the rich. The only thing that I do agree with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) about is that there is a clear distinction, and tills package in one regard is the best thing that has happened to this country, because it gives us a clear focus on what both this side of the House, the Labor Party, and those opposite stand for. I think the most important thing that will come out in the debates over the next six and 12 months is what this package means and what we represent. I am very proud of our record-and so is anyone else who understands it-on home and community care, veterans' affairs, housing, health and education, and the family allowance supplement, a system that is indexed every year. The money that used to finance the free lunches that existed under the Opposition is now going to low income working families and family allowance. The previous speaker criticised AQIS. When the other side was in power we saw kangaroo meat being sold overseas and our beef industry being dragged down because there was no accountability. I well remember standing on the same platform as the right honourable member for New England in Monto in 1988 talking about drought and the effect on our rural community. The right honourable member for New England was not to know at the time, any more than I did, that, while we were debating and comparing and concerning ourselves with the problems that farmers were facing in that terrible drought in my area in 1988, the National Party State Government of that time allowed $30m of money that was distributed for drought to be rorted into the system that went into the pockets of a bunch of greedy graziers. It is a pity that today that money could not go back into the pockets of the deserving people-not the corrupt crooks whose pockets it went into, the sleaze factor of the landed gentry and the wealthy that ripped off",108
451,Mr GRIFFITHS,TREASURER,Which Party was that?,109
452,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"It was the National Party, as the Minister says. I have some respect for the right honourable member for New England because he has some courage and he does have some principles. He was betrayed by the sleaze factor in the National Party in Queensland and by the factional heavies, like Bjelke-Petersen and Sparkes. Of course, it is a pity that unfortunately he is sitting on the back bench. He could add some punch to the debate. But while he is languishing on the back bench, we have a bunch of neanderthals in the National Party on the front bench, and the reason they wear elastic sided boots is that they do not have the brains to know how to tie up their shoelaces. In fact, if the devotees of Charles Darwin ever want any fertile ground to prove their point, they need only go to the Queensland branch of the National Party.",109
453,Mr LAVARCH,TREASURER,What about Don Lane and Brian Austin?,109
454,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"Exactly. But let us get onto the real issue which the right honourable member for New England mentioned, because tills package is more than just the GST. This package is about industrial relations. The right honourable member for New England understands it, and so do we. This package is about destroying award conditions. It is about the same principle for which we on this side of the House have fought for 100 years. Just to show where this debate is going, and because the ultra Right, the New Right, the heroes of the New Right on the other side, in their yuppie suits, from their yuppie suburbs, want to pick on the workers of this country, I will quote from the Courier-Mail of Monday, 25 November 1991, where the Editor said: Coincidentally, tourism luminaries point to the absence of tipping in the Australian culture as, in these days of institutionalised molly-coddling, a signal barrier to enterprise and effort. It is suggested that the Australian tourism industry, or at least the hotel sector within it, would be much better off paying its staff less and making them work for tips. As I have said, nothing has changed; Opposition. members want workers to live on charity t6day, just as they did in 1891. In fact, I have another great little quote I would like to read out, because it goes to the very essence of this principle. It goes to what Opposition members want to do-that is, break down award conditions, bring in voluntary agreements, get rid of the accord, get rid of the union movement through sections 45D and 45E, drag unions into the court and break them. I am quoting from the Bundaberg Sugar Co's history of the industry in my city of Bundaberg: At Bonna men had to work from 6 am to 6 pm six days a week, the only concession being a 4 pm finishing time on Saturdays. At Avondale, 58 hours work was expected for one pound ($2) per week plus rations, with a tin of jam supposed to last the men for a week. We changed that and we got a Labor government in Queensland; we formed a union called the Australian Workers Union, which got rid of slave labour and gave people a bit of dignity. That is what it is about today, because nothing has changed. As I said last night and I will say again, we are working class boys on this side and we are proud of it. We do not intend to allow the people who represent privilege today to do what their predecessors did a hundred years ago, because the only thing which separates them from the cave is their yuppie suits. Nothing has changed. This package is a Stone Age package; it is bringing people back to the cave. It is dividing the community. If we look at the Opposition's idea of reducing wages by 20 per cent for the unemployed and getting them to work for up to 18 months for 20 per cent less than the award rate, we realise that they will be employed-of course they will be employed by the thousands-but those people who are presently employed will be sacked to make way for these who are going to be working for wages reduced by 20 per cent, and they will get into the work force at the expense of the workers who are presently on ordinary conditions. Mr Hulls interjecting",109
455,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"Exactly, as the honourable member for Kennedy says. He understands it; he represents Barcaldine, where our Party struied. So does the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who represents another great Labor seat, understand it. This is about a class war and, over the next 18 months, we are going to see many battles. It was interesting tonight that some of the previous speakers mentioned their views on our Party and criticised people in this Party for having different points of view. I would like to let them into a little secret, because obviously they are ignorant of the history 0f our Party. Our Party is the only Party that is like a family. We might have our differences; we might have our different points of view, ranging from the left wing of the' spectrum to the right wing of the spectrum. But when it comes to defending our own and the principles we believe in, we are united 100 per cent. As we get closer over the next 12 months to the next election, honourable members opposite are going to find the greatest fight they have ever had in their lives. And we are going to win because we have to win, because we are all that stands between that lot on the other side of the House and the aged, the infirm, the unemployed, single parents, and everybody else in this community who would be sacrificed so that they can please themselves with the privilege that they represent and the Melbourne Club and everything else that I find repugnant on their side of this House. Let me tell them that any repugnance they have for us supporting the union movement or organised labour is more than outweighed by the repugnance we have for the privilege, preference and prejudice that they show on their side of the House. When I see the hypocrisy of trying to use a worldwide recession to talk down our economy, talk down our great nation, to try to grubbily crawl their way back into power, it makes me sick. Those opposite would not be able to spell 'pride' or 'nationhood' or 'motherhood'. Getting onto single parents, as I said last night, I know a lot of great people who, through illness, through cancer, through car accidents, are single parents, It takes me back to the last war when many women became war widows through the loss of their men fighting for this country. Honourable members opposite are showing great insensitivity in attacking those sorts of people at the same time as they are going to throw privilege at the feet of the wealthy. That is why I say to honourable members opposite that nothing has changed in 100 years. This is the message that is going to spread right across this country in the next 12 months. This is not just about a little slick second-hand car sales deal with a GST, a real snazzy little package. It is more than that. This is about industrial relations; this is about welfare; this is about the very heart of what we represent; and it is about what honourable members opposite represent-and that is privile?e and greed. That is why I am pleased, as I sald and as the right honourable member for New England said, that this is a clear distinction, because it will allow for the first time since the Great Depression an opportunity for people to focus on the clear choice in this country, the clear choice between representing all Australians fairly and equitably or representing privilege. That is what it is about. Honourable members opposite represent the trickle down effect. Their mates get the glass of champagne and what spills out of the top trickles down to everyone else. That is what this is all about. Of course, we get back to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) saying that most people support it. I have a shock for the boys opposite. A few years ago, there was a thing called the ID card that most people supported but after six months no-one supported it-and that was a pity, admittedly. But that is what is going to happen to the GST. No-one is going to support it over the next six months, and we will see how many nervous nelHes on the other side of the House start to break ranks. Mr Deputy Speaker, see the clowns who used to sit over there, the members of the National Party? They will be the first to run out the door. Mr Les Scott-Straight to Boggo Road.",110
456,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"Exactly, straight to Boggo Road.",111
457,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for the Hinkler should not reflect upon members of the House. He should withdraw.,111
458,Mr COURTICE,TREASURER,"I withdraw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is only the ones in Queensland State Parliament who have gone to Boggo Road. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he would resign if the GST went over 15 per cent. That may happen. We can use hypothetical cases here. Of course, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), may resign, but that still leaves the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the hono-able member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and, hke Curly of the Three Stooges, he will certainly enforce that proposition and I believe, increase the GST. Nevertheless, if the Leader of the National Party resigns and if he goes to Deniliquin to apply for a job at the CES, he would find under a conservative government that the CES was amalgamated with the DSS; then he would find through regionalisation that he would have to go to Albury to look for a job, because it would be closed. That is the sort of proposition honourable members opposite want to put forward. Of course, what they have forgotten to mention is the reduction in wholesale sales tax right across this country, a reduction of over half a billion dollars by 1992-93 off the back of farmers, off the back of mining. It is interesting as we go around this country and talk to people in rural Australia that they have not been aware of that, but they will become aware of it over the next 12 months. So I am looking forward to this debate as we face up to the principles that we represent on this side and privilege on the other side. And, quite frankly, honourable members.opposite can beat this drum as long as they hke, but they are not going to win because this country cannot afford to have another tory government.",111
459,Mr ANDREWS,TREASURER,"I am glad that I came and listened to what the h-no-able member for H-lder (Mr Courtice) sald m response to an lmportant motion, because I thought that sort of old-fashioned dose of socialist claptrap had gone out at least 10 or 20 years ago. Mr Courtice-It is still there, mate' it is still there. '",111
460,Mr ANDREWS,TREASURER,"All he can say in response is, 'It is still there'. That is about the substance of the response we have heard from the Australian Labor Party in relation to not only this motion, but also the Fightback package generally. It is sheer arrogance of Government members to say, 'We are the only ones who know; we are the only ones who can protect the family and the working class', as if all the workers were on the other side of the House. That sort of nonsense can also be seen when they say that members on this side of the House are all members of the Melbourne Club. They ought to find out what bodies we are members of; they would find that quite a few of us, far from being members of the Melbourne Club, have never even been inside it. That is the sort of socialist nonsense that we still get from the Labor Party locked into this 1930s, 1940s and 1950s outlook on the world. Of course, that is the way in which it has taken Australia down the drain in the last 10 years. It is arrogance of it to say, 'We are the family'. The mafia is 'the Family', too, and that is the sort of treatment this country is getting under Labor at present. Let me go back to the substance of this motion. The motion reads: That this House censures the Treasurer for failing to constructively and in a measured and informed way debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation-the Fightback package. That is precisely what has happened. I was trying to think of a way in which one could characterise what has gone on in this Parliament over the last few days, particularly in relation to the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) himself, but also, I suppose, in relation to the Government generally. I thought the best way of characterising it was done so well for me by the artist and the author of the cartoon in last Saturday'S Weekend Australian. The cartoon is entitled 'Bustards of the Bush'. In that cartoon we have a Hawke-like creature and another creature which resembles in caricature the current Treasurer of this country. The Hawke-like creature says to the figure resembling the Treasurer, 'Whaddaya you doin'?', to which the reply comes from the Kerin-like creature, 'Hypnotising a chook with your employment statement'. I mean, that is good enough, but he then asks, 'Wodja think of Hewson's GST?'. Then, of course, we get the line that we have heard-and this is a caricature of what we have simply had in this Parliament for the last few days-' A product of cold, computer-driven theories! But I'll reserve my judgment till I read it to this chook'. It might as well be read to a chook, in view of the nonsense we have heard from the Labor Party in the House in the last few days. A chook might have a better chance of understanding it. In fact, if the Treasurer were a hen, his rate of production would be such that he would probably find himself on the dining room table fairly quickly. What we have seen in this Parliament is a government completely out of control. We saw the Prime Minister wandering around here for 13 minutes in answer to a question in Question Time. It took the Prime Minister 13 minutes to wander around and attempt to answer a question. What was the question? Let me remind honourable members of the question. The substance of it was: will the Prime Minister end this confusion and tell the House whether the Government will offer tax cuts before the next election? If so, how will he pay for them? One might think that is a fairly simple, straightforward and reasonable question to ask the Prime Minister of this country. But what did we get? We got the Prime Minister wandering around in a sort of daze. All he could finally do was pull out an article written by an economist for the Australian Financial Review. Economists are a bit like lawyers-guns for hire. One can get an economist to say what one likes. Of course, one can always pick out a statement from an economist that will support any case. The Prime Minister found a statement in the Financial Review and he relied on it for about two days to answer the same questions. The reality is that the Prime Minister could have avoided that question. All the Prime Minister had to say was, 'Look, you fellows have had 18 months to develop this package. You have been telling us that you have been putting in a lot of work in developing it and going through it in detail. How do you expect me, having just seen the package at the end of last week, to give you a comprehensive answer to these sorts of questions now?'. The Prime Minister could have allowed the question to go through to the keeper, but he did not. This Government and this Prime Minister was so rattled four and five days after the package came out that the Prime Minister wandered around the dispatch box for 13 minutes trying to answer a simple question that was put to him as the leader of this country. We .now have this sad little mocked figure of a Prime Minister who wanders around the dispatch box, yet members opposite still say, 'This is the great Government we have got'. As I sit here and watch the Ministers on the treasury bench, it reminds me of one of those marine landscapes which are not unusual on the south coast of places like New Zealand and South America. As Disraeli said: You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes and, ever and anon, the dark rumbling of the sea. We know where the rumbling is coming from. It is coming from the honourable member for Blaxland (Me Keating). The rumbling is getting louder and louder everyday. Count Dracula's party is about to begin. The 44 Keating supporters will soon grow in number as the rumbling continues, while we have this Prime Minister and Treasurer wandering around in the daze that they are in and have been in over the last few days. This is the situation that this country has got into. Let us step back for a moment to take a snapshot, as someone on the Government back bench would say, of the big picture of Australia today. It is not a pretty sight. Home loan defaults have skyrocketed. This has always been the sign of total crisis as people go without food rather than not pay for the mortgage. In Victoria, home loan defaults have risen by more than 50 per cent in the last 18 months as a result of high unemployment, high interest rates and less prudent lending by financial institutions, according to the international ratings agency, Moody's. Then there is another example of what is going on out there in the community-foster care. The number of children going into foster care and residential care in this country has also shot up markedly in the last few years. In Victoria, it has doubled because of this recession, according to the private welfare agencies. Children are even going to school hungry. A report in the Herald-Sun newspaper a week ago stated that teachers at two Albury primary schools are using their own money to pay for needy children who are hungry when they get to school. Teachers in two primary schools in Albury-not the back blocks, but a huge provincial city-are pooling money from their own pockets so that children who turn up to school without anything to eat get breakfast and lunch. That is the state to which this country has come in the eight years of this Labor Government. We can blame this on not only the Treasurer, against whom this censure motion is directed, but also other members of the Government, including the back bench, but particularly the Prime Minister and the other members of the Ministry. In Albury, for example, a total of 47 children in the two schools are being fed that way by teachers. Then there are the beggars. People who have visited the major cities in Australia in the last few months would have seen that the number of people who have approached them for food or money for food has increased. There have always been some examples of that in our major cities, but it has certainly increased in the last couple of years. Mr Tim Fischer-Not just in the capital cities.",112
461,Mr ANDREWS,TREASURER,"We have these people in not only capital cities, as the Leader of the National Party points out, but also other cities around the country and also in the country areas. So we have people out there in dire need. The number of bankruptcies in this country is higher than it has been for 60 years. The latest figures show that one in every 1,000 adults in Australia was declared bankrupt in the last financial year. Personal bankruptcies rose to 13,091 in the year to last June from 8,636' a year earlier. Ten years ago, the figure was only 5,153 and 20 years ago it was only 2,428. Today we have over 13,000 bankruptcies. The rate of personal bankruptcies for every million Australians has soared from 37 to 762 in the past 40 years. More than half of that increase has been in the last five years under deregulation and the policies of this Government. The worse is yet to come because in the last three months there have been 4,764 personal bankruptcies. This is an 18 per cent increase from the June quarter and a 72 per cent increase from the same quarter in 1990-91. This means that the figures for 1991-92, when they finally come out, will be even worse. Business bankruptcies, as we all know, have also soared. This is the sort of situation that we have under this Government. The Government is not even prepared to respond in any sort of meaningful way to the package which has been presented in the last few days by the coalition. One could go on to quote these statistics about what is going wrong with this country. All we hear in reply in this debate is that Australia has the second lowest rate of taxation in the world. Take that message out to the people in the streets of Australia and see how they react. If the Government believes that is the answer to the nation's I invite it to run the next election campaign on the basis that Australia has the second lowest rate of taxation in the world. There would be a resounding defeat for the Labor Party if it dared. Mr Ronaldson-There will be anyway. Mr ANDREWSThere will be anyway, as the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) points out. But there will be an even more resounding defeat if the sort of nonsense we have heard in this chamber in the last few days were repeated out there in the streets and suburbs of Melbourne. Of course, we have the unemployment situation which has been repeated over and over again in this Parliament. The fact is that we have a figure of nearly one million people being officially unemployed. Who knows how many more beyond that are unemployed or underemployed? What is worse than this is that, under this Government, the very middle ground of Australia has been made worse off. A recent study released by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales shows that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers under this Government. They have suffered a 20 per cent drop in their share of national income since 1975 while well-off families have increased their share by 10 per cent. This is the most recent data from the Social Policy Research Centre which uses income surveys, wage data, tax statistics and census data to chart recent trends. The great middle ground of Australia-the people earning $20,000, $40,000, up to $50,000; 95 per cent of Australian taxpayers-are the people who have been hit time and time again by this Government. All we get in relation to a major economic package which has been put forward is the sort of nonsense that we have continued to hear from the Government over the last few days. It has no answers except to come in here and repeat messages that have been shown to be untrue. If one tells a lie and repeats it often enough, the theory is that some people will believe it. So we get the message that every item in the ills, supermarket is now going to go up by 15 per cent when the reality is that when one takes off the wholesale sales tax, excises, transport costs and payroll tax-a tax on employment itself-there will not be a 15 per cent increase on all these products out there in the supermarket. But will anyone hear that from this Labor Government? Of course not. We just hear the same lies again and again. All we have heard in the last couple of days is the nonsense which has been disproved about road funding. No matter how much the Government is told that the nonsense it is talking is just that, it still gets repeated. If the Government keeps saying it, perhaps some people will believe it. The reality is, as John Arburthnott once said, that all political parties die at last of swallowing their own lies. We can see that happen before us in the case of this particular Government. Do not let the facts get in the way of a good argument. That is the approach that this Government has adopted. It reminds me of the advice that I received when I first went to the bar. I was told by a senior barrister, 'Listen, Andrews: if you are strong on the law, go in there and thump the law. If you are strong on the facts, go in there and thump the facts. If you are strong on neither, then go in there and thump the table'. That is all we have heard from the Government; thumping of the dispatch box day after day, wandering around, thumping away, saying the same old things that do not make sense at all, when all we are asking for is some sort of reasonable reply' to this. What this Government is in trouble is thumping the table. In the last couple of days we have seen honourable members opposite even thumping the man. We are reduced to witnessing what happens to a government when it gets into this sort trouble. We have seen it cyclical times over. It starts playing the man. That is what we have seen here time and time again. All I say to this Government about this hopeless response on the part of the Treasurer and Government generally is to remind it of Cromwell said to the Rump Parliament in 1654, and I say it to this Government: not fit that you sit here any longer. Go, I say, go. It is not fit that you should sit there any longer.",113
462,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.45 p.m.)I think probably in another few years the honourable member for Menzies (Mr taxation Andrews) will give up on his classical alor lusions and the old saws of the various barOpposition risters. Even I, not a lawyer, heard that little piece of advice years ago from people assumed they knew something about the law. Of course, in politics we always ignore that and get to the facts. One of the interesting things about members of the Opposition in this debate is that they have constantly called for us to debate this issue with them. When they actually get up to debate the issue, they say, 'You cannot criticise this package because it is a whole thing'. They say that every single element of it stands up. This entire 700-page document, which is supposed to cover every conceivable element of Australian society and public policy, stands up. So they do not actually want to engage in debate on the issues associated with this package. What they want to do is argue by assertion that what they have presented to the public is an unarguable proposition. Virtually all the respectable commentators-not necessarily all the interest groups but a fair proportion of them; the Opposition has had a deal of support from some of them-in this area have been picking the Opposition's package apart in the pages of the newspapers which do not immediately meet doing when it is the public eye. Mr Downer-It is not half true.",115
463,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Mayo has been sitting around in this place of asserting that all these people are supporting the Opposition. If members of the Opposition go through all the commentaries, particularly can those commentaries in the media which are attempting to make some effort to analyse the the content such as the commentators in the what Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, they will find it is that the commentators have been going through this particular exercise, taking apart their package in principle and in detail. It is no. surprise that that is exactly what they are / domg. . Rather than attempt to debate us on the issues of principle in the way in which the system is distributed in this country, to get into detail on what it is that the proposes to cut, how it proposes to cut it-because that is one of the great who unknowns in this package-Opposition me-bers come into this place and say, 'The entuety of Australian public policy in this country must revolve around the introduction of a goods and services tax'. Let me just put the issue on the Opposition's tax position very simply. It is, in the indirect taxation area, a transfer of the tax burden from big business and large income earners to small business and ordinary people. That is objectively what it is. Whilst the wholeMr Downer-Prove it, prove it.",115
464,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Why does not the honourable member stop heckling and start listening? Whilst it is true that the wholesale sales taxes do fall on some goods which are consumed by the average Australian, the substantial proportion of wholesale taxes falls heaviest on big ticket items afforded by the wealthiest people in this community. Payroll tax falls heavily on large business in this country and on small business scarcely at all. In fact, 50 per cent plus of small businesses do not pay payroll tax. What the Opposition will find from looking at all the grocers, all the butchers and all the folk who actually provide the bulk of the materials by which people have life in this country, is that they do not pay payroll tax at the moment. The Opposition is saying to them, 'Boy, do we have a deal for you. Boy, have we got something worked out for you that you are really going to enjoy. You have never had to employ to this point an accountant for your daily dealings with your public and with the government but you will now do it. But, you lucky people, because the non-existent payroll tax has been removed from you, in order to assist you with your non-existent payroll tax, or to remove it for you, we will lift company tax imposed on you from 39c in the dollar to 42c'. What a deal! Mr Downer-That is a tax on profits.",116
465,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,What a presentation! Mr Downer-Do you know the difference?,116
466,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"I do not think the honourable member does. Mr Downer-You don't, do you?",116
467,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,Let me go through the facts.,116
468,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Mayo is the next speaker in this debate; he should restrain himself.,116
469,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Let me go through the figures which are presented in the Opposition's paper concerning its view of where we stand in the taxation stakes in relation to OECD countries. One of the most glaring of the many inaccurate figures in the document occurs at page 8, where it states: Australia has the fourth highest personal tax burden of the 24 DECO countries. That is a lie. Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, not only is the figure accurate, but I ask the Minister to withdraw the word 'lie', which he continually asks others to withdraw.",116
470,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,I am prepared to withdraw except that I was not accusing any member of the Opposition of a lie; I was referring to a document. Mr Downer- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,116
471,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Mayo will resume his seat. The Minister did not accuse an individual of lying; he said a figure was a lie. I would hope, though, that the honourable Minister would be very careful about his choice of language in this area.",116
472,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"I am not accusing the honourable member of being· a liar at all, so he should not worry about it. Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point is not that the Minister would accuse any individual of being a liar; the point is, as the Minister would know, given his apparently long experience of Parliament, that the word 'lie' or 'liar' is an unparliamentary term and therefore should not be used in the House.",116
473,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Order! It has become the practice of the House, as I understand it, for the word 'lie' not to be unparliamentary unless it is directed at an individual.",116
474,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for drawing that to the attention of members of the Opposition. It is, obviously, helpful for them. Personal income tax in this country plus the Medicare levy raised revenue equivalent to 14.2 per cent of GDP in Australia in 1987. Personal income tax plus compulsory social security levies such as Australia's Medicare levy raised more than 14.2 per cent of GDP in 14 out of 23 OECD countries for which data is available. Mr Downer-So who was the liar?",116
475,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"Fourteen out of 23 is not the fourth highest personal tax burden, is it? Australia has the second heaviest dependence on payroll tax in the OECD. That ignores fact that the 'great bulk of OECD countries objectively. require employers to make compulsory social security contributions for their employees, with these contributions calculated as percentage of pay. Taking proper account these de facto payroll taxes, Australia's payroll taxes, at 1.7 per cent of GOP in 1987, were the third lowest of 23 OECD countries. Those opposite argue that, if we shift tax mix towards goods and services taxation, Australia will miraculously join the interthey national big league. But let us look at the facts. In 1987 goods and services taxation in Australia raised 9.3 per cent of GOP. In Germany the rate was 9.6 per cent; in Switshare zerland, 6.1 per cent; in the United States, per cent; in Japan, 3.9 per cent. What is magic about pushing up the taxation of goods and services? It has nothing to do with making Australia an internationally comremoval petitive economy, and the effect on get Australia's price level and inflationary expecactually tations would be positively detrimental to competitiveness. The taxation system those opposite propose will create an extraordinary distortion. We are going from a situation where we are more less in balance with equivalent countriessomewhat lower than a fair few of them in the indirect tax area; though higher than smaller number, perhaps another income tax area-of the 23 OECD countries. We are going to move to a situation where we will shift the tax base gigantically to indirect taxes-out of all proportion to the level of indirect taxes that are charged elsewherereduction with a very regressive taxation system resulinterested ting. These are the facts which have to be in this case. Honourable members opposite not want to argue them, but they are the facts that have to be argued. In this place we to argue the nature of the taxation burden country. which operates in this community. The burden is, in fact, not excessive by OECD standards. We are quite a low taxed nation by OECD will standards. Whether Australians believe that or not, we here in Parliament do not necessarily debate public policy within the framework of what people believe in their day to day the existence; we have to look at it a bit more In these circumstances, where we are quite a low taxed nation, honourable members a opposite wish to shift the taxation burden of enormously, to bring that taxation burden heavily down upon the ordinary citizen in this country. We move to how that will fall. We have in place what honourable members the opposite believe to be a compensation package, though the inflation figures on which base. it are bodgie. The Opposition also has in place an adjustment of taxation rates. The vast bulk of wage earners in this country eam less than $20,000 a year. Their of this cake will be a pittance. Those 5.0 who have a family income of about $45,000, so which applies to a lot of families, will hit very h,eavy marginal tax r-tes by what the Opposition will do in Medicare and in the of compensation once people start to up to those levels. If the Opposition were capable of implementing the taxation our system-which it is not, for reasons which I will outline-there would be, potentially, a small benefit for people on low incomes; it would be even-Steven, at best, for people with or families in the middle income bracket of $40,000 to $50,000; and there would be a gigantic tax benefit for those on incomes of a about $60,000 to $75,000. There will be a seven, in the huge benefit for them. Mr Downer-Prove it.",116
476,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,"It is from the Opposition's own figures. People on this level of income will benefit enormously from the price in the sorts of goods that they are in purchasing, which will come down from a level of 30 per cent wholesale argued sales tax to the level of the GST. The do propositions that the folk opposite have put forward will enormously shift the taxation have system to damage ordinary people in this On top of that, honourable members opposite will say that such benefits as they gain be a product of their Budget cuts. If there is any area of their set-up that will not stand up to analysis, it is their heroic assumptions about, what will go into their cuts in expenditure: Their opportunities to achieve those cuts in the first three years of government would be utterly negligible. But failure to achieve them would mean there would be no part of the pie available for income tax distribution, because those opposite would have spent the entire pie raised by shifts in the indirect base on th"", taxes that they replace and on the compensation package. They will then be left in a position where they cannot deliver. These are complex' arguments, but they will be put forward over the next 18 months and honourable members opposite will have to live with them. They will not be arguments based on scare campaigns, they will be based on compelling honourable members opposite to address the facts. Some policies will be very interesting. I suppose the area of myoid portfolio is where I feel most offended by what honourable members opposite are doing. They plan cuts of $2oom on defence outlays. We will be the only country in the Asia-Pacific region to lower its defence expenditure in real terms and the only country to spend as little as 2 per cent of GDP on defence. That is where we will be when the taxes get implemented. At least in this place we will be saved endless lectures from honourable members opposite on the inadequacies of our defence planning, because that will be untrue. This is a position of surrender in a critical area of public policy which honourable members opposite will rue. In this debate I do not have time to go into all those areas, but honourable members opposite will find plenty of argument as to the facts of what is being reduced and whether or not the public policy issues have been correctly addressed. We will be addressing them. If honourable members opposite cannot make every cent of those cuts hold up, they will have no income tax cuts. (TIme expired)",117
477,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"It is interesting that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) should so passionately say he wants to take the coalition on in debate, but no sooner than coming in here and delivering his homily, he walks out of the House again, not interested at all in the fact of the debate. In concluding this debate for the Opposition, I think the speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications is a very good place to start. Regardless of what he says about the coalition's Fightback program, he is effectively, as have all the previous speakers on the other side, defending the status quo. They support the policies that they have been pursuing over the last eight years. They are proud of them. They are proud of the one million people they have put out of work. They are proud of the $130 billion foreign debt this country has accumulated. They are proud of the enormous balance of payments crisis they have created in this country. They are proud of all those policies. The Minister for Transport and Communications who, when the pomposity of his portfolio is swept aside, is the honourable member for Swan, has the job of going out into the suburbs of Riverdale, Bentley and Kensington and telling those people in Perth that the policies of the Government that have created the worse recession we have had for 60 years are the right policies for Australia. I would have to say: whom does he think he is trying to kid? Whom do the previous speakers in the debate on the other side of the House-the Labor speakers-seriously think that they are trying to kid? We have come into this House and we have had at last a debate about the Fightback program of the coalition. Labor Party members have said for the last 18 months, 'Where are your policies?'. That is one of their constant cries. We have given them the most comprehensive policy program that has ever been put down in this Parliament since Federation, and the Labor Party nowMr Sciacca-It took 18 months.",118
478,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"The Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely right; it took 18 months. The Labor Party admits it cannot analyse it. It admits the computer that has been set up at taxpayers' expense-a- the expense of the people in the gallery, at the expense of the people in my electorate and at the expense of all Australians-does not work. What Government members have descended to is a rhetorical debate about the Fightback program. They have given no facts and no figures-just a lot of rhetoric. I will come back to that. Let us not forget that this debate is supposed to oe about the House censuring the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) for failing constructively and in a measured way to debate the merits of the only policy agenda before the nation, the Fightback package. So this debate is to a significant extent about the Treasurer himself. The Treasurer is the man who has walked away from the debate on this issue. He is the man who boasted with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) before the announcement of our Fightback program that it would be demolished on day one. But when it comes to the moment, the Treasurer has not been prepared to debate it. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in newspapers around Australia we are getting headlines such as that in the Australian on Monday, 25 November 1991, 'Kerin Pressured to Raise His Game' with a story explaining that there are members not just of the Labor backbench, but of the Ministry, who are concerned that the Treasurer's performance is 'uncertain and gaff prone' and that the great test for him will be whether he is capable of an attack on the GST in Parliament this week. He has not proved to be capable of that, and he is worthy of the censure of this House. Question Time today was an interesting illustration. Look at the dorothy dix questions that the Government members directed at their own Ministers. The Government decided, as it will, of course, again tomorrow, to spend Question Time attacking the coalition and our Fightback program. Why? Why does the Government not answer questions about Government policy? Why does the Government not go out and trumpet the achievements of the Labor Government? Because there are none. There is nothing to trumpet. All honourable members opposite can do is sneer and criticise and, by implication, defend their own inhumane record of the last eight years. It is interesting to note that the questions asked one after another by members of the Labor backbench were not directed to the Treasurer himself. I wonder why. There were questions to the Prime Minister. There were questions to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). There were questions to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). Eventually, after we had continually interjected, 'What has happened to the Treasurer?'-who presumably is responsible for taxation policy, which is an important part of the Fightback program-they decided to ask the Treasurer a question. It is interesting that Government members refrained from asking him a question for much of the day because the Australian Labor Party knows that the Treasurer cannot perform. Of course, the Treasurer's excuse is that he has Treasury officers-at taxpayers' expense-working away on a model to analyse the coalition's proposals. As I said earlier, interestingly enough the Treasury is not able to do that model without ringing some of the advisers the coalition has brought together to develop the program and asking them how to construct the economic model which they will then use to criticise the coalition's package. The Treasurer, the Prime Minister and other Ministers actually admit some of the time that they do not have the data or the information to attack the proposals the coalition has put forward. Well, if they say they do not have the data; if they say they do not have the information; if the Treasury is still ringing around the country trying to find out how to build an economic model to attack the coalition's proposals, why are members of the Labor Party so against it? Why all this empty rhetoric? Why at every opportunity do they say that this is simply the worse thing that has happened since the Second World War? They are frightened. They are frightened that the Australian public will throw them out because at last they have in our package a program which is visionary and shows a direction for this country. At long last they have a real reason to get rid of a government that has thrown nearly one million of them out of work. What a contrast the performance of the present Treasurer is with the approach we used to get from the former Treasurer, the honou,rable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)-the man who, to give him his due, always did his homework and always came into this House and gave a fighting performance. He would not have been fifth on the list of dorothy dix questions; he would have been the first Minister up to attack the Opposition. Whatever one may think of him as the man who, with the Prime Minister, created the recession and the unemployment we have, the fact is that he would have put up a spirited performance. Therefore, it is not surprising that members of the Labor Party behind the scenes in this Parliament are going around saying, 'We can't win with Hawke. We can't win with Kerin. They are disastrous. Let's bring back the honourable member for Blaxland'. They know that, partly because in their hearts they realise that the scare campaign they have started to run against the coalition's proposals, which they themselves admit is not based on any economic analysis or data, cannot work. One of the reasons why honourable members opposite know their campaign cannot work is that they themselves in 1985 proposed a broadly based goods and services tax of the type that we are proposing. They know that members of the public are not stupid; that the public are fully aware that was a proposal which the present Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland, supported by the Cabinet, put forward to the Australian community. It is a little hard to be perceived to be genuine by Australians if, in attacking a broadly based goods and services tax program, members of the Labor Party themselves supported one only five or six years ago. Let us look at some of the arguments honourable members opposite have run and let us think about them. They say they are not going to run a scare campaign, yet they come out and claim-we hear them on the talkback radio programs; we hear it in debates we have with them all around Australia-that under the coalition, prices in supermarkets will increase by 15 per cent. Mr Wright-And the rest.",118
479,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"There we have it. The great lie of the Labor Party. The Labor Party did not say back in 1985 that prices would increase by 12112 per cent because of its 121f2 per cent consumption tax. The Labor Party said that it would abolish the wholesale sales tax and that would have an impact on reducing prices. That is what we are saying. We will abolish the payroll tax, which those opposite do not want to abolish. We will also abolish the fuel excise tax, which those opposite want to keep. They want to keep the fuel excise and the payroll tax, but apparently they have no impact on prices. That is the great Labor lie. The Minister for Transport and Communications ran the old argument that taxes in Australia are not very high by OECD standards. What is the implication of that? Firstly, the message to the Australian people is, 'You are not heavily taxed'-a message that I am sure they would not warmly welcome. But the implicit Labor message is, 'We can and are going to tax you higher. We are not taxed very heavily as a country so why do we not bring ourselves up to the OECD average?'. That is what those opposite are saying. They are saying that there is nothing wrong with increasing taxes in this country. That is where they differ from us. We do not think it is a good idea to increase the burden that of taxation. Apparently those opposite think it is okay. Mr Courtice-On the rich.",120
480,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"Do not worry-I will come to that. Those opposite also claim that a 15 per cent goods and services tax is bound to go up-talk about judging others by one's own standards. They have increased the wholesale sales tax burden in real terms, after taking inflation into account, by 77 per cent since they have been in office. Yet 33 countries with goods and services taxes have never increased the standard rate of the goods and services tax-and some have actually reduced them. But the nub of the argument of those opposite is the claim that the coalition's proposal will hurt the poor and that, to use the Prime Minister's phrase, it is a bonanza for the rich. The Minister for Transport and Communications said just that a few minutes ago. Just so that people in the gallery and people listening to the broadcast know this, I said to him across the table, 'Give us the evidence. Give us the data'. The Minister turned his back on me. He would not and did not want to do so. This means that the computer analysis has not been done in the Treasury, so. those opposite do not actually know that that is the impact of the package. Despite the fact that the details of the package prove that proportionately low and middle income Australians are the winnersnot upper income Australians-they decided to run the line that it is going to benefit the rich. What a rich irony that is! We are talking about the Labor Party, particularly the Prime Minister. We are talking about the mates of Alan Bond and Laurie Connell. Do those opposite remember the little trip in the boat with a multi-billionaire and fast money high rollers; the people who lived on borrowed money and blew out the foreign debt-the mates of the Labor Party? How much money did Bond put into the Labor Party? A million dollars in Western Australia?",120
481,Mr FILING,TREASURER,Two million dollars.,121
482,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"He put in $2m into the Labor Party. Of course he did, because those opposite have been sucking up to him for years. And they accuse us of being the mates of the rich. That is monstrous hypocrisy. Let us have a look at the record of those opposite. One of the boasts of the honourable member for Blaxland at the dispatch box was that the Labor Party has reduced the highest marginal tax rate in this country from 60c in the dollar to 47c in the dollar. This is one of the Government's boasts. Yet the Labor Party says that it is the party for the poor, for the battler-in other words, the people it has thrown out of work. Such a claim is just monstrous. But the Labor Government provided the biggest tax cuts for the richest people. Those opposite should look at the data of the Bureau of Statistics and the ATO. Do not worry about our data. The Labor Government has given tax cuts to the rich but has done nothing for low and middle income people. Indeed, honourable members opposite may be interested to know that a PAYE taxpayer on average weekly earnings pays 30 per cent more tax in real terms than when Labor came to power. Yet, as the tax burden has gone up, the tax packet of a person on three times average weekly earnings has gone down under the Labor Party. So it is an absolutely fraudulent party. Instead of using rhetoric, those opposite should look at the data. But they will never do that. The public knows that people are out of work. People know that their living standards have fallen. They know they are struggling. Honourable members opposite are wrong if they think they can go outside this place and seriously tell people that the status quo is ,being maintained. (Time expired)",121
483,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"Capricomia) (9.15 p.m.)The integrity of the speech of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who has just resumed his seat, can be tested by the facts. He has just said that nothing has taken place in terms of the tax paid by low income earners since we came to power. I have before me the ATO-Australian Taxation Officecomparisons between 1980 and the years of the Labor Government and the figures for this year. Let us go to the first year under consideration. In 1980; single pensioners had no tax free threshold whatsoever. They now pay no tax unless they earn over $9,789, yet the honourable member for Mayo has the audacity to stand up in this House and say that nothing has changed. That is the pensioners. They had no tax free threshold. The Opposition taxed them on everything in 1980; we now tax them only if they earn over $9,789. Let us go to the low income earner. In 1980, a person earning $15,000 a year had to pay a tax of $3,673.08. Today that person pays $1,998.75, a drop of 45.6 per cent-and the Opposition now expects us to believe what the honourable member for Mayo says. Let us go one step further and look at someone in the $25,000 income category-not the rich, not the Bonds, but the ordinary worker. A person who earned $25,000 in 1980 paid $8,154.96. Today that person pays $4,949.75, a fall of $3,205.21 a year, or a saving of $61.63 a week. No wonder the people do not believe the Opposition, because what we are facing here is a hoax. I give those opposite credit for the orchestration and the theatrics of the package and the way that they have timed the taxthey did it well-and the way that they packaged it by throwing it all in together complicated it. This situation is similar to kids sitting at the window at Christmas looking at all the packages not knowing what they want. The packages look great because of the covering and the wrapping. But once one starts tearing at the wrapping of this tax package, one finds that it is flawed and unjust. Mrs Bailey interjecting",121
484,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"I would have thought that the honourable member for MCEwen would have stood up for the supporting parents, but I know that she is supporting something that discriminates against supporting parents. It amazes me that, as a woman, she would do that. Let us examine the other elements of the tax. Opposition members are discriminating against migrants. They have gone. to prejudices in our society and are attacking migrants, supporting parents and welfare. They will introduce a tax burden on all consumers regardless of their ability to pay. There has always been a principle in our society that we have a user pays system based on people's ability to pay. But thrse opposite are casting that totally aside by introducing this scheme. It is a tax on everything people consume and wear and a tax on every service they use-for example, electrical repairs, renovations, home improvements and repairs to their motor vehicles. People involved in car accidents would pay a tax on the towing, insurance assessment, storage, panel beating, paintwork and mechanical repairs. It goes on and on. There will be new health costs and a massive cut in goverriment services. The luxury car will be cheaper, but fruit and vegetables will cost more. There will be higher housing costs and dearer holidays in Australia. But as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said during Question Time, if people go overseas it is different. Imported luxuries will be cheaper, but school books and school shoes will be more expensive. There will be higher costs of liv.ing for people in country areas because there IS a clear tax on transportation. The Government has a problem in that sales tax is paid on freight, which it is trying to address now, but those opposite do not care about that. They will have a tax on transportation. Everyone living outside the metropolitan areas will suffer. The Opposition will privatise the es-enti.al social security areas. Its document says It wdl have gross reductions in public spending of $10 billion. Then it is going to force people into private health schemes. It has a tax credit scheme to compensate those not on social security but they will get a be-efit only .if they ever make money. P-ople wl11.not be l!l a position to gain from this tax credIt. That IS another trick. It is also discriminating against the supporting parents-a point I made in relation to the honourable member for MCEwen. Who is going to pick up the tab? Who is going to pay the cost to the supporting parent when a child turns 12? It will be the parents or the grandparents, or the other family members. I hope Opposition members remember that. I hope they think about that. They are the ones who will carry the extra costs. That poor person-and it will be a poor person-will have to bear that cost. But the Opposition has no care and no concern. The Opposition says it has exemptions for welfare, religious and charitable organisations, but what about senior citizens organisations? What about the police youth club that at this moment under the law, gets tax exemption? What about the parents and citizens groups? The Opposition is careful not to include t?ein its educational institutions. When we dIg ill and pull away the wrapping we start to understand that there is something insidious there. The honourable member for Mayo talked about taxes in this country. We are the second lowest taxed country of the OECD nations. The Opposition talks about payroll tax. Only 50 per cent of the firms pay payroll tax anyway. I heard the Opposition say that we wanted to introduce a tax like this. We never wanted that. In 1985 I did not support what was being proposed anyway, but that is another issue, from the consumer point of view.",122
485,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,I did.,123
486,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"I do not know whether the honourable member did or not. We were looking at a retail sales tax. The Opposition's document states: The coalition's goods and services tax is a version of value added tax. The Opposition is not talking about a retail sales tax; it is not talking about a product getting to the retail outlet and then imposing 15 per cent. It has a complicated system of 15 per cent being added on at every level. Mrs Bailey-Oh, that's not right.",123
487,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"I do not believe that the honourable member has read the document. If she had she would not be making such insane comments. We now have the Opposition's document, thanks to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) tabling it. It is an amazing situation. Let me answer one more question. The Opposition talks about no countries changing anything. I suggest that this is not only Hewson's hoax but it is a growth tax of a different kind. The Opposition has told us what has happened in other countries. New Zealand started with a consumption tax of 10 per cent; it went to 12.5 per cent after three years. France started with 13.6 per cent; it has gone to 18.6 per cent. Italy started at 12 per cent; it has gone to 19 per cent. The UK started at 10 per cent; it has gone to 17.5 per cent. Denmark started at 10 per cent; it has gone to 22 per cent. Austria started at 8 per cent; it has gone up to 20 per cent. The other interesting thing about all these nations is that every one-this is in the Bulletin article that David O'Reilly wrotehas introduced a welfare tax on its citizens. The figures show that up to 23 per cent of all tax revenue in these countries which have a goods and services tax is accrued through a welfare tax. I did not think the Opposition would be doing it until I read the comment of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in that article. On behalf of the Opposition he advocated a tax on nursing homes. One has to have one's own insurance policy. There is a tax built into provide savings for the future cost of nursing homes. It is almost identical-though not exactly-to the welfare taxes of Europe. And the Opposition wants to go further. It amazes me that business would even consider this proposal because we are going to see a higher tax of 42 per cent on its profits, there will be a massive cost in the changeover of cash registers and equipment, and new accounting procedures will be needed. Business people will be legally accountable; they will be part of the 900,000 new tax collectors out there and they will know also that higher prices mean less sales and less sales mean less profits, unless they rort it. That is the difference. I looked at the Opposition's model. I have gone through this very carefully in the last 12 hours. I looked at the model on page 70. Mr Broadbent-You only got it this morning.",123
488,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"That is 12 hours ago; that is what I said. If the honourable member listened and did not get tossed out all the time he would know what is going on here. I have been looking at what the Opposition has been saying. I put it to the Opposition: if this model works, if this model is true, if it has the integrity, then that is okay. It would be the same outcome as a retail sales tax. Instead of having products that blowout by massive cascading effects it would simply have a 15 per cent tax on the top because there is a rebating system. We pay it when we get the value added and then we rebate it back. That is the way the system works. Mrs Bailey-That's not cascading.",123
489,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,I will tell the honourable member what cascading is. She did not listen. I was trying to protect the Opposition when I said that if the coalition's proposal worked it would not be cascading.,123
490,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,Don't you know what cascading is?,123
491,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"If the honourable member for Bennelong listened and shifted those glasses from his ears for a moment, he would understand. I was saying that if the coalition's model worked it would not be cascading. I want to tell honourable members that there is nothing to stop the system from falling apart. I have pulled out some figures. I took a farmer selling, for example, tomatoes for $100, on which the agent added a handling fee of 10 per cent, the processor putting on 10 per cent profit and the retailer buying the product wholesale and putting on 10 per cent profit. The price would start at $100. At the moment the consumer would buy that product for $133.10. Under the Opposition's system, the agent would buy at $100 and would add the goods and services tax of 15 per cent; the agent would therefore pay $115. The farmer would get $100 and the Australian Taxation Office would get $15. The agent applies his 10 per cent profit to the $100; that is $110. He then adds 15 per cent. That means the price is $126.50. He pays the tax man not the $16.50-he has already paid $15 in the system-but only $1.50. This is how the system will truly work. It is not cascading. Those opposite were not quite listening. That is what happens. The processor then buys the product at $110. He adds on his 10 per cent profit; that is $121. He adds on 15 per cent GST, which takes the figure to $139.15. He does not pay the tax man the $18.50; he pays that less the $16.50 that has already been paid. He pays GST of only $1.65. The retailer buys the product at $121. He adds on his 10 per cent profit-that is $133.1O-and then adds the GST of 15 per cent. That takes the price to $153.06. He does not pay the GST of $19.96. What does he pay? He pays $1.81. Let me just go through this example. The consumer pays $153.06. The GST is exactly the same had there been a 15 per cent levy on the original retail price. That is how the Opposition wants the proposal to happen. But there is no way it can guarantee that it will happen that way. Under Whitlam, when we shifted the import tariffs, Myers worked on a system that the consumer would pay what the normal price had been-past tense. Prices did not shift. In fact, Myers took advantage by covering up its profit margin. The retailer took advantage of the situation and blew out the profits. That is exactly what can happen here. Going back to my example, there is nothing to stop anyone who buys those tomatoes from taking advantage of the coalition's proposal. The tomato grower sells his load of tomatoes for $100 to the agent, who adds the 15 per cent GST. That is supposed to be $115, of which $15 goes to the Taxation Office. There is nothing to stop the agent from putting his 10 per cent not on the $100 that he paid the farmer but on the $115. I have checked it: there is not one thing. There is no legal way that that agent can be stopped from putting his profit margin on the original farm gate price plus the GST. I know those opposite are quiet now. They should put their facts on the table. Let us look at the next step. The agent will sell the tomatoes to the processor. When he does what does the processor do? He is supposed to be working out his GST not on some combination of costs but on the actual wholesale price less the GST. There is legally nothing to stop him from adding his 10 per cent profit-it will not be a 10 per cent profit margin to the processor-to the combination of the actual cost of the product and the GST. I have worked out some figures which those opposite can challenge. But they will see that at this moment, by going through that process I have outlined, the $100 worth of tomatoes will cost $133.10. Under the coalition's proposal, they will cost $153.06. Mr Broadbent-Oh rubbish!",123
492,Mr WRIGHT,TREASURER,"The honourable member for Corinella should not say rubbish. He should listen to me. They are the figures that the honourable member for Bennelong agrees with. I went through this example line by line. I should have used three-letter words for the honourable member for Corinella. The situation is that the consumer could actually end up paying $202.41. I suggest that, when we have examples from the past where these entrepreneurs will be paying to run the tax system under the Opposition, they will recoup their costs. We will see an unbelievable inflationary blowout-and those opposite tell us that we have not been conned. They tell us that the people will accept this proposal. When the people open the wrapping they will start to dig inside to see what it will really cost. I believe that they will cast aside what the coalition is proposing because it is a hoax. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affumative. Question put: That the motion (Mr Reith's) be agreed to. The House divided.

495,Mr GIBSON,EAST TIMOR,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its deepest sympathy to the people of East Timor for the appalling tragedy they experienced with the Dili massacre of 12 November 1991; (2) condemns in the strongest terms the resort by the Indonesian military to force which on every account was wholly excessive; (3) regards as deeply repugnant the reported comments of the Indonesian Commander-inChief on the day following the massacre that the ""disruptors ... had to be shot""; (4) notes the Indonesian Government's decision to establish a National Commission of Investigation to investigate all aspects of the massacre, and calls upon it to take every necessary step to ensure to the satisfaction of both the East Timorese and international communities: (a) that the inquiry is ""free, accurate, just and thorough"", as promised; (b) that it is conducted fairly and impartially, with all witnesses guaranteed protection against intimidation or retaliation; and (c) that appropriate action is taken against those found to be responsible for unlawful or excessive acts; (5) further calls upon the Indonesian Government: (a) to provide immediate access by humanitarian and aid groups, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross, to those wounded or detained as a result of the events of 12 November and other recent incidents in East Timor, without any prejudice to those so visited; (b) to respond promptly to requests for information in relation to detained or missing persons about whom concern has been expressed following the events of 12 November and other recent incidents; (c) to release all political prisoners detained because of their opposition to the integration of East Timor with Indonesia; and (d) to guarantee that fndividuals who express Orders peaceful opposition to the integration of East Timor with Indonesia are free from intimidation, harassment or detention; (6) requests the Government to instruct the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia to make an early visit, and subsequently regular visits, to East Timor to report fully on all aspects of the present situation and the progress of the Motion National Commission of Investigation; (7) requests the Australian Government, having regard to the full range of its policies toward and bilateral contacts with Indonesia, to give consideration to the steps which it might take to review these policies and contacts in the event that the Indonesian investigation and follow-up action is unsatisfactory, for example the suspension of military training programs; (8) notes the importance of any Australian Government response to the 12 November massacre not only reflecting the deep concern of the wider Australian community but also being consistent with Australia's own national interests and above all with the interests and welfare of the East Timorese people; (9) calls, accordingly, upon the Government to explore all possible constructive avenues for: (a) guaranteeing the effectiveness of the investigation process and its follow-up; (b) achieving a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict, including by requesting the Indonesian Government, in the Prime Minister's words, to ""sit down with the people of East Timor including the resistance forces and try and work out a program of achieving peaceable relations""; and (c) meeting the longer-term needs and aspirations of the East Timorese people; and (10) in particular in these respects, requests that: (a) the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade make an early visit to Indonesia to discuss all aspects of the East Timor situation, including the events of 12 November and options for effective longer-term reconciliation; (b) active steps be taken to explore the role which might now be played, with wide intemational support, by the United Nations and its Secretary-General; (c) strong support be given to the role of the Intemational Commission of the Red Cross in protecting and promoting human rights in East Timor, through continued representations to the Indonesian authorities and if possible targeted financial assistance; and (d) approval be sought for the establishment of a resident Australian Consulate in Dili. Much has been written and. said in the last two weeks about the massacre that occurred in Dili on 12 November. There will be many more strong expressions of anger, condemnation, sympathy, regret and desire for change made this evening in this debate by honourable members on both sides. This is the first occasion in more than a decade on which the Australian Parliament has debated our nation's policy and actions on East Timor. There have been other occasions on which speakers have discussed East Timor or made some reference to it, such as during the debate on Australia's involvement in the Gulf war, but this is the first occasion for many years on which this House has been able to express its opinion on our policy towards the annexation and control of East Timor by Indonesia. It is no secret that there is a widely held view in the Australian community, in my political Party and in all parties, and in this Parliament, that the actions of successive Australian governments in respect of East Timor have been wrong. I share that view, as I have stated on previous occasions in this House. It is an undeniable fact that the policies of the past 16 years of both the Indonesian Government and the Australian Government on East Timor have been failures in regard to their treatment of the people of East Timor and must change. The Indonesians believe that their use of brutal repression, of military offensives, of mass executions, of intimidation and harassment, of destruction of villages and uprooting of thousands of people, of beatings, torture and detention would lead to their ultimate victory over the people and the territory. The Indonesians may have control over most of the land area of East Timor, but recent events confirm once more that they will never have victory over the hearts and minds of the East Timorese people. Australia's tacit acceptance of the Indonesian occupation, our failure to act upon the continual flood of reports of brutality and repression, our recognition of the clearly illegal act of annexation, and our active participation in negotiations to exploit natural resources in the adjacent area have been at the expense of over 200,000 East Timorese slaughtered by Indonesia. Our policies make us clearly CUlpable in this latest massacre. The blood of the 75 who died on 12 November and the blood of the many thousands before them is also on our hands, as it is on the hands of the Indonesians. We have reached the point where we can no longer ignore the stark contrasts in our foreign policy agenda. The motion before the House is the start of a process whereby our nation can restore some honesty and credibility in our relations with Indonesia by actively working for a just and lasting peaceful future for the East Tirnorese. It will not be good enough for us to simply express regret, sympathy and concern and then let the issue fade into obscurity again, as it did a decade ago. We in this Parli-ment, as representatives of our nation, must seek a positive resolution of this matter. I recognise that the only realistic way we can address the matter is to work with the Indonesian Government. Despite all the temptations to strike back hard and react in the strongest way that governments and nations can, that will not achieve anything for the East Tirnorese people. It may make us feel good that we really showed them what we thought, but the trauma of life for the East Timorese will continue unabated. What is clear .is that there have been significant advances in the attitude of the Indonesian Government. I share the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) that this massacre was not ordered by the Government in Jakarta. It is also clear that if Indonesia had not had tens of thousands of its troops present throughout East Timor, if it had not been engaged in a three-month process of harassment and intimidation leading up to the proposed Portuguese parliamentary delegation's visit, and if it had not allowed the military such a free rein in its activities, the funeral procession would not have occurred, the demonstration would not have occurred and the massacre would not necessarily have taken place. Many in the Indonesian Government and in its Parliament have found this tragedy as repugnant as we have, but there are others, including the hardline senior military in Indonesia, who would have a different view. That is reflected by what I describe as the obscene remarks of General Try Sutrisno. But, for the first time, we have a situation where the Indonesian Government has responded to international pressure-including Australia's - and established a full inquiry into the actions of its military. This is a considerable advance on previous responses. Many people are sceptical about the independence and composition of this national commission of investigation. The flow of reports of continuing round-ups, detentions and possible execution of witnesses and participants in the 12 November march demonstrates that the local military forces in East Timor do not want the inquiry to succeed. It is unlikely that the East Timorese will have any confidence in the inquiry and will be unwilling to risk more lives by coming forward to give evidence. That is why the parts of this motion dealing with the conduct of the inquiry, parts (4) and (5), are vitally important issues which must be taken up as a matter of urgency by the Australian Government in our discussions with the Indonesian Government. Indonesia must bring its military forces into line and cease the intimidation, harassment and detention of residents. It must free all political prisoners and it must guarantee the protection of witnesses. If the Australian community is to have any respect for the work and findings of this inquiry, we need to have our own independent assessment of its operations. The Australian Embassy should ensure that an observer is present throughout the inquiry. We should also seek as a fundamental condition that the United Nations Secretary-General send one of his representatives to Indonesia to also monitor the conduct of the inquiry. That will ensure that the whole international community is kept informed. These are not unreasonable or unrealistic requests. They are fundamental requirements if the Indonesian inquiry is to achieve any credibility or respect. It is in clauses 8, 9 and 10 that this motion seeks a positive change of direction in Australia's response to the continuing tragedy of East Timor. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his first response to the 12 November massacre called on the Indonesian Government to recognise that its administrative policies had failed and that the time had come for it to 'sit down with the people of East Timor, including the resistance forces, and try to work out a program of achieving peaceable relations'. He reaffirmed that position today in answer to a question in Question Time. It is a fundamental fact of life that, in almost all confrontations, battles or conflicts, a final resolution will be reached only when the participants in the struggle actually sit down and negotiate. The tragedy is in the length of time it often takes before combatants realise this inevitability and in the bloodshed and loss of life that are the result of their arrogance, stubbornness and futility. Such is the case in East Timor. '!\vo hundred thousand people have now died. But the protests continue, the fighting continues and the determination to resist Indonesian occupation is stronger than ever. The Indonesian Government is trying to build a vibrant economy and improve the living standards and income of the people throughout its nation. It seeks to take an active role in regional, economic, political and security issues. These are admirable objectives which should be supported and encouraged. But the big negative in this scenario is the heavy-handed methods that it utilises to stifle criticism and expression of opinion. This is highlighted in cold, stark detail with brutal reality in its control of East Timor. It is in Indonesia's best interests to have the East Timor issue peacefully resolved so that it can achieve its objectives elsewhere in its nation. If it does so, it will result in an improved reputation internationally and considerable increases in economic aid and development. Australia does have a unique and important opportunity to take an active role to assist in the achievement of a peaceful resolution. We have worked hard to develop a mature relationship with the Indonesian Government over the past decade. This was highlighted by the cooperation which was evidenced in the work of Australia and Indonesia in achieving a peace settlement in Cambodia. The proposal for a visit to Indonesia by our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is an important component of the process of convincing the Indonesians that their best interests will be served by working positively for a peaceful resolution. But it is clear that Australia alone cannot achieve such a result. The United Nations has a vital role to play and we must use all available avenues to have it, particularly through the good offices of the Secretary-General, actively involved. When I participated in an international parliamentary delegation to speak with the UN Secretary-General in March of this year, our delegation was given very strong commitments about the determination of the Secretary-General to achieve a just and lasting peace for East Timor. The UN is still committed to enabling the people of East Timor to choose for themselves what their future should be-and I share that commitment. There are many ways in which the UN can facilitate a process of talks between the Indonesian Government and the representatives of the people of East Timor. The motion before the House requests the Government to explore all such avenues. It is a matter of some disappointment to me that the Opposition is proposing, by way of amendment, the deletion of those parts of this motion which request our Government to work for a positive future for East Timor. I do not understand this action, as I know that many honourable members opposite share my desire for our country to work for peace in East Timor. Another significant initiative contained in the motion is the call for the establishment of an Australian consulate in DilL This would provide for ongoing participation by Australia in the cause for peace. It will enable us to monitor the situation and provide some protection for the East Timorese. It is supported by the people of East Timor and by the Governor of East Timor, as during the visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to East Timor in February this year he asked us to convey such a request to our Government. This motion is an important statement which gives a clear direction for the future to Indonesia, Australia and East Timor. It puts both governments on notice that the people of Australia, and in fact people throughout the world, will not tolerate any further massacres. We will not accept a whitewash of the events of 12 November and we want those responsible brought to justice. But, above all, this motion states clearly that the people of East Timor deserve a much better future than they have had a past for the last 16 years. It is time for Australia to assume a more active role and to correct the impressions of our past policies. Above all, the killing must end, the abuse of human rights must end, and the lies and deceit must end. The people of Australia demand, and will accept, nothing less.",126
496,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EAST TIMOR,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Ferguson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,129
497,Mr RUDDOCK,EAST TIMOR,"Dundas) (9.57 p.m.)Firstly, I observe that, so far as the Opposition is concerned, there is no contest in relation to the abhorrence that we feel about the events that have occurred recently in East Timor. It is an appalling tragedy. As to the first part of the motion that is before us, the views expressed so movingly by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in putting this motion before the Parliament are ones which we affirm and concur with. Whilst the honourable member indicated that I intend to move an amendment - and I will move immediately in that direction-I will do so because we have a view about the way in which this matter ought to be proceeded with at this time; it is not an issue of major contest. At some future time it may not be inappropriate to accept even the whole of the motion. But in the context of the particular circumstances that we now face, the Opposition is of the view that the motion should be amended. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House: (1) expresses its deep sympathy to the people of East Timor for the appalling tragedy they experienced with the Dili massacre of 12 November 1991; (2) condemns in the strongest terms the resort by the Indonesian military to excessive force; (3) notes the Indonesian Government's decision to establish a National Commission of Investigation to investigate all aspects of the massacre, and calls upon it to take every necessary step to ensure to the satisfaction of both the East Timorese and the international communities: (a) that the inquiry is 'free, accurate, just and thorough', as promised; (b) that it is conducted fairly and impartially, with witnesses guaranteed protection against intimidation or retaliation; and (c) that appropriate action is taken against those found to be responsible for unlawful or excessive acts; (4) further calls upon the Indonesian Government: (a) to provide immediate access by humanitarian and aid groups, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross, to those wounded or detained as a result of the events of 12 November and other recent incidents in East Timor, without any prejudice to those so visited; (b) to respond promptly to requests for information in relation to detained or missing persons about whom concern has been expressed following the events of 12 November and other recent incidents; (c) to release all prisoners detained without trial; (d) to guarantee that individuals who express peaceful opposition to the integration of East Timor with Indonesia are free from intimidation, harassment or detention; (5) requests the Government to instruct the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia to make an early visit and subsequently regular visits to East Timor to report fully to Parliament on all aspects of the present situation and the progress of the National Commission of Investigation"". Why does the Opposition propose these amendments in this form? It is not because we are in any substantial disagreement. We see some difficulties of a technical nature in a number of the paragraphs. There are other difficulties because we are being asked to prejudge an inquiry which we have welcomed, which the Government has welcomed and which we all hope will be meaningful. If we look at the first amendment that my alternative form adopts, we have accepted paragraph (1) without contest. We have moved an amendment to paragraph (2) because it was not the case that by every account there was a wholly excessive action. Regrettably, there are accounts-most notably from the military, of course-which did not concur with that assessment. They may be wrong; I believe that they are. If we are to move a motion in this place, we ought to at least be accurate. I accept that the motion as it is worded is probably right, but to say that by every account the action was wholly excessive is not the case. We have moved the omission of paragraph (3). With respect to the report upon which that comment is based, the original remarks were in another language. There are already conflicting reports as to whether those accurately reflect the statements of the commander-in-chief. In that context, I understand that he is shortly to give evidence on that matter to the inquiry. We have amended paragraph (5) to substitute 'to release all prisoners detained without trial' . The original wording of paragraph (5)(c) suggests that all prisoners are political prisoners. The fact is that there may well be people who are not political prisoners but who are not going to be brought to trial. A reference to a trial more accurately reflects the sorts of procedures that we think ought to be followed. That is why we have made that proposed variation. We seek to amend paragraph (6). In our view, the Ambassador ought to report to the Parliament. It is a clarification which we think improves the proposal. We seek to remove paragraph (7), paragraph (8), paragraph (9) and paragraph (10) from the motion. We see those paragraphs as being premature. They raise a number of issues that prejudge matters that are before the inquiry that we have all welcomed. We believe that the amendments more accurately reflect the aspirations of the Government, as outlined in the comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)- I will refer to that later in my observationsand the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) today. We think the motion as we have amended it puts pressure on the Indonesian Government to act properly in its inquiry. It places the Indonesian Government on notice that the international community in general and Australia in particular are not prepared to tolerate breaches of human rights in East Timor. The motion as we have amended it indicates our abhorrence of the massacre which we see primarily in terms of its gross human rights abuse. There may well be further political considerations which Australia will have to address at a later date, and some of these have been raised in the motion as originally proposed. But it seems to us that full details of these tragic events have to become known before we can come to a final view as to whether or not those further steps are necessary. For the time being, the cause of the demonstration which resulted in this dreadful massacre is not a question in issue; nor, in our view, is the question of self-determination of the East Timorese, although I notice that the honourable member for Moreton in his remarks raising this issue considers that this is an opportunity for debate on the actions of Governments over the past 16 years. He believes the whole question of annexation of East Timor ought to be a matter which is the subject of review. I am not sure if I am correct, but I will read his remarks again tomorrow, as to whether or not he is in fact asking the Government to take some steps in relation to that, or whether the terms of the motion we have before us are designed to indicate that that is a matter at issue. There is some suggestion that the terms of the motion as originally proposed may suggest that that is the view of some, although from the observations of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister I do not see it as being the Government's view that that matter is at issue; nor, I think, should the question of whether or not Australia is appeasing a militaristic neighbour be an issue. All these considerations are put aside at the moment, as we see it, because of what is a particularly important matter: that is, that a group of people have been slaughtered while exercising a most fundamental political right, the right to demonstrate, without them having to suffer the horror of armed forces firing upon them. The protection of human rights is something which crosses all national, political, ideological and economic boundaries. The right for the protection of human rights is not something which can be frustrated by threats of diplomatic or political isolation. We have all seen a great deal of information that is becoming known, and some of us who are associated with Amnesty are aware of the reports that it has published. It is quite clear that by international standards human rights have been breached in quite a dreadful manner and that Australia is quite legitimately entitled to thoroughly condenm the action of the military in its treatment of its citizens on 12 November. We do this without apology. The march through Dili that led to this outrageous circumstance appears to have been based on a group moving from a church to the Santa Cruz cemetery following a memorial mass for a youth who had been killed several weeks earlier. A large contingent of security forces, including troops with automatic weapons and riot police equipped with batons and shields, met the marchers on the street outside the cemetery. By this time the demonstrators numbered about 3,000. Many eye witnesses have been reported as saying the troops opened fire without provocation. Reports vary about the number of casualties. Some have suggested there may be as few as 19 killed and 91 wounded. The Fretelin sources claimed that 80 people were taken away and shot. Australia's Foreign Minister has stated his belief that 75 people may have been killed. Unfortunately, the facts are not clear. The Indonesian Government has set up a national committee of investigation to carry out an inquiry into the tragedy, claiming that anyone proven to have violated prevailing laws will be charged and tried in accordance with Indonesian law. In relation to the many and repeated abuses of human rights over time, this is the first occasion, as I understand it, that we have seen an inquiry of this order undertaken by Indonesian authorities. It demonstrates that the Indonesian Government, I think, recognises that it does have to respond to matters relating to the protection of human rights. It also shows that the Indonesian Government has accepted the responsibility to inquire into what has occurred and to report back to the international community. We wait to see ifthis is done in accordance with the international community's expectations, that is, that it has been objective, independent, impartial and thorough. Of course, in our view it needs to be open, public and complete as an investigation. It is crucial that the national investigation commission conducts its inquiry with regard to these expectations. It is also important to allow international aid agencies, and particularly the Red Cross, unrestricted access to the wounded and other witnesses. Despite the opening of the territory to tourism and commerce in January 1989, and notwithstanding government assurances that access to the territory is unrestricted, Amnesty International has not yet been permitted to visit East Timor. I hope that honourable members will mention some of the reports that Amnesty International has given. I have read them myself; they are very much a matter of concern. Some of the descriptions that have been given are of a very real and moving character. I do personally rely very heavily on Amnesty as an authoritative organisation whose reports ought to be treated with credit. Father Frank Brennan has received information from eyewitnesses to one of the incidents that it was suggested may have been the Government's reason for these particular tragic events. I am not suggesting that. 'the response to this alleged stabbing is in any way justified, but it does indicate a variety of views about the incident. That is a matter that needs to be kept in mind in any discussion. Amnesty has received unconfirmed reports that people have been executed at subsequent times and their bodies buried in unmarked graves. These are matters that are also of concern to honourable members on this side of the House. In the minute or so that is left to me, I want to make some brief comments. We in the Opposition are not saying that, if this inquiry is not one of a thorough character and one that meets the criteria that We have set down, we could not look at cuts in aid, other sanctions, and limits in defence cooperation. There could be action of another sort involving the UN, as has been foreshadowed. But we are of the view that it is premature to push for those particular steps to be taken at this time. We think the inquiry needs to be open, frce, fair and complete. r looked again at the words of the Prime Minister in answer to the question amt, contrary to the honourable member's expectations, it seems to me that the Prime Minister was saying clearly that we need to await the terms of that inquiry as well. The Prime Minister said that, if it turns out to be a whitewash, we would have to consider steps to review our policies in relation to Indonesia. That is the view the Opposition supports, and I think the Prime Minister supports the stand we have suggested as well. (Time expired)",129
498,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EAST TIMOR,Mr Jenkins)Is the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas seconded? Mr Downer-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,132
499,Mr FERGUSON,EAST TIMOR,"At the time of the Gulf war, amidst great patriotic fervour, some members of this House and of the Senate drew what are proving to be some fairly timely analogies with international reaction to the situation of the Timorese. Referring more concretely to one specific example of Australia's inconsistencies on this matter, I mention the continuation and worsening of our contact with the PLO. That is a matter that is of vital concern in my electorate. We decreased further our ties with that organisation because of its support for the Iraqi situation. That relationship is one of a client group; it is one of total dependence on the Iraqis. That is explicable by the fact that the Syrians have engaged in a major assault on the leadership of the PLO in recent years. So if the reaction to the support of the PLO for the Iraqi position is not defensible, even though it is understandable, then how much more is Australia's perfonnance to be abhorred, to be denounced? How horrific is Australia's perfonnance on Timor by comparison, Timor being a nation of such geographic proximity to this country? It is a nation where citizens still can trace the relationship between their parents, grandparents, et cetera, and Australian forces in the Second World War. That is the first point I want to make. The selfdemned righteousness of that Iraqi war is now put some context as the full horror of the situation in Timor is driven home. From 1975, when Indonesian forces invaded the country, through 1976, when full in-' What tegration of East Timor as the twenty-seventh province took place, there was a process and which was internationally close to genocidal: endeavours to starve large parts of the The population; a campaign of slaughter and authority: horrific beheadings; the wholesale relocation of people's villages; and the destruction fanns. Throughout the milder periods-and there have been a number of them during which Australian diplomats assured us and the then governments that things were improvingthere has been fairly rampant job discrimination; mostly unsuccessful efforts of transmigration; and the monopolisation by the Indonesian military forces of lucrative sectors of the economy, be they imported cigarettes, petrol, spare parts or the coffee industry. That - as been the history of this country. People have failed in their genuine efforts to work with the Indonesian authorities. In this respect, the statements of Archbishop Belo and Governor Carrascalao have been recorded on many occasions. People have endeavoured to see whether there could be a peaceful integration. They may not have liked doing so but they made that effort. During the period that witnessed Australia's disgraceful de jure recognition of that countly-based largely on the realpolitik of the region, the importance of Indonesia and economic considerations in the Timor Gap-a variety of international institutions disassociated themselves from the Australian position. Irrespective of whether Ministers of this Government and other governments want to quibble about whether some taxation treaties with Indonesia impliedly accept the integration of Timor into Indonesia, the reality is that only about six nations went as far as Australia and made a fonnal decision of de jure recognition. As I said, a variety of sources have conthe very ghastly occupation of Timor in by the Indonesians. I could refer-and this is relevant because of the religious background of the Timorese-to the Pope's statement in the Diario de Noticias of 12 May 1991: I want for that community . . . is that they are able to live according to their own principles convictions, their own language, culture and traditions and their own religion. political problem is being dealt with by another The United Nations and I have always wanted-I said it there and I must say it here-that of it should be solved, the East Timor problem, according to principles of justice and according to their human and national rights. Last week, the European Parliamentary Assembly reiterated the position that it has adopted over the last decade. It commented that it: . . . affirms the right of the Timorese people to decide their own political destiny and preserve, deveIopand assert their cultural, linguistic and religious identity. It asks that Indonesia: ... ends aU violations of international instruments establishing human rights and peoples' right to self determination and independence. In Australia, we have seen the initiative of 59 members of the Victorian Parliament, over a third of them from the Opposition. Once again and not only in this scenario, the International Red Cross has indicated that the restrictions upon it within Timor imposed by the Indonesian administration are totally unsatisfactory. We have reports which mention the State Department. There are many doubts about the actual number of people who were killed. But it is important to say that the Indonesians should not be given the benefit of the doubt. Although they operate a very oppressive and controlled media, apparently we are to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that very small numbers of people were killed. But people cannot report properly because papers are closed down or censored. The US State Department commented that an estimated 75 to 100 were killed. It further commented that the action was disproportionate to any threat. If we spend our time arguing about technicalities as to whether the action was wholly excessive on every account, we are missing the fundamental point of international abhorrence-the fundamental point that, regardless of what the Indonesian inquiry comes down with, it is recognised internationally that there has been an extremely oppressive regime there. This event of the last week-it is important to stress this-is not some wild aberration. It might have occurred because the local military acted rather than because of orders from Jakarta but, as I indicated earlier, this whole process is not some wild event that was inexplicable and unpredictable. As early as 28 October three visiting journalists, Gina Roncoli, Lois Randall and Francisco Vidinha, talked of witnessing the ears being cut off Timorese, facial cuts and people seeking refuge. In a letter they sent to the Portuguese Ambassador in Australia they spoke of the accumulated evidence which confirms without doubt that the consequences of the cancellation of the Portuguese parliamentary visit will be absolutely devastating to the East Timorese people, who believe that the visit is the first genuine indication that the international community is finally taking an interest in their plight. The journalists spoke of truckloads of troops, new battalions being moved in and very overt surveillance on themselves and the Timorese citizens. They spoke of people being grabbed after speaking to them. They spoke of Nuremberg style rallies in villages, with people forced to indulge in waving of flags and singing of patriotic songs. As I indicated, that development was occurring before these events. It was a development that led to the murder of two Timorese when Indonesian forces invaded the Motael church. That led to the Santa Cruz cemetery events. We have our own Australian experience in this whole process-the murder of five journalists. Unfortunately, the Opposition has moved to detach references to a comment by General Sutrisno that people who refuse to toe the line must be shot. That is proposed to be deleted. Once again, I think we have to stress that that is not some kind of aberration either, because it is typical of other comments by the Indonesian authorities. For instance, in March 1990 we secretly recorded the then Defence Minister Murdani when he commented of Timor that they had 'without a moment's thought wiped out dissident organisations throughout Indonesia', that they would 'crush any challenges to Indonesian control of East Timor' and that 'we can take care of them all' . For some reason, the Opposition thought that the words of the motion before us today were a bit too strong in taking on those comments of the last week. The majority of members in this Parliament and the majority of people in this country certainly believe that those comments should be taken on full bore. They are deplorable. Unfortunately, they are typical. We can say on occasion that some of this is propaganda from Fretilin, that it even feeds that material through Amnesty International. But the variety of sources about the situation leading up to this, when supposedly Australian diplomats are saying it is all hunky dory, was typified again by Newsweek of 23 October 1990 when it commented: The borders are now officially open and residents can in theory travel within the province. . . In practice, people's movements are controlled by a pervasive security apparatus. The police and army stop and question travellers at check points that appear as often as every 5 or 10 miles. The Far Eastern Economic Review of 15 February 1990-once again, in this period of improved, relaxed Indonesian administration - was somewhat critical when it commented: Unrest is already worse than before... it is unlikely that East Timor's demilitarisation will go too far. We have accounts of a continuing, pervasive, aggressive and suppressing performance by the Indonesian authorities. I for one do not subscribe to the theories put forward by the Foreign Affairs Department that we have to be very careful because the Indonesian Administration is split; that there are some really good guys in there, such as Alatas, who are really trying to overcome the military; and that the local administration has improved so we should not go too hard. Quite frankly, the results of that policy are what has occurred in the last fortnight. In referring again to the situation within Timor, we have the Gajah Mada University account that was suppressed by the authorities. A public seminar on its conclusions of the situation in Timor was to be held, but those discussions had to be held in private. The university representatives said that East Timor, as of June 1990, endures war conditions, trauma and deep social divisions almost 15 years after it was incorporated into Indonesia. Of course, they spoke of economic development hampered by a war economy laden with regulations sometimes with monopolistic tendencies. That is the situation. The Opposition spokesman has said that he cannot see in the motion that there is necessarily any inference of support for self-determination for the Timorese. Quite frankly, I think that the reference to active steps being taken to explore the role to be played, with wide international support by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, can imply only one thing. The United Nations 1982 resolution, which has never been repudiated, never been withdrawn, states that it was: Concerned at the humanitarian situation prevailing in the Territory and believing that all efforts should be made by the international community to improve the living conditions of the people of East Timor and to guarantee to those people the effective enjoyment of their fundamental human rights. They requested: ... the Secretary-General to initiate consultations with all parties directly concerned with a view to exploring avenues for achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problem and to report ... to the General Assembly ... Anyone who has followed the situation there knows that that decision is still operative. It is typical of a large numbcr of other UN bodies that have passed similar condemnatory resolutions against the Indonesians over Timor. The reference in the motion before the House is clearly, by inference, related to the UN position on the matter. How can it be otherwise? I have to say that I would not wish to be partisan in this matter. Any objective analysis must subscribe to each party in this country a large degree of condemnation for the role of the Indonesians. As I said earlier, it is a position that is internationally reprehensible; an international position that very few countries adopt. Unfortunately, decreasing the strength of this motion, even by withdrawing the concept of having a consulate in Dili, certainly gives a green light to the Indonesians that the Australian Government will not be pressing too hard in the near future. Quite frankly, if there is one thing needed there, it is increased Australian presence, whether it be through aid organisations or a consulate. It is quite clear that the Australian people, the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been illserved by the lack of contact, the lack of interest and the lack of intelligence provided by the Embassy in Jakarta.

500,Mr DOWNER,EAST TIMOR,"All of us in this House are deeply concerned by the Santa Cruz shootings that took place recen,tly and reports that between 50 and 100 people-by some accounts, even more-were simply gunned down in a callous shooting of innocent citizens. This incident has quite rightly received not only condemnation from Australia and countries such as Portugal and the Netherlands but international condemnation. Even though we do not have the conclusive details of the incident, it is something that weighs very heavily on all of us in Australia as a neighbouring country of Indonesia and as a country which has taken a good deal of interest in events in East Timor. When we consider the motion before the House and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), which I support, we have to bear in mind as a first point of principle that, horrific as this incident was, Indonesia is a sovereign country. The first responsibility in this instance rests with Indonesia as a sovereign country to investigate fully and impartially the incident that actually took place and, secondly, to ensure that those involved in the incident are identified and brought to justice. Because Indonesia is a sovereign country it is important that we acknowledge that it is its responsibility in the first place to investigate this incident. It is true that the Indonesian Government has taken the first steps towards fulfilling those responsibilities. It has established a national commission of investigation, headed by a supreme court judge, who, admittedly, has spent a goodly part of his career in the Indonesian military. But it is premature for us to prejudge the outcome of the national commission and to institute direct action against Indonesia in the fonn of cutting off aid funding, in the manner of imposing trade sanctions or other propositions that have been put to us as members of parliament without first seeing the conclusions of the national commission for investigation. I have very strong views about that. We cannot walk away from the fact that Indonesia is a sovereign country. We do not want to fall into the trap of being neo-imperialist in our attitude to other countries. We certainly want to give Indonesia the opportunity to investigate fully, properly, impartially and independently the incident that took place at Santa Cruz. The Indonesians, I would have thought, have a very real interest in ensuring that the investigation turns out to be a full, fair and objective investigation. They have a very real interest in bringing those who were responsible for the incident to justice, consistent with Indonesian law. The simple fact is that if Indonesia does not do that, if the international community simply judges that. the investigation has been nothing more than a whitewash, that will create a great deal of difficulty for Indonesia in its relations with the rest of the world. We should give Indonesia the opportunity to conduct the investigation impartially and effectively as a sovereign nation. It is clear that Indonesia, on reflection, has a real interest in making sure that not only the people of Indonesia and the people of East Timor but also the people of the rest of the world are satisfied with the effectiveness of that investigation. There is no doubt, though, that this very sad incident casts a shadow over Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Certainly, it is true that there is a good deal of concern in the Australian community, including in my own electorate, about the incident that has taken place. I am sad about the way this incident has cast a shadow over the relationship, because I think we all feel that that relationship, which historically-let us not walk away from it-has been a difficult relationship for us, has been an important relationship. We all know that Indonesia is a country of 180 million or so people right on the boundary of Australia, that we have a large numher of common interests with Indonesia, fairly obviously, and that we must regard as very regrettable the deterioration in our relationship with Indonesia. I want to mention two or three things about that relationship with Indonesia. I have said already that it is a country with a population of 180 million. While I have been the shadow Minister for trade, I have argued that we need to focus our national attention on Indonesia much more carefully than we have in the past. Our commercial policy-not our foreign policy so much-and our international trade strategy have been oriented much more towards Europe and the United States than towards our own region. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the shadow Minister for foreign affairs (Senator Hill) I, as the shadow Minister for trade, and a large number of my colleagues have been arguing strongly over the last few years that we need to focus our attention more carefully on our own region, and that clearly includes Indonesia. The Indonesian economy represents a market of some 180 million people, as I have said a couple of times already, and it is an economy which has now, after a considerable measure of restructuring in recent years, entered a period which I think-one can never be sure-will be a period of fairly sustainable growth. The World Bank estimates that economic growth in Indonesia for the rest of this decade will average somewhere between S and 6 per cent per annum. Consequently, just looking at it in crude economic terms, it is a market that will continue to grow for Australia. There will be a growing middle class in Indonesia. It is a country that will weigh more heavily on regional politics and economics, but it does present a very good market for us in the longer term. Our bilateral trade relationship with Indonesia is, however, quite surprisingly a very limited one at this stage. Something like 1.8 per cent of our exports go to Indonesia and 0.9 per cent of our imports come from that country. So it is actually a remarkably small trading partner, despite its proximity to Australia. It is interesting to reflect on the that our exports to Indonesia, which last year amounted to something like $1 billion worth, were concentrated not exclusively, but almost exclusively, in the primary areas. For example, our wheat exports constituted around IS per cent of our total exports to that country. This year we are expected to export about $IS2m worth of wheat to Indonesia. Although Indonesia is a small trading partner for Australia, despite its geographic proximity, we are Indonesia's sixth largest source of imports and we are the fifth largest foreign investor in Indonesia, with a very narrow range of Australian companies-I think there are only about IS-investing something like $1 billion in that country. The point that we have been making on this side of the House for quite some time is that, as an exporting nation and as an investor, we have not been doing well enough in Indonesia. As I have said already, Indonesia offers very major opportunities for Australia. But it is also a country that has a much wider importance to us-a regional importance, as the largest country within ASEAN and as a very influential member of the regional community. We need to ensure that our relationship with ASEAN, which has, I think, developed fairly well over the past couple of decades, continues to build. We obviously have a long term economic interest in our region. We have to understand that we have a long term political interest in our region, and that involves developing strong political as well as economic ties with the ASEAN countries and other countries of the region. I do not pretend that that is an easy task. Incidents like the one referred to in the motion bring home to us with a great jolt how difficult that task will be. Without wishing to be undiplomatic about the issue, the other ASEAN countries and many of the Asian countries, including Japan, have been quite silent about this incident in East Timor. I do not think they should have been, but they have been quite silent about it. Obviously that represents pragmatic foreign policy concerns, but to some extent it underlines the cultural differences between Australia and other parts fact of the region. That is something that they will have to work on and we will have to work on, and it does underline a very difficult challenge for us in the years ahead. Perhaps that serves as a reminder to those people in Australia, particularly a lot of the academics, who glibly say that we have to integrate within our region. I guess I could be accused of this. We have to integrate within our region. We should never underestimate the very difficult task that that presents to us. Nevertheless, Indonesia is a vitally important part of the region, as I have mentioned in the context of ASEAN. It is also a member of APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation! group, which I think has tremendous potential as a foundation for developing a liberal trading arrangement of which Au-tralia and the ASEAN countries, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States and Canada can fonn a part. This reminds us how difficult that task will be; nevertheless, it is in our national interest to work at it. For fear of being accused of being overly cynical in referring to commercial and longer term political issues in this heart-rending debate, I say in conclusion that they are factors that in the broad sweep of history we will have to take into consideration in the context of our relationship with Indonesia. To finish where I started-I want to re-emphasise these points-I think we will find it very difficult to develop a relationship with our region if we simply take a neo-imperialist view that no inquiry established by the Indonesians themselves can prima facie ever be accepted as a bona fide inquiry. We have to accept with respect that the Indonesian Government is a sovereign government and that the Indonesian people are a sovereign people. We have to allow them to pursue justice in the way in which they regard as appropriate. However, we have the right to make judgment about the impartiality and the objectivity of that investigation. If a similar incident occurred in Australia, we would not want to be told by other countries how to construct an investigation and whom we should involve in that investigation, but we would accept that those other countries ultimately had a right to express a view about the quality of the investigation that we undertook. That is what we will do in this country, because we have the right to make that judgment. Let us give Indonesia the opportunity to conduct the investigation. If, as a result of that investigation, Indonesia brings to justice the people who were responsible for this horrific incident, I think we can probably do no more than express our deepest regret to not only those people who lost their lives but also their families and those associated with them. But it would be a mistake for us to be impulsive and get swept up by a rush of blood to the head and start taking immediate action against Indonesia without in the first place giving it opportunity to conduct the investigation. So I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas and I hope the rest of the House will support the amendment moved by the Opposition.",135
501,Mr SNOWDON,EAST TIMOR,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (10.43 p.m.)-The Government will not be accepting the amendment proposed by the Opposition. However, we respect the way Pl which this debate is being conducted and also the views. which have been put forward by all those who have participated thus far and, no doubt, all those who will follow me. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) made a particularly apt contribution by pointing out the human tragedy which has occurred in East Timor. I refer to an observation of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) about the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian armed forces and on allegations about the number of people who were involved in the massacre and who died. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) pointed out some very important aspects of the way in which Australia has in the past dealt with the issue of East Timor in terms of international relations and, I think, aptly demonstrated in a very coherent way the responsibility we as a nation have to take seriously the concerns of the East Timorese people. I would like to particularly address a couple of points, before I go into some observations of my own, about the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I understand where he is corning from, and I think he presents a very good argument, but I think we have to go further than just satisfying ourselves about this investigation. That is why I believe this motion puts forward very positive proposals about how Australia might advance the really important issue, the crux of this whole debate, which is the future of East Timor. I respect the honourable member's view and I agree with a lot of what he said in relation to the need for Australia to build a closer and stronger relationship with our South East the Asian neighbours, particularly Indonesia. I have made public comment in the past on this subject. We have been building a close and mutually beneficial relationship in the recent past, but it concerns me that the problem of East Timor remains between us. Whilst I do not believe it is appropriate for us to try to rewrite history, because we cannot, we must recognise how important that association between East Timor and Australia has been. I will refer to that in a moment. In talking about the mutually beneficial relationship and the importance of that relationship, I agree with the honourable member for Mayo that we need to focus our national attention on Indonesia-for many reasons, not least because of our commercial interests, but also because we have a responsibility as a nation and as part of the international community. I am fortunate that my electorate is the Northem Territory. The city of Darwin is our closest city to Indonesia. Darwin was the point at which soldiers embarked to go to Timor during the Second World War. I want to make some short reference this evening to that particular point. In 1942 the soldiers of the 2/2 and 2/4 independent companies, or the commandos, were on East Timor for an extended period of time. I will refer briefly to an article by Kenneth Davidson in the Age of Thursday, 14 November because in one paragraph he aptly summarises the importance of the role played by those soldiers in East Timor: Strategic realities for Australia have not much since the 1940s when Australia sent naval ships to Noumea to expel the Vichy Governor after Japan entered the war and left 400 commandos on East Timor to harass a full division of Japanese troops. The 12,000 troops Japan left on Timor were not available for the campaign to take Port Moresby via the Kokoda trail, in which Japan unsuccessfully used one-and-a-half divisions. On Timor, the aptly named ""sparrow force"" caused 1,500 Japanese casualties for the loss of 40 Australians. The real casualties were suffered by the East Timorese who lost 40,000 as the Japanese wiped out whole villages suspected of offering succour to the Australians. To me, that is the guts of this debate. We have a special relationship with East Timor and, in my view, a very important responsibility to those people because they sacrificed themselves for this country. I come with quite emotional feelings to this particular area of the debate. That emotion is a result of knowing many of those soldiers who fought in East Timor for Australia. One of those soldiers was a friend of my father's who was in the 2/2 commandos. His name is Pat Kenneally. Pat Kenneally is an Irish-Australian, a wharfie, and some would say a bit of a rogue. He is a man probably in his early 70s who visited East Timor again two years ago. He came back and wrote to me. I then wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) as a result of what he observed and as a result of the repressive military occupation of East Timor. That situation was one in which there was a complete denial of human rights for East Timorese people, a situation which he was able to tell me about first hand because he had spent a couple of weeks travelling around East Timor. He came back and told us about the way the military was intimidating the locals. It is fortunate also because Darwin, a very beautiful city, has a very multicultural population. I first went to Darwin in 1976, not two months after the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. Darwin was a dropping off point, if you like, for many refugees, many East Timorese refugees, many of whom are my friends. Some of them remember the Second changed World War and some remember the role their parents played with the generation of our parents on East Timor and the closeness of that association. Whilst, as I say, I do not want to dwell significantly on the history or attempt to rewrite it, the shame for Australia is that, on 7 December 1975, we took no action. Not only did we take no action, but also we walked away from it. ",138
502,Mr SNOWDON,EAST TIMOR,"And we have walked away from it ever since. The foreign Minister of the time interjected that that is not true. The record says differently. The fact of the matter is that there have been successive opportunities-and the Labor Party is as much responsible as anyone else in this-for Australia to play a very constructive role in trying to bring about some resolution of the problems of East Timor. To my shame, and to my Party's shame, we took that fatal step in 1984 of giving formal de jure recognition through our party processes. It is something which I now live with. But I say to honourable members that, had I been in a position to do so, I would have attempted to influence the decision so that it was not made in that way. I say to those people who would have a different view that my observations are not made with jaundice or malice; they are made with a great feeling of concern-a concern that since 1975, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, in excess of 200,000 lives have been lost in East Timor. That is significant, is it not, because the population of East Timor at the time of the Indonesian invasion was approximately 700,000? So what we have seen is more than one in three East Timorese people die as a result of this conflict. It has been ongoing, and it is not as if the occurrences of 12 November are new, because the 16 years since that Indonesian occupation have been peppered with similar stories. The unfortunate reality is that, until 1988, the borders of East Timor effectively were closed. The reports that we in the outside world got were necessarily filtered or made by observers, by individuals. We were not able to get in and have Amnesty International or the international Red Cross or other reputable bodies make observations about the effect on human rights in East Timor. We did not have that ability. Fortunately in one respect, since 1988 the Indonesians have broadened their horizonsand thankfully. They have said that they would allow visitors into East Timor. It is fortunate because, on 12 November this year, two people-one of whom I know quite well, Saskia Kowenberg, and her friend Russell Anderson-were in East Timor and witnessed the massacre. Let me tell those people who would think that there is no intelligence network besides the networks of official governments or that there is no other that is accurate that I know these people. I relied on Saskia Kowenberg. She had worked for me; I trusted her. I have no reason to doubt her observations. She is one of the people who blew the whistle, and she blew the whistle because Indonesia, thankfully, decided to open up the borders of East Timor in 1988. In speaking to the motion-as I have said, quite emotionally-I reiterate what I said at the outset: in my view, it is extremely important that we build a closer and stronger relationship with Indonesia. But it has to be one which is based on mutual trust and one wherein we can raise these concerns and say to the Indonesian authorities, 'You must fix the problem of East Timor'. It is no longer good enough that, 16 years after the initial invasion, the conflict continues. It is no longer good enough that the litany of human rights abuses that have marked that occupation continue in 1991. It is no longer good enough and, in international terms, it is not acceptable. We as a nation have a responsibility. I think the motion addresses that responsibility. It does not go all the way, in terms of what some of us might like; but it does go to the crux of the issue. It says that, in the first instance, we need to address this issue of human rights. But it is worth noting the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time this afternoon, and I say that with some pride. He said: ... I try to put constructively ... has to seek a resolution of that continuing conflict and understand that the military solution is no solution. It will not solve the continuing running sore and tragedy of East Timor in military terms. It must understand that. I have said that the Indonesian Government must make renewed efforts not to meet just in some formal tokenistic way but to sit down and talk with the people of East Timor, including the people from the resistance. Xanana Gusmao, the leader of the Fretilin resistance forces in East Timor, in an interview with Bob Domm late last year, said: I am ready to discuss any project for a solution without preconditions and under the auspices of the United Nations. We have a responsibility. As a result of this motion, we have asked our Government to raise this issue with the United Nations Secretary-General. There is the propensity for the Secretary-General to be the advocate for these sorts of talks. I believe the House should endorse this motion most strongly.",139
503,Mr RONALDSON,EAST TIMOR," There is one thing we can all be sure of in this debate: no-one has the moral high ground. Of that there is no doubt at all. I do not want to see this whole discussion about the tragedy that has occurred in East Timorindeed, the tragedy has been ongoing for many years-degenerate into party politics. On that note, I would like to read a response from Senator Ray in the other place yesterday in answer to a question from Senator Spindler. It is quite regrettable that the Australian Democrats appear to be playing politics. They are trying to take the high ground in this matter, and it is totally inappropriate. For the sake of the record, I would like to read the question from Senator Spindler and then the response from Senator Ray, which think puts our defence relationship with Indonesia into some sort of context. I then want to address the real issue in this matter, region namely, what happened this month in East standing. Timor. Senator Spindler said: I refer the Minister for Defence to the defence export guidelines which state that exports may not be approved where a risk exists that they will be used against the citizens of the importing country. Firstly, given repeated Indonesian atrocities in Timor, West Irian, Aceh and elsewhere, can the Minister explain why approvals were granted in 1989-90 to Australian Defence Industries to sell ammunition to the Indonesian armed forces. Secondly, what further approvals to export military equipment to Indonesia have been given since 1989-90 and what is the exact purpose of the best, military training of Indonesian personnel conducted under the defence cooperation program? An incident occurred in the gallery and Senator Robert Ray responded: I thank my fan club for the reception. In relation defence exports to Indonesia, the export guidelines have been scrupulously and properly met. The ammunition to which Senator Spindler refers, as he knows full well, is 4.5-inch naval ammunition used for practice purposes. He knows that, but everyone else has been saying, 'Probably our ammunition was used in Dili'. That is absolute nonsense. None of our defence exports have ever been used for internal security purposes. Senator Spindler goes on to ask what other defence exports have been sent to Indonesia in the period 1989-90 and onwards. There are three .. None of those were defence related at all. Senator Ray continued: That is the totality of our defence exports to Indonesia. It is remarkably low. Indonesia does not seek to source its defence equipment within Australia-l assume for reasons of price rather than anything else. While Senator Spindler may not have been trying to imply that the ammunition was being used in Dili, others who have been associated with him have. I think it is a good opportunity to at least put that to rest. Senator Spindler went on to ask about Indonesians being trained under the defence cooperation program. This is a remarkable question. The defence cooperation program with Indonesia was cancelled in 1986. It has not been revived and will never be revived. It simply does not exist. In fact, as the honourable senator would well know, the defence relationship was somewhat strained from 1986 through to 1990. The tentative re-establishI ment of a reasonable defence relationship has occurred from 1990 onwards. That has occurred mostly at a senior level and is mostly aimed at trying to create a degree of transparency in our so that there will be no military misunderThe honourable senator, although he did not ask for the number, asked whether Indonesians were involved in training in Australia. There are some, but far less than all of our other neighbours because this is a very tentative relationship which is being East built up. I very much defend the type of military training that we provide because it broadens the horizons of officers coming overseas and broadens their experiences of other cultures and other values. The one thing that Australia is excellent at is , training: having a disciplined and polished officer coming out the other end who will exemplify the not the worse, of military values. None of that training is to do with internal security matters; nor would the Indonesians ever expect it to be so. I will be absolutely horrified if the Australian Democrats try to take the moral high ground on this matter. Members from both sides of to the House-including the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)-are expressing their absolute horror at the events which occurred on that day. The events were shameless; they should never have happened. I would like to see this debate seek proper resol-tions. I say to the Labor Party and I say to my Party that so far this matter has not been subject to party politics and I very much hope that it will not. I can see that my colleagues on the other side of the House are in full agreement on that. Paragraph (2) of the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Moreton states: condemns in the strongest tenns the resort by the Indonesian military to force which on every account was wholly excessive; It was more than on every account. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has drawn that to our attention tonight. The words used by the honourable member for Dundas probably better cover that situation. His amendment states: condemns in the strongest tenns the resort by the Indonesian military to excessive force; There are some matters that should be raised. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is back in the House tonight. When he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, he promoted co-sponsorship of a resolution in the United Nations with respect to East Timor. I can understand that he was aggrieved before he left the House five or 10 minutes ago. I place on record exactly what happened in that regard. The realities are that, if something positive does not come out of the approach by the Indonesians to this incident, if something does not come out of what we are told will be a high level investigation, I have no doubt that we will need to totally revise our position on this matter. I am fully aware of the sensitivity of the relationship with what is an extremely close neighbour. But I do not think under any circumstances we can in any way condone what happened. I do not care what the ramifications are for our relationship with Indonesia. When we are speaking strictly about this incident I do not think there is anyone who could, in his right mind, justify what happened or in any way attempt to exculpate those who were involved in it. Apart from the obvious human tragedy of what has occurred and my very great concern with the abuse of human rights which took place on that day, one of the reasons that I decided to speak to this motion is that three weeks ago I spoke to a young lady who is studying in Ballarat. Given the short notice of this matter-and this is not in any way a reflection on the member for Moreton-I have not been able to contact the young lady concerned and I would be reluctant to use her name until I had spoken to her. Her family is still in East Timor. She has very strong contacts with one of the political organisations in East Timor. We had a very long, in depth and extremely interesting discussion about the views that her political party in East Timor was taking on self-determination-Oli independence, and it was quite obvious to me that there had been a shift. There was a very real willingness on the part of her political party to sit down and talk about a reasonable approach to the settlement of this problem, and it was not on a precondition of assumptions on behalf of the political party as to what it would necessarily want, which had been a problem in the past. What has happened now is that they are totally polarised, and quite frankly I do not blame them. It may not be anything to do with the Indonesian government; I have not conducted an inquiry and there has not been an inquiry conducted as yet; it may have been a group of people acting entirely outside the Indonesian government. I sincerely hope that is the situation. That is not the point. What has happened is that the incident has taken away what I believe was a genuine wish on behalf of East Timorese people to satisfactorily resolve this dispute, which has been continuing for the last 15 years. Without any pre-conditions they were prepared to sit down and discuss it. This has certainly polarised their views on it and I have very great concerns about whether we can again bring up from the ashes of this event that conciliatory approach that I found very obvious when I was speaking to this young lady. I am the first to admit that she is the only person I have spoken to who was actively involved in the political process in East Timor. I trust her judgment. She is a young lady who made a lot of common sense. I have obviously sent my condolences to her, but I have not had an opportunity to follow up our initial discussion. I will be imploring her that, despite this, her political party still maintain the attitude it held before this quite deplorable massacre. We have a very, very important role to play, in my view, in relation to the East Timorese-Indonesian situation, and I hope we have the political and moral will that, after this official inquiry is conducted, if we are not satisfied with what has happened, we will very, very strongly take further action. They are separate issues: one is the massacre and the other is the long term future of the East Timorese. I do not think it is appropriate to get those two confused. We need to resolve what happened with regard to the massacre, and we need to put steps in place to ensure that the second part is accorded the same importance as the first part. I am aware of the late hour, and I am aware that there are other members who wish to speak, and I thank the House.",141
504,Mr DUNCAN,EAST TIMOR,"I rise to speak in this debate tonight with a heavy heart in many respects, and a heavy feeling of responsibility. I think few debates have been held in this Parliament which go to the very gravamen of what we as members of parliament are about. When one looks at the history of the situation that has existed in East Timor and the role that our country, through successive governments, has played, one must get the feeling that we bear a heavy responsibility for the events that have occurred in recent weeks. I support the motion that is before the House. I think it is a minimal position and one which ought to be supported unanimously by all honourable members. I do take into consideration the thoughtful words of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who has just spoken, when he said that this debate should not in any way be a party political debate. I support that, and I am encouraged by his words in that regard. We should, as individuals in this debate, speak from our hearts of the morality that we feel in this particular issue. On Thursday, 21 November, I had the honour in Adelaide of officiating in the launching of an East Timor photographic exhibition. In my speech I spoke of the sense of shame that I share with many honourable members of this House for the stain that the continuing oppression of the East Timorese leaves on the record of successive Australian governments which have remained mute in the face of great tragedy and violence so velY close to our shores. Officiating at this launch and formally opening the East Timor talks campaign in South Australia was Ms Emilia Gusmao, the courageous wife of the Fretilin resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, who has asked that a message be conveyed to this House. I wish to share with honourable members Ms Gusmao's words, which comprise a plea for compassion and support which I believe no humane Australian could ignore. She says: I am an East Timorese woman and a mother who endured and experienced over these past 15 years the suffering, the anxiety, the drama and the struggle of our people against an unjust war, subjected and humiliated by all ways of repression. I've witnessed with my own eyes horrors which will remain in my memory, in my children's memory and in the memory of our people. Women were raped and murdered. Children also murdered; young Timorese subjected to torture day and night. Since 1975 to this date East Timor has become the largest prison in the world. The East Timorese are not allowed to walk free in their own land. The ""perganbunang"" developed in East Timor is a mere show case to convince the international community. For example; the asphalted roads used by military for quick dispatch for combat troops to fight the resistance in the mountains of East Timor. The 16 years of Indonesian occupation have brought nothing but tragedy to our people. The people of East-Timor are being exterminated in the face of the international community indifference, especially Australia, which valued its economic interests above the rights of the EastTimorese. Last week's massacre in East-Timor was of young men, women and children, including a New Zealand friend Kamal, who were gunned down by Suharto's soldiers. Many were seriously wounded without medical attention. Others were detained in the prisons for interrogations and at the same time are subjected to physical tortures. Luckily this time there were some foreign eyewitnesses from America, Australia and England to report the massacre. In' the end the world finally woke up. I have to say that the successive Australian governments are accomplices to the genocide perpetrated by the Indonesian troops in East-Timor. Since 1985 the present Labor Government has recognised Indonesia's sovereignty over EastTimor. It has strengthened Indonesia's generals resolve to exterminate the East-Timorese people. On behalf of my husband Xanana Gusmao and my martyred people I request the Australian Government to exert pressure on the Indonesian government to investigate the killings, under the auspices of the United Nations. We will never accept any inquiry coming from the Indonesian Government because it is the Suharto Government who orchestrated the killings. Will it be necessary for the whole people to be exterminated in order to show the world in a few years time that a crime of genocide has occurred in East-Timor? I would like to remind the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, that 300 miles off shore from Australia, East-Timor, which is a very tiny country, was invaded by a large neighbour country, Indonesia. If the principle of self-determination is applied for the people of Kuwait, Cambodia and South Africa, the East-Timorese deserve the same right. I welcome the Prime Minister's prompt condemnation and his appeal to the Indonesians to talk with the Timorese, including the resistance. I would like to re-phrase the proposal put forward by the resistance leader Xanana Gusmao and I quote: ""Dialogue with Indonesia without pre-conditions under the auspices of the United Nations. The EastTimorese people will never accept any dialogue as being a people of the 27th province of Indonesia. Finally, on behalf of East-Timorese people, my sincere thanks to all Solidarity organisations support given. I know that the blood shed by young Timorese, together with the other 200,000 Timorese already massacred, and your solidarity, strengthens our determination to proceed with our struggle for justice, peace and freedom and independence for East-Timor. Thank you for listening. Emilia Gusmao. I thought very carefully before I read that into Hansard, but it is fair to say that we all understand that the capacity for the East Timorese people to have their voice heard on the international stage is extremely limited. Although I do not necessarily agree with everything that was said in that statement, I certainly think that it is important that opportunities be made available for the people of East Timor to have their views expressed and heard in the international community. The passion that is so obvious in that statement bears witness to the pain that has been felt so dearly by all the people of East Timor. It also reminds us of the shame that I believe rests heavily upon the shoulders of successive Australian governments and, therefore, the Australian nation in relation to this matter. I want to spend the few moments that remain to me talking about how I believe we may be able to assist in resolving this dreadful situation. The first thing I want to say is that, undoubtedly, the key paragraph in the motion that is before the Parliament tonight is paragraph 1O(b), which states: in particular in these respects, requests that: active steps be taken to explore the role which might now be played, with wide international support, by the United Nations and its Secretary General. Undoubtedly, that is the key paragraph in the motion with which we are dealing tonight. There was some debate about the words in that paragraph amongst members of the Government. It was made clear that active steps meant more than merely strong support. It meant that we as a nation would take active steps to explore the role which might now be played with wide international support by the United Nations and the Secretary-General. In for the good faith, I hope that that will happen. It was the clear understanding of members of the Government that that would happen. Nobody should be in any doubt that that is the key section of the motion.  sively, but when you say that that is the key section, what do you actually mean? What do you want them to do?",143
505,Mr DUNCAN,EAST TIMOR,"I would hope that the United Nations would become involved in the situation in East Timor. I do not for a moment say that Australia should in any way seek to act unilaterally in this matter. We must act through the proper and appropriate international bodies. I believe that we will take an active role in pursuing this in the future. In addition, I hope that whatever differences have existed between Australia and Portugal over this matter in the past will be buried in the near future because of this window of international opportunity that has so sadly been created. I hope that Australia and Portugal will be able to act in concert to sponsor appropriate action in the international forums, including the United Nations. That would be entirely appropriate. I hope that Australia and Portugal will be able to do that. Undoubtedly, if the Portuguese and Australian governments in goodwill wish to assist the East Timorese, the best way for them to do that is to act in concert. I certainly hope that that will occur. I would particularly like to see an international parliamentary delegation visit East Timor. I think that that would be a very useful step. If parliamentarians from the United States, possibly Canada, the Dutch Parliament, the Portuguese Parliament, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Australia could visit East Timor, that would be a very useful step. I would certainly hope that in any delegation the Japanese Diet would become involved. It has an important role to play in this. This is an issue which in the context of the new world order should be taken up-and should be taken up with vigour. I say in passing that there has been a lot of talk internationally about the need for democracy throughout the world. Without saying any more about the matter, there are 180 million Indonesians who are in the situation of having little or no say and control over their Government. To put the issue of democracy in Indonesia on the international stage would be no bad thing. If we are concerned about democracy in Burma and various other countries in the world, to be equally consistent we should be concerned about democracy in Indonesia. I support the position that the Government has taken in relation to the commission of inquiry in Indonesia. I hope, as the motion says, that we will see a proper and effective inquiry. Whilst the outcome of that inquiry is very important, such an inquiry, its investigations and the outcome-recommendations or its report-should not be allowed to mask the underlying issues. Whilst I hope that the inquiry finds that the Indonesian Government was not involved in a premeditated way and that those who did perpetrate the outrage will be brought to justice, that will not be the end of the matter. The massacre has been just one in a series, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made clear in his contribution. The only difference on this occasion is that the international media were present and, hence, the world has had its eyes opened to the depth of human suffering involved and the need for international action to resolve the situation. (TIme expired)",144
506,Mr SINCLAIR,EAST TIMOR,"The events of 12 November were brutal and unconscionable. I do not think anyone in this chamber would believe that any manner of whitewashing of those events should be condoned. At the same time, I wish to make my contribution because I guess the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and I have been associated in a political sense with East Timor and Indonesia as long as any honourable members in this chamber. While I respect and understand the reasons why the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), who preceded me, expressed their views as they did, I do not really think that we can approach international affairs with quite that altruistic optimism that seems to have been demonstrated. I certainly do not believe that we can achieve the result that the Government seeks and we seek by trying to intrude on countries that, for some years now, we have accepted as having sovereign responsibility. Having said that, to me the events of 12 November are just as serious for Indonesia as the events in Tiananmen Square were for the people of China. Each incident was appalling in its total neglect of basic human rights. They were appalling in the loss of life and in the tragedy that occurred. As far as the events at the Santa Cruz cemetery are concerned, I certainly extend, along with all other members of the House, my deep personal sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who were slaughtered, to those who are still hospitalised and to those whose fate is unknown. I want to look at the events in four categories. First, it is important for us to understand that for a long time many on both sides of the House, and certainly the honourable member for Kooyong, felt that we might be able to give some opportunity to the people of East Timor perhaps to find some way by which they might have had an opportunity for independence or for some option other than to become incorporated as a province of Indonesia. That option is now no longer available. Those who encourage the members of Fretilin or the East Timorese or their supporters or relatives and friends who live in Australia towards that objective are deluding them. I just do not believe that that is now any longer a practical proposition. As of the end of the 1970s that option was lost. For all that we feel as we do, we have to remember that, sadly, many of the nations of ASEAN have barely said anything on this issue. We are flat out getting the support of many of the other countries in the world that have been only too free to condemn South Africa and to condemn the events of Tiananmen Square. We have to make sure that we separate the question of sovereignty from the expression of our concern. We have to see how we might be able to use these tragic affairs and deaths to change the attitude of the Indonesian Government towards its administration and, hopefully, to introduce those very objectives which are sought. Let me make it quite clear: we have to look at how the objectives expressed by the honourable member for Moreton and, indeed, by honourable members on both sides of the House-that for those who live in East Timor there should be an opportunity to practise their religion freely, to preserve their culture and to live in a society where there is freedom for the individual, where there is not persecution, where the armed combat forces no longer dominate their lives-might be achieved. I think that is really at the core of what we have to do. It is important that we set aside that sovereignty issue and look at how we might be able to achieve, out of these tragic events, a better regime for the future. While I know there are many on the other side who feel that the national committee of investigation that has been authorised by President Suharto is not perhaps as extensive as they might wish-and we have heard the honourable member for Makin suggest that he really wants United Nations intervention-we have to understand that our relationship with Indonesia is such that we really cannot at this stage go to the United Nations. As the honourable member for Kooyong said, 'What do you want? How are you going to get the United Nations into it?' The United Nations is a group of nations within which there are many who do not feel as emotional or as sympathetic for the plight of the people of East Timor as we do. It is not only a matter of getting the numbers; it is also a matter of trying to find a vehicle by which an international agency like the United Nations might be able to do something to assist. I certainly endorse the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). Paragraph lOCh) is not the way to go. We need to try to ensure that the Indonesians not only see this new national committee of investigation as being the most significant inquiry that they have conducted but also understand that international pressure will be looking extraordinarily closely at the way in which that committee carries out its investigation. It is chaired certainly by a gentleman who was once a general, but in the Indonesian system we need to understand that that is not unusual. He has been a practising Supreme Court judge for many years. The constitution of that committee represents a number of departments from the Indonesian Parliament and ABRI. It is still an entirely sophisticated means of inquiry within the Indonesian system, which is so different from our own. Internationally we have to put pressure on that Indonesian Government to make sure that that committee conducts its inquiry impartially, that justice is done to the extent that those East Timorese witnesses who might be called on have no fear of reprisal against themselves or their families and that they are able to give their evidence. We need to ensure that the traditions of our system of justice are exercised to the maximum by the national committee of investigation. We need to make sure that those who are responsible for this appalling tragedy are properly brought to trial and that, if they are found guilty, they are called on to bear the penalties that exist under Indonesian law. I have heard several of my colleagues on the other side of the House tonight try to assert that Australian law and our precepts of justice should apply. Whether we wish that that be so or not, as a nation we are not able to impose our systems on Indonesia. There is no doubt that we have a particularly close association with East Timor. Australians have suffered and have been imprisoned and died as a result of their service there. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) said, the worse tragedy has occurred with the East Timorese themselves. That is not a basis upon which we can impose our system of justice. We have to accept that the Indonesian system is different and that the tragedy itself, and the international consciousness of that tragedy, are just as consequential for Indonesia as the events of Tiananmen Square were for China. They give us as an international community a capacity to require that that committee of investigation not only applies a greater standard of impartiality than perhaps existed before but that it elevates the standard of justice beyond anything that has also existed before. If we can achieve that, it will be a significant advance. It is perhaps important that before the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) make their visits we ensure that the Indonesians know what we expect of them. I trust we do not only do it for them. I would like to see Australia doing that with its friends in the United States, Japan and Europe. If we can bring that pressure to bear on Indonesia, that is the first important step. I believe that was part of the purpose of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas. The next thing that is really quite critical is that we then look beyond this tragedy, beyond the trial and beyond the investigation, and see how we can use this tragedy. There is just no condoning it, and I do not seek to do so. Nobody looking at the fact that perhaps a battalion deputy commander and a private soldier might have been injured can accept that the measure of the reaction by the military was justifiable. However, there seems to me to be some matters that we can take from this tragedy and use as vehicles to seek changes in the way in which the Indonesians administer this province. Ther.e has to be a reduction in the number of combat soldiers that are currently serving there. In a report that was a product of a visit by several members of this House, including the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and Senator Sherry and Senator MACDonald and me, we commented that, sadly, the balance between combat and construction corps within ABRI is excessive. There is no longer an excuse for that high military presence. I am quite concerned about what still seems to be an overly heavy presence by, allegedly, East Timorese-whether that is so, I do not know-within the police. There has to be a greater recognition of the human rights aspects of the people of East Timor. They are different. They are predominantly Catholic; they seek to pursue their religion. Their culture is largely based on the Portuguese culture and they seek to preserve that. They should be allowed to do so. After all, to my mind, that is what the doctrine of Pancasila is about. It is a matter of trying to allow, within one nation, the practice of a number of different faiths. I think it is very important that we encourage the Indonesians to do that. If they are to do that, they have to treat East Timor in the same way that they treat the people of every other province. I do not think that is happening. This incident shows that it is not happening. As a result of what happened in Tiananmen Square, we expect a greater standard from the Chinese in the treatment of their citizens and the freedoms of the individual and the opportunities for democratic views and for difference within their peoples for the future. So, too, should we expect that of Indonesia. What is called for is fewer troops and a better standard of justice. There can be no doubt that the Portuguese left this nation in an appalling state. Frankly, I have no truck with those who suggest that perhaps one alternative is that East Timor return to being a Portuguese colony. The Portuguese exploited it for all they were worth. There is no basis for anybody suggesting that the Portuguese should again take it over. We need to say to the Indonesians, 'You can't afford to be viewed by the world in today's environment as the Portuguese are viewed as a colonial power. If you say that this is part of Indonesia it must be a part of Indonesia'. The people have to be treated differently and then we have to look at the way by which we can develop them towards those freedoms of which I spoke a little while ago. The freedoms have to be not only in the social and religious and human rights sense but also in the economic sense. East Timor is not a rich province. It is a province of about 737,000 people, with about 120,000 living in Dili. It is a province which has been very admirably administered by Governor Mario Carrascalao, whom I found to be a very fine fellow. I have met him on a number of occasions. I have a great deal of respect for him and I respect him all the more since he said that, if the investigation set up by the Indonesian authorities is not fair and dispassionate, he will resign. That will be one of the catalysts. We can look at what further action is necessary if he feels that that is to be the outcome. An enormous responsibility now falls on him and Brigadier-General Warouw, the military commander. They have to change the ground rules. They have to provide economic opportunity as much as political freedoms and religious freedoms. There is an aspect of religious freedom which I think is important. I am disappointed that the bishop in Dili is responsible to the papal nuncio in Jakarta, unlike every other Catholic parish within the whole of Indonesia. I would like to see closer links between Dili, East Timor and Australia. I would like to see an airline service-perhaps the old TAA service-resume. Let us get more visitors in there. Let us open the doors. Let people from East Timor visit Australia to see their relatives here. Let the Catholic church in Australia perhaps develop new relationships there. We must not overreact. Indonesia is too important. We need to use our special relationship to ensure that there is a proper prosecution of justice. Above all, we should not destroy what is a developing, critical relationship with Indonesia. This is a vital issue. Let us treat it as a vital issue. Let us treat the issue dispassionately, fairly and wisely, with a view to the future and not the past. (Time expired)",145
507,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,EAST TIMOR,"I am pleased to speak on this motion and to follow the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in this debate. I listened carefully to his remarks, and I think the substance of them added a great deal to the quality of debate we have heard this evening. I particularly congratulate my colleagues who visited Indonesia and East Timor and presented a report on that visit. Many of us have read that report and thought carefully about what it had to say. The underlying tension and difficulty that was evident in East Timor came through in that report. There were obviously differences about some matters, and to some extent those differences have been shown in terms of current events, but I think the fact that Australian members of parliament were concerned enough to visit is quite significant. It is obviously from this concern that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has moved this motion-a motion which has great significance for this House. It is interesting to note the number of people who have contributed to this debate. The other debate this year that comes to mind is the debate on foreign policy during the Gulf war. We have seen that this Parliament is capable of addressing itself to international issues of this dimension. I think the right honourable member for New England reflects the Australian public's concern about what has happened in East Timor. I have been interested in the extent to which people have been concerned about it. Some colleagues have raised with me that, given other difficulties-the levels of unemployment and the problems in the community-it is interesting that there has been public concern about East Timor, because in some respects a lot of Australian people feel a great degree of responsibility for what has happened there. Many servicem-n who were in East Timor during World WadI report receiving cooperative treatment and support from the East Timorese. In my own area some servicemen have never ceased to put to me their concern about what is happening in East Timor. Mr Snowdon-A lot of Western Australians were there.",148
508,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,EAST TIMOR,"A lot of Western Australians, indeed. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that. Many Western Australians were involved there. Within my own area, many have continued to put the question of East Timor. In some senses the policy of appeasement that we have followed since 1975 has not worked, and the Australian community shares the responsibility for that. The sad thing about that policy of appeasement was that it was a case of trying to deal in a civilised and open way with a near neighbour-Indonesia-and to encourage it to operate and cooperate in what we would have hoped would be the ultimate emergence of East Timor as a proper community. That clearly has not happened, and we have to address that. The current issue in East Timor does focus on another concern in dealing with the region which we have seen in relation to Malaysiathat is, the ever present tension between what we might regard as a set of values and principles of behaviour that are customary in Western democracies and the behaviour that people regard as essential to keeping their communities together in near neighbouring countries. For example, we have had it put to us that some Australian criticism of events in Indonesia or East Timor can be unacceptable to the Indonesian Government. Similarly, we have had it put to us that criticism of our Malaysian neighbours is unacceptable. We have to recognise that we live in this part of the world; at the same time, the values to which we subscribe have an application across the board. One cannot afford to submerge those values because, in terms of geography, one moves a short distance. In this case, moving from the northern part of Western Australia or the Northern Territory across to East Timor does not require, or ought not require, us to reduce the value we would place on human life. In some senses that is what is being asked for-just as when we looked at the Tiananmen Square matter an assumption was being made by some in China that we in Australia would change our sets of values. This motion is saying to the Indonesian Government that we on both sides of this Parliament believe that there are some very important elements at stake in East Timor. One of the elements is the need to have a full and complete inquiry now which would meet certain tests that we would want to impose upon it. Very clearly, the words 'that the inquiry is ""free, accurate, just and thorough"" as promised' are very central to the whole issue. It is unfortunate that we need to put that into this motion, because it presupposes that the inquiry might be otherwise. But, sadly, that is what the experience in recent times suggests. What we are saying to the Indonesians in the firmest possible way is that we would hope that is the outcome. I also listened to the remarks of right honourable member for New England and in some senses I want to pick up his theme, but I also want to continue to be positive and optimis,tic in terms of our dealings with Indonesia so that the events in East Timor do not write off all the other relationships we would have with Indonesia. What we want to say to the Indonesians is, 'There are many other levels of relationship we have with you. However, what we would ask of you is that we do need a complete report on what has happened. We also need some standards of treatment of people and we need information on what has happened to those people. The best way for that to be determined is through humanitarian and aid groups, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross'. That is an essential element of this whole approach. We need to be able to say to people in our own community that we have imposed some standards in terms of the inquiry outcome and, secondly, that we want outside groups to examine what should happen and what has happened in terms of East Timor. Having said all that, the next issue is that the Australian Government should have regard to the whole array of bilateral contacts we have with Indonesia and be prepared to examine them. The Government is really putting up a set of claims. What it is saying to the people of Indonesia, to the people of Australia and to the East Timorese is that as a parliament we should regard this issue so seriously that we are prepared to examine bilateral contacts. We do not want to put them all in jeopardy, but we can simply say that we are prepared to examine them. We believe that would be, and is, a significant part of our dealings. Some people make the claim that the Portuguese should be allowed back into East Timor. In the European Parliament this year I told the Portuguese that much of the problem of East Timor could be placed at the feet of the Portuguese themselves. There is no comparison between the infrastructure which they left behind in East Timor and what the British left behind when they decolonised. There were no professional classes, and an inadequate structure was left there when the Portuguese packed up and left. It is not good enough for them to now tum around and say, 'We want to restore what we had before' or make claims about that circumstance. That is not acceptable. What we are saying, and what I would determinedly hold to, is that we need a process which will ultimately lead to self determination for the East Timorese people. We recognise what is at stake here-the right honourable member made these remarks earlier-and that is the Indonesian Government's recognition that East Timor is different from some of its other provinces. Until now it has not been prepared to understand or to accept that proposition. We believe that is an important part of this motion. Further, we are also suggesting that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) make an early visit to Indonesia to discuss all aspects of the East Timor situation. It would clearly indicate to the Indonesians the significance of the matter. A visit of this nature ought to be made and the normal visits could be put to one side. We need to have our Foreign Minister go and report back to us as a parliament and the Australian people on the events there. Finally, the establishment of a resident Australian consulate in DiU is also an indication that this is a country which is close to us and that in the future we need a much closer relationship. I can recall some days in 1975 when I had hoped that we would have had on our doorstep an emerging country with which we had dealings in a very open and free way. It may be that that is what is down the track. It would be a good outcome if we were, in fact, to have a near neighbour with which we could have free and open dealings. I would say to the Australian people that, if the venture that we have put in terms of this motion were to fail, there is the possibility of a larger number of refugees from East Timor than has previously been the case and I think that would be of concern to all Australians. As I understand that the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) wishes to participate in this debate, I will make one or two more quick remarks and then conclude. We as a parliament believe this to be an important issue. This a signal to the Indonesian Government that we as a parliamellt place this matter high on our agenda. But it is also a signal to the Australian people that we believe that we have a responsibility as a national parliament to reflect their real anger, concern and outrage at what has happened in East Timor. We have before us a set of steps in the motion which I believe address the issue. Accordingly, I am pleased to support the motion.",149
509,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,EAST TIMOR,"I rise to identify myself with the viewpoint that was so clearly and eloquently expressed by my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). In the course of his speech, the right honourable member urged us to set aside the sovereignty issue and to see what constructive outcome can be achieved from these tragic events which, indeed, he compared as significant for Indonesia as Tiananmen Square was for China. He urged that the national commission of investigation be encouraged to conduct its inquiry in a free, accurate, just and thorough way, as has been promised, and that it be as fair and impartial as possible. He also urged us to join with other nations in bringing pressure to bear to ensure that those responsible for these tragic events be brought to justice. Let us hope that some good may come from this tragedy. Perhaps it might be something of a catalyst for change in the attitude and approach of the Indonesian Government in that area. The right honourable member us not to over-react in this matter as our relationship with Indonesia is extremely critical. We note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) proposes to visit Indonesia. We hope that constructive and forward looking resolution this matter, which is in the best interests Australia and our great neighbour, Indonesia, can be achieved. Debate (on motion by Mr Barry Jones) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories",150
510,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"Higgins) (11.55 p.m.)Tonight I wish to bring to the attention of the House a tragic situation concerning my former friend and neighbour, the late Mrs Jenny Halford. Mrs Halford was treated for inferwhich tility in the mid-1970s with human pituitary derived gonadotrophin-HPG-at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. She subsereply quently became the mother of two children. In 1990 she died. At the time she was living in England, as her husband had been transdoctors, ferred there for work related reasons. A post mortem revealed that she had died from a disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jacob-CJdisease, which attacks the central nervous system. In May 1990, the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Medicine reported the connection between HPG and CJ in the case of a woman who died in 1988 and who had received HPG injections in 1974-75. The report said: The human pituitary-derived Gonadotrophin was produced by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Australia. It is estimated that approximately 90 women received injections from this particular batch. Regardless of whether this is an isolated case or whether other recipients of human pituitaryderived Gonadotrophin subsequently developed Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, it highlights the potential infectivity of human derived products and reinforces the need for stringent regulation concerning both the manufacture and use of biological substances. urged I believe Mrs Halford is now the second woman to die as a result of receiving infected HPG prepared by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The disease manifested itself in these two cases approximately 15 years after a administration of the infected product. I am of concerned for the families of these two of women who are known to have died as a result of this treatment and I am also concerned about the risk to the remaining women who were treated with this batch of HPG prepared by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I have written to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories about this matter and I seek leave to table my correspondence and the reply from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Leave granted.",151
511,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"I have also written to the Director of the Endocrinology Clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, administered the HPG to Mrs Halford, seeking further information about how this tragedy occurred. I have not received any to my correspondence from the hospital. In 1990, the Department of Community Services and Health apparently wrote to involved in treating patients with HPG. I assume the Department has investigated this matter. The results of its investigation should be made public so the families of those women who have already died can receive a full explanation of the events that led to this tragedy and whether it could have been avoided. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services apparently has records of the recipients of all of these hormones. Although the Department has written to the doctors involved, I believe it should take steps to notify directly all those treated with this batch of HPG of the risks and all the facts as to how this occurred, as they are currently known. I believe the Department should make counselling available, not only to those people at risk but also to the families who have already suffered tragically as a result. What is now clear is that at least two women have died as a result of a treatment prepared by a Commonwealth authority-the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Their families have suffered the trauma of untimely death. In the case of the Halford family, a husband is now without a wife and two children are now without a mother. I believe it is incumbent on the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to prepare a proposal immediately to compensate the families who have suffered from this tragic loss and to disclose what remedial steps have been taken to ensure that such a tragedy will not occur in relation to other products that are prepared for medical treatment by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I urge the responsible Minister to take all action open to him to disclose what is now known about how this came about, how further suffering will be handled, and how compensation will be made available to those families who have already suffered the tragic loss of loved ones. Question resolved in the affirmative.
