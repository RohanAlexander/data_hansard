1,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In the absence of the Honorary Minister, I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether it would not be possible to have cheap leather covers supplied with the pocket book of Commonwealth statistics that has just been issued to members, and the issue of which I first suggested in this House a little time back. These books are likely to bo very much used because of the valuable information that they contain; but the .present covers are too flimsy, and wear off almost immediately. A cheap leather cover Bhould not cost more than about Jd. per book; it would not be necessary to print anything upon the cover.",12

5,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In the absence of the Honorary Minister, I ask the Prime Minister if he will request the Minister of Defence to cause inquiry to be made into the case of a boy named Walter Kreygger, who, at the Northcote Police Court, gave it BB his objection to compulsory drill that the teaching of the Bible was against it. He was sentenced to twenty-eight days' detention, and has written to his mother in these termsWe had to drill about half-past 7 this morning, and they all formed up and started off. I fell out with Harry Flintoff, and the officei came up and dragged me round the ground. Then he called two boys, one a champion boxer, to get me and push me around. This boxer",12

When he got up, said that he would summon his assailsubsequent ant, and was then struck such a brutal blow that, he says, "" it sent me clean over, and now there is an awful lump on my face."" I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether there is any truth of stamps. in those statements, and, if so, whether the punishment alleged to be inflicted on this boy was in accordance with the regulations. Mr JOSE PH COOK - If the facts are as alleged, and there is no other to the case, the officer responsible ought not to remain in the force a minute longer. At the same time we know what some boys are. Certainly it looks as if there had been bad blood between the officer and the.boy.

If he cannot give us the information now, will he obtain it during the day? Mr JOSE PH COOK - My impression is that no officer is entitled to use physical force. There are certain the regulations for adequate discipline, which would be observed by the officer except, of course, under emergent circumment stances, but I hop© my honourable friend will not get it into his head that all boys who have to be drilled are angels and all the officers brutes. the case.",13

17,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I cannot. The engraver of the Commonwealth notes side was kind enough to make a die, and engrave the plates in his own time for the printing of .these stamps, but th© Treasury Department will not allow him to strike off more than 1,000,000. If he were permitted, he could continue to print stamps at the rate of 1,000,000 per The Treasury Department is having dies prepared, so that further stamps can be printed by the electro process, which is the process employed for In my opinion, the stamps produced by the steelengraving process are much superior to the others.",13

22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The matter may not be debated at this stage.,14
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask the Postmaster General if he does not think that this is so? Those in the "" k n o w "" will undoubtedly corner as many of the stamps as they can get.",14

25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does the Postmaster General assume that the designer and engraver of ' these stamps has a private monopoly in the dies ? Does he not think that the Government is in duty bound to get possession of the dies, and to use them as it thinks fit?",14

52,Mr SPEAKER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"That is perfectly correct; but I have nothing to do with reprints from Hansard, which honourable members are at liberty to obtain at their own expense whenever and wherever they please. The matter is really i h the Treasurer's Department so far as it relates to reprints by the Government Printer. Under a resolution carried by the House, which is still in force, only exact reprints of Hansard are allowed.",15
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"I considered that when I put the resolution to the House with regard to the Printing Committee reference, and got the consent of the House, I had done all my duty. I took it then that the Printing Committee would take the same steps with regard to this as to any other matter, and that the Chairman, or whoever was responsible for the convening of the Committee, would call a meeting.",16
54,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"The Chairman, Senator Henderson, had gone home.",16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,It seems to me that it is a matter entirely for the Committee. I do not know - what more I can do. I should be glad if I could do anything more.,16
56,Mr SPEAKER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"The following is an extract from the Printing Committee's report appearing in the Votes and Proceedings of 5th August, 1909, at page 76 The Joint Committee have informally considered the. question of the printing of cross headings in the reprints of Parliamentary Debates for t'.ie use of Ministers, but, finding that the matter is beyond the powers of the Committee ns defined in the Standing Orders, have resolved to take no action unless on a special reference of the question to the Committee by the respective Houses. The resolution carried by the House appears on page 77. as follows: That the only reprints permitted be an exact reproduction of Hansard, but speeches already ordered by Ministers, with cross-headings, shall be printed and delivered. That is the position of the matter at the present time.",16
57,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,I am quite prepared to have the question of sub-headings under the censorship of the Treasurer.,16

62,Mr BOYD,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"About two months ago I asked the Minister acting for the Minister of Defence what the intention of the military authorities was with regard to the kilt. I was informed that I would receive a reply in a few days. So far, I have received none. Can the Prime Minister, answer the question now?",16
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"My impression, and I think it is correct, is that the kilt is to stay. LOANS TO STATES.",16
64,Mr SHARPE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,Hav e the Queensland Government made any arrangement for the repayment of their loans to the Commonwealth on any different basis from the other States?,16
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,I hope the honourable member will believe that all the States are being treated alike with regard to loan applications.,16
66,Mr SHARPE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,Is it a fact that the Government have agreed to accept from the Queensland Government half the money due next March as a return of that loan?,16
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"I am unable to say, but my impression from the correspondence is that the Treasurer is treating all the States in the same way, and straining a point to meet them wherever he can, without respect to any particular State. That is our duty. I know some concession of the kind was made only the other day to Mr Holman, but no political colour enters into a transaction of that kind. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ANTILL .",16

Five honourable members having risen in their, places. Question proposed.",17
77,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"Barrier) [11.30] - It was my intention to raise this question during the consideration of the Estimates relating to the Postmaster-General's Department, but, in pursuance of an arrangement to deal with the Estimates within a certain time, they were put through so hurriedly that I had not an opportunity to do so. It is necessary, perhaps, to explain that there are two kinds of stamps, the steel-engraved, which are valued by philatelists, and those printed .from zinc plates, which are known as utility stamps. The steel-engraved stamps are the more costly to produce, but, whilst they are better to look , at, and, from the stand-point of the philatelist, are preferable to the utility stamps, the general publio do not care whether they are supplied with the one or the other. I am somewhat inclined to philately, so that if I had followed my own personal predilections when I held office as Postmaster-General, I should have decided to issue the steel-engraved stamps. But, from the point of view of pounds, shillings, and pence, it was believed that only the utility stamps, which had been issued in Australia for many years, should be printed, and that was the decision of the late Government. In America steel-engraved stamps are issued, and I believe, although I am not quite sure, that they are also issued in Great Britain. The present ' Postmaster General has seen fit to print 1,000,000 steel-engraved stamps. It was announced that the issue would be confined to tfeat number, and the announcement is sure to appeal to philatelists all over the world. I do not wish to say anything unkind, but it seems to me that the downright ardent philatelist must be something in the nature of a crank.",17
78,Mr FLEMING,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,Say a misguided enthusiast.,18
79,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"That , perhaps, would be a better term to use. This issue of 1,000,000 stamps has been taken up, not by the general public, but for the most part by philatelists. It was recognised that there would be a general rush by these people, and in order to meet it the Postmaster-General directed that no person should be allowed to purchase more than six at any one time. The honourable gentleman's desire was that «these steel-engraved stamps should be distributed as far as possible among the general public, but nearly the whole issue has already found its way, I venture to say, into the hands of the philatelists. I am not complaining of this, because, as a matter of fact, I have a little corner in these stamps. A number of my parliamentary friends were good enough to buy the maximum number allowed to be issued at a time to any one person, and to hand them over to me. In Melbourne there is only one place where these stamps can be purchased today. They were available at that place a little while ago, but after the question put to the Minister / on the subject it is possible there has been another rush, and that even the supply there has become exhausted. I inquired at the General Post Oflice yesterday, and was told that these stamps were not available. An inquiry that I made at another office met with the same reply. The ob-: jection that I take to the Postmaster General's action is that he may do the same thing again, with the object of making a profit for the Department rather than of serving the public interest. The question of whether the steel-engraved stamp or the utility stamp should be issued is a matter of policy for the Government to decide. If the Postmaster General is a philatelist, he may urge that only steel-engraved stamps should be issued, but if the rest of the Government are not philatelists, then, like some of my colleagues in the late Ministry, they may prefer the cheaper issue. The question as to which class of stamp shall be issued should be settled, however, once and for all; otherwise we may have further issues of steel-engraved stamps, not for the public use, but simply to enable the Department to make a profit. If such a course of action were adopted and continued, it would reduce Australia to the level of some of the South American Republics. In South America there are some Governments who continually issue fresh designs, in steel engravings, and very attractive in character, merely for sale to philatelists; and I feel sure there is no one in this House who would for one moment desire to see the Commonwealth adopt such a policy.",18
80,Mr WEST,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,Why not ? It would raise revenue.,18
81,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"I should be sorry, indeed, if Australia started to'raise revenue through the Post Office in such a way. Those who have any acquaintance with what I may call the craze of stamp collecting, know that stamps become very valuable after they have been issued for some time. Only a few days ago, in a tram, a friend of mine asked me whether I had in my collection a certain Victorian stamp.",18
82,Colonel RYRIE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"Then the honourable member is a "" l it t l e bit gone"" on the craze ?",18
83,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"I admit that. I told my friend that I had not an actual stamp, but only a copy of it ; and he then informed me that when he was some seven or eight years of age, he found a trunk full of old letters' belonging to his grandfather, and that nearly all the stamps on the envelopes, as he remembered quite clearly, were the particular issue to which he referred. ""Unfortunately, he threw away the stamped envelopes; but had he retained them he would now have been able to obtain £ 2 5 each for the stamps. Stamps have a regular price in the market like any other commodity, and the fact that the Postmaster-General lated that each person should only be able to purchase sixpennyworth of the new issue shows that he full y realized that the philatelists would get to work. I understand the Postmaster-General to say that the Treasury will not allow him to have the die in order to p r in t any more of this new issue. My own opinion is that we ought to definitely decide, as a' matter of policy, whether a ' certain stamp is to be issued and continued, or whether only a certain number are to be printed. In regard to our Post Office we ought to have a high ideal; because no country with any respect for itself would issue stamps merely in order to make a profit over a brief period, and then introduce a fresh design with the same object in view. I do not suggest, or think for a moment, that this was the idea actuating the Postmaster-General; but I hope that we shall not have a similar occurrence. Whether a stamp be from a steel engraving or merely what is known as a u t i l it y stamp, it should be issued bond fide for postal purposes.",18
84,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"Wide Bay) [11.45] - I take rather a serious view of the statement of the Postmaster-General, not because he decided to issue only 1,000,000 of these stamps, but because of the un-' certain manner in which he informed us that he is unable to p r in t any more, as the matter is in the hands of the Treasurer. The language that the Postmaster-General used as to the plates being cut by Mr Harrison, the head of the Australian notes printing office, left the impression on my mind that the plates belong to that gentleman as his private property.",19
85,Mr AGAR WYNNE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,Nothin g kind.,19
86,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"I am glad to hear that. If the plates are not private property, they are the property of the Government of Australia, and, I venture to say, the property of the Postmaster-General and ""no other. They may, for practical pur[169]- 2 poses, be temporarily in the hands of the Treasurer, but they are in no sense the Treasurer's property. The Postmaster General has not been so clear on this occasion as he usually is. Speaking generally, the honourable gentleman is perfectly fran k in everything he says and does in the House; but in regard to this matter, he has not been so definite as I should have liked him to be. He must stipu- know whether he set out to p r in t 1,000,000 of these stamps, and no more; and, if he did, he should have taken the necessary precautions to insure that the issue did not f all into the hands of monopolists-shal l I say?-o n both sides of the House, or of other people "" in the know.""",19
87,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,The Postmaster-General did his best in this connection by stipulating that no person should be able to purchase more than sixpennyworth.,19
88,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"If the intention was to issue 1,000,000, and no more, the fact should have been stated to the House and to the. world. When the late Government were in office, certain alterations in the stamp design were made. ' These have been disapproved by the present Government; but I am not going to discuss that phase of the question. I understand from one of my colleagues that, immediately those alterations were made, great buyers sent for, I think, about £25 0 worth, not of the new issue, but of old unused stamps. What would they not give for a new issue of a limited number? I am given to understand that an issue of 1,000,000 mean's about one stamp for each active philatelist. Why, there are members of the community going about with pounds' worth in their pockets; and I think that this is grossly unfair. I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that there should be no truckling in connection with the printin g and issue of our stamps.",19

Is that the way the administration of the country is to be carried on ? What chance, under such circumstances, has an outsider to get even one stamp ? He will have to buy it from the dealers. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro surely sees that a public statement should have been made in this Chamber i m mediately the Government arrived at a policy in the matter. There should have been no communication of information, privately or otherwise, to any particular person. Immediately it was hinted by the Postmaster-General that he might prin t more stamps by the steel-engraving process, the honourable Parkes interjected, "" And break faith with somebody?""

101,Mr THOMAS,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"If the Postmaster General had not said that no person would be allowed to buy more than six stamps at a time, there is a firm in England-Messrs . Stanley, Gibbons, and Company-that would have bought up the whole issue.",20

Whether they were engaged in a profitable speculation or not member for has nothing to do with us.",20
103,Mr BRUCE SMITH,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,What is the honourable member's point?,20
104,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"That the Postmaster General ought to have had a policy when he started to prin t these stamps. I asked him at the beginning whether the stamps were to be printed from steel plates, or by the ordinary electrotype process, and he said that he intended to print from steel He could not have done better than get Mr Harrison to engrave the plates, - but he had no right to assume, as he did today, that these plates were not under his control, or, rather, that he How cannot get the stamps printed at the note To give an evasive answer to a question was not in like the honourable gentleman. If he has determined to prin t only 1,000,000 stamps by the steel-plate process, he has no more for the plates now that the stamps been issued, and, for the honour of the country, he should have them debecause f a it h should be kept with to the philatelists who have purchased the - stamps. Whatever difficulty may have has been due to his want of frank ness in stating that the issue was to consist of 1,000,000 only. When I questioned i m from time to time on the subject, sugyesgesting that there would be a loss by printing from steel plates amounting to about £3,000 a year, he did not give the slightest indication that he intended to prin t only 1,000,000 stamps by the steelengraving process. It was then that he ought to have been frank. Stamps have no special interest for me, except as I might like one or two to give to children, here but I think that the Postmaster-General has made a mistake. I know that he had no intention of getting any advantage for himself or his friends, hut there has been a lack of frankness, for which I am sorry.",20
105,Mr AGAE WYNNE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"BalaclavaPostmaster-General) [11.56] - I had, perhaps, better tell the House the history of these stamps - Some time ago designs were called for an Australian stamp to replace the stamps of the various States. The kangaroo design was chosen, but it was not the design that won the first prize. I thought that the design that had won the first prize was a better design, and when I came into office I inquired whether it could be used. The designer said that he did not think that any one in this country could engrave the steel plates needed to reproduce it, and that a good stamp could not be obtained in any other way. I ascertained, however, that the engraver of our bank notes is one of the most expert stamp engravers in the world. He engraved most of the stamps used by the British Government, and has engraved stamps for other countries as well. I saw him, and he said that he would be very pleased to cut a die and to engrave the necessary plates, but that the design needed modification to bring it within the compass of a stamp. modified the design accordingly, made a die, and engraved the plates. The finest stamps in the world are those that have been printed from steel-engraved plates. I thought that Australia should have a stamp which was as well engraved as the stamps of other leading nations, such as the United States of America. The engraver told me that, with a Hoe machine, he could produce 1,000,000 a week. I asked the Treasury Department to allow him to do this, but the Department objected, saying that the Commonwealth Stamp Printer was producing the stamps of the kangaroo design, using what is known as the electro process, and that there was not the necessary machinery for printing stamps by the steel-plate cess. After a great deal of trouble, however, the Treasurer let me have 1,000,000 stamps printed with a machine that is being used for the printing of bank notes. I made no bargain with any one-neithe r with the public nor the stamp dealers-as to the limitation of the issue to 1,000,000. penny stamp. All I stated was that the first 1,000,000 stamps issued would be steel-engraved. If - the Postal Department had the machinery - whic h it has not, the control of the printing of stamps being in the hands of the Treasury-w e should continue printing from the plates. The Treasury Department has purchased two more Hoe machines, but I am informed that they will be used all through the coming year for the printing of notes, because at pre-, sent the notes cannot be printed fast enough. There would be no difficulty in getting the stamps printed if we had the necessary maclunery. I propose to keep the die and the plates. There has been no bargain with philatelists or others to limit the issue to 1,000,000. The stamps were not issued by the Department for the purpose of making money. There was no premium charged. The man who bought a stamp, a philatelist, or any one else, got the value for his penny.. I was not keen to see any one making a corner in these stamps, and retailing them to stamp collectors. I understand there are exactly 1,000,000 stamp collectors in the world, so that if each got one of these first million, there would be just enough to go round. The Leader of the Opposition said recently that it would cost £5,000 or £6,000 to print these stamps by the steel-engraving He process. The actual extra cost of printing them is £420 per hundred million.",21
106,Mr FISHER,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,I said the stamps would cost that amount altogether. How many do you issue each year?,21
107,Mr AGAR WYNNE,SCHOOL TEACHERSINNE W,"About 550 million stamps of all classes. The issue of Jd. stamps is very close to that of the ld. stamp, probably in the proportion of three to five, but stamps of higher values are not used to any great extent. With an issue of 550 million stamps per annum, there would probably be 300 million penny stamps issued, costing the Commonwealth £1,260 per annum above the cost of the ordinary electro-printed stamps. I do not think the people of Australia will pro- grudge paying £1,260 a year to have a stamp that is a credit to the Commonwealth. Philatelists are good judges as to the quality and value of a stamp, and they give credit to any country that issues a good one. In the United States there are six different variations of red for the stamp that corresponds with our Any tinge of red is authorized by the Berne Convention. I would like to issue some of these penny stamps with' a crimson colour. I had a few printed in that colour; but, seeing that the Treasury would only allow us to have 1,000,000, I took the best I could get. If I had my own way we should have nothing b ut engraved stamps in circulation, and not what are known as utilit y stamps. I do not think the Department has done anything unfair, either to the philatelists or the public. I was aware would be a rush for the first issue of 1,000,000 stamps, and therefore I tried to keep them out of the hands of stamp dealers, and make a fair distribution to the public. That is why I issued the order that no person could buy more than six at a time.",21

The States are making investigations on the scientific and research side as well as on the practical side. most of that work can be better carried out in a Federal Department, but it would have been best to consult the States in order to induce them, if possible, to relinquish some of their important functions to the Federal Agricultura l Bureau. It is not possible for the Federal Department to undertake experiments on an extensive scale throughout Australia without the States co-operating with it by placing land at its disposal. . are hampered in that important direction. It has been stated that the Bureau of Agriculture in the United States has been carrying out very great functions. We know it has, because it has enormous powers of I administration. The reason is that in the, early days of Federation in the United States, after the first nine States federated, the whole of the public estate COURT. became the property of the Federal Parliament, with the exception of territory in Texas, which came in afterwards. In fact, in the whole of the States which afterwards came into the Union, no.w numbering nearly fifty, the public estate became absolutely the property of the Federal Government. The result was thab they instituted a Department of Agricul'ture, not only to carry out research work throughout the United States, but also to do important administrative work which is now carried out here by the States in connection with their inspection laws, by the Railway Department to a large extent in the construction of new railways, and by the Water Supply Departments i u the building of large dams.",24

I have travelled all over Australia as a member of the F r u it Commission, and the question of uniform We inspection is, I know, of vital importance. That is a function which constantly might be undertaken by the Bureau of Agriculture. There is also the question of the export of produce-, such as butter and f r u it , and other perishable products. These are matters that could be brought under uniform inspection and uniform laws.

152,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We are not justified in piling up. the expenses before every effort has been made to get the States to relinquish some of their functions. If the States point blank refuse to do so, it. will be the duty of this Parliament to exercise its constitutional functions in order to carry out work of an Australian character. The Government must enter into serious and close negotiations with the States in order to obtain for the bureau the power to regulate the export of produce, and create a uniform system of inspection. We also want the States to hand over, to a large exteut, to the Federal Parliament that valuable experimental and research work which is being carried out in every State Agricultural Department. Some of the finest experiments in regard to wheat growing have been carried out by the States in South Australia and Victoria. I believe that by co-ordinating the work, and having a uniform character of literature issued from the one Department for the whole of Australia, we can minimize the expenditure and do even better work. This is the proper Parliament to exercise research and experimental functions. We are piling up expenditure, and additional expenditure will be incurred by the creation of this Department. Duplication is going on in all directions. It occurs in the compilation of statistics, the making of land tax valuations, and in other matters where we should be able to avoid it. I say at once that we should pass this Bill, because the Federal Bureau of Agriculture can do much of the work to be allotted to it better than can any State Department. But it will be necessary for the Government to confer with is the States, with the object of inducing them to relinquish some of the more important functions which their Departments of Agriculture are now individually exercising, in order that unnecessary expenditure may be avoided, and the success of the bureau thoroughly assured. I hope that before the Bill is brought into operation the Government will do their best to induce the States to hand over to the.

Then, again, I would remind'the Committee df what happened in connection with our decision to inspect meat for export, because of the trouble that had arisen oversea with regard to the presence of nodules in beef. It was absolutely necessary that something should be done, and at our request Professor Gilruth undertook certain work, which could not have been done better even if this Bureau had been established.  gations were being made at the Institute of Tropical Diseases, in Townsville.",26
166,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The investigations are being continued by that Institute. I think we are all in favour of steps beingtaken to rid our beef of nodules. In order to get our beef into the British market, it is necessary to remove practically the entire brisket; and something like 70 lbs. of meat out of every carcasshas to be sent to the. digesters, where it isconverted into tallow. The State most vitally interested in this matter objected, them. to its inspectors acting for us, and the of Commonwealth had to appoint inspectorsexof its own. In all the other States the in work is being done by State officers, and M in - the Commonwealth is paying ""for their Kooservices. Unless the Government can arrange to avoid overlapping, I am afraid, enterthat this'bureau will prove'a""very'costly one.

171,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As - far back as 1907, the question of bitter p it first engaged my attention, but nothing was done by the - Commonwealth u n t i l I appointed Mr . .MCAlpine to investigate it , and the Pisher Government placed on the Estimates a sum of money for the purpose. The States unanimously asked that this rshould be done, and said in effect, "" We - will find £1,00 0 if you will find another .£1,000.""",27
172,Mr RODGERS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is evidence of co-operation.,27
173,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , and we hoped that rthe movement would be successful. This is one of the matters that would have - come within the purview of the Bureau Agriculture if a bureau had been in existence. Since Professor Gilruth went into the question of the worm nodules - certain investigations in connection with - diseases have been carried out at the stitution of Tropical Medicine at Townsservices - ville. By the way, the worm nodule is and Dr Sweet. more unsightly than harmful.",27
174,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It was the American 'Trust that spread the rumour harmful.,27
175,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so. The disease sary duplication. - of bitter pit is of extreme importance so far as orehardists are concerned. Bureau of Agriculture of the United ""States has spent about 500,000 dollars trying to find some remedy for this - ease, but they have been unsuccessful.",27
176,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Extensiv e experiments Tiave been made in Victoria regarding it .,27
177,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Wannon asked me whether any laboratory work is being done, and, in reply, I have to say that, at the Customs House, ""Melbourne, there is one of the finest laboratories in Australia, under the charge of Mr Wilkinson, who, as an analyst, can was hold his own anywhere. I do not believe in decrying Australians simply because they are Australians. We should Mr Rodgers - He has administrative duties as well.",27
178,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No . His work is purely that of the laboratory; and it would be well if honourable members, who are interested, visited this institution, which is one of the most up to date in the world. It has only recently been built, and advantage was taken of experience gained elsewhere. I take it that when the Bureau of Agriculture is instituted it will take over certain of the work now being done by the Commerce Branch, and also some of the work now being carried on at Townsville.",27
179,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We shall also avail ourselves of the results of the investigations carried on at the universities, whose trouble is lack of funds and officers.",27

184,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member not think that we ought to deal with the referenda proposals before we proceed further with this Bill?,27
185,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so, but I desire to pay a tribute to men who are not here today, but who had much to. do with - the original proposal to institute a Bureau of Agriculture. The question was first raised in June, 1901, about six weeks after the Federal Parliament met, by Sir John Quick, then the member for. Bendigo.",27
186,Mr GHOOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think the question was raised earlier than that by some candidates during the election campaign.,28
187,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am speaking of what has been done in this Parliament'. Sir John Quick pointed out that not only he, but the late Mr Groom, father of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and Mr . Deakin had advocated a bureau during the elections. In the House, Sir John Quick was followed by Mr Isaacs-wh o had taken a keen interest in the question- Mr Kennedy, Senator MCColl, and, I think, Mr Sydney Smith, who had been Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales.",28
188,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And by the Prime Minister.,28
189,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think that the present Prime Minister spoke on that occasion, though he did support the suggestion by way of interjection. Many honourable members at that time contemplated not merely a bureau, but a Department of Agriculture.",28
190,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is this bureau not a good mustard seed to begin with ?,28
191,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , but I am anxious that the money should not be wasted in duplication of effort. We know that there is no l i m it to the expenditure when scientific men begin research with the knowledge that the public purse is behind them. Of course, in many cases, the money is spent most effectively.",28
192,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is no l i m it to the good that can be done in this way.,28
193,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I grant that, but, at the same time, there is no limit , I shall not say to the waste, but to the expendiof ture. I think we are making a good start, but there sliould certainly be arrangement made with the States to pregrave vent duplication. Sir ROBE RT BEST (Kooyong) [12.54]. - The success or failure of this Bill w largely depend on the cordial co-operation of the Commonwealth and the States; and it would be deplorable if operation were absent. The vast possibut he would not say yes. bilities of a Bureau of Agriculture cannot be full y realized, even in a discussion such a mere beating of the air. as this. The Bureau of the United States is an object lesson which shows what can be done by concentrated research, particularly in regard to agriculture. There the expenditure is something like £3,750,000 per annum on scientific research work, and some of the reports issued are of the utmost value to the whole world.",28
194,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is said that the United States Bureau has increased the value of the corn crop by £1,000,000 a year.",28
195,Sir ROBERTBEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A great deal will depend on the way in which the Bill is administered. We have first to secure the services of the very best men, quite irrespective of cost.",28
196,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Is it not better that the institution, like Topsy, should grow ?",28
197,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think it is depresent sirable that the Bureau should grow gradually, but there ought to be at least two or three of the very best men engaged at once. In the Mother Country, where something like £500,000 per annum isspent in this connection, the principle adopted is to endow universities and entrust special work to selected professors. There has heen a marvellous metamorphosis, almost startling in its character, in regard to methods of agriculture. The rule of reason is supr planting the rule of thumb; and any country, such as our own, which looks forward to vast cereal exports must avail itself of the highest scientific knowledge of the day. My only reason for rising today, however, is to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo, who raised some doubts as to the constitutionality of the measure. With those doubts I personally do not agree-. Sitting suspended from. 1.0 to 2.30 p.m: Sir ROBE RT BEST - If the argumentsthe honourable member for Bendigo are' sound, we are wasting time in discussing some this measure, because he seems to have doubt as to the power of the Commonwealth to make appropriations for the purposes of an Agricultural Bureau. i ll I asked him whether, as a lawyer of experience, he would take the responsibility of stating the opinion that the Commonthat cowealth has no power todothis> Consequently. his expression of doubt was But we have the right to satisfy ourselves that what we are proposing to do is constitutional, and therefore I shall proceed to examine the honourable member's suggestion. He argues that the Commonwealth's powers of appropriation are shut down to the purposes set forth in section 51 of the Constitution. If that were so, we should be in a serious position so far as the State exigencies which from time to time arise are concerned. In support of his view the honourable member said that our Constitution is more limited in this respect than that of America. There are two replies to be made to him. The first is that I claim we have a general constitutional power of appropriation, altogether apart from the provisions of section 51; and the second that we have also an incidental power contained in that section. As to the general power of appropriation, section 81 provides thatA l l revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, lo be appropriated for the purposes of the CoTnmonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. My honourable friend may suggest that the words "" for the purposes of the Commonwealth "" are limited by the words "" in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution."" They are limited in this way to some extent: When it says that the revenues of the Commonwealth may be appropriated "" for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution,"" that, I think, means that our measures must be originated and appropriated in accordance, for instance, with such provisions as sections 53, 54, 55, 56, and 83, and that regard must be had to the charges imposed on the revenue, such charges, for instance, as the payments to the States under the Braddon provision. We have general powers of appropriation so long as the appropriation is made in accordance with the method provided by the Constitution and subject to its charges and liabilities. That view is supported by all the leading American authorities, and in this connection the American Constitution is practically the same as our own. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in a memorandum issued by him in reference to this measure, on behalf of the Government of which I was a member, drew attention to a well known passage in Story on The American ConstitutionAppropriations have never been limited by Congress to cases falling within the specific powers enumerated in the Constitution, whether those powers be construed in their broad or their narrow sense. If we assume for the purposes of the arg u m e n t that the tw o Constitutions are i d e n t i c a l, we have t h is u n q u a l if i e d statem e n t of undoubted a u t h o r it y on the subject. But there is a later a u t h o r it y . Will o u g h by , dealing with the power of Congress to a p p r o p r i at e moneys, saysA parity of reasoning would seem to provide the principle that, inasmuch as taxes must be for a public purpose, an appropriation of the proceeds of taxes should be for a public purpose . . . and, as regards the restriction that appropriations shall be in aid of enterprises which the Federal Government is empowered to undertake, the doctrine has become nn established one that Congress may appropriate money in aid of matters which the Federal Government is not constitutionally able to administer and regulate. No words could be stronger or more specific t h a n those. D e a l in g with a paper e n t it l e d Views of the President of the U n it e d States on the. subject of in t e r n a l improvements, s u b m it t e d . in connection with his veto by President M o n r o e , Will loughby says The constitutional grant to Congress of the power "" to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States"" he very correctly argues does not operate to vest in the general Government any additional powers of control, but solely to authorize that Government to raise revenues and to appropriate money lo the purposes specified. These purposes, however, he maintains, are broad enough to enable Congress to appropriate money in aid of enterprises which the general Government cannot undertake or directly control. The two authorities I have quoted establish beyond doubt the general power of appropriation for which I am contending. The ho'norable member for Bendigo endeavours to meet this argument by con- tending that the powers of the American. Constitution are wider than those of our Constitution. I differ from him. The American Constitution may be somewhat wider in respect of eminent domain, but, broadly and generally, our Constitution is, if anything, the wider. The eighth clause of the American Constitution empowers Congressto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States. That is a limited power of taxation; but our Constitution contains no such limitations. Section 51 provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . . Taxation; but so as. not to discriminate between States or parts of States. We have an unqualified power of taxation so long as we do not discriminate, but the power of Congress is limited by the words thab I have read. The honourable member for Bendigo suggested, as honourable members understoodthough, I am sure, he did not mean it literally-that the Constitution of the United States of America specifically provided the power of appropriating for the general welfare. I say that there is no such provision in the Constitution of the United States of America.",28
198,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Do you not there is a limitation to those words, ""general welfare of the .community "" ?",30
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is; but by our Constitution we are not limited by words of the kind. We have complete power in that connection, whereas the words in the Constitution of the United States of America imply a limitation. But the point I was tryin g to make was that, in order to get over the fact that there is already i u existence in the United States of America a vast Bureau of Agriculture, and in order to get over the authorities to which I have referred, and the fact that, for exigencies of State, it is a most common and ordinary thing for the Congress to appropriate for agricultural and otlier, what we might call outside, purposes, t.he honourable member for Bendigo said that the Constitution of the United States of America was wider than ours, and provided that appropriation might be made for the general welfare of the community. There is no such specific term in the Constitution of the United States of America. general welfare provision is only included, in the power of taxation, the power to appropriate for the general welfare necessarily being a corollary. However, there is a limitation in the Constitution of the United States of America. Of the two Constitutions ours is the wider in this regard. I think I have made it clear that, first of all , under our Constitution, we have a general power of appropriation. My next argument is that we have also the incidental power which is also in the Constitution of the United States of America. It will be observed that a number of powers are mentioned under section 51 of our Constitution. Sub-section XXXIX . of section 51 deals with matters incidental. The provision reads- The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(xxxix.) Matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament, or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any department or officer of the Commonwealth. We have, therefore, full and complete in cidental powers to deal with all the subjects set out in section 51-trad e and comthink merce with other countries and among the States, quarantine matters, and so forth . The Minister of Trade and Customs, in the memorandum to which I have referred, very succinctly set down our present constitutional powers contained in section 51, in regard to which we have all the incidental powers of jurisdiction and legislation, and on page 7 of that memorandum the powers of the Commonwealth, with regard to the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, are capably summarized as follows:-- . Moreover, the power to organize such a Department is incidental to the grant of the various specific powers under the Constitution. Under section 51, sub-section (i.), Parliament under its powers of trade and commerce may appoint officers to inspect both imports and exports of agricultural products and stock. Under subsection (iii.), Parliament may grant bounties on the production or export of goods, and accordingly may appoint expert officers to give advice as to the growth and production of various agricultural and pastoral products. In pursuance of the power to deal with Quarantine (sub-section ix.), expert officers must of necessity be apThe pointed. Under its Navigation law, the Commonwealth - may make provision for the regulation of the carriage of stock, and may also.deal with other matters of a similar nature. The power to deal with meteorology includes the power to furnish special reports for the use of those engaged in the primary industries (sub-section v i i i . ) ; and under.the Post and Telegraph and Telephone Services (sub-section v.) the means of distributing this information are under the control of Parliament. Moreover, in the power to deal with mail contracts the Commonwealth may make provision for such matters as cold storage. The officers appointed to the Statistical Department (sub-section xi.) may collect information dealing with production and land settlement; and under sub-section (xxvii.) the power to deal with immigration implies the power to collect and furnish all such information of the industries of Australia as may be of assistance to induce immigrants to come to Australia. The power to deal with External Affairs (sub-section xxix.) enables the Commonwealth to appoint agents abroad who may act on behalf of the primary producers of the Commonwealth. Moreover, in connection with the power to deal with Customs and Excise, necessary officers may be appointed to furnish such advice and information as may be required. Finally, the Commonwealth has complete power to legislate for territories under its control. Possessed of all these different powers, the Commonwealth may organize the members of the Public Service into a department and utilize their services on behalf of those engaged in the primary industries of Australia. I agree with that summar y of our in c i d e n t a l powers, and I in v it e honourable members to closely examine the Bill , and they will find it does no more than cover these. Even adopting the argument of the honourable member for Bendigo, that we are confined to the powers within section 51, the enumerated incidental powers, to which I have referred make it quite clear that the proposed functions to be delegated to the Bureau of Agriculture are all incidental powers to the enumerated given to the Commonwealth by section 51. I hope I have made it clear to honourable members that there are two answers to the contention of the honourable member for Bendigo. Firstly, our general power of appropriation; secondly, under section 51, the incidental powers to the enumerated powers set forth under that section.",30
200,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Kennedy) [2.52]. - The honourable member has given us a long address as to our constitutional powers and rights. I do not think it is the first time. I have heard the honourable member on these questions. So far as I am able to understand it , the honourable member's contention is that, in regard to section 81, which gives general powers of appropriation, all we have to do is to pass a Bill for some particular matter, and then we are empowered to appropriate the necessary sum of money to cover the expenditure entailed by the measure.",31
201,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How did you justify the maternity appropriation?,31
202,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I shall come to that later. I understand the contention of the honourable member for Kooyong to be this:' that if we pass a Bill for a certain purpose, we are entitled to appropriate moneys to carry out that purpose. That is to say, we have full powers of appropriation. If the contention of the honourable member is correct, then there was no need for the late Government to bring down their referenda proposals, because all that was sought to be done under tlieir Bills could have been done without any amendment of the Constitution, and we could have made the necessary appropriation to carry them out. As for the maternity bonus, it is recognised that we had the power to give away the £ 5 for a specific purpose; but the weakness of the matter was that we had no power to deal with the details of it . I did not hear what the honourable member for Bendigo said, but, as he is most cautious in giving opinions, I have no doubt that he had good reasons for what he said, and that what he said was right.",31
203,Mr AHERN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He did not express any opinion on the matter.,31
204,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I can understand his taking up that attitude towards powers such a subtle matter, but the honourable member for Kooyong left the impression that he had stated clearly that the Bill before us was unconstitutional. However, I did not rise to deal with that question. Honourable members opposite profess to be very anxious to have this Bill passed; more particularly the honourable member for Wimmera; yet when the honourable member rose to speak, the first words he uttered were to regret that the Government had not consulted the States, and later on he regretted that the States had not been taken into the confidence of the Government. He also mentioned a number of things upon which the States should have been consulted. If one-tenth of what the honourable member for W i mmera said is correct, the Bill should not pass; but I am not prepared to go as far as the honourable member. I think such a Bill as this should be of considerable value to the people of the Commonwealth. In a country like Australia we cannot have too much research. Another "" farmer's representative,"" the honourable member for Kooyong, said that the agricultural industry was probably of more importance than any other; but there are other industries which seemed to be brushed aside by farmers' representstives-bi g industries which the Bill will benefit very materially, and which are just as important as agriculture. I refer particularly to the cattle and sheep industries. work is necessary for those industries. While I admit that agriculture is of very great importance, the cattle and sheep business is also important, if not in one sense, more important.",31
205,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The output for 1911 for agriculture was worth £38,700,000, and for the pastoral industry, £50,725,000.",32
206,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Thos e figures show the importance of the pastoral industry. A good deal of research work is required in connection with' cattle, notably as to tick and other diseases, while the sheep fly, and other troubles that affect sheep should be inquired into. Coming down to bedrock, agriculture is the most important because the cities could not exist without it . I regret that the honourable member for Wimmera did not allow this Bill to pass this morning. It should have been through by now, if honourable members had really desired to pass it . It - has merely been thrown on the table of the House with a sort of intimation to honourable members that they can have a good time with it . If that is the idea that the Government have of dealing with this very important measure, it is a very wrong one. The way the Department of Agriculture in the United States is carried on sets au example to the world. I have seen a number of the specimen copies and little packets of ^eeds that they send out to Australia. All they require from whoever gets a packet is a little note to say how he succeeded in the production of the plants. They keep, I understand, an accurate record of results. To show how important this Department of Research is, or what is thought of it in other countries, I may mention that when travelling, I met a doctor who had been out in Australia for some considerable time. While here, he collected no less than 23,000 different specimens of Australian insects-bugs , as the Americans call them - for scientific purposes. We have done nothing of that kind in Australia. Many other countries have better collections of Australian specimens of this kind than we have ourselves. All these things will have a very material effect upon future developments in relation to pests. In the circumstances, this Department, if properly carried on, can be of great benefit throughout Australia, but . 1 deprecate very much this attempt to belittle what is Research being done on many of our agricultural farms and colleges. They are doing splendid work, and I should regret it very much if this Bill were to interfere with them to any extent. I "" do not know whether the different institutions are going to be allowed to overlap. If so, it will not be a good thing. There may be some matter that affects the whole of the States, and, in such circumstances, it would probably be best to have it investigated by the Federal authorities. There are conditions in Queensland, particularly North Queensland, that are totally different from those in other parts of Australia. That work would be better done locally than we could ever hope to do it in Melbourne, or at the Federal Capital. It is only of late years that the fly among sheep in Queensland has become so bad. A few years ago it was never heard of. ",32
207,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; but it was never known before in Queensland. It is not so bad in North Queensland as it is in the southern part of that State or in New South Wales and Victoria. We know the damage the tick pest caused a few years ago, and now we are led to believe that, after all , it is not the tick, but a parasite on the tick, that caused all the red water and other trouble which led to the loss of so many cattle in the northern part of Queensland at that time. These are things that can be in quired into. It was known for years before we had any real disease that the tick existed in the Northern Territory. Look at the amount of money spent in Queensland on the tick business. I think Mr . Pound is still retained there in connection with that and other matters.",32
208,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He is one of the best trained experts in Australia.,32
209,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He is one of the best. To show the amount of money spent in relation to tick, a Commissioner was sent to Texas and other parts of America and to A f r i ca in order to try to find a remedy. It might be Letter for the Commonwealth to undertake all that sort of work, which should be done on the spot if possible. Another subject for investigation is the grub which appears in the cane in Queensland. I do not think it has been found even in the northern portion of New South Wales, and certainly not to any great extent in the southern part of Queensland. The bureau can do good work, especially where specific conditions require special inquiry. That work can be better done on the spot than from any central office. I hope, whatever is done in relation to the Bureau of Agriculture, that it will not be confined merely to experiments in the central office, because, if it is, it will of very little use. No doubt a kind of museum of specimens will be kept in the central office.",32
210,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,On e idea may be to train experts to make investigations in certain industries. The greatest difficulty is being experienced in England at present to get trained experts.,33
211,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the difficulty we are going to experience here, not merely because the trained expert cannot be obtained for one particular branch, but owing to the fact that the Australian climate varies from the tropic down to the temperate zone. AH these climatic aud geological variations have a tendency to affect stock or plant life in dilTerent ways. We must bo very careful in the circumstances; but the Bill will involve the expenditure of a large sum of money.",33
212,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The following appeared \n the recent report on the English Development Act of 1909:-""The number of men really qualified to conduct agricultural research in this country is at present exceedingly small, and obviously cannot be increased at a moment's notice."" That is the difficulty that stands in the way.",33
213,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is doubly in Australia. I should like to congratufarmers late the honourable member for Wimmera upon his latest achievement in turning Unificationist. The whole tenor of remarks today was to the effect that Government deserved severe censure for of Agriculture. not having consulted the States in all' these matters, and that the whole busition ness should be a matter of co-operation between the Statfea and the CommonWe wealtli. I thought that was one of strongest arguments that in favour of Unification. I trust that, when the honourable member goes amongst his intelligent electors, he will not his speech this morning.",33
214,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I will not have any hesitation in expressing the same opinions to them.,33
215,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am glad the honourable member has stated clearly and distinctly that he is a Unificationist.,33
216,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am uot bound to accept the honourable member's interpretation of my remarks.,33
217,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When the honorbe able member reads his speech tomorrow, he will very much regret that lie ever made it, because that is undoubtedly the only interpretation that could be put on it. The Bill is a good and wise one, and when it is put into force I trust that the Government of the day will not stint the expenditure of money required for experts. We cannot have too many of them, and we should get the best we possibly can. If we are not prepared to do that, we should not go on with the Bill. I am sure that we shall always be prepared to pay a decent remuneration to those who are likely to serve the Commonwealth in this direction.",33
218,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Capricornia) [3.15] One would naturally expect that an Administration which from many public platforms has declared that it intends to restore responsible government and to institute a regime of sober finance would be prepared to put before us some facts as to the probable cost of the Bureau of Agriculture which they propose to establish. We find, however, that they are not ready to do so. Can the Minister of Trade and Customs, by way of interjection, tell us now, within £50,000, what expenditure the passing of this Bill will involve? The honourable gentleman remains silent. . I so suppose tJiat, since he has a number of in his electorate, he thinks it - will be useful for him to be able to say his that he was instrumental in the passing the of a Bill to provide for a National Bureau Before long, however, the farming, as well as every other secof the community, will pay greater attention to the question of high finance. are too ready to spend millions of the money without due regard to the taxcould be used payers' interest.",33
219,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Publi c money could regret not be spent on anything better .than a National Bureau of Agriculture.,33
220,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Everythin g depends on whether or not the services to be supplied by the bureau are already being given to the people by State Departments. When I asked the Minister whether State services would not be duplicated he answered that my question was based upon inaccurate information. He has told us that we shall want only three or four experts; but, if I may adopt the language of the Prime Minister, I think there has been too much shuffling on his part. A paper which he presented to the House shows that, the cost of the United States Bureau of Agriculture in 1905-6 was £1,435,198.",34
221,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It has grown more than threefold since then.,34
222,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is most inspiring to read of the achievements of United States statesmen in various Departments, but we are entitled to have something like reasonable information as to the expenditure to which we shall commit the country if we pass this measure. The Bill having become law, the Government may appoint a scientist to organize the bureau, and, no doubt, he will not have very much regard to the question of cost. Most scientists are so wrapped up in their work that money with them is quite a secondary consideration. On the other hand, the Government may obtain the services of a man who is not so much a scientist as a financial expert, and the Prime Minister may tell him that all that is necessary at present is to appoint a couple of experts - on e to deal with the prickly pear pest, and the other with bitter pit. But the bureau, having once been established, it will not be long before numerous appointments are made, and we shall find ourselves face to face with an expenditure of probably £100,000 per annum in connection with it. In reply to the Minister's statement that I was wrong in asserting that the Federal Bureau would duplicate work now beiug carried out by the State Departments, I would point out that in an official memorandum issued by him we have the statementThe work of Agricultural Departments be divided broadly into three parts - [a) tive; (b) research; (<-) educational The series of lectures undertaken by the might be supplemented by addresses by the perts of the Commonwealth. What does that mean? The Minister of Trade and Customs tells us in this memoword randum, which was issued by him in May,. 1908, that the lectures which are being delivered by the State experts are to be supplemented by Commonwealth lectures. In other words, the frui t experts who give lectures in Queensland are to have their efforts supplemented by a Commonwealth expert; the State expert who is telling people how to grow cotton in Queensland is to have his efforts supplemented by a Federal cotton expert, and so on.",34
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have just read that there have been general rains in Queensland.,34
224,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is very satisfactory; but it does not absolve me from my responsibility as a member of this House. If the Prime Minister will agree to proceed at once with the motion relating to old-age pensions I will sit down.,34
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A rainfall of 3 inches.,34
226,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Wit h characteristic obstinacy, the Prime Minister insists upon having his own way. I think it necessary to point out that he is proposingunder this Bill to override the States, and really to bring about the unification of various governmental powers in Australia. In his official memorandum, the Minister of Trade and Customs refers to the desirableness of establishing experimental stations. I read only the other day a comprehensive account of the various experimental farms in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. The Minister of Trade and Customs has told us that he is going to have four experts attached to the bureau.",34
227,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I never said I was going to have four experts.,34
228,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable gentleman's memory is at fault. He tells usin his report that the direct control of the experimental stations already existing must be retained by the States, but that the Federal officers can co-operate"" with the officersin charge of experimental stations in order to carry out any further or special experiments that, from a national may stand-point, may be necessary. He goes, regulaon to say that the "" co-ordination of States work and the prevention of unnecessaryexduplication might also be effected'."" "" Coordination of work "" is a very fine phrase; it is nearly as good as that '' blessed Mesopotamia."" It seems to be alinc-3b admitted that there will be dupli-catioa. The report proceedsShould special stations be required for-national ,purposes, especially in connection with the growth of tropical products, the matter should easily be arranged with the States. In the Territories of the Commonwealth there must necessarily be .national experimental stations. - Can we understand why the Government, who have these ideas about the necessity for a Bureau of Agriculture, should be so neglectful of their duties as to refrain from consulting the States? This bureau, also, is to undertake the work of finding markets for Australian products, a work which from its very nature is national The Minister must have forgotten what was written in 1908, when he tells us now that this is to be a national bureau merely for research work-to discover the causes - of tick fever, and a remedy for the prickly pear and bitter pit. However, I shall defer any further remarks on this point reach a later clause. I wish again to proclaim my objection to any undertaking of this kind without first consulting all the States. Why should we be out of harmony with the States ? There 'has been too much discord between the Federation and the various States; and for this we are largely responsible. Honourable members seem to forget that a State like New South Wales or Queensland comprises a territory larger than that of some of the European States; indeed, I believe that New South Wales is larger than Germany. Yet, because in New South Wales there are only 1,250,000 people, and in Queensland about 600,000, there seems to be an idea that those States are not worthy of our consideration. Tliese States are too big and important to have their interests overlooked by this Parliament; and we have to be very careful in our relations with them We ought, not to reflect on any State member of Parliament, or suggest that he is in any way less capable than we curselves. To introduce a measure of this kind, without consulting the States, must surely create discord; but it is not yet too late for the Minister to retrace his steps. We ought, as I say, to have some idea what the bureau is going to cost. During this financial year we shall spend £27,000,000. The Minister of Trade and Customs, and also I myself, when on the platform - in Queensland Federation, said that the Union would not mean more additional cost to the people than half-a-crown per head-the amount necessary to register a dog. It was a great argument, and had effect; and now it is proposed to add for this bureau from £300,000 to £500,000 to the £27,000,000.",34
229,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That half-crown did not include the cost of defence, the postal services, and so on.",35
230,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"This is not the occasion to go into the details of the expenditure that has been superimposed. I think I have sufficiently exposed the wrongful conduct of the Prime Minister and his satellite, the Minister of Trade and Customs; and, having entered my protest, I can do no more. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 (Functions of Bureau).",35
231,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Capricornia) [3.39] - The until we conduct of the Minister of Trade and Customs reminds me of a man I once saw on a show ground in Queensland, who, after apparently dropping three sovereigns into a purse, offered to sell the purse and its contents for £ 1 . When, however, the unfortunate purchaser examined the purse in a quiet spot, he found that it contained only three coppers. The little lecturette which the vendor gave was pure bluff, and so I regard the observations of the Minister on this Bill . Honourable members may look in the Prime Minister's dictionary for a definition of "" b l u f f . "" The Prime Minister, who, apparently, has not given due consideration to the measure, has told us that we shall require four experts for this bureau, men of the highest and best brains, to conduct the research work. I have pointed out that the States are spending well on to £500,000 per annum on their Departments of A g r i - culture; and now the Unificationist Prime Minister introduces a proposal for a bureau for the acquisition and diffusion amongst the people of the Commonwealth of information connected with agriculture, dairying, horticulture, viticulture, live-stock breeding, and forestry. The Minister of Trade and Customs has been trying to make the House believe that this is a measure of no consequence, except to establish the nucleus of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture. What can we think of a Minister who can do such a thing? Honourable members from the country, even if they are Liberals, advocating must have some sense of proportion. This bureau is to consist of three or four experts; and yet it has to acquire information for dairy farmers, pastoralists, stock-owners, vignerons, and so forth .",35
232,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the difference between a pastoralist and a stock-owner?,36
233,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a difference, I think, because, while a stock-owner may only have a few head of cattle, a pastoralist is understood to be a squatter king, who has vast flocks and herds, and who, of course, is looked on with great respect by people who have their bump of reverence very largely developed. I dare say there are some people who rather look down on the little stockowner. And this reminds one of what was said by Walter Besant, when he told us how the poor match-seller, who sold by the box, was despised by society people, but how the man who sold matches by the million was a person of high position, able, I suppose, to acquire a title if he only paid sufficient into the funds of the dominant political party. What does the Attorney-General think of the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs in in troducing this measure ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I did not hear it , but I think very highly of it .",36
234,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On general principles, I suppose ? I am afraid, however, that the Attorney-General has too much respect for his own reputation to lay down such general principles before a Judge of High Court. The Minister proposes to establish a bureau to deal with agriculState ture, horticulture, viticulture, live and forestry, although he knows that these things are being dealt with by the State Departments, and that what he in proposes is a mere duplication, without due regard for the finances of the monwealth. Y e the is .a member of Government which was going to establish a sober financial rkgime!. I wish the 900,000 Liberal supporters understood this proposal.

236,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; even though there might be duplication. The Minister says that there will be no duplication. Has he then forgotten the work that is being done in the States? Has he forgotten Gatton College, the Kamarunga Nursery, and the education respecting cotton, tobacco, f r u it , and cane-growing, the management of stock, and a host of other matters which is given by the Queensland Agricultural Department? Is it no t monstrous that the Ministry should use its majority to force through this Bill at the end of the session, to the exclusion of measures of more immediate i m portance ?",36
237,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is private business on the paper.,36
238,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes . There is the motion of my honourable friend regarding the rights of citizenship- a very necessary thing for the development of civilization - to show that we are willing to regard the foreigner while he is here as a citizen.,36

Is Liberalism going to raise the people from poverty bywasting money in the duplication of serthe vices, and employing Commonwealth officials to do what is being well done byofficials? What has the Minister stock, to say against the work that has been all done in Queensland ? He represents the Darling Downs, one. of the finest districts the world. The only f a u l t I find with the district is that it returns him to ParComliament. I would have no objection to a the proposal if the Government intended to confer with the Governments of the States, to ascertain what branches of this work they are willing to hand over to the Commonwealth as being better undertaken by the Commonwealth than by the States,",36

244,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . The Liberal party has never got over the surprise of"" finding itself in possession of the Treasurybench. Ministers hurriedly prepared a so-called policy, of which the Bill forms part. The measure is being forced through at the expense of the old-age pensioners. I never knew a more heartless person than is the Minister in his present mind. The bureau is to be established for the collection, propagation, and distribution of new and valuable seeds and plants. One would think that this was not being done, by the States, and had never been done before. As a matter of fact, it is being done by all the States. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Ver y little being done by Tasmania.",36
245,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Because there are a lot of antediluvian legislators there, who are in power because of the land monopoly there. The Agricultural Bureaux of the States are costing thousands of pounds, and the Minister proposes to duplicate the work and the expense. He wants to establish a Commonwealth Bureau forThe carrying out of experiments and investigations ; The investigation of pests or diseases affecting plants or live stock, and the means for preventing their spread or effecting their eradication. It would be well if we could have an investigation of the mental twists of the members of the Liberal party. bureau is also to undertakeThe publication of reports of the experiments of experimental farms; The publication of reports and bulletins dealing with any matter of importance in regard to production in Australia; and Such other functions as are prescribed. Does the Minister say that there will he no duplication? He makes no reply, because his attitude is the same as when questioned about his mistake concerning the Sugar Excise. Certainly it is difficult to understand the attitude towards the Bill of men of the world like the honourable member for Riverina, and some of the Victorian representatives. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 6 agreed to. Title agreed' to. Bill reported without amendment;' report adopted. Standing Orders suspended. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",37
246,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Robertson) [3.54] I should not have risen had it not been for some remarks which fell from the honourable member for Capricornia. I understood him to say that the money which will be needed for the proposed Agricultural Bureau should be expended on old age pensions.' I rise to point out that if we do not make money, we cannot distribute it. The Bill is calculated to help to increase production, and thus to make more money available for old-age pensioners. The time is arriving when we shall have to seriously consider our financial position. We cannot go on distributing money as we are doing if we do not increase our production. The proposed is bureau is eminently calculated to assist in the increase of production. Five years, ago the exports of Australia exceeded the imports by oyer £25,000,000, but last year the excess was only a little under £817,000. We cannot allow this diminution of exports to continue, especially in view of the fact that we have to pay nearly £12,000,000 a year in interest. Should our exports continue to diminish, we shall land ourselves in grave financial difficulties, and when an honourable member wishes to divert money from the producing interests, it is time that a protest was raised. Surely, we all are in favour of maintaining our present standard of The living, but to do that we must increase our production. According to the New South Wales Government Statistician, the railways of the State, which are its biggest earning Department, return only 4£ per cent., and the State Treasurer recently borrowed £2,000,000 at a little over 4J per cent., the actual cost to the State being £ 5 2s. 6d. per cent., the highest rate of interest paid for forty years. It is impossible to maintain the present high standard of living when we are borrowing money at a rate of interest which even our most productive lines will not return; and when so much money is being diverted to lines which are nonproductive the danger is increased.",37
247,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then why go in for a borrowing policy ?,37
248,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We must borrow if we are to develop the Commonwealth as it should be developed. Surely we have sufficient belief in Australia to continue upon a policy of development. I have no fear of pursuing a borrowing policy. So long as the money is properly spent upon reproductive works, it will be with satisfaction to ourselves and those who come after us.",37
249,Mr SHARPE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then why do you complain about the New South Wales Government ?,38
250,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"N e w South Wales has been borrowing at an exorbitant rate - of interest, mainly because the financiers - of the world do not hold the Government of that State in sufficient esteem to lend them money at a reasonable rate. that is not the point. I have said that our most productive spheres for the expenditure of public moneys are railways, but, in New South Wales, these are not returning more than 4£ per cent.; and, seeing that a great proportion of the money we have borrowed is spent upon nonmember which I desire to correct. productive lines, those that are productive must be called upon to pay 9 per cent. The honourable member for Capricornia now tells us that he wishes to divert money from a productive source and spend it upon things that are non-proshould ductive; but I would point out thab, less we go on spending our money on works which are - productive, and so i creasing the produce of the Commonpast, wealth, it will be impossible to keep our old-age pensions, our defence syswealth tem, and our high standard of living. It is time honourable members opposite here. looked the financial position squarely in the face. It is beyond all reason think that we can go on borrowing money, and put it into non-productive channels, at the same time maintaining our high standard of living. honourable member for Capricornia wishes to endanger the defence system, old-age pensions, and our present high standard of living, he is going the right way about it. It is high time some of us went the platforms of the country and pointed out exactly where this sort of expenditure is going to lead us.",38
251,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A r e you in favour of States being consulted before we estabhave lish this bureau ?,38
252,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There would cerwhich, tainly be no harm in asking the States to co-operate with us, but I believe that the interests of the Commonwealth are paramount over those of the States. am not ashamed to state my view upon - this matter, and even if I am called Unificationist it does not h u r t me, cause I believe, as all true Australians must believe, that the interests of the Commonwealth are paramount over the interests of the States. However, let me say, in conclusion, that if honourable members urge the Government to divert money from productive works, and use it in non-productive channels, there will be grave danger to things they support, or pretend to support, and that ib is absolutely impossible to carry on at the preBut sent rate if they wish to maintain the present high standard of living.",38
253,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hunter) [ 4 . 7 ] - I would not have spoken had it not been for one statement made by the honourable I quite favour the establishment of this bureau; but, at the same time, I agree with the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Capricornia that, before this measure is put into operation, there be some understanding with the undifferent States. We all realise that the States have pursued this matter of agrin - cultural research for a number of years and it would not be wise to have a up clashing of interests. Both the Commonand State Parliaments have cert a in provinces to which they can adThe States have already directed their attention to certain lines of reto search, and we should not do anything to clash with their work. In this way we can minimize expenditure. But if we are to maintain a Federal Department doing If the work already attaching to the State Departments, there will be a duplication of expense which the taxpayers, whether they be State taxpayers or Federal taxpayers, must bear. Duplication of effort upon should be unnecessary. The honourable member for Robertson made it appear that by going on as we are the old-age pensions and the defence system are likely to be endangered. He pointed out the that the Government of New South Wales borrowed money for what he termed unproductive works, and he said that they had.borrowed £2,000,000 at 4J per cent., after paying all expenses of brokerage, and so on, really meant £5 2s. fid. per £ 1 0 0 ; but the statement of the I honourable member that the high rate of interest was due to the financial world not a having a sufficiently high opinion of the bepresent New South Wales Government is absolutely without foundation, because the rate of interest has gone up everywhere. The Treasurer of New South Wales was able to make a statement recently, in which he showed that he was able to borrow money cheaper than the Treasurers of other States where there were Liberal Governments in power. The honourable member's statement that the Government of New South Wales had increased the cost of the railway system by having to pay a higher rate of interest is absolutely without foundation. If the railways in New South Wales return 4J per cent, over working expenses, and more than that has to be paid in the shape of interest on the money borrowed, the honourable member has only two courses to advocate-eithe r to cease the work of building railways to develop the country, or to cease borrowing. But, as the honourable member is in favour of borrowing money, he must pay a high rate of interest, because he could not get it at any cheaper rate than the New South Wales Government are now paying. So there is no room for complaint upon the part of the honourable member. I agree with him that it would be better to have increased exports; but the Bill before us has no bearing on the matter of exports, except that it makes provision for dealing with pests, and i m proving seed, and other matters affecting agricultural pursuits.",38
254,Mr ATKINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That means increasingworking expenses. the exports.,39
255,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In that way the Bill will be a benefit, and for that reason [4.14] - The we approve of it ; but to bring in the matter of New South Wales borrowing money, and to endeavour to make the people believe that we are paying more interest because of a Labour Government being in power in New South Wales, is all beside the question. As a matter of fact, the Government of New South money. Wales are getting their money on better conditions than any other State. I am accord with the Bill ; but I hope that Government of the day will consult w the different States before putting.it into operation, in order to ascertain what ls being done in certain directions, and thus avoid clashing. We ought to undertake work that is not taken in hand by different States^work that will be of vantage to Australia. In this way we may, at the close of the session, do something which will meet with the approval of the people generally. The Government will be ill-advised in carrying out work now undertaken hy experts in the States, thereby increasing the expenditure and quite unnecessarily duplicating the number of people engaged in this work. According to the Commonwealth official statistics issued by Mr Knibbs, the 'number of sheep in 1911 was 93,000,000. Though the number in 1912 fell to 83,000,000, we still maintained the same export; we practically maintained the number of sheep exported, though we had a reduction of no less than 10,000,000 sheep during the year. I merely rose to answer the honourable member. Railway construction is beneficial. The.people in the country desire that we should develop it, and in that way bring population; and we cannot carry out railway construction unless the money is borrowed on the best terms available on the money market at the time; the rates upon the railways being fixed in order to get sufficient return to recoup the cost of borrowing and the working of the lines. To that extent the Government of New South Wales have been very successful. I understand that the average rate of interest is not much over £ 3 15s. per £ 1 0 0 , while, according to the honourable member himself, the railways return 4J per cent, over Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) honourable member for Robertson must know that rates of interest are not governed by New South Wales or Australia. A man may sometimes be so saturated with prejudice that he may say something that is dangerous to the well-being of the country. The rates of interest all the world over depend on the acuteness of the demand for At present there is a demand everywhere for money. Those countries in which were at war have come into the the market, and they are now in New York i th trying to borrow, and they are willing to pay 6 per cent, or 7 per cent. Brazil wants $60,000,000, the Argentine is in the market, Canada is also still in the market tryin g to borrow for the extension of the the grand trunk railway to the north adof the Dominion. The result is that these countries are paying 5 per cent. In fact,. the other day Japan was paying 6 per cent, in New York, and China pays 64 per cent. I have just picked up a copy of the Nev> York American, in which I find the following in regard to the money rates governing the national exchange of the worldTime-money rates yesterday remained unchanged, although more trades were made and more money was offered. With the passing of the week following the first of the month disbursements, and with the return of deposits, better conditions are expected to prevail. Kates : Sixty and ninety days and four months, 5 per cent.; five and six months, 4J-5 per cent. Call loans were made at 4 per cent., with . } i per cent, the low figure. That refers to cash that you can get your hands on every day in Wall-street, New York, Lombard-street, London, the Unter den Linden, in Berlin, and the Bourse, in Paris; ""and yet my honourable friends come here and talk about the borrowing of the New South Wales Government. There never was such a demand for credit in the whole world, on account of the wonderful development in all countries. I hope my honourable friends will not decry their States. I want to keep up the interests of our States. Little Tasmania can borrow money, but, of course, she has to pay for it .",39
256,Mr BENNETT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Gippsland) [4.16] I can assure the honourable member for Darwin that we are not decrying our States. It is not the intention of the Government to give effect to this measure without first consulting the States. This is a very important matter. If we did not want it passed it would not be on the business-paper. We are not in the habit of putting up placards for the people. We are in the habit of submitting legislation to this House in order to have it passed. The honourable member for H u nter had placed in his hands by the Leader of the Opposition a little booklet, marked at a particular page. That was right enough. I have no objection to the use of statistics in tihis matter, but they should be used in a logical way. understand that the interpretation placed upon the decrease in sheep was that it was caused by the drought and other things. The decrease was not due solely to the drought. It was due to the phenomenal export of Iambs for that particular year. Every one knows that, when you over-export your lambs you naturally reduce the number of sheep in the Commonwealth. That is borne o u t in the next column of the same pagepage 31-wit h regard to the production of wool. While the actual number of sheep in the Commonwealth had decreased by 10,000,000, the actual decrease in the wool export was £33,000,000, or only £ 3 per sheep. It must, therefore, be evident that the greater cause of the de»crease of the number of sheep is the export of Iambs, which were never shorn at all. Statistics show that the value of lamb aud mutton exported increased in that particular year.",40

I took the view that the Bill was too good to be set aside, and against the wishes of the majority of my own party, I took the platform in favour of its acceptance. own State, by the aid of the gold-fields, and especially of the north, we were able to carry the affirmative. The States as a whole carried the Bill in the affirmative, and the affirmative vote, in the main, was given because the Bii', contained a provision enabling the people to amend, the Constitution as they thought f it from time to time. That provision has been put into effect three or four times. occasion it was used for merely a nominal amendment of the Constitution, which was approved of. Ou the second occasion the proposal was for the acceptance of the Fusion's Financial Agreement, which was defeated. It was put into operation for the third time ID 1911, wheu the Labour Government appealed to the people to give the Commonwealth Parliament larger powers to make laws with respect to trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matBILLS. ters, railway disputes, trusts, and the nationalization of monopolies. The six proposals were embodied in two measures, and only two questions had therefore to or be answered by the people. The voting on that occasion was as follows:-Consti tution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill 1910: For, 483,356; against, 742,704; or 39.42 per cent, for the Bill , and 60.5R per cent, against it . Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill 1910: For, 488,668 against, 736,392, or 39.89 per cent, for, and 60.11 against. It will be seen that, on that occasion, there was an enormous majority against both of these proposals. Believing, however, that they were in the best interests of the people,, the Government decided in 1912 that they should again be submitted to the electors. The present Prime Minister and members of his party declared that it was "" a piece of cheek"" on our part to propose to re-submit to the people questions that had been turned down by such a large majority less than two years be the » Confore. Notwithstanding their criticism, we submitted them at the last general election, and the voting upon them, as shown on pages 39 and 40 of the Statistical Returns presented to the House on 24th September last, was as follows: - Consti tution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) Bill 1912: For, 958,419; against, 982,615; or 49.38 per cent, for, and 50.62 In our per cent, against the Bill .

261,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,Will the right honourable member explain to the House how this improved vote was secured by the cracking of the whip-by the new plank inserted in the Labour party's platform at the Hobart Conference. It was previously an Australian question; it became afterwards a party question. .,44
262,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"The honourable member for Wannon is misinformed about something he has gathered - from some irresponsible source, which has nothing to do w i the point now under consideration. A question of this kind must always be a national one, and need not necessarily be made a party matter. The proposals which we made were not at all popular. Had the present Government been in power-the so-called Liberal Government - it would have taken care not to put before the country any unpopular proposal. The business of the Fusionists is to-try to find out first of all what the people are most likely to accept, and then to go as near as possible to giving them what they want, regardless of whether or not it is right. That, however, is not the attitude of a party which has the true welfare of the country at heart. Our determination is to p ut the right thing before the people, regardless of whether or not it be popular. But for that, we should not be here. We are here, not because we advocate popular things, b ut because we advocate that which is right. And thus, although our proposals were turned down by a majority of something like 250,000 votes at the referendum in 1911, we submitted them again in May last. I come now to the honourable member's point.",44
263,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,You embarrassed a few of your leaders in different States.,44
264,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,Nonsensica l statements of that character should have no place i a debate of this kind.,44
265,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,I am stating what is fact.,44
266,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Such arrogant asserto tions are hardlv worthy of notice. Let me the antipodes? give the honourable member an actual fact answer to his mere assertion. I was at Said when the result qf the first referenbetter dum reached me. The exact figures were put before me, and I was asked by a resailing presentative of Reuter's what I had to say in regard to them. I replied at once that the questions we had submitted were of national importance, designed to conserve the interests of the people, and that it would, therefore, be the duty the Government to put them as often possible, whether fhey were popular or not, until they were carried. That statement of mine was published at the time, so that the honourable member will see that it was with us a question, not of popularity, but of doing the right thing. Had the late Sir Henry Parkes and one or two other stalwart men of his day been deterred from carrying on the campaign for Federation by the sneers and gibes in which many indulged as to the reasons th which influenced their action, there would have been no Federation today, and the same jeers and . sneers will be indulged in at the expense of those who try to enlarge the powers of the National Parliament, so that the interests of the people may be conserved.' When the Federal Constitution was drafted, there was no thought of trusts, combines, and monopolies ruling the great republic of America. When the people of Canada asked the British Parliament for a Constitution of their own, did th-3y appeal for a Constitution like that of the United States of America ? They did not. The preamble of their Act asked that they should be given a Constitution as nearly allied to that of Great Britain as possible; and this was done in the light of experience of both forms of government. Unfortunately, we commenced the campaign for a Federal Constitution for Australia at a time when the cry of triumphant Democracy in America was very popular; and we fell into the error of choosing the Constitution of the United States of America as a model. Our Constitution has, in my opinion, been a partial failure from the first, and it has failed precisely where it is most allied to the American system. The United. States Constitution is a monun ment to the intellectual ability of the men who framed it . At that time, however, a who could have said that a person living in one part of the world would be able dictate the business of another part at It was then absolutely in impossible. At that time the means of Port transport and communication were little than in the time of the Phoenicians. Travel by sea was possible only on small craft driven by the wind, and on land there were only the fleetest horses. What is the position today 1 A man may sit in a room in America, Europe, or Asia, and control great industrial and of commercial concerns by the touch of a as button, and his servants obey his will jus t as directly as if they were in the same room. It is by this means that trusts, combines, and monopolies are able to do great in j u r y, and to practically the people, while under our Constitution, we, as a National Parliament, have means of prevention. The Attorneythe General and others will tell us that States have sovereign powers, and can - deal with these matters.",44
267,Mr MCDONALD,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"That is, when the - torney-General has altered his opinion; observed. lie did not say that at first.",45
268,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"W h i l e , politically, I this - differ strongly from the Attorney-General on many questions, I have pleasure i mitting that he did great service to the Commonwealth when he spoke out plainly stitutional by the High Court. during a critical period of our history. Whatever differences, politically, there may be, I can never forget national vice rendered by any one.",45
269,Mr MCDONALD,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"When a man believes that a certain thing ought to be done, votes against it because some other party is in power, I do not think much of him.",45
270,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"I am not defending anything of that kind. I take it that man holding the views expressed, and, believe, still held, by the Attorney-GeneI ral, must be prepared to support certain alterations in the Constitution. I am who places no l i m it on the extent of alterations that can be made. I do not think a democratic people need be afraid of the National Parliament- a Parliapropositions ment which stands alone on this great continent as a reflex of the will people. In every State the Upper House is either a nominee House or one elected on a privileged franchise; and how one calling himself a Democrat can tolebeing taken on these Bills. rate such a state of affairs I cannot underknow why. stand. Yet the one Parliament, which must be a reflex of the opinions of the people, is shorn of the powers to protect those who brought it into existence, and who have from time to time to elect it . Let me deal with the arguments that have been used by our opponents against the Labour party, who are practihave cally the originators of the extension the powers of the Commonwealth. The opposition was not to the enlargement . the powers of the Commonwealth; the argument was one of prejudice, and sisted in the contention that the powers were asked for by the Labour party the purposes of the Labour At the same time, our opponents knew that the appeal, if successful, would still leave in the hands of the electors the determination, from time to time, of the rob policy to be carried out by the Government and the Parliament. If the people no returned members who were opposed to exercise of the larger powers, then the the policy they represented would prev a i l ; on the other hand, if members were returned favourable to the larger At - powers, the will of the people would be I direct attention to the fact that for the last five years Parliament has been passing legislation approved, some of it , by the n adpeople at the general election, and yet that legislation has been declared unconI am not complaining of the action of the High Court in interpreting the Constitusertion as they find it . It is its duty to interpret the Constitution, and it is our duty to accept its decisions; but we should avail ourselves of every and opportunity presented to amend the Constitution in a proper way. I cannot hope to be successful in asking the Attorney General and the Government to pass these any Bills this session, and to submit them to I the people at the earliest convenient date. do not think the Government are likely to accede to such a request; but, at the one same time, it would not, I think be a the serious departure from even the principles of responsible government if they were bo debate, and even alter, if they chose, of the kind submitted from either side of the House. I understood, of the from a personal remark made by the Prime Minister across the table, when the House was sitting the other night, any that he is not favourable even to a vote I do not Mr W . H . IRVINE - It would be impossible to take a vote in a House of necessary about thirty-two.",45
271,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"I shall not press that any further, because it is certainly not a time when an important matter of this as kind can be fully discussed. Although I a great number of notes on the subof ject, I feel that it would be futile, and out of place, to attempt to discuss the of question at. any length to-dav. I believe, however, that I speak the mind of the conwhole party I represent when I say that we consider this the most important subfor ject that could engage the attention of party only. the people of Australia. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear!",45
272,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Most of the machinery that is necessary to ameliorate the conditions of the workers, to protect the employer, and to prevent the people being despoiled by trusts, monopolies, aud combines is withheld from us in the absence of the necessary power in the Constitution. Have honourable members read the statement by Mr Justice Higgins the other day in regard to the difficulty of getting a common rule for the protection of workmen? The learned Judge pointed out that Victoria alone, of all the States, has no Workmen's Compensation Act , and, shrewd jurist as he is, he finds this an obstacle in allotting the value of labour. A builder's labourer, for instance, is subject to the same risks in Victoria as a builder's labourer in New South Wales, but in the latter State, if he meets with au accident or a fatality, compensation is awarded under Act of Parliament. In Victoria there is no compensation.",46
273,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,The necessary legislation is being instituted in Victoria.,46
274,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,A g a in we have an lightening interjection ! Is the able member aware that Victoria is the only British community in the world that has not had workmen's compensation legislation for years?,46
275,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,That is not the point.,46
276,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"The point is that Victoria is the only State in Australia thathas not had, u n t i l recently, a Labour Ministry. Australia took the lead in this regard, and in Queensland, where there was the first Labour Government in Australia, a' Workmen's Compensation Act was passed. This shows clearly that the protection of the toiling masses, and even of the employer and the capitalist, is better looked after under a Labour form of government than under any other form.",46
277,Mr RODGERS,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,If the honourable member desires to be accurate he will tell the House that it is the Liberal party in Victoria who propose this legislation.,46
278,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"As I explained earlier in my speech, it is a characteristic of Liberalism to put all its goods in the window-to display anything likely to attract a vote-bu t matters are very different when the time for action arrives. How can a party which has enjoyed the sympathy, support, and smiles of trusts and combines-whic h has employed their munificent gifts for party purposesafford to attack those organizations here? I am not speaking of what I do not know. Have honourable members read the evidence given by the Queensland Premier,. Mr Denham, in the course-of a defamation case in the Brisbane Courts? Mr . Denham there said that he had received 1 £2,000 from nowhere in particular as a contribution to the Liberal funds used in fighting the referenda proposals, and that £2,000 more, with other donations, was= promised conditionally. Are honourable members aware that the receipt acknowledging this g if t , donation, or windfall,, was drawn up in such a way as to conceal the identity of the donors? Are they aware that these funds were used, and I presume rightly used, for p a r t y purposes-to defeat the referenda ? On that occasion money was poured out l i k e water to prevent a national Parliament having national powers. B ut nothing in the world can stop this movement-no thing in the world can prevent an enlightened democracy from granting those enpowers as soon as the proposals are laid honorbefore the country. Every day, or at least every month, there is fresh evidence of the need of larger powers; and the sooner they are conferred the better it will be for us all.",46
279,Mr WH IRVINE,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"The right honourable member said, I think, that the decision of the High Court had shown that under our present powers we could not South deal with monopolies or trusts.",46
280,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"I said that the High Court had rightly interpreted the Constitution in their own way, and that we must cheerfully accept the Court's decisions. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I know; but the honourable member said, in regard to one particular matter, that the powers of the Commonwealth as to trusts and monopolies had been declared by the High Court to be not sufficient.",46
281,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,I think the Attorney General is in error. .,46
282,Mr FENTON,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Wha b I think the honourable gentleman said was that the people approved of certain things which the High Court said were unconstitutional. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is another thing; I refer to the particular matter of trusts, combines, arid monopolies.",46
283,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"I carefully avoided the mirage of the High Court and Privy Council decisions in regard to the powers we have to deal with monopolies. What the legal position is I do not know, and I do not know that the Attorney-General knows. I have had the privilege of consulting Attorneys General, and the permanent officials of the Department, and I know that they do not know, or, if they know anything, it is that they do not know, although it is their business to enlighten laymen like myself as to the legal position of the Commonwealth. Nobody knows what our powers are. But should we not know ? If the country is in danger, should we allow any doubt to exist as to whether we have the righ t weapon with which to protect it? Every one admits that trusts, monopolies, and combines are here, and are doing in j u r y to the people, and that this Parliament cannot protect the country. Should tliere be any quibbling as to whether this, that, or the other thing is the law, when it is within the power of the people to make the law clear and definite ? No one has expounded the position better than the Attorney General, who has said that, if all the States joined together, they could not, because of their divisional boundaries, deal with trusts and combines. Under the chequer board system of government, it 'is easy for the rogue to prosper, and difficult for the honest man to exist. As it is not possible to have a discussion on each of these measures separately, I should like to move the second reading of all these Bills in one motion. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Does the honourable member wish to push the question to a division ?",46
284,Mr FISHER,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"No . I wish merely to get the measures formally before the House for discussion. I move That the Constitution Alteration Bills read a second time. Speaking for this party, I assure the House that we are in earnest about these measures, because we consider them necessary for the good government;. of the Commonwealth. I say now, as I have said on hundreds of platforms, that I consider that the questions dealt with by these Bills are the first questions that should be dealt with by the National Parliament. I told my electors that I considered thecarrying of the referenda proposals more important than my return for Wide Bay, and I say now that it would be better for the people of Australia that these Bills should become law, to give to this Parliament the constitutional powers that it should have, than that we should all be returned after the next elections.",47
285,Dr MALONEY,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Melbourne) [5.5] In seconding the motion of the Leader of the Opposition for the second reading of these Bills, in globo, I am reminded of a worthy citizen who, at a church meeting, said, "" Mr Chairman, before I vote for this motion, I want to know who this Mr Globo is . "" I express my regret that to these six measures for the alteration of the Constitution there has not been added a seventh, to give to the people the referendum and initiative. No other country in the world is . so Democratic as Australia. Even the Conservatives on the other side have advanced beyond the English ideas of conservatism. If we had the referendum and initiative, the six Bills now before us would not be necessary. I speak with knowledge, because I have lectured on the referendum since 1891, when I say that, if the people had the power, as in Switzerland, where 1 per cent, may set this machinery in motion, or in regard'to an alteration of the Constitution, If per cent., there would be legislation dealing with trusts. As I told a gentleman, acting for the Standard Oil Trust of America, "" You may boast that you can buy the Parliament of Australia, but even if you could command a majority here, you could not buy the whole nation. That is what the Australian franchise means."" The progress of the referendum idea in the Great American Republic is something unique. Last year, 12,000,000 persons voted for it . Ohio, where the population is 4,726,000, voted be nowfor it in September last; Washington, with a population of 1,141,000, in November; and it has been carried also by Nebraska, with a population of 1,192,000; Idaho, with a population of 325,000; Wyoming, with a population of 145,000; Wisconsin, with a population of 2,333,000; Nevada, with a population of 81,000; and Indiana, with a population of 2,700.000. This question can be approached without party bias. The greatest political minds ih Great Britain within the last thirty years-the great Gladstone and the Marquis of Salisbury, the Conservative leader of Great 'Britain-sup ported the referendum ;- and in America it has been supported by Willia m Jenare nings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, the Prefor sident of the .United States of America, and breakfast. and ex-President Theodore Roosevelt. Over 110 different cities have the referensaw dum and the initiative, and' many of from the fields. them have the recall.

The honourable member knows that agents with lying tongues are trying to get EngThere lishmen to accept assisted passages to Australia, i u order that they may earn the premium of £ 1 per immigrant. I am astonished at the honourable member balking in that way. If he objects bo the referendum, let him vote against it . But while it is a plank in the platform of the Labour party it is the duty of honourable members to try to make it the law. I hope the Government _will follow the lead of Democracy in this regard, and bring in the necessary measure. If they do so, it will come dowu to a practically unanimous House, and be adopted immediately. I appeal to the Attorney-General. In the past we have had many fights, and I have not the slightest doubt he has memories of political warfare that he regrets, just as I have; but he knows that the Government live simply on one vote. If they have regard to the "" shadow before,"" the result of the recent elections in New South Wales must show them how in secure their tenure is. Therefore, why caunot they follow the trend of democratic thought, and bring in a big measure like this. They would, thus enable both sides of the House to share in the eulogium that must follow the passing of it , and show the people outside, who send us here and pay our stipends, what splendid work can be done by a Parliament combined in one great democratic line of thought. If the Government are wise- I do not say if they desire to dish the other side, to use Disraeli's expression-the y will have the support of the strongest ing journal we have in Victoria, which, after many years, has been converted to this view, and they will also bave the support of every Democrat in Australia; and why they are timid about touching the matter I do not know. At all events, I hope they will consider it during the recess, and if , after mature consideration, they think ib righb bhat the people of Australia should have the power of controlling legislation introduced in this Parliament, they will be wise in in troducing the referendum and initiative. But if they do not, and during the recess from any cause one of their supporters should lose his seat, and another party should come into power, they will have lost a glorious opportunity, just as the Attorney-General, when he had the power to curtail the powers of the Legislative Council in Victoria, failed to grasp that opportunity. He did alter the Constitution of the Upper [170] House in Victoria, but not to the extent that was desired and hoped for by democratic Victorians. If the Government would have sufficient common sense to bring down a Bill , I should welcome it gladly; but if they do not, the people outside will condemn them. There is no nation so ready to carry out any political enterprise or idea for the welfare and benefit of the people. Politically, I think Australians can claim to be amongst the most highly-educated people in the world. Sooner or later the people, if the. Government stand in their way, will sweep them into the oblivion they deserve. I throw this out simply as a hint in the dying hours of the session. I do not know that there is anything so deserving of inquiry during the long recess as the matter of the initiative and referendum. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We shall have a good many matters of urgency to inquire into.",48
300,Dr MALONEY,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"The Attorney-General, as a legal man, though often on the wrong side, to my regret, would not 3o anything that is not to the benefit of the whole community; but with all his knowledge of trusts and combines-and he knows what bheir power is-h e may nob know that a man who represenbs the Standard Oil Company made the boast in South A f r i ca that he could buy up the whole of the Australian Parliament. The fightAttorney-General may not know that this man got two members of the Commonwealth Parliament, the two he wanted. When the House sought to compel the Standard Oil Company to t in their kerosene in Australia, the proposal was beaten by two votes. Those two men are out of Parliament today, and I am glad of it . I know this as certainly as I know that the Attorney-General has money in his pockets. Mr Bruce. SMITH - How do you know that he has money in his pockets?",49
301,Dr MALONEY,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"I know that the At torney-General has money in his pockets, although I would not dare to swear it in a witness-box. That is just the difference between certain knowledge and evidence. The learned member who represents Parkes knows that I would not dare to say in a witness-box-thoug h I know it as certainly as I know the Attorney General has money, in his pockets-because I could not prove it , that these two votes were obtained, and the Standard Oil Company got their way without having to buy the Australian Parliament. If the people had the referendum and initiative there would be no Meat Trust here as it is in Queensland today. It tried to establish itself in New South Wales, but Mr Trefle, the Minister of Agriculture, to his eternal credit be it said, prevented it. What can we do against the wonderful power of the money of these trusts? One thing only. It is possible to use. the money power to buy even a Cabinet. Not for one moment do I think there is the slightest suspicion of it, but it is possible, when we are fighting against millions. It is possible even to sway a majority of this House. But it is not possible to buy the whole of the people. That is why I say we should have the referendum and initiative. The Fiery Cross in the Highlands would be nothing to the cry that would ring through the length and breadth of our land, and there would be no difficulty in getting 45,000 signatures compelling the Government of the day to put a question before the people. If the Government cannot accept the other six suggestions, then let us join and give the people the power of the referendum and initiative. Thus the Government could show that during their tenure of office they were not afraid to trust the people by giving them the power which all democratic thought is wishful the people should have. There are twenty-two States in the United States of America that have this power. If we divide the United States by a line, all the western States but two have it, and on the eastern side six of the older States have it. We have this example, and we can follow also the splendid lead of Switzerland. Therefore, I hope the Government will carry this proposal into law, so that the people may be dominant.",49
302,Mr HANNAN,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Fawkner) [5.27] I desire to confine my remarks to the question of the alteration of the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to industrial matters. During the last election a great deal of stress was laid upon the necessity for industrial peace, and much political capital was made by our opponents, because of the fact that within the previous three years while the Labour Government were in power, there had been a certain amount of industrial strife. The responsibility for the whole of that industrial strife was placed upon the Labour party and upon the Labour Government, whereas the Labour party stand for the best form of industrial legislation-legislatio n which makes strikes unnecessary. If the absence of that legislation leads to industrial strife, the responsibility does not rest upon the Labour party. There are certain restrictions under the Constitution placed against the Commonwealth Parliament passing the form of industrial legislation we desire. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904 gave the President of the Arbitration Court power to make a common rule, but the High Court decided that the section of the Act providing for the common rule was unconstitutional. Nothing would tend more to bring about that industrial peace so ardently advocated by many people as the fact that the Arbitration Court would have power to give effect to a common rule. Unions recognise the great difficulty of approaching the Arbitration Court. It is not a question of bringing three or four employers before the Court. Under the existing Act, in certain industries, it is almost necessary to bring 500 or 600 before the Court.",50
303,Mr ARTHUR,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"In one case in New Zealand there were 1,200 respondents.",50
304,Mr HANNAN,SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS OP PROPOSED LAWS,"Unde r the existing law unions might have to bring anything from 100 to 1,000 employers before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to get an award. Under the original Act the intention was that if a union took a case to the Court it was only necessary at ""first to take there about ten or fifteen employers. Having obtained a decision from the President of the Court, the union within a certain time could apply to have the conditions fixed in the original award made the common rule. Once the common rule was brought into operation it practically applied from one end cf Australia to the other, to all those persons employed in that particular form of industry; but, as the result of the appeal to the High Court, that section of the Act was declared to be ultra vires. Had the Bill dealing with industrial matters submitted to the people at the last election been endorsed by them, this Parliament would have had full power to pass whatever industrial laws it might deem necessary in the interests of indust r i a l peace. During the elections we were accused, as a party, of practically stirring up industrial strife as between employer and employee; but, as a party, I say we stand for industrial peace, although not at any price. We believe that, by bringing into operation a sound form of industrial legislation, industrial peace is possible, but under the hybrid system of industrial legislation operating in Victoria today, and even under the system provided for in the Federal Arbitratio n Act, industrial peace in our community is almost impossible. We were told during the elections that, if the proposals of the. Labour Government, for the alteration of the Constitution, were successful, the Labour party were determined to wipe out of existence the system of Wages Boards now operating in Victoria, a state' ment which was made, not only from the platforms of Liberal candidates, but also by the Victorian press. While we have advocated giving increased powers to the Arbitration Court, we have never, at any time, stated that it was our intention or desire to interfere with the Wages Board system in any way. We recognise that there are many thousands of workers in our community who have received many and great benefits from our different systems of State industrial legislation in operation throughout Australia today, but we have to recognise that the tendency of all great industrial organizations is to become Federal in character. While we admit the great benefits given to thousands of workers by the Wages Board system, or by the Arbitration Courts, we say, as a party, l h at it is possible for any State Wages Board, or State Arbitratio n Court, to deal with the conditions of such large Federal organizations as exist in Australia today. No State Wages Board can deal with the conditions of the seamen of Australia, or of members of the Australian Workers Union. The same'thing applies to many others employed in manufacturing industries. One of the objects of our Protectionist policy is to protect the manufacturers of Australia against the unfair competition of manufacturers in other parts of the world. Under our Constitution this Parliament has no power to differentiate between State and State. While we bring into operation a system of Protection to put the whole of the manufacturers of Australia on an equal [170]- 2 basis of competition, we know that under the State system of industrial legislation it is quite possible for the manufacturers in one State to have an undue advantage over the manufacturers in another State. In these circumstances, when the whole of the manufacturers of Australia are < placed upon an equal basis of protection by the Commonwealth Tariff, it is only right and just that the whole of these manufacturers should be placed upon an equal basis of competition, so far as legislation is concerned. No State form of industrial legislation can place our manufacturers upon an equal basis of competition. Those of us in the industrial movement in Australia today say that, if you want industrial peace between the employers and workers, or even satisfaction as between manufacturer and manufacturer throughout Australia, the only possible way to secure them is by adopting an effective Federal system of industrial legislation. Before that system can be obtained, the difficulties that confront the President of the existing Arbitration Court must be removed. No one can speak with greater experience regarding those difficulties than the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Bendigo. I remember that Mr Justice Higgins on one occasion said he had to wade through a Serbonian bog of technicalities in carrying out his duties under our existing legislation. I believe that if it is possible for this Parliament to enact laws that will give the people of Australia industrial peace, we are doing something that will be in the interests of our people as a whole. From the inception of our moveim- ment our party has absolutely stood for industrial peace, ' but we are not going to have industrial peace unless you give to the bodies that deal with industrial disputes full and absolute power. While I have always advocated the extension of powers to this Parliament with that object in view, ib has not been with the intention , as stated by the press of Victoria and by the opponents of the Labour party, of injurin g or defeating the State system. It is only so that we can have a form of legislation suitable to deal with the great organizations of labour that we know exist in Australia today, and which are absolutely federal in character. Under our State laws-and I speak with some experience, as I have had the honour of sitting on a Wages Board in Vicboria for something like twelve years pripr to ber coining a member of this Wager Boards carry out their under many difficulties and There is also an Industrial Court in operation over them. rather peculiar that those who are always condemning our party because we are stirring up industrial strife, claim to be advocates of industrial are, on investigation found in our Victorian Assembly and Council voting and using their influence to weaken the form of our industrial legislation. Wages Boards have not the that they should have, not the fault of the State party. The Industrial Appeal Court has been the cause of industrial strife, it also was not brought into operation by the State Labour party. The same thing applies to our National Parliament. have had a Government in power which have utilized all their opportunities strength to bring into operation a form of legislation to create industrial and uot industrial strife. was to allow the workers to approach the Court and obtain satisfactory without being compelled to go on strike. We have been condemned as a party for creating industrial strife, and yet any person who goes to the trouble of making inquiries as to our actual attitude the trend of our movement must, if unbiased, admit that from the very inception of our political movement, last twenty-five years, we have been trying to bring about a form of industrial legislation that will make it unnecessary for the workers to strike to better their conditions; yet, when it is a question of appealing to the people to alter the existing Constitution, so as to give the National Parliament additional in order that they may carry that form of legislation, our object in asking for those powers is ignored, and the electors are told that our one object is to maim and wipe out of existence the form of industrial legislation in operation put Australia today. That is not the true position. We, as a party, industrial 1 peace, but industrial with honour; and I have urged that the best way for the workers to obtain industrial peace is to approach the different Courts, or Boards, that we have .in operation today. with attention to the Mr Hannan. when he was speaking a few days ago> House-our on the question of preference to unionduties ists. I do not know whether the honorrestrictions- able gentleman Has ever given consideraAppeal tion to the fact that practically every deIt is cision given in the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court today gives preference, not to unionists or fair emand who ployers, but to the individual who is prer peace, pared to sell his labour under the r u l in g wage, and to the employer who is alwayslooking for the lowest form of labour. That is the position under the existing, The law, since any decision given by the power Court is binding only upon the employersbut that is who are respondents in the case, and Labour upon the workers who are members of the claimant organization. The employer but who does not employ a union hand is in no way bound by any decision given by the Court. The position is, therefore, We that our existing industrial legislation gives preference to the employer who ""does and not employ union labour, and preference to the individual who will not join an peace, organization to improve his own condiTheir object tions. It does not give that individual the preference to secure a higher wage, conditions it merely gives him the right to offer his labour at a lower rate than that fixed by the Court. This phase of the situation^ so far as I am aware, has not been mentioned here before. The difficulty can be and overcome only by bringing into operation once more that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provided for the for the common rule, and which was declared by the High Court to be unconstitutional. If it were in operation toabsolutely day, an award of the Court, on a second application by the organization which had obtained it , could be made binding on all employers and employees engaged in the industry throughout Australia. Until powers, we have obtained power to secure uniform conditions of employment, allowance being made for the difference in the cost of living and certain other conditionsand until we have in operation industrial laws that will bring the; conditions of t hethrough- different workers in the several States on something like an equality-w e can never desire hope for that industrial peace for which peace a great number of public men are always> consistently clamouring, but which, as public men, they do their best to block. I come now to the position of the rural workers, which has been receiving a great deal of I listened attention from public men and the press Attorney-General of Australia. Under the existing law/ the rural workers' organization, in order to obtain something like an effective .award from the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, would have to bring before that tribunal some hundreds of employers. Honourable members will recognise, therefore, the difficulty in the way of any organization representing - such au industry securingan award that is likely to bring in its wake industrial peace. It is the duty of this Parliament to make its industrial laws effective if it is really sincere in its desire that industrial peace shall be obtained. My right honourable leader drew attention to the fact that certain proposals which we submitted to the people at the last general - elections were defeated by only a small majority. Amongst .those proposals was a measure providing for an alteration of the Constitution to enlarge the power of this Parliament to deal with industrial matters - If carried, it would have given this Parliament full power to bring into operation an effective system of conciliation and arbitration. It was defeated by a very small majority. But how was its defeat brought about? Was it defeated by an intelligent, educated vote ? By no means. In saying this I do not wish to infer that the electors of Australia are not intelligent. I mean rather to infer that an elector, however intelligent, cannot cast an intelligent vote unless he has before him the actual facts upon which he is asked to express an opinion. Our electors were 'sufficiently intelligent to be able to decide this question as between our opponents and ourselves, provided that the - actual facts were placed before them. But the real facts were obscured. We say that we want industrial peace, and if the whole of the facts had been placed before the people at the last referendum as to the reasons which actuated us in asking that the Commonwealth Parliament be given increased power to legislate with respect to industrial matters, I am confident that that proposal, with others, would have been carried. If it had been accepted we should have had absolute power to bring into operation a system of industrial legislation which would probably make strikes in the - future almost unnecessary. It was defeated, however, because the true facts were not placed before the people. Imagine any newspaper, which desired to tretain the respect of the people, publishing leading articles like those which appeared in the Victorian press, telling the farmers that if the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Matters) Bill were accepted by the people, the'Labour party, on their return to power, wOuld at once pass a law compelling every farmer to dispense with the services of his sons and daughters; that the law would* declare that preference must be given to unionists, and that since his sons and daughters Were not members of the Rural Workers Union he would 'be compelled, under the law, to dispense with their services. That statement appeared in a Victorian newspaper, and was only on a par with many Others that were published day after day, not only in Victoria, but in other parts of Australia. In View of the fact that our proposals, despite these damaging statements, were defeated by only a small majority-in one case by a little over 8,000 vote's-w e may reasonably conclude that, when they are again submitted to the people, the small minority against ' them will be converted into a substantial majority in support of them. I speak as one who has been actively engaged for some time in the - industrial movement in Victoria, as secretary of a trade union, and as a member of a Wages Board. In the latter capacity I learned how the powers of the delegates were restricted, and how the law itself prevented us fixing conditions which would have insured industrial peace. As a trade union secretary I was the first to take a case before . Mr. Justice Higgins in the Federal Arbitration Court. In that case the Attorney General appeared on the one side and the honourable member for Bendigo on the other. I am able to speak from practical experience of - the difficulties which the unions have in reaching' the Courf, and to show that, when they do reach it, the time of the President is occupied in dealing, not with the questions in dispute, so far as wages and conditions of labour are concerned, but with technical questions of jurisdiction. I know of an organization which went into the Court, and was represented by Mr Duffy, and the honourable member for Bendigo, while the Attorney-General was on the other side. The arguments extended over weeks, and, in the end, the members of the union had presented to them a bill of costs amounting to something' like £3,000, although their conditions were not altered, or even considered, by the Court. The whole time of the Court was taken up in dealof ing with questions of jurisdiction. We cannot hope for industrial peace under such conditions. We need to have Federal Court that can deal with the great system of federal organization that has sprung up. We want an equal basis tract. I moveof competition as between manufacturers in each State, and that equal basis of to. competition can be secured only by uniform industrial conditions operating in the different States. Those uniform conclause ditions in turn can be brought about only by full power being given to this Parin liament to pass industrial legislation, and those full powers would be obtained such if the people accepted one of these measures. I believe that, on the next sion that a reference is made to the people, that Bill wil l be carried, and when agreed to. full powers to pass industrial legislation are conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament, industrial peace, as we advocate it , will be, for the first time, within the near view of the people of Australia.

There is an extremely small poputhe. lation to provide for there at present, and labour of all kinds is very costly; and the difficulties of transport, together with the time that purveyors would have to wait for their money, add enormously to the price of the goods. The Government, however, would know says exactly what was required, and could provolent vide reasonably for any given period. A rangements could be made with a merthe chant or merchants of Darwin, and the goods could be conveyed to. the workmen. the amendment. Mr W . H .

It provides that the Governexacted ? ment shall undertake to supply all stores at prices obtaining at Darwin, plus penalty. freights.",55
310,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"I would say, freights and the cost of distribution. Mr W . H . IRVINE - But what does the provision mean? I suppose the prices are to be retail prices; but retail in Darwin will always be going up and down, varying, perhaps from famine prices to selling-off prices. The provision imposes on the Government the statutory duty of providing the men liament bo the Governmenb. with provisions at the exact prices prevailing in Darwin at any given moment, plus freights.",55
311,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"In my opinion, the amendment does not conflict with common sense or good government. Whether the men engaged in constructing the proposed railway are working for a contractor or for the Government, they must live, and should be enabled to live as human also beings. They must, therefore, be supplied with all necessary food, clothing, and the comforts of civilized life. Who will supply these things? The men ought nob to be in any uncertainty as bo the supply, nor should they be left at the mercy of a few storekeepers in a place so remote that there will be little or no competition. The Government ought not to lose anything in this transaction, and, I say that the cost of distribuThe amount charged should allow a margin sufficient to protect the Government againsb loss. The Prime Minister is never tired of advocating co-operation for the protection In of the individual against the attacks of combinations. Well, the Government will be in a position to co-operate with tliese The Attorney-General, in opposing the Senate's amendment, is acting against declared policy of his party. Mr W . H . IRVINE - On the contrary, I have admitted that the Government, in inviting men to go to this remote district, are under an obligation to see that they would are not placed at a disadvantage.",55

314,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,Onl y the political Mr W . H . IBVINE - The Government plus are liable to that in any case.,55
315,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Of course, the men could nob obbain compensation from the Governmenb if Minisbers failed to carry prices out this statutory obligation.",55
316,Sir ROBERT BEST,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Then there is no enormously, value in the provision.",55
317,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"The provision amounts to a clear and distinct direction from ParWe have now only the verbal statement of the senior Minister present that Ministers would feel it their duty, in ordinary cases, to protect these men as far as possible. If the Government failed to comply with the statutory direction, their political offence would be more serious than if they merely broke a promise made by a Minister.",55
318,Mr GROOM,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,No provision like this was inserted in the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Act .,56
319,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,No legislation is perfect. I should have supported the provision had it been proposed when we were considering that measure. I understand that a similar provision is in force in South Australia and in Queensland.,56
320,Mr GROOM,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,I do not think that there is any statutory obligation on the Government in Queensland.,56
321,Sir ROBERT BEST,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Suppos e the vernment refused to comply with the statutory obligation, and had the support of their followers?",56
322,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Then they escape political punishment,, of course, and the Crown could not be mulct in damages in any action brought against it . But should we be afraid of expressing our opinion in statutory form ? The Attorney General has gone a long way beyond his ordinary political views - when he says that the Government will look after these men as far as that is practicable and possible. I shall have to call for a division against the motion, unless that will discover the want of a quorum. Mr W . H . IBVINE - That will be result.",56
323,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"We l l , having made a promise, I cannot go back ou it ; but I regret that the Attorney-General insists on his view.",56
324,Mr TUDOR,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Yarra) [6.26] - The complaint made during the recent electoral campaign was that, while wages have been increased, the prices of commodities have gone up so inordinately that the workers are little better off than they were. The Government has accepted an amendment regarding the conditions and wages of th© men who are to be employed on this railway, but Ministers say, in effect, ' ' We shall allow the contractor for the work to take his storekeepers along the line of route, and charge _what he likes for the provisions supplied.""",56
325,Mr FALKINER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,The amendment would allow the Darwin storekeepers to charge the men what they liked.,56
326,Mr TUDOR,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"At present there are no vested interests to consider. When a camp has been moved from one place to another, there will be no business for a store at the place from which the move has been made. I am afraid that, unless this provision is agreed to, the men will be charged such high prices for provisions that their improved wages and conditions will do them little good.",56
327,Mr AHEBN,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,This provision will not improve their positions.,56
328,Mr TUDOR,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,Can the honourable member suggest anything better?,56
329,Sir ROBERT BEST,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,The promise of the Government is better.,56
330,Mr TUDOR,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"I understand that the Government declines to undertake the responsibility. But the Government Go- would know what contracts had been let, where the men were likely to be employed during any period, how many were being employed, and would what stores they would need; and the men would be infinitely better off if supplied by the Government than if left in the hands of private storekeepers. The honourable member for Kooyong knows that it was a complaint against certain employers that when the Wages Boards increased the wages of their employees, they raised the rents of the houses in which these employees were living, and thus got back more than the additional amount which they had to pay out.",56
331,Mr HIGGS,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"Capricornia) [6.31] - I the hope that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister will realise that this is an opportunity to assist the navvies or railway men to live under better conditions. We have had. proposals for assisting the farmers, and this is a proposal to assist workers, by enabling them to get their stores at cost price by the elimination of the profits of the middleman. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [6.321 - Without this great mass of navvies-thes e men who produce the wealth of the country-ther e would be no home market for the farmer to sell his produce in , and where men are not getting wages,- they cannot pay high prices.

That is a reason for making the lot of the men who are to be employed on this railway as comfortable as possible.",56
333,Mr GLYNN,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,That will be done.,57
334,Mr FENTON,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,"I do not say that this provision has been properly drafted to do what we wish, but we should have an absolute assurance from the Government. The men should not be left to the tender mercies of the local storekeepers.",57

339,Mr FISHER,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,Perhaps the Prime Minister will make a direct statement of what the Government propose to do should the amendment be rejected?,57
340,Mr FENTON,PINECREEK TO KATHERINE,I hope so. You will find a better class of men making their way to this place if it is known that the protecting hand of the Government will be over them.,57

We are undermany obligations, Mr. Speaker, to you, as the presiding officer of the House, for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. However strenuously our political battles may be fought, we must ail believe in our hearts that you have done your best to keep to the high levels set you by your predecessors. Personally, I have to acknowledge that I have been kept strictly in my proper place under your care and control, and I hope I have submitted with becoming humility to the discipline. We all must feel, sir, that you have done your duty diligently, ably, faithfully, and impartially. We owe much also to the Chairman of Committees for his patience, industry, and ability that have led to the facile conduct of the affairs of the Committees. The officers of the House are always with us; Ministers come and Ministers go, but they, like the brook, go on for ever.' We hope, I am sure, that that "" for ever "" will mean, at any rate/many years to come. We owe much to their assistance and their ready help in time of need. To their courtesy, unfailing and untiring, and to their urbanity and diligence, we are indebted more than we know for the proper conduct of the business of the House; and I make my acknowledgment to them here and now. To our good friends of the Hansard Staff, headed by the "" F r i e n d "" of man, we owe a great deal; and, altogether, I think we do not sufficiently remember how the organized forces of the House patiently, silently,, and ably keep the wheels of our machinery going with as little friction as: possible, and with a maximum of efficiency. I hope honourable members will' believe me when I wish them, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, aMerry Christmas and a very Happy NewYear, and all the good fortune that the world may bring to those who try to do their duty, as I am sure my right honourable friend tries to do his - I hope. that when we meet again it will be with renewed vigour, and with patriotism unabated, to do the best we can for this great country of ours.",58
352,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide B a y ) [3.21 a.m.]. - I j o in with the Prime Minister in this valedictory of the first session of the fifth Parliament, which has been the most tragic of any since the commencement of the Commonwealth. I trust that never again, within the space of one short week, shall we see two of our members struck down in their prime. I agree that all concerned have done their best according to their lights, and if that best sometimes has fallen short of what we would desire or expect, it is only in the nature of things in the proceedings of every deliberative assembly. I join with the honourable gentleman, too, in offering my congratulations to you, Mr Speaker. It is incumbent on every member of the House to give you all the help, and to show you all the consideration possible, and this I have endeavoured to do. In any position that I may occupy, you may depend upon my assistance in conducting our proceedings according to the rules that have been framed for our'guidance. I do not wish to strike a jarring note, but I should fail in my duty, and should leave a false i m pression on the minds of honourable members, if I did not say that, placing the m.ost favourable construction on everything done by Ministers, I feel that the suspension of the honourable member for Bal|larat was mistaken, and based on grounds on which it cannot be sustained. The matter is no longer controversial, the penalty imposed having been paid. What was done was done by the head of the Government, not by you, Mr Speaker, and I am not, therefore, reflecting upon you in mentioning the incident. I join with the Prime Minister in conveying the thanks of this party to the Chairman and officers who have guided the procedure of the House, and to the Hansard staff, to whom we are all greatly indebted. them. I offer my personal congratulations for the manner in which their duties have been performed. We are exceedingly fortunate in the staff that was formed at the beginning of Federation. The representatives of the people who come from every part of Australia can be sure that their utterances will be turned "" best side out with care,"" if I may so express myself, by the official reporters, who, while giving a truth f u l record of the speeches delivered, are creating a permanent record worthy of this National Parliament. Knowing the wear and tear of Ministerial work, and the drain upon the physical energy of the occupants of office,. I trust that Ministers will find in the recess opportunities for much-needed rest, and recuperation. While we must often,, in the heat of debate, strike hard, I trust, that the good personal feeling which exists between us, notwithstanding our political differences, will always remain unimpaired, and that our proceedings; will be characterized by that dignity which is the pride of the Legislature of the Mother Country. From honourable members generally I have received many courtesies. The honest expression of opinion is always to be respected, and adverse criticism is sometimes more helpf u l than friendly support. In conclusion, I echo the wish of the Prime Minister that we may all enjoy a merry Christmas and enter upon a happy New Year.",59
353,Mr SPEAKER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Before we disperse for the recess, I wish to express my appreciation of the kind remarks regarding myself and the conduct of business since I have occupied the position of Speaker, which have fallen from the lips of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, speaking, I take it , on behalf of their respective parties. I thank the House for this expression of confidence in me. There can be no two opinions about the arduous nature of the work we have had to perform. It is unfortunate that the electors are apparently so evenly divided in their political opinions .that neither political party has a majority in this House without counting the occupant of the Chair. I happen to be that, in some respects, unfortunate individual, and thus occupy a position unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. I can, however, honestly and truth full y say that I have To endeavoured, with what ability I possess, to act ini partially in the discharge of my duties in the Chair. No one can do more than his best, and notwithstanding my shortcomings, I have tried to do that. I am indebted to the Clerks at the table for their cordial assistance, and express my appreciation of the efficient manner in which the Hansard staff, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and our officers generally have performed their duties. I trust that the recess may afford both Ministers and members an opportunity to recuperate after their labours, and that we may all return next session wibh renewed vigour our personal friendship, notwithstanding our political relations, remaining undiminished. In the meantime, I wish all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH posedTliat the House, at its rising, adjourn until this day week. SURAR INDUSTRY - MR .

357,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Wide Bay) [3.28 a.m.]. - I have no reply to make to the Prime Minister's remarks, having said- I think with courtesy-wha t I had to say on the subject. I wish to draw the attention „ the Minisber of Trade and Cusboms bo the following telegram from Brisbane, published in this morning's issue Argus:Brisbane, Thursday - The Minister for Agriculture (Mr White) said today that he had signed 512 certificates of exemption as provided for under the Sugar Cultivation Act, permitting aliensto engage in the sugar industry. No one bad received an exemption certificate unless he had resided in Queensland for over 10 years. Some of the applicants have been 30 years in the Slate. Many of them were Hindoos (British subjects) and Kanakas, who had been exempt tinder the Federal Act of ro,02. I am quibe sure that Hindoos and Kanakas exempbed under the Act of 1902 are not exempt under the agreement into which we entered with the Queensland Government. The fact that 512 aliens have been given certificates of exemption is, in my opinion, a very good beginning towards the reintroduction of coloured labour into the sugar industry. I very much regret that almost as soon as we have given the State Government control of the industry we should be comCOOK) pro- pelled bo pay, in respecb of sugar produced by 512 aliens, the same amount that we pay on sugar produced by white labour. Protection was originally granted to the sugar industry on the basis of the employment of whibe labour, but, appaADJOURNMENT. rently, with the best of intentions, a breach of that policy has been committed. I have no hesitation in saying that from "" ARG US "" CRITICISM. my own knowledge of the industry, and I am satisfied that, if this practice should be developed to any material extent, it will be fatal to the best interests of the industry, and to the northern portion of the continent.",60

I allude to an attack made in a leading article, published in yesterof day's issue of the Argus, upon a great Judicial Officer of the Commonwealth- a you Judicial Officer who, I am sure the House believes, has discharged his functions with hope impartiality, and has brought to bear - upon them all the wealth of his great learning and his diligence. This article, in my view, amounts practically to an accusation of bias against Mr Justice Higgins. In order to maintain that position I propose bo quote one or two short of passages from the article.",60
359,Mr AGAR WYNNE,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,We might want to of the say something on the other side.,60
360,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"V e r y well. The article opens with the statementA Liberal candidate at the last Federal election who ventured to express a candid opinion of the working of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was asked by an indignant Labour supporter whether he impugned the integrity of Mr. justice Higgins. "" No,"" replied the candidate, ""nothing of the sort; I would Be the very last man to do such a thing ; all I say is that all his awards go the one way."" Taking that as his text the Argus leaderwriter goes on to sayThat, we believe, is the impression which Mr. Justice Higgins has made all over Australia. It is certainly the whole secret of his popularity in trade-union circles, where every mention of his name excites an approving cheer. In referring to employers the writer saysObviously, they are never right in His Honour's opinion. And he goes on - to sayThey know that they cannot enter the Arbitration Court without coming out losers, so only when the demands made upon them are ruinously extortionate do they think it worthwhile to fight, in the hope lhat perhaps something less than the full claim made upon them will be granted. In dealing with His Honour's remarks on the question of preference to unionists, the writer saysThere is a fine surface appearance of moderation ancl restraint about his utterance, but a moment's examination shows that it is one-sided. His Honour shrinks from the open unfairness of directing lhat preference be given to unionists, but warns the employers to do nothing which might appear to justify the suspicion that they are discriminating against organized labour; yet he does not exact any corresponding assurance from the unions. Further on we have the statementBut no; organized labour must be pampered and coddled every time and right through the bill. . . . Experience has shown that all the privileges are accorded to one side, and all the obligations placed on the other. And it is all done in the name of industrial peace ! If this is not a direct impugning of H i Honour's impartiality I do not know what would be. The High Court has deterbelief mined that statements may be made conmendation cerning a Judge that are not contempt of Court, and that a Judge has his remedy in bringing an action for libel. I desire, however, to place on record the fact that my experience is that H is Honour exertliat cises in every case the greatest diligence and care, and, as I thoroughly believe, the greatest impartiality.",60
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"In fact, he excites the honourable member's admiration and approbation.",61
362,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,Yes ; as a lawyer he excites my admiration by the way in which he deals with the questions brought before him.,61
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member must be in that circle to which the newspaper refers.,61
364,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I think that the origin of these remarks is that our experience of Judges who have had to deal in the past with industrial matters is that they have shown some class feeling, and that they have not given to the claims of the workers that close and sympathetic consideration which they deserve.",61
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member is now attacking the other Judges.,61
366,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I am not. I attri bute this to class feeling, which must be the result of the environment from which a Judge has sprung, and in which he has his being.",61
367,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,Mr Justice Higgins is exposed to hatred by some who ought to be his defenders.,61
368,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,And because Mr . Justice Higgins has divested himself of that class feeling,61
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,The honourable member for Bendigo and his leader are now going a long way to justify the comment of which complaint is made.,61
370,Mr ARTHUR,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"Because Mr Justice Higgins has got r i d of that class feeling, and is able to deal impartially with the matters coming before him , he. is condemned by newspapers like the Argus, and those whom the Argus supports. I m partial and scientific observers of the work done by this learned Judge in the Auss tralian Court of Conciliation and A r b i tration, however, have expressed complete in his impartiality. Words of comhave been uttered in that regard. ' Some observers have remarked that he has made statements which might ruffle the feelings of employers, but that, in the result, his awards have been fair, they have been made after a complete consideration of all the facts and circumstances, and that no f a u l t can t e found with them. Persons who have been opposed to the claims of the unions, and others who have had to"" advise them and to conduct their claims in Court, haye also expressed the view that His Honour, in the result, has done nothing that is unfair or which could be attributed to partiality towards one side or the other. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [3.48 a.m.] - I have not read the article referred to, nor do I in tend to read it . But I should like to remind the honourable member for Bendigo that in inviting a discussion on the Judges who are engaged in discharging ordinary judicial functions, or functions of a legislative character, he is entering upon ground that is not likely to lead to any useful result in this House. The Courts possess all the necessary authority to deal with criticism which goes so far as to be dangerous to the administration of jusbice. They have the power to do that in the most complete way and to protect themselves.",61
371,Mr FISHER,PINE CREEK TO KATHERIN E,"I think that the Attorber. ney-General once said that the President of the Arbitratio n Court was liable to be criticised in any way. Mr W . H . IRVINE - In no case where they are exercising judicial funcand tions is it advisable that this House should be made a theatre for the discusber sion of these Judicial Officers. true, as I was about to add, that rightly or wrongly it has become the policy of this Parliament, and of other Legislatreaties tures, to invite Judicial Officers to form functions that are really not judiinform cial, but are more of a legislative characThese ter. Mr Justice Higgins, in a brated case, himself pointed out that his duties were really more legislative than porary. judicial. I refer to his remarks in the Harvester case. Such criticism cannot go on without evoking criticism and elsewhere on both sides. We know, though I am not going to refer in detail to this, that there are other Judges enperial gaged in similar work who have evoked much more rancorous criticism than any read by the honourable meinber. It would be wise to let the Courts defend themselves in these matters; because, once we introduce debate in this House, we naturally invite discussion on both sides, and this, i u my opinion, it is very desirable to avoid.",62
