2,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Navy. Can he inform me whether the navy is to maintain only one aircraft carrier in commission, namely, HMAS. Sydney ? When will HMAS. Vengeance be returned to Britain ? Can the Minister say whether the delivery of the new aircraft carrier, HMAS. Melbourne, from Britain, has heen postponed or cancelled ?",11
3,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"There are two aircraft carriers in commission, namely. HMAS. Sydney and HMAS.. Vengeance. HM.A.S Sydney is the flagship of the fleet; HMAS. Vengeance is doing the work that HM.A.S Australia did. H.M.AJ3 Australia provided training facilities for all recruits for the Royal Australian Navy, National Service trainees, and all naval reserves. HMAS. Vengeance will do that work, as HMAS Australia is to be sold for breaking up. HMAS. Vengeance will proceed to Great Britain, with the balance of the ship's company, in time to meet HMAS. Melbourne, which we expect to come back to Australia in August or September, 1955.",11
4,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,When will we take delivery of HM.A.S. Melbourne!,11
5,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"H.M.A. S Melbourne should leave for Australia about September, 1955.",11
6,Mr OSBORNE,Unknown,"The Minister for the Navy has informed the honourable member for Calare that . HM.A.S. Vengeance is to be used for training personnel, as HM.A.S. Australia was used prior to being paid of f . Will the Minister tell me whether HMAS. Vengeance is being used now for operating aircraft? Does it carry aircraft? When HMAS. Vengeance has been returned to the Royal Navy next year and HMAS. Melbourne has been commissioned, will HM.A.S. Melbourne be used as an operational aircraft carrier ? If so, what then will be the role of HM.A.S. Sydneyi . Mr Francis - I thought I made it uite clear that HMAS. Vengeance is ,1 oing the work that HMAS. Australia \ did. HMAS. Australia did not carry aircraft, nor does HMAS. Vengeance. When HMAS. Melbourne arrives in Australia the work that HMAS. Vengeance has been carrying out will bo performed by HMAS. Sydney.",11
7,Mr MULLENS,Unknown,"Does the Minister for Social Services recall that when he was Minister for the Navy, in answer to questions asked by myself and other honourable members in this House, he denied that. HMAS. Culgoa was sent to a private firm for refitting and repairs ? Such a denial was made on two occasions. Is the Minister aware that the present Minister for the Navy has. said distinctly and emphatically that HMAS. Culgoa did go to a private firm for overhaul of machinery, refitting and repairs? If these are facts will the Minister for Social Services say whether it is a case of deception",11
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member may not use the term ""deception"" in relation to a ministerial answer to a question.",11
9,Mr MULLENS,Unknown,Will the Minister give the facts of the case ?,11
10,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,I regret that I do not know sufficient about the facts to he able to give the honourable member an adequate reply to his question. I presume that the Minister for the Navy heard the question and I am sure that he will take the earliest opportunity to straighten out the tangle which 1 think exists in the honourable member's mind in relation to this matter. SHIPPING.,11
11,Mr LUOK,Unknown,"Is the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that the steamer Taroona left Melbourne for Tasmania yesterday without mail, perishable cargo and passengers' cars? Was wharf labour available for the steamer but not used by the owners?. Will the Minister take any steps necessary to ensure that this vessel, a vital link between the mainland and Tasmania, will provide the service intended, without interruption by disputes on the waterfront?",11
12,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,Unknown,"I am aware that there were no requisitions by steamship owners and stevedoring companies for labour on the Melbourne waterfront yesterday. There was a dispute on a certain vessel, Taiyuan, and the watersiders refused to accept the adjudicator's award. Some ships loading and discharging in the harbour already had their men, and work on those ships was continued, but there was no requisition for labour for other ships yesterday in Melbourne. ATOMIC ENERGY. Mr E3EON - I ask the Minister for Supply whether the Australian Government has received an invitation from the Government of the United States of America to join the International Committee on Atomic Technology, which the United States Government has established for the further development of peaceful uses of atomic energy. If the Australian Government has received such an invitation, will the Minister say whether the dispute between atomic scientists that is taking place .at present is likely to lessen the value of Australia's membership of the committee and the value of the committee to Australia? Is the Minister prepared to try to find some solution of the present controversy in Australia between experts in various atomic fields?",12
13,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"The difference of opinion to which the honourable gentleman has referred has no bearing on the subject matter of the first part ofhis question. If he will place it on the notice-paper, I shall have it examined.",12
14,Mr CRAMER,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Supply .aware that two top-ranking physicists have expressed diametrically opposite views on the advisability of erecting an experimental nuclear reactor in Sydney? In view of the fact that public organizations are being induced to contribute large sums of money for this purpose, - can the Minister give any guidance in the matter? MT. BEALE - I think a .whole covey of scientists, and not merely two eminent scientists, were involved in this matter. What happened was that at a recent symposium in Sydney there was a difference of ©pinion between various scientists who were attending it regarding whether or not there should be erected at some time what is known as a low power reactor, which is alleged to be useful for training and research purposes. Outside the symposium, a day or two before, one professor had offered the view that such a reactor ought to be built. At the symposium, a day or two later that view was opposed by another professor, who had just returned from Harwell, in England. He offered the view, in effect, that that sort of reactor was useless for training and research purposes and was, in effect, a waste of money. He was supported by another professor who had also just returned from Harwell, and by another eminent nuclear scientist in Australia. I offer no views on the merits of the controversy, but I say that the fact that it has iQceurred, at least completely justifies the Government's attitude in this matter, which has been to proceed carefully .and take the latest and best advice possible. EDUCATION .",12
15,Mr GALVTN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister cause inquiries to be made into the recent stipulation of the authorities which control Commonwealth scholarships, that these are not to be paid unless they reach a minimum of £10 ? Is he aware that that decision permits of the payment of fees of part-time students who are attending the universities in New South Wales and Victoria to study one or two subjects, but that students who are doing the 'same subjects at the university in South Australia, where fees are being kept low, are deprived of their scholarships ? Will the right honourable gentleman ensure that South Australian students shall not be penalized merely because they happen to live in South Australia ?",12
16,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I shall be glad to have this matter investigated, and I will inform the honourable member of the result in due course.",12
17,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"My question concerns the fact that, each year, the Commonwealth awards about six or seven so called Canberra scholarships, but when these are paid their value is deducted from' any additional Commonwealth scholarships that the recipient may be receiving. Will the right honourable gentleman consider making these few Canberra scholarships additional to any other scholarship which may be held by the recipient ?",12
18,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I shall have the matter investigated, and I will advise the honourable member of the result in due course. AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.",13
19,Mr JR FRASER,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Army inform the House whether the Department of the Army is proposing to discontinue the use of hats, khaki, fur-felt-the slouch hat which has become the symbol of the Australian army-and if so, whether the slouch hat, is being replaced by the un-Australian beret?",13
20,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"There is no intention whatever of interfering with the old "" digger "" hat.",13
21,Mr HULME,Unknown,"In relation to the purchase of certain farms in the Canungra area for jungle training purposes, will the Minister for the Army say how many farms are being acquired, the prices being paid for them, and whether those prices are reasonable-o n a walk-in walk-out basis-and sufficient to enable the displaced farmers to rehabilitate themselves one. on comparable properties?",13
22,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I inform the honourable member that fifteen farms are the subject of negotiation by my colleague, the Minister for the Interior. The owners of these farms are entitled, under the Constitution, to fair and just compensation. I am sure that my colleague will that they get it.",13
23,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"As the Minister for the Army is aware, the field firing,range which is used by the Army for artillery training purposes in southern Queensland is situated several hundred miles from the main training centres. Will the Minister indicate to the House whether investigations are being carried out at the present time in an endeavour to locate a suitable area, which could be used for field firing purposes, and which would be handier to the major training centres?",13
24,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I appreciate the interest of the honourable gentleman in this matter. For some years now, a very careful search has been made in the vicinity of Brisbane, where the bulk of those who require artillery training is congregated, in an effort to find a suitable artillery range, but so far we have not been successful. In respect of those areas we sought, the cost of the land was prohibitive. The investigation is still going on. HOUSING.",13
25,Mr BIRD,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether any progress has been made, pursuant to a decision taken at the last meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers, that Commonwealth and State housing officers would meet to work out a uniform and equitable plan for the sale of Housing Commission homes to tenants? When is it expected that .a further meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers will be held, in order to ratify the proposed plan ?",13
26,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"This matter is under very close examination by the relevant Minister and by the Cabinet. When we are in a position to make a precise proposition I shall communicate with all the Premiers and if , after that, they desire some further discussion, I shall convene RICE.",13
27,Mr NELSON,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Territories give any information to the House regarding statements that are circulating to the effect that the Governsee ment is negotiating with American interests to allow them to take over and develop 2,000,000 acres of rice land situated in the northern part of the Northern Territory? A sum of £5,000,000 has been - mentioned as the amount to be expended by the American interests in the development of the area. Does not the Minister consider, if these reports are correct, that the interests of the nation would be best served if the Australian Government called in experts from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, who have made an outstanding success of rice-growing in New South Wales, to assist with the development of the area, where 3,000 or 4,000 farms could be established which could form the basis of a war service land settlement project? I ask the Minister to allow the Commonwealth to undertake this work so that settlers will not have to bear the added cost of profit-taking which, according to the statement, the outside interests would impose.",13
28,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"I had anticipated that the honourable member would ask this question and I have prepared a statement, which, with the leave of the House, I would read. Mr CAIAVEI.L - The Opposition will grant leave.",14
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the Minister asking for leave to make a statement?,14
30,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,Yes .,14
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Then I think that he should ask leave at the stage when Ministers generally are asking leave to make statements. Later:,14
32,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"by leave-For some time, the Government has been investigating the possibilities of commercial rice-growing in the sub-coastal plains of the Northern Territory, especially in the Adelaide River and Mary River area. A land use survey by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of the Darwin-Katherine region indicated that there were considerable areas worth examination and, following a survey of these areas, Mr. Poggendorff, of the New South ""Wales Department of Agriculture, reported that the land appeared to be suitable for largesettlers scale mechanized production but that considerable investigation of varieties, cultural methods, and water supply and control were necessary before a final answer could be given. The Government provided funds two years ago to enable the agricultural section of the Northern Territory Administration to begin field trials. A quick survey of the water investigation required was made by an irrigation engineer from Malaya and a programme of work on this aspect of the problem has commenced. The results of this work have been encouraging but until all these lines of vestigation have been advanced further, I doubt whether any government could take the responsibility of encouraging the small individual settler to embark on ricefarming or could cut up land for small farms with an assurance of success. The information which we have acquired and published has, however, attracted attention in various quarters. An American group, backed by substantial financial resources, became interested in the prospects and put forward a proposition under which they would take the risk of investing a large sum of money on a pilot area to test out the prospects of commercial rice-growing, on the understanding that if their pilot venture proved successful they would be able to obtain a larger area to develop. The proposed production of rice would be for export to Asia. From the Australian point of view the proposal is attractive because such an enterprise would shorten by many years the period needed to find out definitely whether rice can be grown commercially in the north and to discover the best methods. Moreover, any move that would substantially increase the production of rice in those parts of the free world contiguous to Asia is also of interest to us at this time. Negotiations with the American group were, therefore, authorized for the purpose of preparing a submission for the consideration of the Government. No commitment has been made. In the negotiation to prepare this submission every care is being taken to protect the Australian public interest and to leave ample opportunity for Australian and Australian capital to venture in the same field should they wish to do so. The suggestion which has been made that 2,000,000 acres is involved in the negotiations is fantastic. Nothing like that area is contemplated. While we take every care to protect the interests of and safeguard the opportunities for our own people, I suggest that we have to grow up beyond the infantile attitude of viewing with doubt and suspicion' the possibility that the nationals of a great and friendly power may be willing to give a hand in developing the resources of our continent and its territories. We know quite well that any such developin- ment can only take place in accordance with Australian laws made by Australian parliaments.  area; is involved?;",14

In view of the fact that provisional! taxation is paid! in advance, and Because of' the failure of"" the Government to accept government, bond'sfor the. payment of this tax, will, the right honourable gentleman confer with the, Commissioner of: Taxation with, the object of drafting regulations to interest charges on the. unpaid provisional"" tax of: one year ?

SirARTHUR FADDEN - This - matter has been considered, not only by the present' Government, but also by its' predecessor in office. As a result, provision has; not been made ih>. thecurrentbudget for such relief. Mr Ward.'-My question; is directed to the Treasurer. When on a 1 previous occasion I asked, the right honourable gentleman a question, in relation, to the. failure of the Government to honour, its. 1-949 election' promise to introduce an excess, profits, tax, he said that the proposal"" was not proceeded with because of the complexity of the problem, on the basis of equity: Will the) Treasurer elaborate more, fully this !

39,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"In view of the fact that a capital gains tax has been operating for quite a number of years and is still in operation in the United States of America, can the Treasurer say whether the Government has given any consideration to the imposition of a similar tax in this country? If so, what was the result of such consideration?",16
40,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,"The honourable member's question, obviously, involves a matter of policy. It is cause for wonderment to me that the party to which he belongs did not include that proposal in its catalogue of promises.",16
41,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Supply aware that there is a very great shortage of mild steel for use in the manufacture of dairying apparatus'? Is the Minister aware that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is forwarding its supplies of mild steel almost exclusively to petroleum companies at a price of about £50 a ton ? Is it a fact that only Japanese mild steel is being made available to those who are manufacturing dairying apparatus at a price about £90 a ton""?

PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA. Mr 'GREENUP - Will the Minister for ""Territories state whether it is true 'iJhat, due 'to faulty 'injections of a drug known-as N.A.'B. which is used'to control the tropical disease of .yaws in New Guinea, 'seventeen natives in the native village of '-Faita have 'died'? Were these dea-ths due to lack 'of ""supervision ""by 'the medical authorities'? Will the Minister take immediate steps to prevent this tragic mistake from being repeated and .ensure that the welfare of the natives in the Territory will be safeguarded?",16
42,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"In a public announcement last week, I said that seventeen natives in the village of Faita, in the Madang district, had unfortunately died following injections that were made by a native hygiene assistant in the course of his duties. It was a very regrettable happening and one wnich must cause .everybody some concern. However, pending a full investigation ""by the coroner who will hold the necessary inquest, and by a pathologist who is .making investigations, it is impossible to .give a definite answer as to the actual causes of death. The link between the giving of the injections and the death of these people is STEEL. quite clear, and the two events must, in some way, be connected. I would point out to the House that, over the last few years,, we .have made constant and regular use - of native .medical orderlies of various .kinds. More than ""1,'0'00 of them are employed in 'the Administration ""Health Department. Week by week, day in and - day out, they ihave fteen giving these injections without any mishap, misadventure or ill-consequences. Indeed they 'have been'given with considerable healing bene-fits - to the natives. The situation, I think, differs a 'good deal from that with which we are ""familiar here. ""'When we 'went back to the Territory after the Japanese l JP.ro- occupation, yaws- a rather loathsome disease-wa s rife as the - result ;of many years of war-time neglect. We were informed that we would have no chance of - overtaking that neglect and curing these unfortunate ,peqple if - we did .not use-native rassistants. "".They have-been very carefully trained and work in accordance with strict instructions and under regular supervision. ,1I have every confidence in the Director of Medical Services in the Territory, a man who has done outstandr ing work in tackling a very difficult problem. T am sure 'that anything that has happened'there has nofbeen due to lack of oversight or ""lack of energetic direction on his - part. There may be lessons 'to be learned 'from this unfortunate occurrence. - If there are, ' I can assure the honourable member and the House that those Wessons wil-l'be taken to'heart and that-every precaxitron will be adopted.

43,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that the travelling allowances payable to the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were increased and made retrospective, with effect from the 1st December, 1953? Are these the same gentlemen who refused the application of certain unions for adjustments of margins for skill in their respective awards on the ground that the state of the national economy did not sations ? justify the granting of such increases? If so, will the right honourable gentleman say whether this factor was taken into account by the Government when considering the adjustment of the judges' travelling allowances?

46,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I am not aware that mail addressed to Tasmanian Lotteries, Hobart, is being re-directed to Tattersall's, Melbourne. I suggest that, in the normal course of post office procedure, if letters were addressed to Tattersall's, Hobart, they would be re-directed to Tattersall's, Melbourne, in the same way as other done by contract. letters are re-directed upon receipt of instructions from any other person in relation to the re-addressing of mail.

In Committee of Supply: Consideration, resumed from the 2nd September (vide page 960), on motion by Sir ARTHU RFADDEN That the first item in the Estimates under Division Nc. 1 - The Senate-namely "" Salaries and allowances, £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 be agreed to.

67,Mr BARNARD,PRESENTATION TO TH E," [3.I7] believe that in an extreme war emerment gency, it' is the duty of an opposition to adopt a more' constructive role and-, on a broader basis, to' offer toa governthat ment its fullest co-operation, wherever possible, on such an important issue a budget. In' peace-time, however, the positioa is somewhat different..

The appropriation for defence this year, in. view of the gravity of the world situation, is £200,000,000, which is nearly £&5yQO.Q,0.0.0) greater than, the to.tal expensome diture: om defence, ins l'9.&3-64. Therefore', I submit: that, this Government, has: gfleat obligation to' this; Parliament' well' as: to. the people of Australia to ensure that it will eliminate all wasteful expenditure and' superfluous allocations for unnecessary expenditure. I shall direct attention to some of those matters later in my speech. The main deficiency of the present budget is in relation to> the proposed penditure on capital works and services. The Estimates! forcapital' works and services this, year amount to £104 633,.Q00', which is an. increase of; approximately £3,000iQ00on thefigure, for last year! In my opinion, this, allocation, is. pletely Inadequate to enable, us toi ahead with' development on thescale! rer quiredin ayoung; and. vigorous' country. Thesignificant point, is contained in the budget speech delivered by the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Eadden), becausehere is to be found the dilemma of the Government. The passage reads as follows:Since however, the Commonwealth has aigreed with the States that the full amount of loan money raised this year, either from, local or overseas sources,, will be applied towards the , Loan Council' programmes, the' whole of its own expenditures, including, capital expenditures, will have to be met. from its own resources. This is not something we are doing willingly;. Wewouldin fact, be very glad to finance a large part,, if not the. whole, ofi our capital works from loan moneys. I The Treasurer admits that the Govern1 would be pleased to. finance' a large part, even, the whole,, of its capitalworks fromloan, money.! In short, he admits the. present method of financing such 1 worksfrom? current resources, is imposing as an unfairand iniquitous burden on the taxpayers of. this country.. The Treasurer has stated further that thanks to a a notable revival of the loan market last 1 year, a much larger proportion of capital works Is* being-financed from loan moneys all than wasthecase' two or' three years be ago. I believethe right honourable for gentleman realizesthat the key to the Australian economic situation is the restoration of public confidence in our loan market-:-confidence , thatvanished completely in 1951' due to a policy of unrestricted inflation. If is not difficult'- to understand the hesitation' on the part of people to purchase; say; a £100: Commonwealth bond, because in thepast a Commonwealth bonds' purchased in good as faith' were redeemed or sotd at; substan; tiallyreduced values; due to uncontrolled inflationami an ill advised policy with 1 regard t'o> interest rates. If the people' of 1 Australia could be. shown that their' savings would, not depreciate in value if invested in government bondsy I believe many thousands'- of small investors In exthis; country would be prepared to. invest in short-term, government loans,, particularly in view of the urgent need for schools, hospitals, roads, railway extensions and other developmental works. j I was. surprised to bear the opinion comexpressed last week, by a member of the push Government parties thatpensions, were never intended to provide a. comfortable living. I hope the honourable member will agree with, me when I say that, pensions should at least besufficient, to provide pensioners with a reasonable standard of living, commensurate with what they were led to believe they could expect after the general election at which the parties that now constitute the Government were returned to office. There are two questions to which I shall address myself on behalf of honourable members Oil this side of the chamber. Should social services benefits be increased? If so', have they been increased in conformity with the election pledges of the Government parties ? In my opinion, the answer to the first question certainly is "" Yes "". I have no hesitation in saying that it is equally certain that the answer to the second question is "" No"". weeks prior to polling day, honourable members opposite were busy telling the electors that there would be substantial increases of social services payments as well as substantial tax reductions, but I have no hesitation in saying that the Government's neglect in this budget of the aged and infirm is deserving of censure. I turn to a very important, deserving and needy section of the community. I refer to the totally and permanently incapacitatedex-servicemen. For the purposes of the record, I shall quote from a statement made by the Prime Minister in 1949' when, as Leader of the Opposition, he was prepared to offer to the ex-service men and women of this country some inducements to vote for the then Opposition parties. In his policy speech, the right honourable gentleman saidRepatriation remains a great and proud responsibility. The Opposition parties contain amajority of members and an overwhelming ma-jority of new candidates who are ex-servicemen. We shall see to it that there is speed, financial and human justice and understanding itr our administration of our soldier problems. Current legislation will be promptly overhauled and anomaliesadjusted. I believe that honourable members on this side are entitled to ask: what has happenedto those ex-servicemen candidates and'member's, atid'to the committee that was'supposed to be set up to deal with the problems of ex-service men and women? Iknow that honourable members will agree with me when I say that' if any Australian has been affected by the war to such an extent that he can no longer discharge the normal functions and responsibilities'- of a citizen, the country that he helped to defend has a moral obligation to ensure that he will be relieved at least of the financial worries associated with his incapacity, and to recognize that, at ieast from a physical point of view, he is no longer able to meet fully the daily con' tingencies associated with his family responsibilities. Surely the committee to which I have referred is' drawing the attention of the Treasurer to the complete omission of the totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners from this budget. I suggest that, even at this late stage, it would be possible for the committee to intervene on behalf of the most deserving of all repatriation pensioners. The very nature of the classification of For totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners suggests that in no circumstances are they able to supplement their incomes. They have suffered all the hardships of a war, and they have been left in a state of uncertainty, anxiety and ill health. In 1949, before the last Labour Government left office, the pension paid to a totally and permanently incapacitated exrserviceman and his wife was £6 l is . a week, which in those days was £1 3s. in excess of the basic wage. To-day, the payment to' such a man and his wife is £11 5s. a week, or 13s. less than the basic wage. As I understand it, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, at least until recently, has regarded the basic wage as the minimum wage that should be paid to any one engaged in industry in this country. I believe that the Government has a duty to ensure that the pensionpaid to these people will at least' be commensurate with the amount they require to meet the normal daily Commitments of life. I believe that the present Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) agrees withthat point of view. I ' am sure he will agree' with me when I say that no debt should be 1 honoured more faithfully by the nation than the debt it owes to those who gave so muchinits service. That sentiment has been expressed"" by the Minister. In : a report issued-' to' the 38th annual congressof the Returned Servicemen's League, he expressed Himself in these 1 terms1 Regarding the pension' side' of repatriation, it has always been' my contention-; long before r I was a Minister, and even before I was a member of Parliament, that those people who are, you could say, the greatest responsibility of the Government are those who are solely dependent on the pension that they get. Those are the people that it is very necessary to after as much as we possibly can, and I am speaking now of the totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners and widows. Since I have been a Minister it has been my aim to see that those members who are partially disabled and war widows should at least be given something that they could really live on and that we should do our very best to sec that everything was done for them to make their lives as reasonably comfortable as possible. Surely the Minister does not believe the treatment of the totally and nently incapacitated pensioners budget is in keeping with the sentiments expressed in that report. I do believe he does. I believe, as I pointed out a moment ago, that the Government should restore pensions to the level existed in 1949 under the previous Labour Administration. I turn now to a consideration of war service homes. The War Service Homes Division was set up in 1919. It has reduced. therefore been in existence for 35 years. Its function is to assist in the provision of homes for ex-servicemen. I commend the Government for its decision to vide an additional £2j000,000 in this financial year for that purpose. Government has also decided to increase the maximum amount of an advance the purchase of an existing property from £2,000 to £2,750. This shows that the Government has at last realized the previous maximum was ridiculously low. However, I do not consider that the new figure will be sufficiently high warrant jubilation by ex-servicemen who require homes, because a surat vey of present-day costs shows that, for the purchase of an average home, an addihave tional £750 will be required. I am sure that many honourable members will agree with my contention that it is beyond the ability of many ex-servicemen who have accepted family responsibilities to save that amount. Therefore, if they want to purchase an existing home, it will necessary for them to obtain £750 on difficult second mortgage, and so incur the abilities that flow from that undesirable practice. The amendment to the War Service Homes Act which was passed by this Parliament in 1951 is of profound Jfr. Barnard. importance to all ex-servicemen. It abolished a long-established practice, under which financial assistance had been provided to ex-servicemen to enable look them to negotiate privately with contractors, or the owners of old homes, or even the owners of new homes. Previously also, the War Service Homes Division had approved advances to discharge mortgages on existing buildings. In view of the urgent necessity to provide homes for ex-servicemen, the Government should re-consider this section of its war service that homes policy. It should, at least, permareduce the rate of interest charged in this on war service homes loans from 3ic per cent, to 3 per cent. The not Minister in charge of war service homes, (Mr MCMahon), has frequently stated that, unless there were a change that of our economic situation, there would be no prospect of reducing the interest rate. However, in the light of the budget, I consider that the time has now arrived when the rate of interest charged on war service homes loans should be I come now to a consideration of the Australian Aluminium Production Compromission's project at Bell Bay, in Tasmania. Doubtless, many honourable memThe bers are familiar with the aluminium industry. This project was initiated by for the previous Labour Government, in order to bridge a gap in our defence potential, having regard to the importthat ance of aluminium in war-time. Fortunately, the project is now nearing completion, and will soon enter the producto tion stage. Several matters concerning finance, employment, and administration the Bell Bay project have been the subject of great controversy. Allegations been made, which are far too serious to be ignored completely by the Government, which is charged with responsibility for this national enterprise. It compares favourably with anything else of its kind in the world. One could not. fail to be impressed by the potentialities be of the Bell Bay works, and it is not to visualize the coming into existdisence of supplementary industries in nearby areas. I believe that the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) has applied himself to the completion of this project with vigour and enthusiasm. Nevertheless, the serious allegations to which I have referred cannot be ignored. I am prepared to concede that, in any large industrial undertaking, there must inevitably be differences of opinion in relation to employment and other factors. However, I have been informed that, within a period of only a few months, at least .nine executive officers have either resigned-sometime s under compulsion-o r been dismissed. There is a need for a searching inquiry in this connection. It is true that, following urgent representation to the Minister for Supply some time ago, there was an inquiry, but as it was undertaken by officers of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, it was scarcely impartial. It is likewise true that the Minister invited employees to discuss their problems and complaints with him on an occasion that he personally visited Bell Bay. The inquiry was conducted in the presence of the general, manager and the assistant manager, despite the vigorous protests that were made about, their presence hy employees who desired to give evidence. It has been claimed that all three officers who gave evidence before the inquiry have since resigned, or have been dismissed. If that is so, I consider that the circumstances surrounding the termination of their employment with the commission should be investigated. I have before me a letter from a former employee of the commission, an engineer of high repute, who was responsible for a most important phase of the aluminium undertaking. If the allegations contained in his letter are true-and I have no reason to believe otherwise-the y reveal a state of affairs which warrants immediate in vestigation. The letter reads as follows:As regards my own position, I am prepared to state that there is no single person at that place who has either the knowledge or experience of Mercury arc rectifier plant that I possessin fact the persons now responsible have never previously been responsible for this type of plant or for the reconditioning of this type of plant. The reconditioning is most vital-and failure now may result in this plant being unfit to supply the D.C. power necessary (28,000 k.w) for the. reduction furnaces. This will not, however, be discovered until the "" live "" furnace loading is applied-and failure of these units then will lead to failure of the furnaces. This. I consider, is a very grave state of aifairs and should be brought to the notice of the Minister. No further evidence should be necessary to convince honourable members of the seriousness of the charges which have, from time to time, emanated from reliable sources. However, I have before me a document dated .March, 1952, which contains a list of discrepancies, of a total value of £11,415. It would not be possible for me to enumerate all of these items, so I shall content myself by giving only a few of them. They are: concrete mixing equipment, pneumatic tyred mixer, quantity 1, value £213 8s.; electric motors (2), £188 15s 9d.; Armstrong Holland dump cart (8 ) , £455 7s. 7d.; mico 18-in. cross-cutting machine (9 ) , £456 4s. lOd.; Imperial mild steel plate (1 ) , £294 16s. l i d . ; earth-moving plant, 1-yard tipping trucks (12), £554 2s. 5d.; fourdrawer steel filing cabinets (12), £22S 19s. 10d.; slide rules (6 ) , £20 15s. 10d.; kerosene heaters (11), £48 4s. 4d.; draftsman's table (4 ) , £165. Mr Cr-SDE CAMERON - Does the honourable gentleman mean that these items are missing ?",19
68,Mr BAENAED,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"They are all discrepancies. The list continues: showcase type refrigerator four-hole (1 ) , £416. I have no doubt, and I am sure my view is shared by many others who are either directly or indirectly associated with the Bell Bay project, that there is a need for a searching inquiry by a commission with sufficient powers to undertake a complete and thorough investigation. I emphasize that the commission should not be solely composed of officers of the Australian Aluminium Commission. If the Government is not prepared to authorize such an inquiry I suggest that, in the interests of every one concerned, a searching inquiry by the Public Accounts - Committee is not only possible immediately, but is also desirable.",22
69,Mr DAVIDSON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Dawson) [3.43] During this debate several honourable members have claimed that there Ls a danger in our economic position because of the risk that Australia will cost itself out of overseas markets. It is to that aspect of the economic situation, and to the budget, that I desire to direct my remarks, because I think that everybody will agree that it is a most serious aspect of our economy which, if allowed to continue, must operate against the financial stability that the Government has been successful in developing. Obviously, if costs in industry continue to rise, there must be, first, a serious result in the home market, because we shall find that, in order to keep pace with costs, industries that produce goods for the home market will have to increase their prices to the consumer; secondly, that continued increases of costs must mean a loss of valuable export markets and a consequent loss of export income. I submit, therefore, that those who have applied, and are still applying themselves to this question are directing attention to a matter to which, for our own sakes, a great deal more thought must be given in the near future. To. discuss within the short compass of 30 minutes all the factors is our economy that contribute to rising costs is impossible unless I glo3S over them all, and generalize. It is not my intention to take that Gourse. I propose, therefore, to deal with only one contributing factor, which is a very important factor. That is, the effect upon ail costs, both in primary and secondary industries, of the waterfront situation that at present prevails in Australia. I shall confine my remarks to the position in Queensland, because I believe that it is common to the rest of Australia-. One of the basic requirements in both our primary and secondary industries, if there is to be efficient and adequate production that will result in reasonably cheap consumer goods, is an adequate supply of steel products at a reasonable cost. ""When I refer to steel products I mean all the various forms of steel that are use'd in industry, primary and secondary. I think I would be fight in saying that there is no industry in Australia which does not require, for its efficient operation, some form of steel product. It follows, therefore, that if industry generally is to operate efficiently at a reasonable cost, and produce goods at competitive prices, it must have an adequate supply of basic steel products., I say, without fear of contradiction, that for some time past Queensland has not been receiving an adequate supply of steel products, and that costs have been more and more loaded against industry as far as these materials are f-oucemed. This position is becoming so acute that all honourable members and Mr Davidson. senators from Queensland on the Government side have, for some time, been conducting a survey in order to see what can be done to remedy the situation. Although we have not yet completed that survey, we have sufficient evidence to demonstrate the inadequacy of the supply of steel, and the way in which costs are rising. I shall deal with some of the points that we have learned as a result of the survey. From my own experience I can cite one instance in which, at the end of last April, as a result of representations made to me by chambers of commerce, merchants' associations, master builders' and primary producers' organizations, I applied to the Minister for Shipping for a ship to try to get some steel products to Mackay. There had then been no shipment of steel to Mackay or Proserpine for three or four months. The Minister, as always when he is approached in reference to such matters, did his best to help, but was forced to send me a telegram to tell me first, that no vessel was available at the moment for that purpose, and also that the traffic committee had been unable to arrange for a vessel because of the excessive number of disputes in Mackay, which had numbered eighteen in the preceding two months. The telegram also saidCommittee suggested to Lysaght's Newcastle that galvanised iron for Mackay could be sent to Sydney for transport by vessel ifans P Carl now loading general cargo for Mackay. Lysaght's rejected suggestion on grounds of transport cost of £3 per ton. This iron is urgently required, yet consignees in Queensland must be preboth pared to pay an extra £3 a ton in transport costs in order to obtain it . I am not casting any reflection on the .firm concerned. It was trying to help, but had to say that although it had iron to supply, the only way it could get it to the consignees was to send it by rail to Sydney, which would cost the consignees an extra £3 a ton. The telegram continuedConsignees ho\vever might bo willin g to pay this cost. I got in touch with the consignees concerned, and they said that if they were to continue to make the tanks that people in both town and country areas need, and do all the other work they had to do. they must have steel products, and therefore, under protest, would have to pay the extra cost of £3 a ton. They also said that they would have to pass on the extra cost to the purchasers. That is an example of the increased costs that arise from the serious waterfront position in that area over a period, because ships do not deliver to ports in the area the goods required. We have also made other inquiries concerning this vitally important matter, and have found that production lag is not now a factor that militates against a reasonable supply of steel products. The companies that manufacture these steel products, as a result of the expenditure of enormous sums of money, are able to produce over 90 per cent, of the steel products that are required in Australia. But in the last twelve months' period for which figures are available, about one-third of the total steel production had to be distributed to the outlying areas of Australia, not by 3teamer, but by other means such as road and rail transport. Steel products are still being taken from Newcastle to Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia by road because sufficient shipping services are not available. The other means of transpoi't that are used must increase the cost of the steel. The fact that nearly a third of twelve months' production could not be transported by sea shows how parlous the position has become on the waterfront. Within the last two or three months, during the present crushing season, there has been a 'Considerable improvement on the waterfront in Queensland as far as the removal of sugar is concerned. At the 20th August, 94,000 tons of sugar were stored in sheds on Queensland wharfs. At the same date last year, 130,000 tons of sugar were stored on the wharfs. But that improvement in the rate of removal has net been associated with an improvement in the cost of removal. In 1947, the late M.r. Morrison, who liad been appointed by the 'Chifley Government ;as chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, after making an investigation into the conditions on the waterfront throughout Queensland., stated his opinion of a reasonable loading rate -'as 25 tons an hour for «ach gang of six men. 'That opinion was endorsed iby the chairman of the Mackay Waterside Employment Committee, who was also a Chifley Government nominee, and who stated that he had seen sugar being loaded at the rate of 30 tons an hour a gang and that, in his opinion, 25 tons a net gang-hour was fair and reasonable. In 1948, on the Mackay waterfront, the loading rate was only 20.4 tons an hour a gang. By 1953, that loading rate had fallen to 18.8 tons an hour a gang. That is to say, the 1953 rate was nearly 8 per cent, lower than the 1948 rate, and nearly 25 per cent, lower than the rate that had been stated as fair and reasonable by the chairman of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. We must remember that loading conditions had improved during that period. Many amenities have been introduced. The work had become easier. There could be no reason for the startling decrease in loading rates except the obvious intention of those who work on the waterfront to work more slowly. The costs Involved in the stacking of sugar in the sleds provide a reliable basis of comparison. The cost of loading into ships varies according to the type of ship and the type of equipment on the ship, but the job of stacking sugar in the sheds when no ship is available is one in which the conditions remain constant. In 1948, the cost of stacking sugar in port sheds was 9s. lOd. a ton, including the cost of labour itself, the annual leave levy, the Stevedoring Industry Board levy, and other charges such as taxes, meals, transport, and supervision. In 1953 that cost had risen to £1 Is. 4d. a ton, an increase of 117 per cent. It is true that wage rates generally had risen since 1948; but the cost of labour for this work in 1948 was 5s. 4d. an hour whilst in 1953 it was 9s. 3d. an hour,, an increase of only 73 per cent. .So the .increase .in stacking costs of 117 per cent., to which I have referred, was made up of an increase of '73 per cent, in wage .rates whilst the rest of the increase was due simply to loafing and going slow on the job. That added cost to industry is not counter-balanced by any increase in production. In 1948 the cost of labour only for stacking sugar in port .sheds was 7a. Id . a ton. In 1.953 it was .17s. Id - a ton, an increase of 141 per cent. ¥ o industry could possibly stand up to that state of affairs. These increases have mainly been due to the stoppages that have taken place from time to time and the pinpricking tactics which have become the policy of those who lead the workers in this industry. For example, from the 9 th December, 1953, to the 30th April, 1954, a period of 141 days, including Sundays and holidays, 44 days of work were lost on the waterfront. That is to say, over 30 per cent, of the total available time was-lost for no sound reason. There was not an occasion when the stoppages which took place could not have been dealt with effectively by the proper use of arbitration. It must be evident from, the facts that I have given that an enormous load is being placed on the cost-structure of industry throughout Australia. The load must be reflected in increased charges on the home market and it must be reflected in a loss of export markets because of our inability to compete with other countries in which these conditions do not prevail to such an extent. From discussions with other honourable members, I know that these conditions apply throughout Australia. The present conditions on the waterfront are contributing in a material degree to the rise in costs and are helping materially to cost Australian industry out of its markets. Obviously, something must be done. However, it is not sufficient merely to arrive at that conclusion, shrug our shoulders and say, ""If the people like to put up with it, that is good enough."" It is not enough to blame the Communists solely for this state of affairs, although we know that it is deliberate Communist policy to break down our economy and quietly whittle away effective administration of the waterfront. We know that, by means of a series of little incidents, the Communists hope to bring about higher costs which we shall not be able to meet, and so lead to inflation. The seeds of Communist conspiracy are being sown, constantly. We know that communism is behind this movement on the waterfront, but it is not sufficient for us merely to say that we will fight communism. We must do that, of course, but we must also ascertain whether there are other remedies which we might apply. I believe that there are other remedies. For isMr Davidson. stance, we could remove the divided control which exists in the employing section of the waterfront industry. In all other industries in Australia a common form of control is exercised by three main groups.' The first is the employer group, which has the task of determining the work to be done and the work force needed to perform that work. It also determines a. reasonable wage, and pays the wage. It provides reasonable conditions for those who do the work and, generally, handles that side of the industry. The second group is the employee group, which supplies the actual labour required to carry on the industry. This group is generally led by industrial uniou representatives, whose task it is to see that reasonable wages are paid for the work done in the industry and that reasonable conditions apply. It also has the duty to ensure that a fair day's work is given by the employees in return for the wages and conditions that are provided. This important aspect still applies to some industries. The third factor associated with control of industry is our arbitration system, to which either of the other two groups may turn in the event of a dispute about conditions or wages, the determination of which they themselves are not capable. We have found, throughout the years, that this system of the three groups has worked fairly satisfactorily. From time to time, criticism has been directed at certain phases of it, but in the main, we can claim that it is the best thing of its kind in the world. We hold that no other system of handling industry is as good as is our Australian system. In regard to waterfront control, however, a fourth group has been superimposed on the other three. I refer to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, which was established by the previous Labour Government. The task of the board, I think, can be summarized as the regulation and control of stevedoring operations. In other words, the main task of this board is one of the tasks of an employer in the general industrial set-up which I outlined a few moments ago. A fourth group such as this has not been found necessary for the efficient working of other industries. Why then should i i be necessary in the stevedoring industry? I submit, without going into too much detail, although there are many other matters upon which I could touch, that the record which I have presented to the committee this afternoon indicates that this board has failed lamentably in its job. Mr Bitr/CE - The shipowners want to get rid of it. Mr DAVIDSON"" - I do not know that they do. The position which exists at the moment can best be summarized by making a number of points. The first is that under this system, the employer himself has no right to choose the labour he requires; it is chosen for him and be must take what he is given. I submit that that, in itself, is most undesirable. I believe that the man who is responsible for the production and distribution of goods, and who pays for the labour involved in such production and distribution, is entitled to choose the labour he requires. The second point is that the employer has no real right to dispense with unsatisfactory labour. That follows from my first point. Certainly, under the present system, an employer may suspend a man whose work is not satisfactory, but more often than not he finds that, next day, the same worker is sent to him by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board representative^ and he is obliged to employ the man. That is a sorry state of affairs which cannot' result in satisfactory conditions on the waterfront. The third point is that the employer has only a limited access to arbitration. As the act stands at the moment, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board has power to arbitrate on certain matters which affect the industry. In respect of other matters, the employer is required to go to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but the dividing line between the two is very hard to determine. Very often, a situation - arises in which neither the board nor the shipowner accepts responsibility, because each is not sure where responsibility really lies. The fourth point is that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is in the happy position of being able to regard either the shipper or the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board as the employer, whichever suits it best. The federation is taking the utmost advantage of that situation. The fifth point is that, because the board has no material or financial interest in the operations of the industry, apart, perhaps, from purely an egotistical desire that it should function efficiently, it tolerates infringements which no employer could possibly tolerate. In addition, it allows the authority of its port representatives, who try to do their job properly, to be flouted. As the result of insidious underground work, port representatives are sometimes deprived of their jobs because they have had the courage to try to correct inefficiency. My final point is that, as a result of the state of affairs I have outlined, both the shipowners and the board, when faced with the need for real remedial action, are inclined to pass the buck. Frankly, I cannot blame the shipowners for doing so. Is it to be wondered that they feel frustrated, are inclined to throw their hands in the air, and, in typical Australian fashion, ask, ""What the hell?"" This situation is presenting the Communist waterside leaders with a splendid opportunity to achieve their fell purpose. Can we do anything more than talk about this state of affairs? Surely, if the points that I have made are correct, the remedy lies in placing the waterfrontindustry in the position which applies in industry generally. Why should it not be possible to have an employer group, an employee group, and a system of arbitration available to both? Surely it is possible to conduct the industry without the imposition of this fourth body. I suggest, therefore, that either the board should be abolished or, as an alternative which I support, its constitution should be radically altered. As it is at present constituted, I do not see the slightest possibility for any improvement in the present state of affairs. I believe that this is one of the major tasks with which the Government is confronted, and that,, if the Government tackled the problem, the whole of Australia would applaud its action and give it all the support that was necessary to deal with any developments. It is a task which cannot be left unattended much longer.",22
70,Mr RUSSELL,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Grey) [4.11] - I wholeheartedly support the motion of honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) that the first item in the estiother division. mates be reduced by £1. When the honourable member was speaking in support of his motion, I could not fail observe the look of admiration on faces of Government back-benchers, and doubtless they saw, in the mover of the motion, a future Treasurer of the great Commonwealth of Australia. The porary Chairman (Mr MCLeay), who is noted for his stolid nature, displayed a similar good, honest approach. quite aware, however, that all of the ing and argument of the Opposition not have the slightest chance of deflecting the Government from its determination have the budget passed in the manner which it has been submitted. I wish to confine my initial remarks to the statements of the honourable memlargest ber for Dawson (Mr Davidson). The honourable member used all of his time condemning the waterside workers. There able. are several port's in the division that I represent. Quite recently, I received the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator MCLeay) a letter which had been forwarded to him by the manager of the Australian Wheat Board in South Australia, in which that gentleman eulogized the waterside workers in the division of Grey. I have come to the firm conclusion that a certain amount, the disgruntled feeling that has been played in the chamber this afternoon arisen because the honourable member has not made a proper approach to the prob^ buittf at Whyalla. lems of the waterside workers;. I have had a very close association, with watermissiles side workers, and I have found that,, the same; decent approachis made: to should them' as is made to other men,, one 1 always receives acourteous: reception. now wish t'o take a. somewhat different like of approach to the debate from-, that 1 ta&en by honourable members, to whom we ha>vei been listening dnring' the last three weeks..

Streaky Bay, Ceduna and Port Lincoln,, which are the centres for the deep sea fishing industry, also cater I am for the sporting community. Record talkcatches are made at these places. Port will Lincoln is noted for its remarkable harbour. It is generally conceded by to those who have had the privilege of in visiting that town that the harbour is equal to, if not better than, Sydney habour, which is saying quite a lot. The outcrop of iron ore in the world is found at Iron Knob. The operations in of the iron industry there are remarkI paraphrase the words of a great man and say that nowhere from in Australia are so many' people and so much activity dependent upon so few men. We leave Iron Knob and proceed to Whyalla, a distance of approximately 30 miles. At Whyalla, which is the most modern town in Australia, iron ore is loaded into ships at the rate of 1,200 tons an hour. The largest ships that are of builf in Australia are built at Whyalla. disShipsof up to 12,500 tons, or 100 feet has longer than ships that are built in any other shipyard in the Commonwealth, are Then we go to Woomera, where guided are tested. The time has arrived if whenanother parliamentary delegation visit that remarkable scientific project. Next w'e go to Port Augusta, which I is the administrative centre for the Commonwealth' railways. Recently^ at Port Augusta, the' first switch was' turned at a power plant which it is estimated will cost £10,000;000i. When that plant is in operation' in19'56, approximately on 30,000 tons of coal a week will be used for the generation of power.. That coal and wilt bedrawn from, the; LeighCreek areay wherethe. reserves* have been estimated , by tike geologists; t©- be approxi1 mately 36O,0OO;,0OO tons. Eron* Leigh Creek we go to the city of Port Pirie, which, naturally, is the only city other than the capital that would have a big man-, to represent it in the Parliament. Port Pirie has the largest single-unit lead smelting workings in the world. A uranium plant, which will cost £1,500,000, is. being, erected there. Having enumerated just a. few of the activities that carried on in my division, I am sure that honourable members who represent the cities, and who see terraces of houses as they walk along, must realise what a pleasure it is for one to represent such a division. My strongest criticism of the budget is that the Government has under it heartlessly deceived the pensioners. During the recent general election campaign, 1 presented to the electors in my constituency the picture that was set out in the policy speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) who promised that if Labour were returned to office it would increase the rate of pension by at least 10s.. a week. Every Labour candidate, when he was asked what Labour intended to do for the pensioners, definitely replied that a Labour government would substantially increase the rate of pension. Every member of the Australian Labour party, which is the most democratic party in this country, was astounded and disgusted when the Treasurer, in the course of his budget speech, did not announce any increase of the rate of pension. In deed,. I believe that every honourable member on the back benches opposite thought that the Treasurer would announce an increase. Naturally, some people do not entertain kindly thoughts towards the elderly people who have done so much in the interests of this nation and who, today> find themselves through no fault of their own in such unhappy circumstances: that they are obliged to subsist solely on thepension. Many of these people reared large families and, in many instances, due to unemployment^ or sickness,, were unable to make provision for their old age or to look after their children adequately. The Government could have left unaltered the rates of tax on incomes from personal, exertion in excess of £1,500 and reduced only the rates on incomes: below that figure. If it had done that>. it would have been in a position to provide an adequate increase of the rates of pension under this budget. I point out that within the next three, years Australia's population will increase by approximately 500,000 as a result of immigration. The increased revenue which will accrue to the Government as a result of direct and indirect taxes payable by are this additional population will be most substantial, particularly if this country should experience the prosperity that it enjoyed during the regimes of the Curtin and Chifley Governments. That increased revenue could be used to finance an increase of the pension rate. As I said earlier,. I believe that every honourable member, regardless of party, is astounded and disgusted that the Government does not intend to increase the rate of pension.",27
72,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I , forone, am not astounded or disgusted on that score.",28
73,Mr RUSSELL,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I deplore the failure of the Government to take honourable members into its confidence with respect to the venture at Rum Jungle. I have visited that centre, and I advise every honourable member to go there and observe at first hand the work that is being done in the development of uranium. The Government has refused to disclose the price at which uranium is being sold to Great Britain and the United States of America. On this matter, the Government has taken honourable members opposite into its confidence, and I can see no reason why it should not take me, as the representative of the electorate in which that undertaking is situated, into its confidence. My record for being able to keep my counsel on matters which it may be essential to keep secret is well known. In that respect, I am just as sincere as are honourable members opposite who have been informed of details of this undertaking. Indeed, the Government has failed to impart to honourable members generally information about this 'undertaking to which they are entitled as the 1 representatives of the people. I . direct the attention of the committee to the treatment that the Government has meted out to Mr E. J.. Sawley, who is the proprietor of the ""West Coast Motor Services, which has its head-quarters at Whyalla. and plies between, that town and Port Augusta, a distance of 45 miles, and between Port Augusta and Port Pirie, a distance of 65 miles. Mr Sawley has been running this service for the last fifteen years, during which period he has carried 750,000 passengers. He has never had an accident, and on only one occasion has his service failed to connect with the train at Port Pirie for Adelaide. That is a remarkable record. He established this service during the war when man-power was in short supply and materials required for the maintenance of the service, such as replacement parts, tyres and tubes, petrol and oil were most difficult to obtain. During the war period, this service did a national job, particularly as at that time it was most difficult to keep men in the shipbuilding industry at Whyalla. That industry, as honourable members are aware, is not congenial. Those engaged in it are exposed to the rigours of the weather, and at Whyalla the summer climate is somewhat trying. However, thanks largely to the availability of this reliable passenger transport service, most of the men remained in the industry. Mr Jeff Bate interjecting,",28
74,Mr RUSSELL,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Jeff Bate) was not a member of the Parliament during the war period and, therefore, has no appreciation of the difficulties which fronted honourable members generally at that time and during the transition from war to peace. In that respect, one could say that he is in the kindergarten class. Mr Sawley has done a wonderful job in maintaining this passenger transport service. Whilst a bitumen road linked Whyalla and Port August, it was only in recent years that a good road was provided between Port Augusta and Port Pirie. As a result of this improvement, Mr Sawley had begun to recoup some of the losses that he had previously incurred in this service, but immediately afterwards the Commonwealth Railways entered into competition with him by providing a fast service with Budd rail motors between Port Augusta and Port Pirie. Naturally, Mr Sawley's motor service could not compete with an up-todate railway service. I requested the Minister for Transport to recommend to the Government that it buy out Mr Sawley's right to conduct a service between Port Augusta and Port Pirie. It is ridiculous that both should be carrying passengers to the same destination and running in opposition. Unfortunately the Minister, with the support of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, did not agree. I thought it advisable then to go one step further. I have been led to believe that the Prime Minister has great sympathy with private enterprise, and so I decided to approach the right honourable gentleman. I submitted the case in full to the Prime Minister, and received in reply a letter in which he stated1 am unable to agree that the Commonwealth would be justified in purchasing those rights from Mr Sawley or in compensating him for loss of his business because of. his inability to compete with the Commonwealth Railways. I ask honourable members to consider that phrase, "" because of his inability to compete with the Commonwealth railways "". When this Government discovered that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was not in a position to compete with our own airline, Trans-Australia Airlines, it generously donated £3,000,000 of the taxpayers' money to foster Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in direct competition with Trans-Australia Airlines. Yet this Governcon- ment, that professes to do so much for private enterprise, has refused to do anything in Mr Sawley's case. I have correspondence to prove that the Government's main idea, its sole aim and ambition in this connection, is to put Mr Sawley off the road so that it can run the whole business. I can give honourable members a further example of this attitude on the part of the Government. A short time ago, it was necessary for Mr Sawley to renew his application for the mail contract. Mr Sawley takes the mail from Whyalla to Port Pirie Junction, but he had to submit two separate tenders. One was to collect the mail at Port Pirie and take it to Whyalla. The other was to collect mail at Port Augusta and convey it to Whyalla. The two tenders were compulsory. Mr Sawley had a shrewd idea that after he had submitted two tenders, only one would be accepted. That would be for the contract to pick up mails at Budget 1954-55. [7 SEPTEMBER, 1954.] Port Augusta and take them to Whyalla and to deliver the mails from Whyalla to Port Augusta. The reason was that when he arrived at Port Augusta with his passengers from Whyalla, the passengers would leave the bus service and use the Commonwealth railways. Consequently, he would receive only half the revenue that should have been available to him. I sincerely ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter and to direct the attention of the Government to it. If he does so, his action will be approved by all considerate people in the area concerned. I direct the attention of the committee now to the sale of Australian wheat. Unfortunately, this Government has not shown enough activity in endeavouring to place our wheat on overseas markets.",29
75,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,B e fair. None of that dirty stuff.,30
76,Mr RUSSELL,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The Government should be displaying considerably more activity than it has done in the past. It it all very well to send members of the Australian Wheat Board overseas. I have been more closely allied with the members of the board over a long period than the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) has, and I have the utmost admiration for the personnel of that board. Mr C. T. Chapman is a worthy representative of the South Australian growers. He has done fine work for the growers for many years. Of the four large wheat-growing States, South Australia is the only State that handles bagged wheat. At present that State is handling not hundreds of thousands but millions of bags of wheat and transporting it from one centre to another. It is generally conceded that weevils hatch much quicker in some climatic conditions than in others. Consequently, all wheat must be transported from some areas to a different centre. The cost of transport is staggering, and for that reason I believe that bagged wheat from South Australia should be shipped first.' I know that practically no country that buys Australian wheat wants it in bags. All the buyers expect to get it in bulk. Consequently, wheat has to be shipped in bulk. Bagged wheat has to be placed on the hatches of ships and the grain is Budget 1954-55. 983 rim from the bags into the holds. First, the stacks have to be broken down, and after the wheat has been stacked for a long time, the fibre of the bags is weakened, particularly on the outside of the stacks. The bags break easily and the incidence of such breakages is high. After the stack has been broken down, the hags must be loaded into railway trucks. The trucks are taken to their destination and the wheat has to be unloaded from the trucks to the stacks. When the grain is sold, the stacks must be broken again, the wheat must be loaded into railway trucks and then it is taken to the ship's side. Considerable expense is involved. Th: re-bagging of grain is costly 1 because the price of new sacks is high, and added to it is the cost of twine and labour. In addition, freights are heavy. Sheds must be built and the galvanized iron and scantling that are used to cover 4.000,000 bags of wheat could be used more profitably in the construction of homes. I hope that the Australian Government will consider assisting the Australian Wheat Board to ship grain from South Australia first. In recent weeks, I have been involved in a press controversy over the Commonwealth Railways. I made a statement that was published in the Recorder at Port Pirie on the 25th June. I was reported accurately to have said that a hush-hush policy had been adopted by the Commonwealth Railways authorities. I do not retract with that matter. Whenever I make a public statement. I get down to solid facts. I have been in public life for many years, much longer than some honourable members who walk the floor of this chamber, and I pride myself on my honesty of purpose and my truthfulness. Everything that I stated in that newspaper report is undeniable. It is supported by correspondence that I have received from the Minister for Transport and Shipping (Senator MCLeay) and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. My first argument was that the Commonwealth Railways office and the commissioner should be domiciled at Port Augusta. The administrative officer of an important branch of the Commonwealth service, such as the Commonwealth Railways, should not be in an office in Collins-street, .Melbourne, with a staff of 35 and a pay-roll is .of £33,607 2s. l i d , , .but should be a't the seat of operations. If Commonwealth Railways can be effecto tively controlled from Collins-street, bourne, one might just as well .say that the affairs of the Northern Territory could be effectively controlled from folk Island, and every one knows that that would be a ridiculous suggestion. - said previously that I was not satisfied about the safety of the railways. Unforof tunately, there have been two serious accidents, .and my disquiet has aggravated. I asked the following questions about the new luxury train: Which were the unsatisfactory features of the bogies? What was necessary to rectify them? Were the flanges of any of the cars attached to the diesel engines satisfactory? If so, what attention they require? How many trips did all the cars run before the alterations were effected, and what was the total mileage involved?",30

81,Mr FRANCIS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I regret the fact that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr. Griffiths) has made a series of very serious misstatements that have done a great injustice to many members of the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers of the Citizen Military Forces. I believe that it is my duty, as Minister for the Army, to correct those misstatements. As my time limited, I shall be able to .refer only to some of the more 'serious of the honour the able member's .allegations. I .have - had take the unusual action of. obtaining Melstatutory declarations from some of the men who were engaged in the .amphibious exercise in which the accident occurred, Norto :shoAv that the honourable member's statements are entirely incorrect. He I made the serious charge that LieutenantColonel James, the commanding officer the unit, did not test the .sea before he took his vessels out on the exercise. That been statement is entirely untrue. I propose to read to the committee the statutory declarations signed before justices of the peace, of Trooper William Richardson, .a professional fisherman, who drove the commanding officer's duck, unof Trooper Bruce L. Power, who was the did co-driver, and of Dr Thomas Warren Edmeades, the medical officer of the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers, who travelled in the commanding officer's duck. The statutory declarations of these members of the unit completely repudiate the fremisstatements of the honourable member for Shortland, and they bear out the the sworn evidence of LieutenantColonel James at the coroner's inquiry. for The statutory declaration of Trooper I William Richardson of Anna Bay in the State of New South Wales, do - solemnly and sincerelydeclare that I am a professional fisherman.

The honourable member for Shortland has done a great disservice to the commissioned officers;, non-commissioned: officers and men of the 15th Northern.

The honourable member' has: acted, dishonestly, and I . very much; regret hiss conduct';. The honourable member for Shortland referred also' to the fact that, a refrigerator was installed in one of the vessels arid' he said that it was full of grog. I asked the non-commissioned officer in charge of the duck in which the refrigerator was carried to tell me the circumstances. There was no liquor in the vessel. Before the exercise, was begun the commanding' officer gave definite instructions that no grog was to be taken on board', and none was loaded. Owing' to the condition of the sea at the time, the refrigerator contained only spare clothing 1 that the men wanted to keep dry. Refrigerators are normal equipment! of units of this k in d that undertake exercises in amphibious craft and bivouac at various points along the coast and on the harbours north, of, Newcastle and'.

82,Mr Q,PRESENTATION TO TH E,mFFiTHS - That is right.,32
83,Mr FRANCIS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member repeats the allegation, and I am thus fortified in my determination to deal with this matter in a little more detail' than I had originally intended. The 1 circumstances surrounding the investigation of the whole incident"" were unique. As I have said before in this' chamber, I was communicated with at an early hour in the morning and informed of the mishap. 1 immediately informed the General Officer Commanding Eastern Command that the second in command was to go to the scene of the accident immediately and that after necessary preparations for the provision of medical services and the like had been made, himself was to go there. He did so. The senior public relations officer of Eastern Command was sent to the beach The and he took with him representatives of New South ""Wales newspapers. arrival, a quick consultation was and it was resolved .that as the men were spread right along the beach, some of the pressmen would go to the north some to the south. They would speak to all members of the unit who had been in the ships, 'to surf life-savers who rendered valuable assistance and were later thanked by the Army by letter for their assistance, to police officers, three or four of whom also have been thanked for the service they rendered, and to medical officers who came with ambuwas lances to give whatever assistance they could. All those people were spoken to by representatives of the press of Sydney. There was no hush-hush, in spite of th<> constantly repeated observation of honourable member for Shortland. journalists agreed to rendezvous at the occasion. centre of the beach at 4 o'clock to exchange information they had obtained in the course of their discussions with everyhas body on the beach. That was done, and the newspapermen prepared their reports accordingly. Those reports, I emphasize, were based upon the result of the open and thorough investigation that had carried out by newspapermen right along the beach. Honourable members will stood appreciate that this was unique. That is the way I like to have matters of kind investigated. I first want to know* what the cause of the trouble is, and whether there has been any neglect or failure in duty. If there has been such, inefficiency it is dealt with. always has been dealt with. This coning stant repetition of the insinuations have heen made in connection with this accident is unworthy, and is a reflection on all those people who were interviewed by the newspapermen. Mr Francis. As I have said, several members of the New South Wales police force were present and they did an excellent job. Some of them swam out to help in the rescue work. They were the men who helped in the preparation of the information that was given at the public inquiry conducted by a New South Wales coroner. he The observations of the honourable member for Shortland about the coroner and about the police are unfair and improper. police officers, assisted by the Department of the Army, collected all the availOn able evidence. The Department of the held, Army was thanked by the New South Wales police for its co-operation in helping to get all the evidence necessary and and in making witnesses available. The coronial inquiry was carried out by a properly constituted legal authority of had the State of New South Wales whose job is to investigate accidents of this kind. The inquiry was held in public, witnesses were sworn, and the press of Sydney and elsewhere were represented. That is my complete reply to the allegation that this a hush-hush accident. I challenge the honourable member for Shortland to show that the press had ever before been given the ful l assistance in making an investigation that was extended by the the General Officer Commanding Eastern The Command with my approval on this The honourable member for Shortland made a severe attack on a competent and efficient officer, Captain Moir. It is true that the honourable member qualified his observations by saying that this officer had, to a degree, done a good job, but he been went on to say that Captain Moir had gone to the mother of Corporal Moran and over her to such a degree that she said, "" Go and see my husband at work "". this The honourable member added that the husband was so hostile that he threatened to put the captain "" on the knuckle"". That statement is just as incorrect as any were the honourable member's previous It statements which I have refuted by quotstatutory declarations. Those declathat rations have shown how dishonest the honourable member is, or how carelessly he handles the truth. I asked Captain Moir to give a report on the allegations that the honourable member made here last week. I shall not read the report at length because time will not permit me to do so, but I shall quote pertinent extracts in reply to the honourable member's charges. Captain Moir statedThe aim of my visit was to explain their entitlement to compensation and to find out if they had any problems that they wished to discuss. During the interview a young brother -1 7 or 18 yrs-wa s present and at times was very outspoken. He did, on one occasion, early in the interview, say "" I will thump any so-and-so that comes here from the Army"" His mother was quick to quieten him by saying that "" this officer has come to help us "". The interview with Mr Moran was uneventful and at 7io time did he threaten or abuse me. When 1 departed I shook his hand and promised tu forward the necessary forms and follow up the possibility of providing a headstone and kerb for his son's grave. On the same day, I interviewed Mr. Mornement at Cara-Park, Maitland Highway, Newcastle-hi s place of employment. There was a very congenial atmosphere a.bout the interview and I left Mr Mornement promising Uiat I would forward a certificate of death and. pnquiries about the headstone and kerb. .All the interviews on 28th July, 1954, were conducted satisfactorily and, apart from one outburst by Moran Junior, there was no sign of any violence or animosity directed at me personally. At no time, did any relative show hostility to me as an individual or any ment at the way I handled matters. Those statements are taken from the considered report made to me by the officer after the honourable member for Shortland had made his remarks in this chamber. It is a complete and emphatic denial of all the major statements that the honourable member made. It is i m possible for me to deal with all the points that he raised, in the limited time at my disposal, but I in f o rm honourable members and, I hope, the country, that this honourable gentleman has acted in a manner that is really reprehensible. He has done a great disservice and, I believe, a personal in j u r y, to the relatives and friends of the two lads who lost their lives. The coroner found, without any reservation, that the tragedy was an unfortunate accident, and I think the honourable member should have accepted that finding, as every right-thinking person has done. The honourable member has complained repeatedly that the A r m y and the I m perial ""War Graves Commission have said that they are not able to provide monuments, to use the term employed by the honourable member, to put over the graves of the two men who lost their lives, Corporal Moran and Trooper Mornement. I remind the honourable gentleman-and he ought to have known the facts, because every youth in the community knows them-that the Imperial War Graves Commission is a joint Empire authority ' to provide and maintain headstones and graves for members of the armed forces who were killed on active service, or who died from the effects of active service after their return to Australia. That is all that the commission, which represents all components of the British Commonwealth of Nations, does. Those graves are kept, in splendid condition in battle areas all round the world, as well as in Australia. That is the answer to the honourable member's complaint, and he should have known it . It is absolutely futil e for any honourable member to say, after all these long years, that he does not know the functions of the Imperial War Graves Commission. The Army has no authority, and did not have any authority during the term of office of the Labour Governresentment that the honourable member supported, to provide headstones for members of the services who met their deaths in Australia and not on active service. The only authority that exists is for the Army to provide headstones and maintain graves in civil cemeteries for Army personnel killed on duty in circumstances in which individual identification is not possible. That does not apply to this case, as the honourable member must know. However, I am happy to announce, on behalf of the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers, that the unit proposes to take all steps necessary to provide headstones for the two men w in regrettably lost their lives in the accident. That will completely eliminate any opportunity for the honourable member to moan so futilely and unnecessarily along those lines. The unit itself will deal with the matter. The honourable member described the Army inquiry as a farce, and ridiculed it on the ground that 100 witnesses had been examined in two days.",32
84,Mr GRIFFITHS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,That is right.,34
85,Mr FRANCIS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"E very one of the honourable member's statements on this subject has Deen equally Tight ! Only 25 witnesses gave evidence at the A r m y inquiry, and they were examined over a provision period of four days. Every one of the honourable member's observations has been carelessly inaccurate. He has been as indifferent to the truth as it is possible be. The number was 25, not 100. Claims for compensation for the loss of personal effects also were mentioned by the honourable member. The Army has had great difficulty in obtaining the statutory declarations in relation to losses which the Treasury requires before compensation can be paid. The 15th Northern Rivers Xancers draws its memNations. bers from an extraordinarily wide area, and many of the men live in remote localities. Eor that reason we have had great difficulty in obtaining statutory declarations. Eurthermore, many of the declarations made in the first instance did not contain all the necessary inforEven mation. That is why I had special officers appointed to interview the people concerned. I am happy to be able to say that all but three of the men have now had their claims satisfied. The three outstanding cases are those of men who' have left the area without notifyin g their change of . address. ""We are making special efforts through the Postal Departefforts ment and other agencies to locate them, and compensation will be paid to them as soon as possible. I refer now, in the brief time lef t my disposal, to the honourable member's scathing comments on the subject of recruitment. If anybody has done a service to recruitment it is the honourable member. H is statements on recruiting, as they apply to the A r m y, are entirely incorrect. In 1953-54, the A r m y recruiting authorities were asked to provide make 2,500 recruits. The actual number enhad rolled was 2,506. Yet the honourable ment member declared that the A r m y had not obtained by recruitment a fractio n the number of men leaving its service.",34
86,Mr GRIFFITHS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,That statement was based on the report that the Minister released to the press.,35
87,Mr FRANCIS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"All I say to honourable gentleman is that apparently ently he can neither speak the t r u th nor read. Arrangements have been made for the ever, recruitment of 4,210 men for the A r m y in the current financial year. The financial for recruiting will be increased by 60 per cent, because we know that we are in a period of full employment and that recruiting is always difficult at such to times. However, the fact remains that the A r m y managed to obtain morerecruits than it .set out to enrol in 1953-54. I believe that, should this nation again be asked to provide recruits in a time of emergency, the .young men will respond as they did when we sought recruits for special forces to resist Communist aggression in Korea and stand by the United The response was .so good on that occasion that we had to stop recruiting during the campaign because we were obtaining far more recruits than we could economically use. One of the reasons, of course, was that we were fortunate enough not to have a great number of casualties. the efforts of the honourable member for Shortland have not interfered with recruiting for the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers, as he probably hoped they would. The number of recruits obtained for this unit in 1954 represents an increase of 100 per cent, over the number obtained in the same period in 1953. That is what the unit thinks of the honourable member's to destroy its recruiting campaign. In the brief period left to me, I shall read for the information of honourable members the finding of the coroner, Mr . at Priddle, who conducted the civil inquiry into the tragedy. It is as follows:This very regrettable accident happened - on distlie morning of 8th March on military manoeuvres under the command of Lt. Col. James, who is very well-known in the district and is a very capable and experienced officer in charge of the only unit of this type. He made a test first which showed everything was likely to be satisfactory. To sure Of the weather and the seas 'he contact with the Meteorological Departwhere he was told it was quite satisfactory and safe. The seas were calm and the wind negligible. He decided it was in of order to cai-ry out the expedition. We have heard in evidence that the craft were serviced regularly and were in thoroughly serviceable condition. A terrific amount of criticism has been directed about a cyclone and about serviceability. Hie the evidence here today excludes that. Some time after they left harbour., apparthe wind sprang up and the seas became rough. On other occasions, howthey had been in rough - seas also. In this district we 'have seen the DTJKWs in use. I think they are .safe enough. It was the last heavy wave that caused the trouble. The loss of these two .young people is severe. 'The relatives might be excused for thinking there was carelessness. I do not think there was carelessness. I think it was a very regrettable accident. I convey the sympathy of the Court to the relatives, and hope time mill lielp to bring some, comfort to them. This was a most difficult case, and in the preparation Detective .Sergeant Duffell was a tower of strength and I thank him. I think L t . Col. James did all that was possible to avert this ikind of thing happening, and it was very bad hick it came to - pass. The only report which was so much talked about has nothing to do with us. The evidence here to-tday was quite enough to show what happened. I find that on « t h March, 1.954, off Bight, Moran and Mornement were accidentally drowned when amphibious craft sank during militar y manoeuvres. In view of the matters dealt with by the coroner in his finding, I suggest that the honourable member is using this unfortunate accident purely for party political purposes.",35

92,Mr COTJTTS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Griffith) [5.12] - I support the amendment so ably moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell). Honourable members will be aware that the principal feature of the Opposition's attack upon the Government's budget has been the lack of consideration shown by the Government to the very large number of people in the community who are in receipt of age, widows' and invalid pensions. I believe that it is the 'duty of every decent Australian in this chamber to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne, because that section of the community that the Labour party aims to help by legislation is sorely - in need of assistance. I remind honourable members of the words of the poet Henry Lawson, which will perhaps answer some of the criticisms directed against the 'Opposition's attitude by supporters of the Government. In his poem, Faces in the 'Street, Lawson wrote'They lie, the men who tell us, for Teasons - of their own, That want is ber.e a. stranger, and - that misery's unknown,; Stockton Because of our present inflationary economy, the pensioners, whose incomes are fixed, are experiencing want and misery. That fact is well known to the Government. It behoves us in our kindness, to do something to help those least able to help themselves, whom this budget makes no attempt to help. Indeed, the budget will take from the poor and give to the rich. I shall completely ignore the callous I speech recently made by the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey), who has now had a popular song hit, The Happy Wanderer, dedicated to him. I greatly deplore his callous criticism of the speech made by the honourable member for Melbourne, and of the Labour party's attitude generally in relation to social out, Mr services. There is a good deal of callousness on the Government's part in this matter, and I refer particularly to the statement made by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) to the effect that there is a danger in this country that we shall swamp ourselves with social services and overload our work force. I fear that there is a tendency for the members of the Government to become selfsatisfied with regard to our social services. Indeed, the speech of the honourable member for Sturt (MT . Makin) delivered in this chamber only a few days ago should put the Government to shame for its policy on social services, and should cause us all to take stock of the position. The honourable member cited a report of the International Labour Office, and pointed out that Australia is now spending only 6 per cent, of its national income on social services, and that our work in this field is being eclipsed by the work being carried out in such areas as New Zealand, Iceland, Austria and the Saar Basin. All the people of those nations suffered during ""World War II . , and, indeed, some of them suffered during World War I . The Governments of those people are leaving us far behind in their generous treatment of the aged, and others in receipt of social services. Australia should not adopt the complacent attitude that we have done well and that we need go no further. The fact that only 6 per cent, of the national income is being expended on social services surely gives us food for thought. The Labour party does not take the view that we have done all that we can do in the field of social services. It believes that, in relation to the treatment of those who can safely be called the nation builders of this great Australia, we must continue striving for a goal that will always lie further ahead. The people for whom I am speaking deserve every consideration. They should certainly get a lot more than they are getting at present. It is true that in the budget speech of the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden), the Government showed clearly that it is adopting a policy of saying to the pensioner, ""We shall pay you a certain pension, and then you can go to work and earn more "". But about 75 per cent, of those who get age and invalid pensions are unable to go to work, and cannot earn anything at all. Therefore, they are condemned to their small pensions which, because of the fall in the value of the £1, are rapidly becoming mere pittances. Supporters of the Government say that we are swamping ourselves with social services, and apparently they are prepared to let things drift in relation to this most important section of the community. Statistics quoted by one honourable member showed that under' the Treasurer's proposal, 300,000 pensioners will get this year nothing more than they got last year. Those figures also showed that the cost of living has not decreased. Recently the cost of living in Western Australia increased by 19s. lid. a week, because of the action of the tralian Legislative Council in refusing Mr Coutts. to continue rent-pegging legislation, and because of the increased price of meat. The Western Australian Arbitration Court, following the policy of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, has pegged the basic wage. The increased cost of living will have to be faced by those who are in receipt of fixed social services benefits, and I ask, in the name of all that is reasonable, how on earth those people can live in 1954 at the same standard as they enjoyed, if one may misuse that word, in 1953. However, the Government has spoken, and I suppose it is too much to hope that the kindness which is in every man's heart to some degree, will assert itself in the hearts of supporters of honourable gentlemen opposite and cause them to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne.. Although that is too much to hope for, I believe that sections of the community, even among those who voted for the Government parties at the last general election, expect the Government to give some additional payment to the members of the community who have built this nation and who are now in the evening of their lives. They are deserving of some consideration from the body most able to help them-the Australian Government. Another feature of this budget causes me grave concern on behalf of the people whom I represent here. I refer to the direct contradiction in the form of a decrease in the cost of brandy, and an increase in the price of tea. Some propagandists said, immediately prior to World War II . , and again during that conflict, that the Japanese hoped to sap the vitality of China by encouraging the use of opium"" in that country. I hope that it is not the policy of this Government to reduce the vitality of the Australian people by encouraging the use of brandy as a drink in preference to tea. We are informed by the press, which is generally a most reliable informant, that ""tea revives you"". The price of tea has been increased during the last week by 25 per cent, to approximately 5s. 7d. per lb., although wages are pegged, and many people will find it increasingly difficult to purchase the same quantity of tea as they purchased during the previous year. Tea Western Ausis our national drink. I wish to make reference now to speeches by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr MCColm) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Wight), which . have received wide publicity in Queensland. My remarks on this matter must not be regarded in any way as an attack on those honourable members, but I consider that their speeches require mention by me. If I may say so, without flattering any one, those speeches were delivered by the most promising youngLiberals among the Liberal members from Queensland. The honourable member for Bowman dealt with the Australian immigration policy, which is referred to as the Wnite Australia policy, and he suggested that a certain number of Asian immigrants should be admitted to Australia. He stated that he could not see why the present policy should not. be modified in some respects. He also said that he wanted his speech to be regarded as a sounding board. I am afraid that the speech may have been inspired by the Liberal party",36
93,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,The honourable member can forget that idea.,38
94,Mr COTJTTS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Oh ! Is that so? I repeat that the speech may have been inspired by the Liberal party.,38
95,Mr HAWOBTH,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Some one has been pulling the honourable gentleman's leg.,38
96,Mr COUTTS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I wish to make my attitude clear on this matter. I stand firmly for the retention of the present immigration policy in relation to Asians. We in Queensland have had some very sad experiences in the past, particularly in pre-federation days, when blackbirding was prevalent and Pacific island labour was brought into the sugar industry. The immigration policy, as we know it now, was introduced in the early days of federation, and the Kanaka labour was abolished in the sugar industry. But towns in the sugar belt in central Queensland are still suffering the evil effects of the Kanaka days. There was also a move to have Chinese immigrants introduced into the pastoral industry. The wealthy squatter, who does not see his station, is not concerned with the kind of labour that is engaged to work his property. He is concerned with the amount of money that he pays to his employees, and the profits that he gets for his outlay. The first riots against Chinese pastoral workers occurred at Hughenden station in central northern Queensland. Those of us who have a knowledge of Australian history are well aware of the fact that severe riots occurred at Palmer goldfield, in northern Queensland, and at some Lambing Flat, which is now the town of Young, in New South Wales. Many of the Chinese employed in the mines were killed. Some of the Chinese at Lambing Flat were thrown into the shafts. Generous-minded souls take the view that it is possible, when such people are brought into Australia, that the living standards, to which they were accustomed in their native lands, will be raised to the Australian standard of living. I dispute that contention, and suggest that, should such people be brought here, our standard of living will deteriorate towards their standard of living. We have fought over the years to raise our standard of living to a very high level, and every effort must be made to maintain it, and, indeed, to raise it, to an even higher level. An article which appeared in the last issue of the Brisbane Sunday Mail states that support will be given at the conference of the Liberal party in Brisbane this week to a proposition that a committee be appointed to study Asian problems, and to encourage Australians to take an interest in them. If the State Liberal party in Queensland is to encourage the study of Asian problems with a view to suggesting eventually that we bring Asian immigrants into this country in any numbers at all, it is to be hoped that the party will remain out of office for all time, and that its conference this week will be abortive. Delegates to Libera] party conferences in Queensland do some amazing things, and it is well that honourable members and the people should be aware of some of the statements which emanate from those assemblies. I have here a report of a statement made at the last conference of the Liberal party, which shows the true attitude of mind of some members of that party. One of the Liberal candidates for parliamentary honours is reported to have made the following statement:The public are an unintelligent lot. They are interested only in display, and it is up to State Liberal members to give them display. Publicity is the tiling. I have listened closely to the speeches - of some members of the Liberal party in this chamber, and I am led to the con-clusion that they, too, believe that publicity is the thing. In view of the budget presented by the Treasurer, I should say that he, together with other members of the Government, takes the view that the Australian people are an "" unintelligent l o t "". But we on this side - of the chamber have complete confidence in the Australian people and regard them as our masters. They have shown that they respect the Australian Labour party, because at the last general election they ..gave it the greatest number of votes. I hope that the policy of Australia in relation to immigrants from Asia will never be changed. It has worked well during the 50 years since federation, and there is no reason why we should reverse it now. We were told recently by a distinguished visitor that the question of White Australia is never discussed by the Eastern nations and is of no moment to them. We are creating a problem for ourselves by - continually raising the question. I say that people in Australia who raise it do the nation a great disservice. The honourable' member for Lilley (Mr. Wight) referred to the possibility of reducing the tariff on Japanese goods in - order to encourage trade with that nation. I was amazed to hear him make such a suggestion, because in recent years a most progressive and prosperous textile industry has been established in Brisbane. It is true that it bears the name of a former Liberal politician, but that cannot be avoided. It employs a large number of Queenslanders. if we reduced the tariff on Japanese textiles, that industry would disappear overnight and hundreds of employees who now enjoy good conditions would lose their jobs. Figures released recently by the Department of Trade and Customs give food for thought. We imported £5,000,000 worth of textiles in May of this year, and £7,000,000 worth in June. The Australian textile industry is on the down grade. Without adequate protection, it cannot meet competition from overseas manufacturers, yet honourable members opposite suggest that we should encourage imports from overMr Coutts. seas to the detriment of an Australian industry. In view of suggestions of that kind, I am compelled to say that the Liberal party in this country is lacking in leadership when it comes to the expression of Australian sentiments. It has shown a real Australian outlook only when it has been led by men who seceded from the Australian Labour party-me n such as Sir Joseph Cook, Mr Hughes and Mr Lyons. But those days have gone, and now there is a danger that some of our cherished ideals will be sacrificed. The Government must insist on the development of Australian industries at all costs. I am afraid there are far too many internationalists and too few nationalists on the Government side of the chamber. In speeches on international affairs, Government members have warned us of the danger of a third world war. If such a war occurred, one of the best contributions to the defence of this nation would be adequate production by our secondary industries.. We know that during World War II . Australia increased the productivity of its factories. Fortunately, we had at that time a government led' by Mr Curtin. Production is a great aid to the defence of a nation. This is an island continent, and in time of war we cannot depend on armaments and equipment produced in other countries. There is an obligation on us to establish strategically situated secondary industries, so that if difficult times come we shall not be at the mercy of other nations. That can be done best during a time of peace. Therefore, we should not lower our tariff barrier under any circumstances if that would entail the extinction of any Australian industry. I believe that in voicing those sentiments I have expressed the opinions held by the majority of Queenslanders on the White Australia policy and Australian industry. We could do much to assist our Asian neighbours if we really wanted to do so. but it may be that, as was said by the Liberal party candidate to whom T have referred, the Liberal party believes that the public is interested only in display and that publicity is the thing. In the southern States, we are spending large sums of money to build wheat silos so that, the wheat surplus of last year can be. brought in from country sidings and space made available for this year's harvest., X remember that only a few months ago the finance Minister of Ceylon made an impassioned plea, in Sydney for something to be done so that his countrymen could eat two meals a day. What a great opportunity Australia has to create goodwill, in Eastern countries which could db. so much for us, and on whose friendship we could build our future prosperity!",38
97,Mr WHEELEB,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Would , the honourable member give wheat to them;?",40
98,Mr OOUTTS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I suggest that it would be a very generous action on our part to give wheat to< them. Perhaps £18,000,000' spent on wheat for the peoples of India, Ceylon and other nations who eat wheat would be better than £18,00.0',000 spent on bayonets.",40
99,Mr WHEELER,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"A lot of them db not eat wheat. Mr e.OUTTS.r-1 refer only to those who do eat wheat. It would be better to* spend, the money in a. way that would create goodwill and' perhaps develop markets for: Australia in the future,, when the standard of. livingof these' people has; been raisedl and they are looking overseas; for primary . products.. It is true that this country is doingsome1 thingto assist; in the development of Eastern countries, but that development is a slow process-. The people of those areas cannot wait until irrigation projects have been developed. Thisis the time to assist them and to build up goodwill. I . conclude on the notethat we must db all' we can db to encourage goodwill to Australia in. the Eastern nations, particularly those members of the British Commonwealth which have helped us in the past. It would be better to spend money on food for those countries and toassist the people of Ceylon to achieve their very humble objective of two square mealsa day than it; would be to spend money to buy armamentsfrom overseas: We have an apportunity to secure the goodwill of our neighbours, by assisting those who need our assistance. Mr Whitlam. (Werriwa) [5.40] I wish, tocommence my remarks on the budget with a reference: to - social services. B -[40 ] It is very appropriate that a. Labour member should speak on that, subject, because all. the social servicesi n this country were, .instituted, by the: Labour party. In contrast,, the Liberal paatty and its precursors have never held a very high opinion of social, services. That attitude is. well shown by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), who, in his present Cabinet,, has allotted the portfolio of Social Services, to his junior Minister. (Mr MCMahon), a member of the second eleven, and, in fact, the last man in. The Prune Minister, however, usually softens, these blows with, a happy display of whimsicality. Although he has eight members in his Cabinet who are over 60 years of age, he has given the task of. administering, age pensions to the youngest Minister^ and he has entrusted the administration, of maternity allowances and child endowment, to the only bachelor in the Cabinet,, although he., is one of Australia's most, eligible bachelors. The new Minister has. shown very clearly in liis speech in. defence of tlils budget's lack of provision in the way of social services, that Be is. as new Mihis=ter. Despite the vast staff he. has in the committee room downstairs to brief him on these matters, and"" to prepare arguments for those who have to sit behind him,, he did not state a. good! case in defence of it. Eminently fitted by age 1 to do so, was the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey). I do not in any way minimize the regard that, this, committee has for that right honourable gentle1 man. He is well regarded' far beyond theseshores. In fact, in the Indian Empire his name will probably rank with those, of Clive, Hastings and Lawrence. But,, on social services, he was the Treasurer in the Menzies G'overnment in 1'9'39' who got cold' feet about proceeding with a national' health bill' when World War II . was imminent. Another very eminent and learned member of the Government parties, the honourable member forBa-laelaxva; (Mr Joske), sought to justify the pittance whichpensioners receive, but. I daresay he would never have the temerity to say, on behalf of any of his clients; that an amount equivalent to the widows' pension, or. the war widows' pension, would be adequate: alimony for them,, orthat, any of the. children, of those unions were adequately provided for by an amount equivalent to the child endowment, which has remained static for six years or so, or by an amount valent to the war orphans pension. The new honourable member for Sturt (Mr Makin) quoted the other night from the March, 1953, issue of the International Labour Review, which surveyed the percentage of national income 24 countries expended on social security in 1949. In only six of those countries was the percentage smaller than in Australia. Every country of western Europe expended a greater percentage of its national income on social services than did Australia in that year. If we look at the budget papers, and compare the national income in 1949 and 1953-54, and if we also compare the extent of cash social services benefits in the former year and the latter, we shall see that the percentage of national income in Australia which has been expended on social services has not improved in the five years that this Government has been responsible for such matters. In fact, Australia now expends a smaller percentage of its national income on social services than it did when this Government came to office. Tho reason is that, under this Government, inflation has been worse than in any country of the Western world. Honor able members are familiar with the Commonwealth Year-Booh, because they get it for nothing. Every issue publishes a list of retail price index numbers in successive years in various English-speaking countries. When this Government came to office in 1949, it required £160 to purchase what £100 bought at the outbreak of war. But now it requires £254 to purchase what £100 purchased at the outbreak of war.",40
100,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Is that shown in the Year-Booh?,41
101,Mr WHITLAM,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Yes . Taking the basis of 100 units at the outbreak of war. and comparing it with the position when this Government came to power, we find that the United Kingdom had had slightly less inflation at that time; Canada had had the same degree, and the United States of America had had slightly more. Coming to the present position, we find that the figures-compared with 100 in 1939-ar e 254 in Australia, 189 in the United Kingdom, 186 equiin Canada, 186 in New Zealand and 191 in the United States of America.",41
102,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Are those official figures?,41
103,Mr WHITLAM,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Yes . They have been published by the Commonwealth Statistician. If honourable members have any idea that the Australian figures may have been toned down in any respect, I refer them to the United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics published in June this year-the latest copy available in this country. There, the degree of inflation is compared in various countries, taking 1948 as a basis. From those figures, we find that Australia's inflation is at least twice that of any other English-speaking or Western European country in the lastsix years. Out of 87 countries surveyed by the United Nations in this regard, only seven had endured worse inflation than Australia in the last six years. They were Korea, Indo-China, Austria and four countries in South America. But every other country, including those of Western Europe and North and Central America, had less inflation than we did during the five years this Government has been in charge of the country's destiny. It has been said that, in some way, the Government had to clear up the mess that was bequeathed to it. Figures show that inflation in Australia was no greater than in Western and English-speaking countries when this Government came to office. Since then, it has been twice as bad in this country, and in many cases four times as bad. The Government did nothing until it secured the double dissolution and got hack to power in 1951. The horror budget, the first step to clear up inflation, was introduced in 1951. The inflation that the Government had to clear up was largely of its own making in 1950. In 1950, this Government was still priming the pump. It was seeking to placate and bribe every section of the community. When it came to office, the first controls it took off were the only economic anti-inflationary controls it had on capital issues and imports. All the proceeds to this country in consequence of the bumper wool season, that occurred during this Government's first year of office, went on expensive, wasteful articles. It was only after the Government had been in power for two years that it tried to bring back the controls that it had wilfully taken off. The Government brought back import controls to a degree that Australia never had even during the war, and it brought in capital issues controls with a severity that had not been practised even during the war. Reference has been made to the present value of social services benefits compared with their value when the Government came into office nearly five years ago. No member of the Government will pretend that any social services benefit now bears the same relation to the basic wage as it bore when the Labour Government left office. The excuse is made, however, that various social services benefits bear the same relation to the cost of living as they did five years ago. It is true, if one limits one's inquiry to age and invalid pensions, that the recipients of these pensions receive the same percentage, based on the cost-of-living index, as they received five years ago; but I shall not limit our inquiry to age and invalid pensions. I shall. cite examples provided by some of the other social services benefits. Members of the Labour party do not believe that if the country is sufficiently prosperous to afford to pay a bonus, premium or prosperity loading to people who are still able to work, the people who are no longer able to work, or are too old, too incapacitated or too war-afflicted to work, should not share in that prosperity. The Labour party will continue to urge that cash social services benefits should bear the same relation to the basic wage as they bore when this Government came into office. Neither we, nor the people themselves, will be satisfied with anything less than that. I turn from age and invalid pensions to other kinds of pensions, and I shall compare the percentage that they bear now to the basic wage with the percentage they bore five years ago, when the last Chifley budget was presented. For that purpose I shall use the average basic wage for the six capitals. In August, 1949, the basic wage was £6 7s. In August, 1953, it was £11 16s., at which point it wage? has been frozen. When the Government took office, age and invalid pensions were 33.1 per cent, of the basic wage. They are now 29.6 per cent, of it. The wife's allowance was 18.9 per cent, of the basic wage, and it is now 14.8 per cent. The child's allowance was 7.1 per cent, and it is now 4.9 per cent. The same position applies to the widows pension to which, significantly, members of the Government make no reference on any occasion. The A class widow, when this Government came into office, received 37.4 per cent, of the basic wage. She now receives 31.S per cent, of it. The B class widow received 29 per cent, of the basic wage, and now receives 24.4 per cent. These cash social services benefits have increased in the nominal terms of pounds, shillings and pence, but there are other benefits, also similarly increased by Labour, which have remained stationary under this Government. Maternity allowances, which the Fisher Labour Government introduced in 1912, were increased in 1943 to £15, £16 and £17 10s., and have remained at those levels in the eleven years that have passed since then. The Chifley Government increased child endowment to 10s. a week. That figure remains unaltered today. The Curtin Government introduced funeral benefits. In 1943 the figure was fixed at £10, and it remains unaltered. Many cash social services benefits are payable by the Repatriation Department in respect of people who were injured during war, or who were bereaved by war. In that respect the Government's record is particularly appalling, not the least because its members make flag-waving patriotism and the like their stock-intrade. They give us a nauseating display every budget time, despite the betrayal which they constantly make of the interests of all those who were bereaved or afflicted as a result of war. When the Government came into office the general rate war pension stood at 43.3 per cent, of the basic wage. It is now 38.1 per cent. The special rate pension stood at 83.5 per cent., and is now 78.4 per cent.",41
104,Mr GRIFFITHS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Is the honourable member referring to the Commonwealth basic wage or the New South Wales basic,42
105,Mr WHITLAM,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I am referring - to the average tof ithe - six capitals. It is frequently .'said that social-services benefits should not vary according to .the fluctuations of the (basic Tvage or tthe :cost .of living. In rrespect of .special rate .pensions, - at /least, they should so vary because the recipients of .every lother .kind of tpension can go to <work and -.earn up to a certain 'limit, .'and so .have rthe benefit of cost-of-living fluctuations; .but ithe special rate pensioner is forbidden ito earn - any money in addition to his pension. Accordingly, the is automatically .deprived of the ifluc'tuations and variations that the ""Commonwealth Arbitration Court and other bodies, which are not responsible to this Parliament, make at intervals. I turn now to what I think is pro""baDly the 'most shameful case of .betrayal of repatriation beneficiaries that 'has been perpetrated by the Government. When the Government came into - office war widows received 47:2 per cent, of theoasic wage and now received 33.9 per cent, of it. In 'five years, therefore, the - value of the waT - widows' pension has declined, in terms of the 'basic wage, by ""almost 14 per cent. 'Significantly none of the honourable members opposite who have so far spoken hi this debate on behalf of the Government have sought'to justify that shameful decrease. 'One would have thought that that crusty old warrior, the .Minister for the Army '(Mr Francis), who was the last speaker on the Government side, would have made some reference to repatriation henefits. But the Minister, particularly since he has taken over the additional portfolio of the Navy, has in this regard, .as so often, found it very convenient to put the telescope to his blind eye. I well remember that before the last general election the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper), who represents the Government in another place, had the temerity to 'send to all sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia a copy of the booklet, Repatriation under the Menzies Government, 1949-1953. I have quoted from that booklet all the figures that I have given to the committee. In my own sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen?s Imperial League of Australia, which has about 500 members and has a regular attendance of at least .100 - at meetings, it was morced that the booklet .be placed, not on the notice board, ibut on the darts iboard, because it was so full of holes. The plain fact remains that never, before ithis Government icame Unto office, have w:ai pensions stood at .such a low percentage of the .basic wage as they .stand today. 'For that statement. I quote as an authority the '37th annual report of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, .and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia for the year ended the 31st December, 1952, which was presented .on the .27th - October last year. At page 12 of that booklet there is ;conveniently - set out for members to peruseand this is :another publication .which can be obtained free of charge-the ratio sof the war pension to the basic ""wage in every year since 1914. I repeat that never, from 1916 until this Government .came into office, have war pensions borne .such a small ratio to the basic - wage :as they now bear. Sifting suspended from '6 to 8 p.m. ' Mr Whitlam;-Before the sitting was suspended, I stated that all the cash social services benefits that are-available ito the people .at present had been introduced by Labour governments. I mentioned that in 1949, when the present Government came to power, Australia - spent 'a smaller percentage of its national income on social services than did any country in Western Europe and that now, after five years, all the benefits of that character are worth less .by 'comparison with the basic wage than when this Government came to office. That is due to the fact that inflation has become worse. The - restriction of social services benefits is one of the chief measures that the Government has taken in order to curb inflation. In other words, economies have been effected at the expense of those who are least able to withstand them. The value of the war widows' pension has declined in value during this Government's term of office' from 47.2 per cent, of the basic wage to .33.9 - per cent. It is to the everlasting disgrace of this Government that it .again introduced the means ftest in relation to hospital benefits From the Chifley Government, the State governments - which - conduct hospitals received as much as .they.ever .received from paying patients, but the present Government failed .to .increase that amount although hospital costs subsequently soared. In fact, the Government required the State governments to introduce .the .means test once again in hospitals. .The Government may reply that that was the fault of the 'State governments. If that is so, why did ithe Australian i'Government introduce the - same 'practice in the Canberra Community Hospital which it operates? 'The State governments provide certain social - services ;such as 'education, hospitals, police and - courts. Whereas the Australian ^Government last year spent £218,OGO,O00 ion cash - social services bene: , fits, the State governments spent two; - thirds ®f that iamount, £137,000,000, on - the provision of social services. Under this Government, the amount of money that 'has been made - available to the 'States for - the provision of social services has declined. It is true that the amount of tax reimibursements to the States under - the nniform income tax formula automatically lises if the population of a - State increases or if the average - wage increases. But this Government will make smaller supplementary payments by way <of .tax reimbursements ito the - States this year than - it has made in any previous .year of loffice. This year it will make -£l-.9,500,0'00 available to the States in .supplementary payments. .Never, in any previous year, has the amount been less than £20,000,000.; in .19,51-52 it was £33,577,000. The Government has .made this reduction despite .the fact that, during the five .years it has been in office, the population of Australia has increased by 1,000,000 and the value ;of the £1 has failed by two-fifths. Tf a .greater proportion of the population in any 'State attends school now than -'attended a few years ago, or if the children remain at school longer, the .State is unable to cope with the additional financial burden. This is one of the most melancholy and miserable examples of the economizing of this Government at the expense of the living standards of the people. The Australian - Government should decide how much money or what proportion of the national income should 'be spent on'health and education and the malnitenance of law and order. But this Government .will not provide those services itself and will not let the State .governments .'have sufficient money .to .provide those facilities properly. Page 13 of ithe White Paper on National Income and Expenditure 1953-5:4 shows .that less money was ispent last year - on providing housing than in .either .of ;the two previous years. Taking into consideration the increase in - population ;and the decrease in the value of money, less was spent hy this Government on housing during the last financial year than was :spent in any of the previous years of its - term of office. A great proportion of the - housing - in this country is the responsibility of the Australian Government because .of the Commonwealth and State Bousing Agreement. .During the five years that this Government has been in office, New South Wales has been deprived of -£26,000,'00.0 .that it is entitled to under the .agreement, Victoria has been deprived - of £11;000,000, 'Queensland of £8,000,000. 'Western Australia of £6,'OOO,0OO, and -'South Australia, which is only entering its second year - under the agreement, has been - deprived of £500,000. Last year, the Commonwealth IBank, which alone among the financial institutions of this country has a sense of social responsibility, made less money available to building societies and by way of Credit Fonder loans than in any previous year of the 'Government's term of office. Last year, fewer houses were provided by the War - Service Homes Division than in .any of the three previous years. The division provided -47l homes fewer than it did in the year 1952-53,; 3,40.0 fewer than in 1951-52; and 3,200 fewer than in 1950^51. Yet the repayments <of loans received by the War Service Homes .Division have risen during the Government's term of office from .£5.,0.00,000 to over £11,000,000 a year. The budget :reveals that the Government has not a proper sense of responsibility in relation to the housing needs of the Australian jpeople. The Australian .Loan Council provides the only means of developing this country which is available to the State governments as the Constitution stands at present. Although, in the last two years, the Australian Government has refused to obey the decisions of the Australian Loan Council, this year it has announced that it may obey those decisions. The Government has agreed that £200,000,000 may be raised in loans. However, it has proposed to make advances to the States for the first six months of this financial year at the rate of £180,000,000 a year. That sum is less than it has made available in any of the last three years. The brochure, Major Development Projects issued by the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) shows that of 160 projects listed, 157 are being carried out by the States. Some eight of them have been delayed or deferred for three years for want of money due to this Government's defiance of the Loan Council.",43

We did not refrain from doing so because we doubted the accuracy of that statement. The story is too well known for anybody to disbelieve it.

He implied that I had made a certain suggestion to the Parliament concerning reconsideration of our policy on restricted immigration, which is so unfortunately known as the White Australia policy.

That was the whole purpose of my remarks. If I encouraered the honourable member for Griffith to think I did a good job, I am glad. Public thought has been stimulated about something that I think is important. Mr Ward interjecting,",46
128,Mr MCCOLM,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I did not think that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) would appreciate my statement, because he apparently would not like to see us on friendly relations with our Asian neighbours. In my opinion, the honourable member for Griffith criticized the speech of the honourable member for Lilley for party political reasons. All thinking persons appreciate that it is necessary for us to preserve the balance of trade. After all, the honourable member for Griffith himself said that he would like Australia to give some £60,000,000 or £70,000,000 worth of wheat to the Asian people because they need it. That is certainly a very nice thought, but if any one wanted to disrupt the Australian economy-and so many people seem to want to do that I cannot think of a better way to do it. In relation to the budget, the honourable member for Werriwa accused this Government of not having done something that it should have done or of having done the wrong thing. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",46
129,Mr MCCOLM,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Honourable members opposite say "" Hear, hear! "". I remind The them that we fought them with a policy that was in the ' interests of Australia, and that we fought them in the face, of a bribe that was offered to the electors. I believe that, unfortunately, a number of people fell for.' that bribe. They must, be disgusted with, themselves. I . was. very pleased note,, however; that many trade unionists said that the policy of the Liberal was sound, and that consequently there was a switch of. voting.

Just as it is .important that the 'home unit should be kept together, so it is important that national unity should be .maintained, and we can do that only by adopting a spirit of self-sacrifice. - Honourable members opposite have said, "" The Government has not done a thing towards helping Australia in the last Sour or five years"". The honourable member for Werriwa made a similar statement just a short while ago, but he seems to forget that, to a - certain degree, a country is like a fairly valuable vehicle which, in this case, has been serviced, by bad mechanics. That was the position in which Australia found itself when the Government assumed office in 1949. The vehicle, having been badly serviced and having lousy brakes, was on its way downhill and was nearly out of control, but this ^Government succeeded in stopping it without doing very great damage The Government's achievement over the last five years has been no mean one. 1 conclude by inviting honourable members opposite to name any other government during the history of the Commonwealth which has completely implemented its financial policy in its first budget a general election. That has been the achievement of this Government. This is a real budget, and a good one for Australia. I hate to think what would have happened if the Labour party had had a chance to implement the specious promises that were made by the Leader of the Opposition - and fatuous this budget is and how Jb. HAYLEN '(Parkes) [.8.28]-J3""aving listened to the Liberal dose of political rblane mange for ithe last half hour, I - think it is about time that the - committee returned to .a consideration of the hudget and its implications which, after 'all, is the .subject under discussion. Within the next few hours, as a result of the 'brutal majority of the Government, the ""budget will have been 'passed and, as a blue print, it will have been integrated into the economy of the nation. When one looks 'at it carefully and thoroughly and painstakingly, ias at ""least Opposition members ""have done, one sees that it is .'a - very poor thing indeed. Several - attempts have .been made to ideseribe the hudget. I should like to call it the .horrible little :sister of the horror budget. Whilst the horror budget was brutal and aggressive and - constituted a .sledge hammer assault on the economy, this measly, niggardly, pernicious, .little thing is neither one thing nor the other. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Orean), who is /an economist of some ability-indee d of great ability-care fully and cleverly analysed the budget speech of the Treasurer and put his finger on the one thing that the Government will not face up to. The Treasurer himself said that we have .a balanced economy and prosperity. He cannot claim both. There may be prosperity of a kind that is a - danger because of its inherent weaknesses, but it is not, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out, a balanced economy that is of benefit to the whole of the community. .Uo matter what the Treasurer may 'say about - it, the balance to which he has referred - is not a good one, nor are 'conditions ideal. In his statement, the Treasurer 'spoke of' the economy being In good balance. He then, by accident or design, passed - over the real troubles of the community. after As I have --said, they are 'set out - splendidly for the consideration of the committee by the honourable member for ' Melbourne Ports. 'The honourable member for Bowman '(Mr MCColm) made - one lucid remark in his speech. If I may paraphrase his 'statement, he said tjhat budgets - were - like housekeeping. 'If that be 'so, I ican demonstrate how futile dangerous it can be. There are more goods - coming into J Australia than we 'can pay for, while our primary products with which we have to pay for those things are declining in price and volume. I do not have to cite figures to prove that fact. It is necessary only to 'read the Treasurer's budget statement. The right honourable 'gentleman referred 'to imports, and by those he meant imports, from iGreat Britain, which in the - main are ""welcome, and goods dumped in Australia from low-wage countries and produced 'under coolie standards, which are most unwelcome. The Treasurer said that _ ""'imports continue 'as a threat to ' our economy and there are more --of these"". The right honourable gentleman added that imports for 1953-54 totalled £682,000,000 and were £171,000,000 more than in the previous year. Honourable members should ponder the problem that is centred on the increase of £171,000,000 in the value of imports. We know that honourable members on the Government side are pondering the problem because the Delphic oracle of the Government, the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) said only during the week-end that controls were imminent. He was called on specially in order to see how his prophecy would be received in South Australia, before bringing the matter into the. atmosphere of political realism. Willynilly we are to have more imports, not the things we want but those that are being dumped on us. The archaic anti-dumping laws of this country that were passed years ago have never been amended. During the second world war the time might not have been opportune to review them, but in the midst of a peace-time economy, they should have been reviewed long since. On the import side, we have the prospect of goods valued at £171,000,000 more than we can afford to purchase. I invite honourable members to examine the export side. The Treasurer stated that exports in 1953-54 were valued at £816,000,000 or £30,000,000 less than their value last year. We had £171,000,000 more of the things we did not want last year and £30,000,000 less of export goods to buy those that we cannot afford. In such circumstances, how can the Treasurer talk so glibly of a balanced economy, prosperity and everything being lovely in the garden? Even the signs that are now evident overseas are dangerous. In eight weeks, Australia's overseas balance has fallen by £70,000,000. There is barometric pressure somewhere and the Government should watch it. So far the Government has passed over the danger signs with the comforting thought that the problems will adjust themselves. Reserves overseas were built up during the days of the Chifley Labour Government, and the influence of that Government's administration was still evident in 1951 when the reserves in London stood at £843,000,000. To-day our reserves total £571,000,000. An adverse Mr Haylen. balance of payments is a certainty this year. Australia is facing an economic pincer movement, yet the Treasurer talks of abiding prosperity. On the one hand, as I have said, we have received an additional £171,000,000 worth of rubbish we do not want that has been drained into the country because this Government is an importers' government. It obtains finances for general elections from the importers while our primary industries are running down. The pincer movement that is directed against the Australian economy is extremely dangerous. Between the pincers, Australia is in a precarious position. The Opposition does not want to peddle depression, but honourable members on this side of the chamber must warn the Government of the ultimate results of its policy. Supporters of the Australian Country party prate about their great fight for the primary producers. I invite the committee to examine what has happened to the primary producers during the last few years while members of the Australian Country party have been associated with the Liberal party in this coalition Government. Wool is our great, staple product and we pray that it will remain so, but it is suffering from a price and inquiry change. It is all right to protest that wool that was sold at the opening sales at 8 per cent, to 12£ per cent, less than last season was poor stuff from out west, dirty and affected by diought. Is that not the beginning? If the pincer moves in such a way that the traders can get inferior wool cheaper at the beginning of the season, it will move later on the super-fine qualities. While there may be a slight, lift in the Brisbane sales, is it not conceded by the wool industry that we must be prepared for a 6 to 7 per cent, slump ? That would mean a fall in revenue of £60,000,000 to £80,000,000. The position of wool is precarious. It is on the razor's edge because wool is our staple product at present. What has the Australian Country party to say about the wheat industry? Wheat is virtually on the floor. Every silo is crammed, every bulkhead is f u ll and the Government is wringing its hands. The Government urges wheat-growers to grow more wheat while the chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Sir John Teasdale, has told them to restrict the acreage under wheat. The guesses of the Government were all wrong when the International Wheat Agreement ended. Members of the Government are always talking about private industry but it turned sour as far as wheat was concerned. The Government went for higher prices and the crash came. To-day, the Government is sending out its agents in an endeavour to sell wheat. The agreement has collapsed. There is a glut and the Government is left high and dry. What formula has the Treasurer evolved to solve this problem? He is the Leader of the Australian Country party. Wheat should be bringing Australia £90,000,000 of overseas credit, but the Treasurer does not know what to do. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and Sir John Teasdale do not know. Even the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) doe.3 not know. Mr TnitiVBULL - Neithe r does the honourable member for Parkes.",47
136,Mr HAYLEN,PRESENTATION TO TH E,I know that there is a threat to the Australian economy and the Australian Country party should hang its head because it is of no use to the Government. The Opposition is trying to give the Government some dynamic advice on the budget.,50
137,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,What does the honourable member for Parkes know of primary production?,50
138,Mr HAYLEN,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), the primary producer from the other end of Queanbey an, is the gentleman farmer of the Liberal party. His farming consists of wearing gaiters and carrying a cane. Another problem is dairying and the marketing of cheese. Cheese is unwanted on the overseas markets. At one time it commanded a steady sale. The butter trade, figuratively has gone into the doldrums. Australian butter is used for blending on the London market with Danish butter and European butter is preferred to Australian. Ours is the Cinderella of the Butter trade. The industry in Australia is being sustained by the home market. It is being kept on its feet by the workers of Australia whose wages have been frozen while margins have been denied them and the pensioners are forgotten. That is the lesson for the Government and the Australian Country party. What of the other primary products? Egg sales on government to government level and other fine schemes, denounced when the Labour Government introduced them but sustained by this Government, have now been abandoned in favour of trader-to-trader marketing. We have lost heavily and the overseas egg market is in a precarious position. Is this the prosperity to which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have referred? The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Greenup) said that the Prime Minister was a silver-tongued orator and had persuaded the people that prosperity existed in Australia. I do not agree that the Prime Minister is a silver-tongued orator. He may have been at one time, but now he is only the sanctuary for the ponderous paragraph and the out-worn cliche. I do not agree that the Treasurer is a fine financial genius. He reminds me of a waiter staggering into the kitchen juggling a pile of plates several feet high, and shutting his ears against the crash that will inevitably occur. He piled up figures to towering summits and climbed the Matterhorn of his own platitudes. The Government will not defend the budget. On the 25th August last, the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey) gave honourable members an impassioned address about the Australian Labour party. He knew better than to discuss this budget, this horrible little sister of the horror budget. He has been too long a member of this chamber to have anything to do with the budget. Instead, he gave honourable members a well-mannered lecture in the manner of a farceur entertaining the people at the Tivoli theatre, and he posed the question, "" What is wrong with the Labour party?"" He came to several conclusions, the most important of which seemed to be that the only good Labourite is a dead one. It is significant that he did not touch upon the budget at any stage. We might have expected that, as Minister for External Affairs, he would relate it in some way to the affairs with which his portfolio is. concerned. Oh Thursday last; the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Kent Hughes), whose job is to look after the drains in Canberra, gave us a rabblerousing' address on external affairs and said nothing about the budget. Government supporters say that honourable members on this side, of the chamber have displayed no punch in. their observations on the budget. One does not shoot the sitting hen or kick the horrible little child. He just gets away from it as quickly as possible. In passing, I make the point that the Government itself is determined not to support this budget, because it knows, that it is only an interregnum measure that contains very little that is worthy of support and much that is. cold blooded, particularly in relation to the needs of the servicemen and the pensioners. The financial leader of. this, chamber,, the Treasurer, gave us a welter of figures. He went along, with a. reaping, hook harvesting thefigures-in swathes, making millions of pounds, here and there, telling us. what would happen, at one. place or another,, and pointing, out all. the difficulties with which we are assailed. He admitted, in part. that, at present Australia's overseas trading accountis in an unsound, conditioni and that the returns from primary products have; declined. What was his solution to these problems ? His cure-all was the removal' of 3s. of excise from, the bottle of brandy and the addition of Is. per lb. to the price of tea. That was a magnificent gesture in support of the budget! Eeal solutions to Australia's financial problems are available. If the Government is not aware of them the Australian Labour party will' be happy to help it along by informing it. of them. If Australia's, exportindustries' are in difficulties, why doesthe Administration not do something to curb the activities of the. monopolistic shipping companies instead"" of trying to encourage them? Were it not for the. persistent and unceasing, fight of the Australian Labour party, the Commonwealth shipping line would no, longer be in existence,, and Australia's only bulwark against, vicious and almost insane exploitation would! have been, destroyed. So strong was criticism of the Administration's intentions in relaMr llaylen. tion to the line, as was evidenced by a gallup poll taken a short time before the last general election, that the Government became humble and almost ate its own words when it announced that it would not proceed with the proposed sale of the Commonwealth ships. Any one who studies the high freights that are charged by the overseas, shipping companies, can readily determine where one of the major difficulties lies. The honourable member for Angas (Mr. Downer) mentioned the problem of costs of production. Costs are a great problem, but it is wrong to attribute the high cost structure to the wages of the workers: Every one is aware of the racket in ship! ping freights, that is being practised. Any one with the intelligence, to inquire into, events in Australia knows that our trade with the Middle East has been wrecked by the overseas shipping monopoly. Australia was building up a. splendid trade with the Middle East, but it was. found that the cost of shipping good's to that part of the world was almost as great as would be the cost of sending them to London or Liverpool. Thefreight charge for a. cargo of sugar from Cairnsto Devonport in Tasmania is; nearly as. great as would be the freight charge' for shipping a similar cargoto England. If the Government wishes to put the wheat industry and the other more vulnerable primary industries in a. sound position, it must takeaction to; reduce, overseas shipping freights. Let us; recall what happened, in relation to . stevedoring ; charges.. The AustralianLabour party, in itswisdom, agreed, to support the Administration in its move to reduce stevedoring charges so that freight's might be reduced. Only interstate freights, were reduced"" after the passage of the amending legislation,, and the rer duction was. due solely to the fact that the Commonwealth, shipping line acted as. a contra and provided, a. basis for comparison.. The overseas shipping, com panies have goneoff with the loot and are laughing at: the members of this Parliament. Their response , was similar to that of big business toa reduction of company tax by £30,000 000„ none of. the s benefit of which was passed on to the workers. The Government prates of a balanced economy, but it allows itself to be; swayed, on the; one hand by primary producing interests-;, and on. thes other by big business. I£ the. Administration is sincerely looking for a solution, of Ausitnalia.'s: cost problems in primary indus^ tries, it. should at least take action to reduce shipping' freights,, which are dangerously high;- But it does nothing:. The Government' did not bother to think about markets until salesdeclined, litthen sent canvassers throughout the country to do something about the problem. A feeling' of disquiet pervades the minds of Opposition members and supporters' of the Government In contemplation of the future. J wonder whether we leantoo much upon our economists.. I am not competent to criticize as a class the exponents' of theinexactscience of economics, but I am able to relate to honourable members some history; both recent and not so recent. When the Australian; Labour party was In office, the economists did some guessing and advised the Labour Government to keep servicemen in the Army and to avoid wholesale unemployment. The Labour Administration decided against that policy, and for the first time in Australia's history; full employment was attained , and this Government dare not undermine it. The economistslater advised the people of Australia to begin growing cabbages in their bathroomsbecause a world shortage of food threatened. What happened? A world glut of food occurred"". Economists give allkinds of advice togovernments. - E suggest that the best thing for this Administration to do with Its economists would be to insert in theCanberra Times and other newspapers an advertisement in the following terms':For sale-Some thoroughly worn-out economists-, complete, with graphs,, horoscopes: and - crystal balls. The Government could then get to work in: an energetic effort to administer the affairs of the country more sensibly.. As the honourable, member for Bowman has said, there, is not, in principle, a great, - of difference between running a household efficiently and running a country successfully. Share: prices are high and money is abundant, but any one who thinks deeply must wonder why the. cost structure is not - examined intelligently-.. The unionists go 1 to; the; Commonwealth Court o£ Conciliation and' Arbitration! for justice. On soma occasions' a panel of no> fewer than seven, judges examines minutely ev.ery elementof the workers' cost of. living; and fixes a. basic wage;, which, is then promptly frozen.. The co;urt alsoi fixea margins, and promptly abolishes' them.. Them,, in f the commercial columns) of the newspapers, we; read reports, that something must be> done to reduce thej cost structure. The? Government, has certainly done, something about the cost structure, of the workers-.. It has knelt, on the. workers in the court; deferred hearings: on applications for increased wages;, frozen-, the basic wage,, eliminated margins, and deprived old people of pensions. It , must now look somewhere, else for the dangers in the cost structure, and judging by its actions, it is> looking to the wrong, branches of tradeexploitation. The fluidity of money is. severely restricted by this Government's, banking legislation. The Administration maintains; that, it abhors the very idea, of control, and that, it. was; elected, on a freeenterprise programme,, but it: retains; the master control upon the. entire economy1 the control of credit: We in this, chamber have heard repeated ad nauseam by honourable; memberson both sides; of the chamberthe sorry story of the inability of ex-servicemen, who have only half of the totalpurchase price to. put down, to attain, homes-, that they sorely need. Neither the Commonwealth Trading Bank nor the private trading banks: will accept half the purchase price as. a deposit on% a. home. We have heard also about the; difficulties of developing industries that want money for expansion that will provide, more employment, and are unable to get the money that, they need because they are not engaged in the kind of enterprise in which the. Commonwealth Trading Bank wants to invest. Only those people who, represent short-term investments, and can give a. quick return deal can get. money out. of the Commonwealth Bank. One, of the greatest tragedies ever enacted in this Parliament, was the manner in which the' Commonwealth Bank was separated from the central bank. When the legislation which brought the Commonwealth Trading Bank, into existence, passed through this Parliament, the Commonwealth Bank lost the backing of £1,000,000,000 of the workers' savings. To-day the Commonwealth Bank is forced to lend on its deposits. It is not actually touting for fixed deposits at 1£ per cent., but it is trying hard to get them in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Yet the money lender who finances the purchase of motor cars and other luxury goods, and has already borrowed money from the Commonwealth Bank in the past, is able to sell debentures at 3 per cent. If the Treasurer calls that good finance, I should like to know what he would regard as bad work. One of the real dangers in our economy today is the frustration of the Commonwealth Bank. It has withered. It has been allowed to die on the vine. It cannot lend because it has not sufficient funds. Twenty-five million pounds is needed in New South Wales for co-operative housing. If th'j Government believes in housing schemes and that governments as governments should be interested in housing, why does it not give money to the co-operative housing organizations, which houses for individual owners or others desirous of owning property? With this Government, housing is a dead letter. Money is not available for co-operative housing in New South Wales or for any worthwhile expansion scheme because the Commonwealth Bank simply does not have the money. The £6,000,000 capitalization of the great Commonwealth Bank was the cruellest blow that organization ever suffered. Years ago the Australian Country party gave us the "" Tragic Treasurer"". Now it has produced another one. The bloodlines are running true. This is one of the basic principles underlying the finances of this Government and it is one of the dangers inherent in the budget that the Treasurer praises so warmly. Treasurer leans on the despatch box in this chamber and complains that there is £10,000,000 too much consumer credit in this country, and that people are spending too much money. The reason is, of course, that the things that people really want are too dear, and the reason they are too dear is that most of them are bought on time payment, and the Ur. Ifa.'/lcii. man who is rocketing to fame today under this Government is not the worker in industry, the farmer on his land, or the little manufacturer, but the exploiter of money. It is the fellow with that £50,000,000 worth of "" hot"" money that blew here from Great Britain some years ago. The credit finance game is so good that the banks are chasing it. Every second bank has a credit branch associated with it and makes available credit for hire-purchase because there is at least 30 per cent, profit in it. Why should the Treasurer lament these things when he knows that the money is going into the building of homes and other revenues which cannot be inflationary? He would dispose of this surplus spending power which is going into luxury buying. I quote the case that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Minogue) mentioned to me some weeks ago. It concerned an ex-serviceman who wanted to buy his house which was valued at £2,000. He took £1,000 to the Commonwealth. Bank but the bank could not lend hint the other £.1,000. Can you imagine build what happened to the £1,000 he had saved? It would be expended on a motor car, furniture, or some other things n it so basic to the economy and not so noninflationary as the purchase of bricks and mortar for his family. He can blame only the Government and its banking policy. There is too much talk by the Government of inflation. Much of the so-called inflationary trend is due to the fact that this country has taken a leap forward since the war. Our wages are higher, and our prices are higher, but much of that increase is stable. It is not dangerous. It is something that should be encouraged. Other features are more inflationary, but are still within the limit of our capacity to control. The There seem to be some very obvious things to do about our secondary industries. We talk, by and large, of secondary industries and what we are doing for them. But some mushroom industries cannot creep for ever under the wall of protection. I believe most firmly that the 40 per cent, initial depreciation allowance was a good thing for Australia. When the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) was asked a question recently about this allowance, he said, "" You are talking about this depreciation allowance and, at the same time, you are complaining about the profit of General MotorsHoldens Limited."" But the answer to that was given by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) who asked for an excess profits tax, or, to use the American name, a capital gains tax. The other side of the argument is to say that industries can be encouraged by giving them a depreciation allowance early in the piece for developmental purposes. We stick by that. The half hour that we have to discuss the budget is of course too short to permit us to traverse adequately a document of such size and importance as this, but I should like to make some general conclusions. The most cowardly and unforgivable feature of the budget is its total and absolute neglect of the pensioners. If this Government is prepared to win elections by kneeling on the vulnerable groups in the community, good luck to it. It can then say to the big money-bags, "" We did not let them get away with it . "" But let me warn the Government that if it does not keep money circulating at the grass roots of the economy; in simple language, if it does not feed the pensioner and give him enough to live on, the big fellow will crash too. It is a question of common sense. When, after the Randell report, President Eisenhower was asked what he would do in the event of a depression, he replied, "" I would subsidize the men who grow the food and increase social services to see that the men who eat it have enough money to buy it."" The Government should think that one over when considering its treatment of the pensioners. The Government is tinkering with the means test. The only final solution to the social services problem is the total and complete abolition of the means test. I believe in that and I spoke for When the economy is in despair, fill up your social services because that is where purchasing, power comes from. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr. MCColm) said that this Government had inherited an economy that was running down badly: and that it tinkered at this wheel and that in an attempt to keep the economic machine running. It did nothing of the sort. The Government acquired a financial machine that it did not understand. Its four running wheels were full employment. Its steering wheel was social services and the welfare state, and the chassis was complete prosperity for this great and glorious country of Australia. The Government got control of the machine; it backed and filled and finally rammed the machine into a ditch by adhering to its moth-eaten old fashioned financial formulas that will not work. Honourable members opposite claim that prosperity is abounding, but we say. as the honourable member for Melbourne. Ports (Mr Crean) has said, that prosperity is not abounding but it exists only here and there. We are told about the great future of this country, but at least six primary industries are in the doldrums. We talk about our growing secondary industries but they depend for financial aid upon a source which is dangerous because it is tied up with the money lender. There is a stranglehold on the Commonwealth Bank and a blackout on housing and progressive works of all kinds. How, in the face of all that, this Government can believe that the budget is of any use, I am at a loss to understand. It should be, as the honourable member for Melbourne has said, withdrawn and re-drafted.",50
139,Mr BRAND,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Wide Bay) [8.58] - I expected from an old campaigner and a front-bencher like the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) some constructive thought on the matters contained in the budget. But, like his colleagues, he could speak only of the budget's failure to provide for a general rise of pensions. The only constructive thought in his speech which lasted half an hour was his first suggestion. I should have thought that the honourable member would have at least tried to explain to it. the committee how the Labour party proposed to abolish the means test.",54
140,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Quite easily.,54
141,Mr BRAND,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson) is one of those who did not say, when he spoke earlier, how the Labour party proposed to achieve that objective - In fact, no member of the Opposition has proposed any practical solution of the problem Of abolishing the - means test. Of course, we know that the Opposition has no such solution. We have to submit to this continual criticism in the knowledge that it is completely without justice or justification. Undoubtedly honourable members Opposite are champion critics, but we expect them to offer some constructive suggestions for the welfare of our country. I rose mainly for the purpose of opposing the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Oalwell). I understand that it is the custom for the Opposition to move a formal amendment to the motion that the first item in the Estimates be agreed to, aiid I sympathize with the honourable gentleman in his predicament because the case that he had to present was hopelessly weak. In fact, as the debate has progressed, it has become quite clear that the Labour party has no case at all. It has been beaten by the Government at the polls and is now left without a case to argue. It is a great pity that a great political party like the Australian Labour party has not a constructive policy to place before the Parliament. The people believe that it should at least have a policy, and we on this side of the chamber would be prepared to listen to it if it had a constructive policy. I support the budget because it is a balanced budget that will maintain economic stability and economic freedom for Australia. The parties represented on this side of the chamber are able to say to the people that the Government has carried out within three months every promise that it made to them during the election campaign. I can readily understand why honourable members opposite aggrieved when they heard the budget speech of the Treasurer, especially when ho said, at the outsetDuring the financial year j'lifst cldsed we had in Australia stability of genera] economic conditions, combined in remarkable degree with real and substantial material progress. Oh the one hand, retail and wholesale prices were generally steady throughout the year, and so too were wage rates and the other main elements which determine costs. On the other hand, civilian employment increased by no lefe than 90,000 persons, National income rose by 5 per cent, and, since the price level did not rise, this Was a real gain in terms of goods an'il services, ilfr. Brawl. That statement illustrates bne reason why members of the Labour party are under a great disability when they try to level criticism at the Government. This country enjoys today the best standards of living in the world. According to international food commissions) Australians have more food than people in other countries, with the exception of the United States of America, and our standards of living are equal to those of Americans. The Government can claim quite honestly that it has done good ""to the people of Australia. We are prOud of its achievements. The budget offers advantages to all classes of people. Honourable members opposite have Complained that the Government has not provided for higher pensions, even though they know that it, did not promise to increase pension rates. However, the Government will honour a promise that it made during the election campaign by providing £20.200,000 a year more than previously for pensioners and homes for the aged. A substantial increase of payments to pensioners as a result of a liberalization of the means test will benefit 90,000 persons already in receipt of pensions and will 'bring 71,000' additional persons intb the social services field. Furthermore, over 3,000,000 taxpayers will obtain relief from income tax and related charges, such as sales tax, to the amount of £42,600,000. This is a continuation of the established policy of' the present Government. Honourable members will realise, if they look back to 1949, when the Labour party con : trolled the Treasury, that we did not then have the advantages of a plentiful were supply of food that we have today. We ail know that we suffered from food rationing and rampant black marketing throughout Australia at that time; If honourable members opposite want to know more of what the Government has done for the peoplej they need only examine the records of the savings banks of Australia; The savings of the peopleare an indication of real prosperity. In June this year'j deposits in Australian savings banks exceeded £1,000,000,000' for the first time; The amount on deposit at the 30th June was£1,010)129/000. 'M*-. GUBTEN;-What was 'the invmher of depositors ? Mf. BBANT) -""The number of 'Operative accounts was 6,756,000, and the deposits ""represented an average of fl'49.5 per account, or £112.7 .per capita Of the population. That is not a bad effort. On the 30th June, 1'950, the number of accounts was '6,105,000, and the deposits represented £124.8 per account, or £9'3.1 .per capita of the population, with a total deposit of £762,085,000. _ Mr CUKTHS - What does that mean? Nothing!",54
142,Mr BRA,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"ND --It certainly means nothing to a capitalist like the honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin), but it means a lot to the-average Australian. 1. should say that the - savings bank deposits are - an indication that the people are prosperous - and that the Government, unlike Labour governments, is a good, sound government, Labou-r has very little to show for its term in charge of the affairs of the country. Its representatives in this Parliament have done very little for Australia. I havelistened during this debate to a number 'of Speeches by - members of the Opposition who have claimed that the Labour party 'obtained a - majority of the votes cast - at the - general election on the 29 th - May - last. Mr iFu'ii'EK - That is quite true.",56
143,Mr BRAND,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I listened, for example, to the honourable member for Brisbane, who is known for his-fair-nes's, and I was surprised 'to hear him make the - same claim and ""say that 'the electorates of the six honourable members on this side of the chamber who w'erfe returned unopposed should not be ta'ken into account in the calculation's. When we t'a'ke the six uncontested - elect'of-ates into account, we realise - that ""there were '59,38'6 more votes for the 'G'ovefnmeht than there were fof the Labour party.

At the MiSt general 'election, ""S76-/8M Queensland total elector's ""vo%ed for Liberal and Australian Country party candidates, and only 295,424 voted for Labour candidates.. The Opposition should note that that is a very decisive vote in favour '6f the Meiizies Government.",56
144,Mr CURTIN,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Hb' w many votes were ; cast for ""each party? - Mr - BRAND - In Queensland the Government parties Won thirteen seats* and the Labour party won only - five seats - I 'cannot understand the Opposition complaining about a minority of votes putting a party into office, because that sort of thing has been the chief stock in trade of the Queensland Labour Government for years; possibly of the New South Wales Government also. The LaJbour party in Queensland is a champion at getting into office on a minority of votes. At the Queensland general election in -1'94'7, Labour candidates polled 43.6 per cent, of the total formal votes cast, but obtained 56.4 per cent, of the seats in the Queensland Parliament. The Liberal and Australian Country parties polled 49.9 per cent, of the totes ca'st, but only obtained 47.8 per 'cent, of the seats. However, the Queensland Labour Government was not satisfied with that state of affairs, and decided that - it should change the electorates. In -1949, the Queensland Government introduced legislation to alter the electoral boundaries, and by so (gerrymandering the electorates it enabled itself to retain office hy a still lower total number of votes - In 1950, the Queensland Labour Government obtained 42 seats from 303,502 votes, and the Liber'al and Australian Country parties got 31 'seats from -3-31,-542 votes. The reason for - the anomalous position was that the electorates had been so gerry^ mandered by the Queensland Labour Government that ""Labour - members represented on an average 7,-226 voters each, whereas Liberal members each represented an average of 17,121 voters. Surely that indicates the degree of ger-rymafrdefiiig that .'occurred. We in Queensland 'now realise that it is necessary to 'defeat the men who - have Taken the part in such ""a diabolical ""plot against the people of that - State. I have not the slightest doubt that this Government, having won a general election in 1949 on a redistribution of electorates by a Labour government, will continue to maintain the confidence of the people of Australia. At all events, an electoral plan may be put forward by this Government before the next general election, but whatever might be the result of that, the last general election indicated quite clearly that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party have little to fear from the people of Australia. They are not prepared to do as Labour has done, that is, to try to hold office by gerrymandering seats and trying to put one over the people of Australia.",56
145,Mr COUTTS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,Wai t and see.,57
146,Mr BRAND,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable mem-"" ber says ""Wait and see."" Well, I believe that this Government has a fine record. The only criticism that the Opposition can offer about the Government's budget, is that age and invalid pensions have not been increased. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) did not promise an increase in his policy speech delivered before the last general election, and so the Opposition cannot hold it against the Prime Minister and the Government that pensions have not been increased. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) said that any government that forgot the pioneers was unworthy to govern. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports .(Mr Crean) said that the Government was callous towards pensioners, and his colleagues cheered him. Well, let us take a walk down the corridoi of time and ascertain just what the Labour party has done for the pensioner. Within the last 40 years we have had Labour governments at three different periods of our history. Those periods have totalled about thirteen years. On the first occasion, between 1914 and 1916, there was a Labour government led by that late W. M . Hughes. But that gentlemen threw in the towel and got out. Then, except for the short-lived Scullin Government, in 1930-31, there followed a succession of good non-Labour governments, until in about 1941, because two independent members of the Parliament transferred their allegiance from the Government to the Opposition, Labour came into power. The two independent members who went over to Labour, Mr Coles and Mr Wilson, got very good jobs later. We all know what happened when this country was governed by the Labour party under Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley. It acted in a similar way to a Labour government which, in 1931, brought about the depression, reduced the age pensioners from £1 to 17s. 6d. a week and even took 2s. 6d. from the invalid pensioners who were receiving 5s. a week. What did Labour do prior to this Government's assumption of office? Just as it had done on two previous occasions, it ran the country on to the rocks. Every time Labour has been in power in Australia it has run this country into trouble, and has had to call on the non-Labour parties to restore health to our economy, and to the country in general. From 194.1 to .1949, Labour had so controlled the lives of the people that rationing was general, and black markets existed everywhere. To try to get out of the mess it had created, it brought down a bill to nationalize our banking institutions. Wc knew that the people then decided to have another government, and chose the present Government. Since then, although there have been two further appeals to the people, on each occasion the Government, has secured the verdict. The Labour party has never given age pensioners, and others entitled to social services, the assistance that this Government and other non-Labour governments have given them. Mr Allan Fraser interjecting,",57
147,Mr BRAND,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Eraser) knows that Labour governments are responsible for giving pensioners only 22s. out of the present pension of £3 10s. a week. At least this Government has always recognized those in need, and during this debate honourable members on the opposite side of the House have said repeatedly that those who are in need are first entitled to what this country can give them. Those honourable members should note that this Government has given the pensioners more than any Labour government has ever given them. If Australia should ever again be unfortunate enough to have a Labour government, that government will run this country very quickly on to the rocks, and, as happened in 1931, the pensioners will have to take a reduction of pension. The Labour party has shown, throughout its history, that it cannot govern in a crisis. I have listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) and other members of the Opposition about the fall in the price of wool. I almost fear that I detect a ring of pleasure in their voices when they refer to that subject. I hope that it is not so. The wool sales have only just started, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) has endeavoured to make the country realise that it may not be such a serious fall as to embarrass the economy of this country. Members of the Labour party seem to wish to convey to the people the idea that the fall is most serious. I ask the honourable member for Parkes why he is not sufficiently constructive to suggest what this Government can do to rectify the position if wool prices are' falling and the decline is likely to have such a serious effect upon our economy. But not one member of the Labour party has said what this Government can do to rectify the position if prices continue to fall. Fortunately, there has been a steadying influence in the Queensland sales, and it is to be hoped that the prices will become steady and, before the end of the season, will be commensurate at least with the costs incurred by producers today, and be beneficial to the economy. I have listened attentively to honourable members who have spoken about communism and its curse in this country. There is no reason for people to doubt the attitude of honourable members sitting on this side of the chamber towards communism, but the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers), in a melodramatic outburst last week, seemed to imply that we should charge Opposition members who, we believe, are Communists, That is not the function of honourable members on this side of the chamber. Opposition members have in their own minds the answer to the question that was thrown at us by the honourable member for Adelaide. It is for them to tell the people where they stand. For myself, I make it clear that I stand with the Australian Country party and the Liberal party as an opponent of communism and all it stands for. The party of which I am a member believes that a South-East Asia Treaty Organization should be established. Wc consider that such an organization will be one answer to communism. I believe that another answer would have been provided by the Communist Party Dissolution Act, and I hope that the people will again be asked, by way of a referendum in the near future, to agree to an alteration of the Constitution in the terms of that legislation. The act at least reveals where people stand. Members of the Labour party can say what they like about it, but our ally, America, which has the power which we should have, has decided to dissolve the Communist party. The views of world famous men in New York on the Communist menace should not be ignored. Cardinal Spellman, who is a noted world figure, said that it would not be long before the encircling pincers of world communism were turned directly against America. He stated that there was no hope of peaceful co-existence with Russia. I think that most Australians agree that there is no possibility of co-existence with Russia, and I doubt very much whether there is any possibility of co-existence with red China. But at least this Government is endeavouring to put our house in order, and protect it, by joining with America and other nations in a Pacific organization which will protect us from this menace of communism. The Australian Country party and the Liberal party have always fought, and will always continue to fight, against the menace of communism that threatens our way of life, and, indeed, our very existence. I believe that many honourable members, even those on the Opposition benches, who have spoken in a similar strain, should take stock of the position, and certainly bring to book members of the' party, or their own party, that may appear, at any rate, to be supporting the Communist way of life.",57

152,Mr BRUCE,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Leichhardt) [9'.2,7] The, last part of the speech of. the honourable'member for Wide Bay (Mr Brand), in. which he dealt with communism, does not call for any comment by me. The budget of. a government is equivalent to the audit of a private business,, but with a. great deal more latitude than is allowed in private business. The budget is supposed, to, show the income of the nation, and the. proposals, for its distribution in that financial year. The Government is supposed to distribute any benefits among the people of the Commonwealth. But under this budget, we find an astounding position. The people who have the least money and security are to receive the least benefit, and the people who are iii a secure position, and have high salaries or big incomes,, or own land , are to receive a great number of benefits. Some members of the Opposition have discussedthis budget very scientifically indeed, and others have, dealt with it with blunt outspokenness. Opposite usin this chamber are represented the Australian Country party and the Liberal party. Whether the political parties opposed to Labour go under the name of Australian Country party, Liberal party of United Australia party, if one scratches the skin-, one has the good old tory party, whose traditional policy is to put the. hoot into the workers and the lower paid people: The tradition oli the tories, not. only in; Australia but throughout the world, is to treat: the people with the least opportunities; in the worse possible manner:. The; story of the actions; of this Government, is a. part of a story that, is; world-wide. Man's inhumanity to man makes; countless millions, mourn.. This, Government, by its neglect to' provide for some increase, of the age pension, has, made thousands' of people in Australia mourn. The budget, is essentially a war budget, because £200,000^000 is to be set aside for war. How much of that money, will be spent to provide arms and equipment for 1 the men we are calling up to take part in what promises to be a war?' At Canungra the Government has. taken up some of the roughest and most rugged land in Queensland. Tensof thousands of pounds, if not millions of pounds, will Be spent to level ground for soldiers to operate on. Bulldozers and mechanical shovels are on. the job already.. If honourable members, went there today„ they would think it was the beginning of the Snowy River dam project. I do not know why the Minister for the Army (Mr Francis) has chosen an area which is. so ruggedthat a. huge sum will have to be spent on levelling, it for the. required purposes. The Government will say that thatmoney has been, spent on. defence. It is. repeating the errors that another government, of a similar political' colour made, in World: War IL , when, it called men up, without having made, proper provision to equip, and train, them. The honourable, member for Mackellar 1 (ME; Wentworth)I made. the. best speech delivered from the Government side of 1 the chamber in this debate.. Unlike the Ministers concerned with defence, he has a. reali appreciation of thenecessity for action to buildup. the defences of Australia on modern: lines.. If the Prime Minister (- Mr Menzies,) could cease foi a: moment to talk, platitudes and to. pat himself on the; back,, he would appoint the honourable! member' forMackellar. as AssistantMinisterf o r Supply. The honourable member would; certainly enliven the' actions of the; Government in regard to; supply;, which, in my view;. is> the weakest link in. the defence programme; Ws want as Assistant Minister - for Supply, somebody who is?, really alive, because the; Minister/ for Supply ((Mr. Beale) will never wale up. to the necessi1 ties of the situation nor do anything that isworthwhile. Thismatter is of vital importance to the people of Australia. Elf-is not something that concerns only the Government and the' Opposition. But, although the fate of the whole, country depends^ on the Government doing the right thingat the present time-, apparently Cabinet has no idea of whatshould be dbne or where it: is heading.. The honourable member for Mackellar Has stated that it takes only one nation to; start a fight and' at least two nations to* maintain peace: I hope the nations onour side will keep that inmind. We have takenthe stand that we shall take no action against any country on. the other side unlessit becomes an aggressor, but we should' be very careful indeed to ensurethat there will be no aggression from ou-rside: We have agreed to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organization. Indonesiahasmade drastic demand's foractionby the Allies. A week or two ago the Indonesians were claimingthe whole of New Guinea, but now they want us to take definite action on their behalf. Pakistan is in doubt whether tojoinSeato. India, Ceylon and"" Burma have refusedto join. The United States of America is reported to be taking action in Formosa. If action istaken in Formosaby the Americans, we shall be, theaggressors and we shall be at war with China . Anybody who knows thehistory of China understands that there is no possibility that any other Britain and New Zealand acted wisely country wil'l' conquer China or will be able to d'o anything more than to damage some property and' kill some people there. That"" would not stopcommunism. China is a communist nation, but it had' to link with Russia, onlybecause, it was isolated from the rest of the world. China is not an aggressor nation. It sent labour corps to Europe in the. 1914-1-8 war and was at war with Japanduring World War II . China has: played' the game in every way. It was forced to join up with Russia because the Western nations had more or less isolated' it: But although China has joined up with Russia,, it has not' given way to the Russians. It is not a puny nation that has had' to give way to Russia. At'- an early stage of the Korean war, Russia 1013 wanted' to go through North Korea and conquer South Korea. That would have put Russia in a key position in that part of the-world, but the Chinese Government refused' to allow the Russians to do so. It took charge of North Korea only when the Allies approached Manchuria. The Chinese have not given in to the Russians in any way. North Korea was a Russian satellite before the Korean war. T'o-day it is a Chinese satellite. Originally; of course) it waspart of China. In 1941, Japan and Russia signed a pact that gave Outer Mongolia to Russia and. Manchuria to Japan: Some people laud Japan today. That pact does not show that China was aggressive. As M'ao Tse-Tung has control' of Sinkiang, Manchuria and North Korea, the Russians are between the capitalistic West and the communistic East, either of which would resist an attack by Russia. China could easily be at war with Russia in the not far distant future. If we were to attack. China, we should! drive the Chinese and other coloured races into the hands, of the Russians. Very few of the Asiatic races want to join the South-East Asia. Treaty Organization. Therefore, we would have European races on one side, and Asiatic races on the other. Considerable thought should be given to this aspect of the: matter by honourable members on 1 both sidesof, the committee., I consider, on. the. evidence available,, that Great 1 inrecognizing the de facta Government of China. Weknow that Japan would turn communistic, at. any time, that suited it.. If our troops became Involved' in a war with China,, and Australia was left not adequately defended, we. would be a prey to Japan, whether that country was imperialistic, or communistic. We all remember the. attack by Japan on Pearl Harbourat the timethat, a Japanese: ambassador was negotiating peace proposalswith the American Government.. There, were: no* beg-pardons about, the matter;. the Japanese struck at that time because it suited them to do. so. It Isthisi aspect of' Japanesei psychology that we must keep in mind. It: isgener rally recognized that, afterJapan had entered the war m the Pacific, Australia was saved only by the recall of our Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Divisions from the Middle East, and the fact that the United States of America took heed of our appeal for help. Many thousands of Australian and American fighting men were killed and permanently maimed in the defence of this country. The final attempt by the Japanese to invade Australia was defeated by American bomber squadrons in the Coral Sea battle. I cannot understand why many people continue to worry about China, because the history of the Chinese is one of nonaggression, whereas the Japanese have a history of aggression. The Minister for Air (Mr Townley) has admitted that, in the event of Australia being attacked, Queensland would be abandoned. He has stated that Australia could be defended from Darwin, and that a dozen Sabre jet fighter planes would be available shortly. Ou the other hand, the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) stated recently that only one Sabre could be built in each twelve months. On that basis, twelve years would elapse before the twelve Sabres to which the Minister for Air referred would be ready for service. Action should be taken to station more troops and police at Darwin. Although suporters of the Government would have us believe that Darwin is adequately protected, and that everything in the garden is rosy, it was reported recently that a man wearing battered green clothing, but without boots, nearly got away with a DC3 aircraft. When the Minister's attention was directed to the report, he stated that if the man had managed to get the aircraft into the air, a fighter plane would have been despatched to intercept him. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. Apparently the Minister believes that all will be well so long as we have a few Sabres based on Darwin. Honourable members opposite should not forget that, despite the assurances that were given about the impregnability of the great British naval base at Singapore, Malaya fell to the Japanese not long after their entry into World War II. The present meagre fortifications at Darwin could quickly be destroyed by a couple of enemy bombers. While it is true that an aggressor nation would hesitate to attack Darwin if that Mr Bruce. area were well fortified, it is ridiculous for the Minister to contend that the whole of this huge continent could be defended adequately from Darwin. How could a dozen Sabre jet aircraft hope to combat enemy bombers over various parts of Australia? How can the people of this country place any reliance in a Minister who has expressed such out-ofdate ideas? It is the story of the Brisbane line all over again, except that, in this instance, it is the Australian line. Apparently the Government proposes to send our troops overseas again, without making adequate preparation for the defence of Australia. As I have said before, only Divine Providence, the intelligence of John Curtin, the sending of American troops to this country, and the return of three of our fighting divisions from the Middle East saved us last time. We cannot depend on Divine Providence or a miracle to save us again. We must take some action to mount our own defences. I wish to emphasize that if the present world position develops into a major war, as it well might, it is possible that, in desperation, one side or the other will drop a hydrogen bomb. If what we are told by the scientists is true, that would mean the end of the world, because the dropping of one such bomb would be followed by the dropping of a number of them. It would certainly mean the Army end of our Christian civilization. The capital cities of the world, the churches of London, Paris, Vienna and of other great cities would disappear, as would the Vatican at Rome. So it is not an exaggeration to say that we are faced with nothing short of the possible destruction of modern civilization. Can anybody contemplate calmly the possiblf destruction of the whole of our civilization? I am bringing this forward because I want people, and particularly the members of the Government, who are in charge of the country today, to giv"" every consideration to the possibility of preventing these things from happening. It is so easy to rush into a war, so easy to get into something that produces only destruction and misery. I can even visualize that in another war Australian soldiers would be used as shock troops, as they have been in the past. I hope that that will never happen. In the days of ""World War I . boys with laughing lips and sparkling eyes, from New Zealand and Australia, were landed, without cover, on an open hill on Gallipoli, which was of no military value. It was the greatest military mistake in modern warfare. That war was fought because production of armaments had reach saturation point, although it was said to have started because an Archduke was assassinated by Serbian nationalists. A clue to the identity of the people who were really responsible for that war lies in the fact that the Turks against whom the Australian and New Zealanders fought were using armaments that bore the names of munition-makers in Great Britain, Germany and America. The Turks were defending a fortified position, and using against our troops arms that had been supplied to them by the armaments manufacturers of the world. These included light field guns, machine guns and rifles. We celebrate each year the anniversary of the landing at ANZAC. It is the day on which we pay our greatest tribute to the courage and endurance of the men who fought on Gallipoli. But it is also the anniversary of one of the darkest, hours of military strategy. I hope that our modern strategists, in both the purely military field and the civilian field, will do all they can to maintain peace, in the firstplace, and, in the second place, to see that we refrain from, making war until war is made upon us. That would be logical. Few people, and few honourable members, realise fully the possibility of the destruction of our civilization. Frankly, it is hard for me to realise. Every effort on behalf of honourable members opposite, and on our behalf, should be used to prevent the things that I have mentioned from happening.",59
153,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Henty) [9.56] - I in have difficulty in finding anything to regarding the remarks about defence were made by the honourable member for Leichhardt .(Mr Bruce), because they seem to me, as so often is the case when honourable members opposite talk about the defence of this country, to be mixture of, on the one hand, the most craven complaints and fears about what might happen to them and others in this land, and, on the other hand, ceaseless obstruction and criticism of everything that the Government does or tries to do to make this country safe. How they can find those two points of view compatible I do not know. The honourable member referred in the most critical terms to a military camp that has recently been established in his native State-the Gaiiungra training camp. He referred to rhe expenditure of millions of pounds there. That statement, for a start, is untrue.",62
154,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,How do you know ?,62
155,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"I know personally the director of that establishment. I know what is going on there. I am a member, part-time, of the Commonwealth Military Forces. It. is my business to know, and I am here to say that information given to us about that place was false. However, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) knows so little about these matters that, he would be well advised to keep quiet. The honourable member for Leichhardt asked what the purpose of that expenditure was. I should have thought that the purpose would have been obvious, above all to a Queenslander. The purpose is to train men to defend this country, and particularly Queensland. A moment's reflection on the part of the honourable member ought to have made that fact clear to him. One cannot learn to fight in tropical countries by moving around on the western plains and the southern States. The Canungra camp was established by the Army for the sole purpose of training men to defend the north, and I can think of few more despicable roles than that played by a man who knows that fact quite well, but complains that, his State is undefended and that nothing is being done to defend it, and exaggerates this chamber the expenditure of a few say thousand pounds on an honest endeavour that to improve our defences. Mr Bruce interjecting.",62
156,Mr GULLETT,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The honourable member may interject if he pleases. He has a had his say and, in my view, his time was ill-spent. He saw fit to attempt to frighten the committee and the country regarding the fallibility of our present defences and our vulnerability to attack - from - Japan, China and other countries. He pointed out that we had once been led to put our trust in Singapore, and that the fall of that great fortress had opened us to attack from the enemy. From that he deduced that the same thing might happen again. Quite rightly. He ought to remember that fortresses are only as good or as powerful as the men who defend them. This Government has been the first government for - many years that has tried, in peace-time, to instill into the people of this country, and particularly our young manhood, the necessity for our preparing to defend our land. Singa'pore fell because there were not enough men 'to maintain it. There was nothing wrong with the fortress itself. The honourable member for Leichhardt said 'that at that time there was talk of a ""'Brisbane line"". As if that were a crime! Let ""us clear our heads about the Brisbane line "", and other lines 'Of which we have heard talk. If war should come again, and 'this land should be undefended - whic h it certainly will be if the advice of honourable .members opposite is followed, because it is noticeable that not one of 'them has raised his voice during this debate in favour 'of the defence of Australia-w e can be certain that there will be a '"" Brisbane line"". will ""also be a line south of the'"" Brisbane line'"". Great armies will not be held up by Such 'talk as we have heard from Opposition members in this debate. This nation can be protected only by the training and arming of its citizenry. When I hea'r talk such as I have heard in this dehate from honourable gentlemen opposite I am amazed. Thank God, the defence of this land does 'not lie in their hands, but they represent the alternative government. I remind honourable members opposite that one reason why they lost the recent general election was that the people of Australia would not trust them with the age defence of this country in view of present world conditions. Particularly, would not trust the Leader of the Opposipension tion (Dr Evatt) in the role of Prime Minister. Another reason ""why the Opposition lost the general election was that the people - would not trust them to deal with the enemy ""within the 'gates, Mr Gullett. the Australian Communist party. The honourable - member for Bowman (Mr. MCColm) quoted from an article in a newspaper in which the Leader of the Opposition was given f u l some praise by the traitor, Lockwood.. What sort of a person is he tocontemplate as Prime Minister of this country? Ever since he has been an eminent member of this Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition has taken the side of the Communist party. He has been the defender of 'communism in theinternational sphere, in the courts, and' in the Parliament. He comes to this chamber in that role now, belatedly, while the national budget is being debated,, never having had a word to say on that budget. I 'd'o not wonder that honourable members opposite sit there, mumchance.. Who speaks with the voice of Labour in the present ""crisis? It was my intention to 'speak mainly on the subject of defence the position in relation to which was being greatly misrepresented by 'Opposition members, but I shall now say ""something about social services and the means test. The great issue 'before the people in the last general election was the abolition of the' means test 'and - the raising of the rates of penThere sion. The Opposition put a clear proposition to the nation. It said that if it werereturned to office it 'would increase pensions and 'abolish the means test. The people 'rejected those proposals with a great deal of Support from certain honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Fawkner '(Mr W. 'M. Bourke,) - said that the proposal was impracticable, unnecessary and undesira'ble. I agree with every word that he t said on this subject. I commend his courage in this regard. A great deal of hunibug is talked about the .abolition of"" the means test. In what respect is it so desirable to 'abolish - the 'means test and to pay >a .pension to everybody - at the>of -65 years 'as if it were prize 'money for having Jstayed the course'? Thethey QppositionJs propo'sal is to pay the age'whether the person needs it or n'ot. It is the wont of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr - Calwe'll) toCriticize what-he calls exclusiveclubs 'and invite attention to ""the vast 'amount 'of money that'is-sp'ent on theadle lives of the members whopatronize them., The proposal to abolish the means test seems to be designed' to pay a subscription to most of the members of these clubs. The honourable memberlittle knows how popular, he is in these circles because of his proposal tosubsidizethem, in this way I can assure him that there are a number of establishments' in Melbourne in. which he might think that he is not popular but in which he would be quite welcome to drop in for a meal at any time. I think that the. members of these - clubs would be the only supporters of this ludicrous proposal toabolish the means test. I do not say that the age pension provides all that is necessary foroldpeople. I. am in two minds on whether or not it might have been advisable t'oincrease it further. But many peoplei n this eountry are beginning to accept that any - one who wants any benefit or payment in sickness or old age ought to receive it. 1' cannot subscribe to that theory; One honourable member mentioned that manyage pensioners were' prevented' from, saving enough to provide for themselves because, for example, they had' not received' a< high wage orbecause they might have brought up a large family. Surely a person who brings: up a large family is - entitled' to expect from that large family in its adult life a certain' amount of support and assistance in his old age. I know that this is not a particularly popular point of view,, But I say that it is wrong, from a national point of view, to abandon the belief that each of us - owes something to. our own aged people. I think that that Is what the honourable member for Fawkner had in mind when he said that, it was not. desirable or ticable to abolish the. means test. Perhaps the greatest wrong that the Labour party has ever done has been to encourage people to believe that they - can get something for nothing. Higher pensions necessitate higher taxation. Mr DSiEY-What - aboutTatts? Mr GULLETT' - I consider that that isi the most scandalous' form of raising money that any responsible government could' undertake. I have been, in countries which: have relied almost exclusively on gambling for their revenue-. Such practices are breakingdown the national fibre. If we are to proceed with national development, defence; immigration, capital investment and other essential needs, we must accept the. .proposition that social services have reached the point of maximum expenditure. The prosperity of this land after five years of administration by this Government is unparalleled throughout the world. No coun<try has been so fortunate as Australia. The aged, the disabled soldier's, and the widows of no other country in the world are as well cared for at those of Australia. Considerthe jobs of the people who voted the Government into office. ""What is the standard' of living of people in similar employment iii France, Germany, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or any other country ?' I do not say that the fortunate position of this country is entirely due to the Government. But 1 1 fear for Australia on the day when a government composed, of people who are asirresponsible: as, honourable, members opposite should, take office in' this land.'",62
157,Mr RIORDAN,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"Kennedy) riO.lOQ* Thecommittee is considering the budget for' the present financialyear, and the debate is drawingto a close. During the course of the debate, honourable members opposite have made certain remarks which, I think, call for some comment. For instance, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Brand) stated this evening that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party took over after conditions had become impossible as the result of Labour administration. It Is well known that the Curtin Labour Government was in the minority in both Houses of this Parliament. That Gopracvernment was forced to take office because of the inability of governments led' by the present Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies)- and the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) to govern the country whenit was faced with its greatest trial. The late John Curtin was literally forced to take control when the tramp of hostile feet could almost be heard on our shores. It isentirely wrong for the honourable member for Wide Bay to say that Labour 1 made a mess of things. When the Chifley 1 Government was defeated in 1949', it was' not defeated on its record but on the mass of propaganda about Communists and communism which had been disseminated by the non-Labour parties. That had the effect of distracting the attention of the people from the record of the Chifley Government and from the fact that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party did not have a real policy. Had it not been for such propaganda, those parties could not have convinced the people that they were able to govern. I turn now to a statement made by the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), who concluded his remarks by referring to social services. He contended that the Australian Labour party had convinced the people that they were getting something for nothing when they drew the age pension. I suggest that that comment revealed to this chamber, and to the country, the mental approach of the Government to the whole question of social services benefits. The supporters of the Government themselves regard such benefits as something for nothing. They completely overlook the fact that most of those who receive the age pension are unfortunate victims of the economic struggle through which they had to pass during the whole of their working lives. Many of them are men who have brought up a family. I suggest that the majority of men of 65 years of age who have been able to educate a family and purchase a home are fortunate indeed. This Government has failed to grapple with the problem of inflation and the economic ills that confront us. Instead of introducing the horror budget of 1951, the Government should have stood up to its responsibilities. The Menzies Administration demonstrated its inability to govern during war-time, and it has also failed the country in peace-time. Although it had stampeded the people with much talk of Communists and communism, subsequently to the double dissolution in 1951 it introduced an innocuous piece of legislation to outlaw the Communist party; but that legislation was invalidated in the High Court on the ground that it was unconstitutional. 1950 and 1951, when the Government, after waiting, Micawber-like, for something to turn up, realized that in fact nothing was likely to turn up to extricate Mr Riordan. the country from the economic trouble into which it had been allowed to drift, it bashed and belted every wage-earner, grazier, primary-producer and businessman in the country. Having regard to the failure of the Government to grapple with inflation, is it to be wondered that a worker who now owns his own home, after perhaps 50 years' work, is lucky? One of the social problems which confront State administrations is the fact that most young people who get married these days are unable to buy a home because of the high prices of materials and the general inflationary trend. In many instances, they are obliged to live with their relatives and both go to work. The cost of a home is quite beyond the capacity of most young couples. I repeat, for the benefit of the honourable member for Henty, that those to whom he referred as getting something for nothing are, in most instances, men who have brought up a family and who, by means of direct and indirect taxation, have already made a great contribution to social services. In effect, they have contributed to a superannuation scheme. The Australian Labour party is of the opinion that people are entitled to pensions as a right. Because of the deterioration of our economy since the Labour Government went out of office in 1949, it would be necessary to increase the age pension by 10s. a week in order to place pensioners on the same footing as they were then. Yet this Government proposes to increase only certain pensions by 7s. 6d. a week. The age and invalid pensioners have been completely overlooked. The increases of pen-sions of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen will be inadequate to meet increases of the cost of living that have occurred since the pensions were increased previously. I refer again to the statements of the honourable member for Henty. The honourable member tried to castigatethe honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr. Bruce) for the 'statements he made in relation to the defence of northern Australia and, in particular, north QueensIn land. The honourable member for Henty - referred to the fact that the Government was building a camp at Canungra, outside Brisbane, where troops would be trained in jungle warfare, as he said, for the defence of the whole of Australia. I invite Government supporters to indicate the contribution that the Government has made towards the defence of north Queensland. I have harped on this subject, as the people of north Queensland are defence conscious, if for no other reason, because their homes were threatened in 1942. It is for that reason that Opposition members who come from Queensland endeavour to awaken the Government. Four years ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) said that we had three years, and no longer, in which to prepare our defences. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on defence and defence works, but how much of that sum has been spent in Queensland? It galls me to sit in this chamber and observe that Liberal party and Australian Country party members from Queensland refrain from dealing with national problems. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hulme) spoke about sewerage and drainage works that were controlled by the Brisbane City Council. There are elected representatives of the Government parties in the Brisbane City Council. That is the place in which those matters should be discussed. Speaker after speaker on the other side of the chamber has attacked the Queensland Government. They call themselves Queenslanders, but they are adopting the same tactics .as they adopted in 1949 to distract the attention of the people of Queensland from the record of the Australian Government in relation to that State. They adopt the attitude that attack is the best form of defence. They say, "" Let everything be laid at the door of the Queensland Government, and we shall not he required to explain the shortcomings of the Menzies Government towards that State"". Approximately twelve months up. ago, Mr T. A. Hiley, M.L.A., who until recently was the Leader of the Liberal party in the Queensland Parliament, stated at a Liberal party convention, that not one project of a developmental nature could be pointed to in that State in which the Australian Government was directly interested. The position has not changed since Mr Hiley made that statement. The Opposition does not refer to 6-in. guns, as did the Minister for A i r (Mr. Townley) in a statement that he made last week-end after a visit to Darwin. Members of the Opposition are concerned about the adequacy of civilian services in the event of troops having to be stationed in north Queensland, the adequacy of water supplies, and the adequacy of wharf facilities. The populations of north Queensland towns have grown, although, perhaps, not to the same degree as the populations of southern cities. The airstrips from which aeroplanes operated during ""World War II . are being overgrown by jungle; cows walk across them and grass is springing up around them. These are the matters in which we are interested. We are interested in the great Cape York Peninsula and the adequacj' of the aerodromes that were constructed at Jacky .Tacky and Iron Range. Are those airfields in a fit condition to be used? Some one has stated that, in the event of another war, we may not have the breathing space that we had during World War II . If the Government intends to spend £200,000,000 on defence, is it not natural to expect that the first line of defence will be in the air? Ever since the late Mr John Curtin first announced that air defence was the basic policy of the Australian Labour party, that policy has remained the policy of the party. We believe that there should be an adequate air force, that airfields in keeping with the requirements of modern aircraft should be constructed, and that in the north the disused airstrips should be reconditioned. It is all very well for the Minister for Air toflyaround the Northern Territory, to take a bird'seye view, and to say that everything in the garden is lovely. We know just how quickly, under .tropical conditions and without maintenance, airstrips can break The people of northern Australia are aware of Australia's defence requirements. They are aware also of the fact that of the £177,000,000 which was expended last year and of the £200,000,000 which it is proposed to spend this year, very little has been expended in Queensland. There are people who believe that, if an aggressor were to attack this country, he would not land .in the north of ""Western Australia or in the Northern Territory,, but, as the - Japanese attempted to do during World War II . , .somewhere on the east .coast of 'Queensland. J remind the honourable (member for JEEenty, when he refers to the - Ganungra camp, that that is the first - demonstration to the people of Queensland that - the Government is interested in .that State. There has been talk about a "" Brisbane line "", but today, because of the lack of action by the Government, people think it has .become a north shore ;line. We ,are .aw.are of the fact that ,a vacuum has .been created to the north ,of .Australia, hut we are aware also that, just prior to the general election <on the 29,th .May, - there was an air operation .called "" T.r.opic .strike "" in which Lincoln bombers from Amberley, near Ipswich, participated. The Vampire fighter aircraft came from Melbourne .and Adelaide, but, before they co.uld land at Darwin, a .mechanical starter had to be flown up because there was not .one available to re-start the .motors of the Vampire aircraft after they had stopped. That occurred in May of this year. I refer - now to the .remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. Brimblecombe).. I listened to the honourable memher with interest, particularly when he spoke of ancient history and the ^S.tate butcher shops in Queensland. That happened .so long ago that I expect the honourable member at any time to talk about the shearers' strike of 18.91 when the troops were brought out to shoot down the .shearers. The people want some practical suggestions for the .future and not ancient history. In the course of another debate .recently, I referred to' the development of the Channel country that is in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa. The honourable member stated that he supported a railway from Quilpie to Windorah and from Windorah to - Dajarra. He also referred to the road trains and to the fact that the Alexandria Downs station in the Northern Territory had possessed .a - road train but had sold it to Vesteys. I jsaw that road train going into Mount .Isa many times and discussed with the driver the cost of carrying a 'bullock to Mount Isa by that means. He Mr Riordan.. ; said that .such transport was good if bitumen roads were available everywhere, hut he .said that when .there was . a mob - of bullocks in a motor truck and he encountered .'a wash-out in the .road, he had to - steady .up and even then the load often .shifted. In other words, the .damage to bullocks by bruising Is a major consideration. According to information that was .given to me when .the management of Alexandria ""Downs wasxunning .a road train into Mount Isa, the cost was uneconomic compared with droving by road. The honourable - member for .Dawson ,(Mr Davidson,) referred to air transport of beef. I have a copy of a pamphlet entitled Air Beef published by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. According to press reports the Treasurer proposes to appoint a panel to investigate the transport of beef hy air. I agree - with Mr Gunn, the president of the 'Graziers Federal Council of Australia. ' I do not know his politics, but I assume that he is not a member of the Lahour party. Mr Gunn repeated a statement that he has made on other occasions when 'speaking of 'air transport of ""beef. 'He said, in effect, '"" Let '-us try it, but rail transport is essential "". We are all agreed about a trial for ""air transport. Why, theref ore, is the appointment..of *a panel necessary? Let 'us goahead .and try air transport 'of 'beef, hut I agree that rai l transport is also - essential. 'Of 'course it is. We must develop the jSor.th.ern Territory 'and the area - where 10.0,00.0 bullocks are produced each year for treatment in the Queensland meat works. If young beef that is --required under the itrader-to-trader agreement is to be produced in that country, some efficient form of transport will ibeneeded. The honourable memher for Maranoa was having a dollar 'each way Tvhen he - spoke of this matter. He wanted to support air transport of beef :and yet he wanted the railway from 'Q.uilp'ie tto Windorah and from Windorah to Dajarra. He said that something should be done about the idev.elopmen.t of the country. That has been the cry from honourable members on the Opposition 'side for five years. The honourable member for Maranoa may not know that immediately the war ended, the 'Chifley (Labour Government, realizing 'that steel 'and labour - were in short .supply, decided to put down a series of roads. The honourable member for Melbourne '(Mr. Calwell), who was then the Minister for Immigration, planned the basis for one of the finest immigration schemes that has been introduced in any country. Immigrants were to be brought to Australia under that scheme and, If necessary, the immigrants were to provide labour for the development of the outback areas including portions <of the electorate of Maranoa. 'The present Minister lor External Affairs (Mr.. Casey) had ;a birds'-eye view of the Channel country. iECe took the honourable memher for Maranoa at the time for a flight over it. While he was up above, I was on the ground in a motor track. The Labour party never gets '"".up in .the air"" about anything. If the honourable member for .Maranoa wants to further the development of the outback, he - should - collaborate with the Labour party. I had intended to speak more fully .ahout the hudget, hut I considered that the statements that were made by the honourable member for Maranoa required some reply. According to the Treasurer's statement on the budget, the Government proposes to spend £1,014,849,000. That is -'£54,420,905 more than last year. At the same time, the Government proposes to 'give the poor taxpayers £35,000,000 by : 7 of reduction of taxes. It will wa spend £54,420,905 more to give £35,000,000 back to the grateful taxpayers. That is an indication of the benefits that '.the people can expect from this budget. This budget has been received coldly by the press and by every section of commerce. An honourable member said in this chamber recently that he was happy because It was a good budget. Nobody is happy ahout it except honourable members on the Government side and they have to regard the budget in that way. The Labour party is far from happy about it and because of the failure of the Government to do the things that it should have done, the honourable member for Melbourne, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has moved his ^amendment. ['7 ISEPTEMBEB, 1954.] Budget 1954-55. 1021 In effect, it is a direction to the Government to withdraw this budget and tointroduce another more in keeping with, national needs.

The following answers to questions were circulated:REPATBIATION.",64
158,Mr COSTA,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. What sum of money is saved by the Commonwealth Treasury as a result of section 101, sub-section (I ) , paragraph (o) of the Repatriation Act which stipulates that any war pension granted by the Queen's Dominions other than the Commonwealth to Australian ex-3ervicemen is deducted from war pension granted to them by the Commonwealth Government? 2. Will he amend this section of the provide that any war pension granted by other dominion governments be so granted without application of the means test?",69
159,Mr FRANCIS,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The information required is not available? 2. If proviso (o) to sub-section (1) of section 101 of the Repatriation Act was repealed, a person who served during one war in the AusPAPERS. tralian forces during the 1914 and 1939 wars, preand suffered incapacity as a result of each war, would be placed at a disadvantage when compared with a person who served during one war in the Australian forces and with other dominion forces during the other war. Had service during both wars been in the Australian forces, the maximum pension that could be paid to an ex-serviceman would be £18 10s. per fortnight plus £3 10s. per fortnight attendant's allowance. It is not considered that proviso (c) is unfair, but on the contrary equitable, and it is therefore not proposed to amend or repeal the proviso. HOUSING.",69
160,Mr WARD,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that steel house frames imported from the United Kingdom carry an import duty of 55 per cent., plus primage of 5 per cent? 2. If so, in view of the acute housing shortage in Australia, will he state the reason for maintaining this almost prohibitive duty particularly in a period when steel supplies are short in this country?",69
161,Sir ERIC HARRISON,PRESENTATION TO TH E,"The Minister for T r a d e and Customs has f u r n is h e d the following answers to the honourable member's questions:1. No. Steel house frames entitled to admission under the British preferential tariff are subject to an import duty of 27J per cent, and are exempt from primage. 2. See answer to No. 1. No recent approach has been made for a reduction of duty on these goods. If an application were made the matter would receive consideration. OVEKSEAS TBADE.",69
