Has the honourable gentleman, as repreI senting the Commonwealth Government, received notice of the intention of the company to apply for such a writ? Does he know whether the proceedings of the company have, or have not, been instituted with an eye to certain other prosecutions which may be instituted by the Commonwealth Government, or whether this action of the company is not an attempt to "" h a m s t r in g "" Parliament?",14
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I was informed yesterday that a writ had been issued, and .that the Chief Justice had fixed Monday next to hear an application for an interim inipis. junction directed against the Commission pending the hearing of the case. The Crown was not present when leave was granted, nor was it informed of these proceedings, which were ex parte. It is the intention of the Crown to be represented on Monday, and to oppose the application. I am quite unaware of the motives that have actuated the company in applying for the writ. But I think that if the public are not altogether blind, they must see that there is something very much worth hiding when a company of this sort persistently decline to give any information to a properly appointed Commission of Inquiry, and stillmaintain this attitude when the personnel of the Commission to which they took strong exception has been quite changed.",14
5,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister and Treasurer whether, in view of probability of this Parliament not being able to consider this session the report from Royal Commission appointed to inquire The into the sugar industry, and in view also of the fact that there will.be a shortage in sugar production in Australia, he will conthe advisableness of the Commonwealth Government taking on the business see of the importation of the sugar necessary for Australian requirements, especially seeing that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will, in all probability, be. the oniy importer of sugar, and the only dealer in imported sugar.

I would like the Prime Minister to take this matter in hand, and I ask him if he will see that a definite statement of the policy of his Government, in connection with the construction of a line from Yass-Canberra to Jervis Bay is placed before the Committee before its inquiry closes?",15

"" Mr WATKINS (for Mr BAMFORD) asked the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice I. Whether the Department of Home Affairs advertised in the Sydney newspapers during the month of July last inviting tenders for the supply of the followingtimbers:-Queenslan d beech, Queensland black walnut, Queensland maple, Queensland bally gum, Queensland yellow wood, Queensland silky oak, and Cairns kauri pine? 2. Was an advertisement of a like nature inserted in any Queensland newspaper; if so, which ? 3. Is the Minister aware that North Queensland is the principal source of supply for nearly all the timbers named? 4. Is the Minister further aware that several newspapers circulating in the timber districts are published at Cairns and elsewhere in North Queensland ? 5. If the Minister is so aware, will he say why tenders for the supply of these timbers were not invited through the medium of the said newspapers ? 6. Is it the desire of the Minister that these timbers should be supplied through the middlemen timber merchants of Sydney? 7. If this is not the wish of the Minister, he, when further supplies of North Queensland timbers are required, insure that tenders shall be invited in the districts from which supplies of the timbers named are principally drawn? 8. Does the Minister consider it a good business proposition to invite tenders in such a manner as to handicap possible tenderers in the locality in which the article required is produced ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are-1. Yes, and also for other timbers. 2. Yes, in the Brisbane Courier, Daily Mail, and Worker. Advertisements were also inserted in the Commonwealth Gazette, which can be at anv official post-office throughout Australia. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. I am aware that are several local newspapers, and I have already amended. given instructions that in any future cases this kind advertisements are to be sent to the principal local newspapers circulating in timber districts. It is manifestly necessary limit Commonwealth advertising, and in most cases it is found that advertisements in the leadnewspapers of the capital cities give the requisite publicity. As the Brisbane newspapers throughout Queensland, it is not seen how the timber merchants of Sydney are &iven preferential treatment, or any Queensland is prowould-be tenderers handicapped. STATE CONFERENCE. Mr W.

26,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.45] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Those who have been members of this Parliament since its inauguration are aware that it has on four separate occasions dealt with the bounty question in regard to the sugar industry. The first Bill was introduced, during the session of 1901-2, by the late Charles Cameron Kingston, and provided for the giving of a rebate to growers of cane employing white labour. That will measure was amended in 1903, because it was thought that we had not the power to give an advantage to certain growers by allowing a rebate to them, and provision was made for the payment of a bounty. There were other reasons for the amendment of the law which I shall not go into now, because I have no wish to detain the House on this subject very long. I may say, at the outset, that the present Bill is not the result of the correspondence with the Premier of Queensland relating to the abolition of the sugar bounty and Excise recently seen laid on the table, it having been drafted before that correspondence commenced. In there 1905, the law on the subject was again The rate of bounty had been of fixed on a sliding scale, under which it the would have ceased to be payable in 19 iz. to It was thought, however, that, were the bounty discontinued, the cane-growers and the workers in the industry would have .guarantee of the continuance of fair tions, but would be handed over completely to the monopoly that is running the business today. It is not my intention to deal with that company now, in view of certain questions that have been asked this mornof ing, but at any other time. I should be prepared to say exactly what I think cerning it. Tf the bounty and Excise duties were abolished, this Parliament would have any control over the sugar industry, which would then be in the same position as the other protected industries. When amending Bill of 1905 was before the Senposite ate, the present Minister of Defence moved an amendment providing that the Minister of Trade and Customs should withhold whole or any pan of the bounty payable if he found that the wages paid by the growers were below the standard rate vailing in the district where the cane was being grown. That was the first recognition in this Parliament of what has been termed the new Protection.",16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What does the Minister mean by the new Protection?,17
28,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"On e phase of it is the securing to the workers of a fair share of the profits of the industry in which they are engaged. Previously, no conditions were attached to the payment of bounty; those growing the cane could pay their white workers less than the blackfellows were getting if they could obtain assistance at such rates.",17
29,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I think that the Minister is mistaken ,17
30,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The 1903 Act contains no conditions regarding labour. In the Act of 1910, the conditions of employment and not name one. rates of wages were dealt with more fully thaii they had been in 1905. Now the obligation is laid on the Minister not to the bounty if the conditions of employment and rates of wages are inferior to those vailing in the district; and if , on his cation, an Arbitration Court declares not to be fair and reasonable, he may withhold the whole or any part of the At the present time, the position is this: The sugar is grown, the workers have been employed upon it,» harvesting operations have been performed, the cane is turned into raw sugar, and the farmer can ask for is to assist the cane-growers. his bounty. But the Minister can with the hold it if he finds that rates of wages conditions of employment have not been no fair. Now that, in my opinion, is startcondiing at the wrong end. The workers engaged in this industry are not permanent employees. In a great number of cases, they go to the sugar districts from the southern States, leaving again at the end the season. Even if the Judge of the Arbitration Court found that the rates of conwages and conditions of employment had not been fair, there would be very little not chance of getting hold of the workers to insure that they would afterwards be paid the wages to which they were entitled. I the have been told by honourable members opthat I could have avoided the sugar strike of last year if I had chosen to fix wages. Many honourable members on that the side have made the statement that the strike of 1911 need not have taken place had I exercised the power which I have preunder this Act of fixing wages.",17
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Who said that?,17
32,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Many honourable members.,17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What honourable members ?,17
34,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Senato r Chataway in the Senate said so, at any rate, and several honourable members have done so here. I am positive of that. I think the honour the able member for Franklin did.",17
35,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I never said so.,17
36,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member said that the strike of 1911 need not have taken place if I had cared to fix rates of wages.,17
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I never said that.,17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister can,17
39,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I can name more than one, and I shall not be like the honourable pay member for Lang, who said that it could prenot be shown that he voted for the "" gag,"" applithough his name was immediately shown to them be in the division list. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is an bounty. absolute misstatement of fact.",17
40,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister should not let his tongue run away with him.,17
41,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What I am anxious to do I believe method proposed will be an easy way and out of the difficulty, and will not have the effect of holding up the bounty.",17
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Com e back to the point, and tell us who those honourable members were who made the statement which the Minister has alleged.",18
43,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I can look them up.,18
44,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister says that the 1910 Act began at the wrong end.,18
45,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes .,18
46,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,At whose instance was that Act passed?,18
47,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was in charge of it and I considered at the time that we were doing a good thing. But I did notfixa wage of 22s. 6d. a week and found, as i was fixed by a Ministry whom the honortions able member supported.",18
48,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I never supported such a proposal.,18
49,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! If honorfair able members behave in this unseemly manner the business of the House cannot obtain fair conditions. be properly conducted.,18
50,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I rise to order.,18
51,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Order ! the honourable member for Lannecoorie, who has risen to order is speaking loudly, unable to hear him in consequence of the conversation which is going on.",18
52,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish to know whether it is in order for the Minister make a statement regarding the support before. which a member of this House gave to proposal, which statement is absolutely outside the fact?",18
53,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What is the point of order ?,18
54,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is the point of order.,18
55,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not possible for last year. me to know whether a particular statement is true or untrue. I cannot say whether the Minister's statement was correct or otherwise. Therefore I cannot say that it Arbitration Court. was out of order.,18
56,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I assure you, M Speaker, that it was out of order.",18
57,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,If the. honourable memfairly. ber for Laanecoorie considers that thing I said was a reflection upon him I to the Judge. wish to assure him that I had no such deBy sire.,18
58,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It was a scandalous statement. The Minister said that supported a wage of 22s. 6d. per week and found. I never did such a thing in my life.,18
59,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This is the third time that I have had to appeal to honourable members for order. I again ask them to cease conversation and allow the Minister to proceed with his speech.,18
60,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As I have already said, in my opinion, the existing Act starts at the wrong end. The honourable member for Laanecoorie asked me whether it was passed at my instance, and I said it was. If I make a mistake I am not afraid to , own up to it. I do not desire to place the blame on any one else's shoulders. I believe that the Act starts at the wrong enri t for this reason : The whole of the operaare finished before the bounty can he claimed. It would then be difficult to find the men who had been employed-, in the industry, and who ought to have obtained conditions. I believe that honourable members are all anxious that they shall No honourable member has"" suggested that the conditions set forth in the recent order are too good or the wages too high. As the Minister is Although not allowed under the Act to refer the mat-ter to the Judge of the Arbitration Court, I am or to any Industrial Board or Court, the position is unfair to the worker, unfair to the farmer, aud unfair to the Judge, who was expected to decide upon a matter which to might have been concluded twelve months 1 looked into the matter, and a found that I could have stopped the payment to some farmers recently on the bounty they claimed on last year's crop, even though the work had been done twelve months before. But I determined that I would not do that. I would not stop ihe payment of bounty on cane which had benii produced and had been turned into sugar But this year I published rates of wages and conditions of employment dealing with the subject, and showing that I was anxious that the case should go before the I do not think that the Minister should be placed in the posir . tion of having to act as an Arbitration Court. He cannot judge the matter I am, therefore, anxious that the anyMinister should be able to refer it The Bil l is a short one. clause 2, section 9 of the Sugar Bounty Act is amended, and power is given to the Minister to make application to the President of the Commonwealth Court of ConI ciliation and Arbitration or to any Judge of any State Court, or to any persons composing an Industrial Court.",18
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is this Bill urgent?,19
62,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes ; because the whole of the bounty will be hung up until the measure is passed,19
63,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Why will the bounty be hung up?,19
64,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"-It will be hung up unless the wages set forth in the recent order issued by me are paid. If the specified wages and conditions of employment are observed, of course the bounty will be paid; but I take it that no honourable member would desire that the bounty should be paid unless fair conditions are observed and fair wages paid. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is the reason why the bounty was granted by Parliament.",19
65,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. The Bill gives to the Minister of the day the power to refer the question directly to a Judge for decision. At present, I have no further power than that given by the Act» to withhold the bounty; and that can only, be done after the investigation is complete. Such a position I do not consider desirable, because it is much better to have the matter settled once and for all, so that those engaged in the industry may know exactly where they stand. In the case of the harvester industry, an Act was passed in 1906 fixing a rate of Excise. It provided that those engaged in the manufacture of harvesters should pay £ 6 per machine to the Department of Trade and Customs, or give fair wages and conditions; but, in the meantime, a great number of machines had been turned out, and the manufacturers complained that they did not know what they had to pay. Under these circumstances, this Bill has been introduced ; and an important point in it is the definition of "" standard rates "" in paragraph b of proposed clause 4. The definition is contained in the following wordsI f the Minister finds that the rates of wages ancl conditions of employment, or any of them(6) Are below the standard rates and conditions applicable to the locality and agreed upon between representatives of associations of employers and employees registered under any Commonwealth or State Act, - the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bountv payable. We know that individuals may be persuaded to sign agreements to take less [""7] wages than are fair and just, and, in some cases, a few men thus got together may make it appear that a standard rate has been fixed. The two principal features of the Bill are, first, that it allows the Minister to refer the matter to a Judge as soon as possible; and, secondly, that it defines the term "" standard rates."" I trust that honourable members will do their best to pass the Bill into law, so that the questions which arise under it may be settled by the most competent authorities.",19
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Minister say what the Government policy is in regard to Mr Denham's proposal?,19
67,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That has not yet been considered by the Cabinet.,19
68,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,When will it be considered ?,19
69,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I see by the letter that the Prime Minister suggested that the proposal might be dealt with next Parliament.,19
70,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Minister not consider it before then?,19
71,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am prepared to consider it at any time, because my desire is that the workers shall be safeguarded in this industry, as well as in every other.",19
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister is a long while about it !,19
73,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I must ask the honourable member for Parramatta and other honourable members not to continually interject.,19
74,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Some honourable members opposite have made the statement that the strike of 1911 need not have taken place had I exercised the powers I possess. In the debate on the Address-in-Reply, as reported in Hansard of 13th September, 1911, page 413, the honourable member for Richmond saidThere was no reason for a strike, so far as the field workers were concerned, because, if the Minister believed, as he said he did, that their demands were not excessive, he had it in his power to fix the rates of pay at what they asked.",19
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite right - so the Minister had.,19
76,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The report in Hansard proceeds,19
77,Mr CHARLTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member would have been the first to condemn him had he interfered at such at - ne. :,19
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My point is that the Minister had determined, and was responsible for, the rates that were being paid, and had he been a man he would have insisted on the strikers going back to work at those wages. As for the mill hands, the regulation of their wages is within the power of the Wages Boards. There was, therefore, no reason at all for the strike. The honourable member for Richmond and other honourable members said that. I - ought",19
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What other honourable members?,20
80,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member knows that I have lately been busily engaged with the Navigation Bill, and I have not had time to look up all the speeches made in this connection. I am, however, quite safe in saying that several honourable members opposite stated that it was within my power to fix the rate of wages. That is a power which the Minister ought not to have, but one that ought to be exercised by an industrial tribunal, either by the employers and employees meeting together, or by the President' of the Arbitration Court, or some person to whom he can delegate the duty under the Act. I trust the Bill will be passed into law, and thus give the workers better conditions than they have been able to obtain hitherto, and improve the position of all engaged in the industry.",20
81,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Richmond) [ i 1.5] - The remarks I made on the Address-inReply in 1911. I am prepared to make today; there is nothing I then said that is not in strict accordance with fact. The position I took up was that, when the men made a claim for certain wages, the Minister had the power to inquire whether or not the wages claimed were the standard rates applicable to the district, and, if they were, he could at once declare them to be the standard rates, and determine that no bounty should be given until such wages were paid. That is the position the Minister was then in, and it is the position he is in today.",20
82,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member say that I have the power to fix the standard rates?,20
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; but that is what the Minister has done. What he has power to do is, when a claim is made by the men, to investigate and find out whether the claim represents the standard rates, and, if he determines that it does, he may there and then, under the Act, withhold the bounty until the wages are paid. Under the regulations recently issued, the Minister has taken it upon himself, without any claim being made by the men, or without being approached in any way by the growers, to set up what he declares to be the standard rate of wages; and in this he has done what is absolutely illegal. Honourable members, whether, like myself, they have been only a short time in the House, or have been in this Parliament for a long time, know that, from the inception of this Parliament, the sugar industry has been peculiarly cared and legislated for. Whether that care and legislation have beenbeneficial to the industry, or whether the legislation was designed to be beneficial to the industry, is another question; but T venture to say that it has not been designed, or thought to be, or desired to be, for the benefit of the industry, but for a very different purpose altogether.",20
84,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is a great reflection on this Parliament, and on some honourable members opposite who supported the legislation. Ur. GREENE - Not at all. I maintain that the primary object of the legislation this Parliament has passed from time to time in connection with the sugar industry has not been to the benefit of the industry. It has been passed for an ulteriorpurpose.",20
85,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,For the purpose of securing; a decent wage for the people employed itithe industry.,20
86,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; that was not the purpose. What has really been the object of this legislation? Honourable membersknow it as well as I do. It has been to give effect to a plank in the platform of all political parties in Australia for many years, namely, the White Australia policy.",20
87,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the honourable member against'that?,20
88,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I am for it all the time. I say that what Parliament set out to accomplish by this legislation waste enable sugar to be grown by white labour throughout the Commonwealth, and to dispense with the black labour, which waslargely engaged in the industry at the inception of the Commonwealth. What wasit that Parliament did to give effect to that White Australia policy? It had not the power to do directly what it desired. What it did was to manipulate two legislative powers which it possesses, and,, by the imposition of an Excise on the onehand, and the granting of a bounty on the-other, it was enabled to bring pressure to bear on the grower in such a way that he was practically compelled to abandon black - labour and employ white labour in its stead. Honourable members have only to look at thefiguresof the Budget-papers to see what has been the effect of this legislation. It has had the effect we all desire of gradually reducing the coloured labour employed in the sugar industry to a very small percentage indeed. That was the primary object of our legislation with regard to the sugar industry, and it has been accomplished. But that legislation was never of the slightest benefit to the sugar-growers, ancl never will be of any benefit to them financially, and it was not intended to be.",20
89,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They have been given the benefit of Protection.,21
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall deal with that presently. In the manipulation of the powers of legislation we possess, we imposed an Excise of £ 4 . ' per ton on all sugar manufactured. But who pays that Excise? Is it the consumer? Does the manufacturer, after he has paid the Excise, pass it on to the consumer?",21
91,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member should ask the honourable member for Franklin.,21
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Without asking anybody, I will tell the honourable member for Denison, if he does not know.",21
93,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member should have some knowledge as to who pays it. "" Mr MASSYGREENE - The manufacturer deducts the amount of the Excise from the price he pays to the grower for his cane. I can prove that down to the ground.",21
94,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Unde r the ground, the honourable member means.",21
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I do not, because were it put under the ground where the Attorney-General would desire to see it, it would be out of sight and out of the way, and I desire that it should be put where every one can see it. If the Attorney-General had not been so anxious to put it out of sight he would have read the evidence already given before the Sugar Commission, but which we, unfortunately, are not yet in possession of. He would have seen that it has been proved before the Commission in open Court, on the sworn testimony, not only of growers, but also of manufacturers, that the whole of the Excise which this Parliament has imposed on the manufacture of raw sugar is charged to the growers. It has been given in evidence that the Excise at present collected from'the manufacturers has resulted in the following deductions from the prices paid for cane in the several sugar districts mentioned. Honourable members are, no doubt, aware that the sugar-growing districts have been divided into four for the purpose of the bounty, and our sugar legislation. In the case of No. 1 district, the amount deducted on account of the difference between bounty and Excise is 2s. 6d. per ton; in No. 2 district, the deduction is 2s. 4d.; in No. 3, it is 2s. 2d.; and in No. 4, it is 2S. per ton. Honourable members are aware that the sugar-growers are under an arrangement or agreement with the manufacturers in most districts for the purchase of their cane at certain prices. I have, unfortunately, mislaid a copy of an actual agreement, which I should have been glad to produce for the inspection of honourable members. In that agreement, it is stipulated, year by year, what the price to be paid for cane shall be; whether in a lump sum, or on the sugar contents of the cane supplied. The agreement goes on to set out that, in the event of the bounty and Excise coming to an end, there and then the amounts of the deductions which I have quoted shall be added to the price which, under the agreement, the manufacturer stipulates to pay to the producer for his cane. There is, in black and white, on the face of these agreements, the most definite testimony that it is the growers who are paying the Excise upon the manufactured sugar. All the manufacturers of raw sugar who have appeared before the Sugar Commission have given unequivocal testimony that, the moment the Excise and bounty cease, they are willing to pay to the growers the amounts to which I have already referred in excess of the prices which, under their agreements, they are now paying for cane. So that, if this Parliament, in its wisdom, sees fit to repeal the bounty and Excise, it will add these amounts to the growers' proceeds from their cane.",21
96,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What has that to do with this Bill?,21
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It has everything to do with the Bill. Suppose that, instead of imposing this Excise on the manufacturer, Parliament had imposed - it upon the grower direct, and had then paid the bounty, it would have done what was illegal, and the High Court would have declared it so. Parliament happened to be in the position of having an intermediary upon whom it could impose the Excise duty, and it let that intermediary pass it on to the grower. Having imposed the Excise upon the manufacturer, Parliament granted the bounty to the grower of the cane. The bounty was fixed at £ 3 per ton, and, consequently, there was a difference of £ 1 per ton between the Excise which was charged to the grower and the bounty which was granted to him by this Parliament. So far as the operation of the bounty and Excise is concerned, the cane-growers have nothing for which to thank this Parliament.  duty?",21
98,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I will deal with that question in a moment or two. I find that, since the initiation of this policy, the Excise which has been charged against the sugar manufacturers, and by them passed on ""to the cane-growers, amounts to .£5,879,148; whilst the bounty which has been paid to the growers aggregates £3>71*>5'93Deducting the latter sum from the former, we get .£2,100,555. I i w s n bers to reflect upon these figures, because they will then see that, as the result of the operation of the bounty and Excise system, the growers have actually paid into the Consolidated Revenue no less a sum than .£2,100,555. For the privilege of securing this precious bounty, they have actually paid that amount into the Consolidated Revenue.  oat of it?",22
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is it quite fair to dissociate the import duty from a consideration of this question?,22
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the amount which has been paid by the growers. So far as they are concerned, the bounty, therefore, is a sham, a fraud, and a delusion. It was never intended to be anything else. This Parliament never intended that it should be a bounty in the same sense that it granted a bounty upon the duction of iron and steel, for example. It was merely designed to prevent the employment of black labour in our canefields. As a matter of common honesty and of fair dealing, this Parliament has no right to impose any conditions other than those which were laid down in the Sugar Bounty Act of 1905.  against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",22
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Sectio n 9 of that Act readsEvery grower of white-grown sugar who claims the bounty payable under this Act shall, in making such claim, certify to the Minister the rate of wages paid to any labourer employed by him r other than the labour of members of his family. If the Minister finds that such rate of wages is below the standard rate paid in the district in which the sugar is grown, to similar white labour engaged in that industry, then the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. In other words, this Parliament wished to insure that the cane-grower, when once the bounty had been granted, should not use his position to sweat the white labour which he was bound to employ, down to the rate which was formerly paid to black labour. It was stipulated that the Minister, through his officers, should ascertain what was the ruling rate of wages paid in any district in which sugar was grown, and that the bounty should be withheld in honourable mem- cases in which that rate of wages was not paid. The Minister, I think, made a most unfair remark to the honourable member for Laanecoorie. He stated that the Minister of Trade and Customs, behind whom the honourable member for Laanecoorie sat - and behind whom, he might have added,, he himself sat at the time-ha d fixed the rate of wages at 22s. 6d. or 25s. per week, with keep. As a matter of fact, the Minister did nothing of the sort. He did not fix the wages at all. He merely did what the Act directed him to do. He ascertained what was the ruling rate of wages in a particular district, and declared that that rate should be the standard upon which the bounty should . be payable. Now I come to the question of the import duty. It is perfectly true that a Customs duty of £ 6 per ton has been imposed upon sugar. I wish to refer to certain countries where animport duty is levied on sugar, and compare the wages and conditions which obtain there pro- with those obtaining in Australia. But first let me point out that, although the people of Australia pay an import duty of jQ6 per ton on sugar, yet, owing to the operation of the bounty and the Excise, the effective duty to the grower is only ^ 5 a ton. I have a table which I propose read, because it will give honourable memparts bers a certain amount of useful information Country. ProtecUnion of S.

102,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Hav e you touched upon the price per ton which is charged for sugar in those low-waged countries?,23
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , I have not the information here, but the honourable member will find, I think, that in the TJnited States sugar is quite as dear as it is in Australia. I am not absolutely conversant with the figures, and I do not desire to make a haphazard statement. I now come to the regulations which the Minister has promulgated, and which, I venture to say, have given rise to this Bill, although he did not say so. Of course, he has discovered that the action he took is illegal.",23
104,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , it is not. the barristers says that it is illegal. They say that they know of no means by which it can be attacked.",23

113,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Mr Stumm saysT he intention of the Act seems to me to be clear. The onus was thrown on growers w h o wished to claim and receive payment of the bounty to pay the standard rates, and c o n for m with the conditions of employment prescribed by the Commonwealth or State industrial authority, or, in the absence of such standard, the standard rates and conditions of employment obtainable in the locality in which the sugar was g r o w n ; or, in the absence of any such standard rates, then what, on a reference by the Minister to the proper authority, would be declared to be fair and reasonable. None of That is the position which I have always taken up. The Minister's functions do not arise* u n t i l a claim is made and the finding by him is, in m y view, a j u d i c i a l act. He gives certain facts which I will not read. He should, before determination against the claim, make proper in q u i r y, first, as to whether there is a standard rate of wages and conditions of employment, and if not to r e f e r to the proper authority to have it determined whether those which obtained were fair and reasonable. The growers concerned should be given an opportunity of attending the inquiry. All these considerations, in my view, show clearly that the general order which the Minister has issued is quite beyond his proper function and power.",23
114,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Why not challenge it?,24
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I believe that they are going to do so. The Minister issued his regulations without endeavouring to ascertain their probable effect, and without giving the growers an opportunity to put their views before him ; it was a one-sided action done solely for political reasons.",24
116,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Finis h the quotation from Mr Stumm's opinion.,24
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Mr Stumm saysI do not know any legal procedure by which the general order can be attacked. The Minister has done an illegal thing, but shelters himself behind the quibble that there is no direct means of exposing the i l legality. He knows that the growers will be put to enormous expense and trouble to bring the matter before the Court by indirect means, and he is aware what those indirect means are. It has been asked over and over again : Are the rates fixed too high ? Personally, I do not say that they are, and I do not know a grower of cane who is unwilling to pay them; but I know that the growers have not the money with which to pay them.",24
118,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Why ?,24
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall show that presently. The Minister knows that if the Cabinet liked to equalize the bounty and Excise, the Government could retain its control of the industry, but greatly benefit the growers, or it could hand the control of the industry over to the State Governments, and dispense with the bounty and Excise altogether as suggested by Mr. Denham; but he will not lift his little finger to help the growers, and says that he does not intend to take any action until next year. He has imposed on them regulations which, as I shall show, will beggar them, and will, if insisted on, ultimately destroy an industry for the maintenance of which the people of Australia have been paying heavily by means of duties for many years past. Briefly, the Minister has altered-the conditions which have obtained for two years under the present Administration.",24

121,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Exactly . dealt with that, and I do not wish to go into it again. In the middle of the season, without investigation or inquiry, as his answers to me the other day showed clearly, the Minister suddenlychanged the conditions under which the industry must be carried on. In reply to my questions, he said that he did not know whether the growers could or could not pay the new rates which he had fixed; that he did not know whether they were under an agreement to sell their cane at prices already fixed upon; and, although he did not say it , what he meant was that he did not care. He has altered the rate of wages from 25s. a week and keep to 36s. a week and keep, and the hours of employment fro m fifty-eight or sixty to forty-eight a week. I have never grown cane, except for fodder, but I have been informed that, prior to the alteration of conditions made by the Minister, 75 per cent, of the amount received for the cane had to be spent by the grower in the payment of wages. The process of cultivation is a long one. In my district, two years elapse between the planting of the ratoons and the harvesting of the crop.",24
122,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Did the honourable member ever see ratoons planted?,24
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes .,24
124,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then he is an extraordinary man.,24
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In my district, I believe they call the short lengths of cane that are planted in the ground ratoons; in the honourable member's district, they may have another name for them. After the planting, chipping has to be done continuously to keep the young cane free from weeds. After that follows the trashing, and finally comes the harvesting. In any case, the cost of cultivation absorbs a large part of the sum obtained for the cane; and sugar-growers tell me that, as the result of the change made by the Minister, the cost of growing cane will be increased by 6s. 6d. a ton. This year, the crop is very light, because of droughty conditions; but, even on that crop, the additional cost imposed on the growers by the Minister's arbitrary action is ,£450,000. * Mr TUDOR - That is an absolutely absurd statement. deter- Mr MASSYGREENE - It is for the Minister to prove that. I make the statement on the authority of those most conversant with the sugar industry in Queensland. I have Mr BAMFORD - On the authority of the Sugar Journal ?",24
126,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . I have not seen it in the Sugar Journal. On the authority of men who know, I say that the cost of the change made by the Minister to the growers of cane is 6s. 6d. a ton. believe that it is true. It must be. When you take into consideration the price per ton that is given for cane> and remember that the existing cost of working is 75 per cent., and that these orders have added practically 60 per cent, to the cost of production, the increase must be, at the very least, 6s. 6d. per ton. I fail to see how it can possibly be less. The order of the Minister has taken £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 out of the pockets of the growers, putting it into the pockets o l the workers, I admit, but leaving the growers in the position that they simply cannot carry on. The Minister has it in his power tomorrow, if 'he so desires, to equalize the bounty and Excise, and put 2s. per ton of that money back into the pockets of the growers. But he will not move.",25
127,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This Parliament has to clo it. I cannot do it.,25
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the Government will not move in the matter. The Minister has told us that he will not lift his little this session to help the grower's. He says that he will not do anything t ill next session, and that then he will consider the matter.' By the time next session comes the new sugar season will have come along, and probably the whole sugar season will be over before the question is dealt with. I have shown in such a way as to bring it home to honourable members that what has been, done has been done in the most unfair way. It has been done solely lor political considerations. If there had any attempt to investigate the question the growers' stand-point in order to find out the true position so far as they were industry. concerned, I should have had nothing whatever to complain about, but there been no such attempt on the part of Minister. He has himself confessed in answer to questions that I have addressed to him that he did not make inquiries, and that he does not know the facts. That an absolutely wrong and unjust position the Minister to take up. All I have to him is that the growers, right through two southern districts, have determined lhat they will plant no more cane, for the simple reason that they are not going plant it only to find themselves on the that of a White Australia. wrong side of the ledger when they are finished. I am told by all the growers in my own district that that will be the result if they have to pay these wages under existing conditions. They do not complain of I the wages themselves, but they say that, if they have to pay them and still have placed upon them by this Parliament the charge of £ 1 per ton on the sugar they produce, they must give up planting cane. They cannot carry on the industry at a loss, and I do not blame them. I would point out to the House the further fact that, unless the Ministry are prepared to deal with this question in a fairer spirit, to go into it in such a way as to enable the growers to carry on, not only will these people be deprived of their means of livelihood, and the workers find themselves without a job m the sugar-growing industry, but there will be another result. If this land goes oot of cane cultivation-and a great deal of it is suited for nothing else-the peculiar values which have been created in cane land will disappear. Thus, not only will the settlers themselves lose their means of livelihood and the workers lose their employment, but the owners of the land will find their lifesavings'swept away owing to the destruction of their land values. While the. Minister may desire to do everything for rhe finger benefit of the workers, I only hope that he will remember that there is another large body of men who are entitled tp his fullest consideration, but whom so far he has not considered in any way. They simply ask from this Parliament an investigation of the whole position so far as they are concerned, and expect us to do ordinary common justice by them.",25
129,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Darling Downs) [11.56]. been - I hope from what the Minister has said from this morning that he has not made up his mind finally upon the position of the sugar From the very beginning all parties in this House realized that they has had a very serious problem to deal with. the When Federation was accomplished, this Parliament took over as one of its responsibilities the question of the preservation of the large tropical industries of Australia. is Protectionists and Free Traders alike for worked with a common aim, which was to tell see that in any legislation introduced to the carry out our policy the great industries of Australia, wherever they existed, should be preserved for the Australian people. In to that undertaking, our first problem was We found that this was closely interwoven with the sugar industry; and, in order to do justice to the industry and those who had invested their capital and practically their lives in it, it was essential that some special form of legislation should be passed. When we enacted the ideal of a White Australia, the men who had to carry out the practical working of it were not the Federal members from different parts of Australia, but the growers of Queensland and New South VVales, and those engaged in working in the industry in those States. I think we can honestly say that it was the canegrowers of Australia who translated our ideal into practical politics, and made it possible to carry on the sugar industry under white-labour conditions. This was the first time that experiment had been carried out in any part of the world, and to those men was intrusted the task. They had the courage, the pertinacity, and the determination to make a success of it; and if any one deserves the gratitude of Australia, so far as the White Australia policy is concerned, it is not those who proclaimed their theories from the platform, but those who by their practical operations translated our theories into practice, and preserved the policy as a heritage of which we might well be proud. The great problem of working it out fell in the first instance upon the cane-growers of Australia, and they had working with them, under conditions which have greatly improved, the white workers of Australia. Whenever we faced this problem, we realized that we had to look at it from several points of view. It was a national problem. We had first to see what we could do to keep the industry in existence. If the cane-growers did not occupy the land, and grow cane to supply the mills, the industry would not exist at all. There would be nothing for the workers, nothing for the manufacturers, and nothing for the refiners. Therefore, the first thing we had to do was to conserve the existence of those engaged in the practical work of growing. While considering their interests, we knew also that the rests of others had to be equally considered. The worker engaged on the farm or in the mill was entitled to fair consideration. If he was asked to work under tropical conditions, we had to insure to him fair and reasonable rates of remuneration. If those two things were secured, the matter of the manufacturer and the refiner followed on afterwards. Tjers on both sides of the House tried fairly and equitably to work out the probMr Groom. tem. We were then faced with the question of the expiry of the existing legislation. We were faced with the problem of what was going to be done with the sugar industry. We all have to admit now that to day it is a white man's industry, and is carried on practically the same as any other Australian industry. It was always undercane- stood that this legislation was purely provisional. The present Prime Minister, speaking in 1905, saidThere is no justification either for the Excise or bounty, except the fact that white men are struggling in an industry which is not carried on by white men in any other part of the world. Later on, he saidEvery increase in the Excise duty upon sugar diminishes the price paid to the labour engaged in its production. Every additional £ 1 that we impose by way of Excise means that £ 1 per ton less is paid to the producer of raw material. He addedIn the very first communication that I had with the Government I stated that, in my opinion, the whole of the Excise duty should go to the white grower, and I believe that if the electors of Australia were polled, that would be their view. He said, furtherI ask the Committee to give full consideration to the matter, and, if possible, to allow a rebate of 5s. per ton in the interest of Queensland growers particularly, and, in my opinion, in the interests of Australia generally. The present Minister of Trade and Customs also said, in 1905I am willing to extend to the growers of white sugar in Queensland a fair amount of protection, and if we are not prevented from doing so by the Constitution, I should be in favour of increasing the Excise duty on black-grown sugar and abolishing it altogether so far as the whitegrown product is concerned. The Minister further said It has been often stated that we are giving a bonus to the sugar grower. But that does not fairly represent the case.",25
130,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have always said that.,26
131,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister has always contended that we talk of this bounty as though it were given to assist the sugar ininte- dustry, but that that does not fairly represent the case. We were arranging our Excise and Customs Tariff with a view of securing the production of white-grown sugar in Australia. The Minister went onAs a matter of fact the planters are paying the Excise duty upon their product.",26
132,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister does not Mem- say that now.,26
133,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He certainly has not withdrawn his statement; and I should say that, with the increased knowledge which he has gleaned from practical experience of administration, his conclusion has been confirmed. He said, further, that the plantersAre receiving three-fourths of the amount back in the form of a bounty. If honourable members had to pay their ^400 a year into the Treasury and had only ,£300 returned to them they would not consider they were receiving a bonus. I want to make it perfectly clear that the growers have no objection whatever to granting fair and reasonable conditions. of labour.",26
134,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Are not those imposed fair?,27
135,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My view is that, while we are raising the standard of wages, it is also our duty to see that we create such conditions as will enable the growers of cane to comply with requirements, and, at the same time, carry on the industry on terms remunerative to themselves. VVe must consider all interests. In fixing these wages, the Minister must take into consideration the position of the growers. I am not saying that he is wrong in considering the workers' point of view, but it is his duty at the same time to consider every factor connected with the industry. The information that I have received is that this increase means an increase of 40 per cent, on the average price of the product.",27
136,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Richmond said 60 per cent.,27
137,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He may have been speaking of a different district.,27
138,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not the honourable member think that that is an absurd statement?,27
139,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the Minister is in possession of facts which disprove the statement, he will give them to the House, but the evidence before me shows that at least a 40 per cent, increase in the cost of production is involved, if the present course is to be persisted in.",27
140,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The conditions must have been bad before.,27
141,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"They were not so very bad, though perhaps they might have been better. Has the Minister taken any evidence, from the growers' point of view, to show how this increased cost of production is to be met? As a practical business man, he must know that a grower who is suddenly faced with an increase of at least 40 per cent, in the cost of production may have a difficulty in adjusting himself to the new conditions, and, in some instances, may find it impossible. It is the Minister's [118] duty to look at the matter from the point of view of more than one section.",27
142,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He has been looking at it from one side too long.,27
143,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not want the Minister to look to any one interest in particular. It is his duty to consider every factor affecting the industry, so as to do justice to all. Is not the cane-grower a worker, just as much as any one else? Does be not work on his farm with his hands just as hard as any person whom he employs? Is he not in many instances merely a worker who has had the courage to become a cane-grower on his own account? Do we not know from our own experience in the working out of our legislation that one of the effects of it has been to split up large holdings into small farms ? I think the Minister was present, as I was, some years ago, on a visit to Mourilyan, not far from the Johnstone River. At that time, there was not a white grower on the place, which was held by a big company. The next time. I went to Mourilyan, two or three years later, I found that the whole of that big plantation had been divided up, and was held by small farmers, some of whom had been workers. They saw Ihe chance of making homes for themselves, and had entered into this sugar-growing industry on their own account.",27
144,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member say that cane-growing does not pay?,27
145,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not say that at all, but I do say that when you increase the cost of production in an industry you must consider' all the factors, so far as to insure that it will pay. It is an obligation on us all to see that fair consideration is given to all those connected with the industry. I will give a practical illustration. It is the case of Mr E. Hicks, who gave evidence before the Royal Commission, and 'who is one of the chief canegrowers of the Nerang M ill . Giving evidence at Southport, in March last, he said that during the last four years he had received £ 1 , 5 8 5 for sugar cane, including the bounty, and had paid away in wages, during that time, ,£1,134. His total income was at the rate of .£112 15s. per year, and, with increased wages, he said there would be nothing left for him. I put this as a typical case.",27
146,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is certainly not typical.,27
147,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Did the Minister, before he framed the regulation, consult the growers or ask for their opinions as to what was fair? After all, a Minister in administering a Department has a judicial duty cast upon him. The Minister has to weigh and consider the evidence on all sides, excluding no interested party; and, if the cost of production be increased, something must be done to give relief to the grower. My suggestion is that, during this Parliament, we should repeal the bounty and Excise, and leave the sugar industry in the same position as that of all the other industries in Australia, accepting the Queensland Government's offer to pass legislation to insure that this shall be a white man's calling. This would give all that is asked for by the most rabid of Labour men, or the most rabid of white labour advocates who are to be found in all parties.",27
148,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I shall not repeal the bounty and Excise. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Has the honourable member for Darling Downs any figures showing the average cost of production per ton?,28
149,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not wish to go into that matter, but I have here a document, which the honourable member can see, giving every detail of the cost of working, and so forth, of the Queensland Central Sugar Mills, from the factory point cf view.",28
150,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The best Central mills have been taken over, and the worse left on the hands of the Government.",28
151,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That allegation does not SPttle the problem. Assuming that.the hign standard of wages is to remain, I ask the Minister to do something to give immediate relief to the grower. I have in mind only what is fair to all parties, and I am not asking the Minister to reduce wages; but, while the Excise and bounty remain as at present, something must be done to secure the continuance of the industry.",28
152,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the bounty and Excise are wiped out our powers disappear, and the growers may pay what they like.",28
153,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; the sugar industry will only be put in the same position as that of any other Australian industry.,28
154,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister desires to keep control of the industry?,28
155,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do.,28
156,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In Victoria, for instance, there is Chinese-made furniture. Mt. TUDOR - It is a shame!",28
157,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It may be a shame, but does the Minister propose any Excise and bounty in that industry?",28
158,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; because the High Court said that was beyond our power.,28
159,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister could give a bounty; and I ask why the sugar industry alone continues to be singled out in this way ? No doubt the sugar industry was so closely interwoven with the coloured labour question that we had to legislate specifically for it in order to get free of the colour taint.,28
160,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said at Bundaberg, in 1904, that I would get rid of the Chinese workers if I could.",28
161,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Howeve r that may be, the growers require some relief in their present position. Many of them live under very hard conditions; and we know that the great problem we have to face is the settlement of the northern parts of Australia.",28
162,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would a wage of 15s. a week encourage men to go there ?,28
163,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The northern portions of Australia will never be settled until the industrial conditions are such as to attract people. The workers ought to have a fair rate of pay; and in our Public Service re gulations it is recognised that the remuneration ought to be higher in the north than in the south. From the defence point of view alone, it is essential that encouragement should be given to cane-growers; and I am sure that the Minister would rather see 150 farmers thus employed on one area than have the work undertaken by some big corporation on a big estate.",28
164,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is quite correct.,28
165,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am asking the Minister to so regulate his fiscal policy as to give consideration to small growers. There is no doubt that we shall have to encourage people to engage in the sugar industry in the Northern Territory; and it is to be hoped that the Minister has not made a final declaration of policy this morning. I take it that he has expressed only his own opinion-that the question has not been considered by the Cabinet.,28
166,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I said so.,28
167,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I understand that the Minister's remark about the matter being considered in the next Parliament represents his individual opinion?,28
168,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Bill will not make the position of the growers any worse, but rather improve it.",28
169,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"When cloes the Minister expect the Bill to become law, seeing that the Senate will not meet until the 25th of this month?",29
170,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It should become law in about a fortnight.,29
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The 5th of October is the earliest date on which the Royal Assent can be given,",29
172,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"At any rate, a considerable time must elapse; and, in the meantime, the season is passing over, and many of the planters are refraining from extending their operations. The whole position is so uncertain that the work of planting, cultivating, and so forth is being retarded, and in some instances abandoned, and the very continuation of the industry threatened. This is too serious a subject to be made the sport of party politics, and no one ought to desire that it should be; and we have to consider the position of men who have put the savings of their lives into their holdings, and whose existence depends on our legislation. If the Minister desires to act fairly and justly, he must consider the case of such men. I have in my possession a letter from some cane-growers in the Wide Bay district to the effect that they were prepared to agree to cultivate more cane, but that, since meeting Gibson on the 4th of June last, the regulations issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs have so altered the conditions that "" until all things are equal we refrain for the present from signing the agreement."" The Queensland Government are anxious at the present time to extend the industry. Acting on the report of a Royal Commission, they propose to advance more money for the extension of sugar-mills. The effect of this regulation upon the growers has been to induce them, for the time being, to stay their hands, and to hesitate to s'gn agreements for extending their operations. I should like to remind the Minister that there are at present in Queensland fiftyone sugar-mills, employing 700 men. The mill machinery is valued at £[2,000,coc, and land and premises at £[400,000. The Queensland Government is also seriously interested in the industry, as some cf the mills are indebted to the Government for outstanding liabilities to the extent of nearly £[350,000. The Minister should bear these facts in mind. It is clear from them that the success of the industry is of vital importance to Queensland. Upon it depends, to a great extent, the development [ n 8 ] -2 and progress of some big towns. If the industry in the Mackay district should be destroyed, the town of Mackay would probably dwindle until it became a little village. In the same way, if the industry failed in the Bundaberg district, the prosperity of that district would be seriously affected. Anything which is done to imperil the success of the sugar industry must seriously affect the whole of the shipping industry in the north. In the circumstances, the Minister, I am sure, will realise that the success of the industry is a most important factor in the commercial prosperity, not only of Queensland, but of the whole of Australia. I wish now to refer to the Bill itself. Under the Sugar Bounty Act of 1910, it is provided, in section 9, thatEvery grower of white-grown sugar-cane or beet who claims the bounty payable under this Act shall, in making his claim, certify to the Minister the conditions of employment and the rates of wages paid to any labour employed by him, other than the labour of members of his family. Then, in sub-clause (2) of the same section, it is provided that If the Minister finds that the rates of wages and conditions of employment, or any of them(a) are below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by Drany Commonwealth or State Industrial Authority; or (i) in the absence of any such standard applicable to the case, are below the standard rates payable and conditions of employment obtainable in the locality in which the sugar is grown; or (c) in the absence of any such standard rates and conditions of employment respectively are, on application by the Minister to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared not to be fair and reasonable by him, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or any person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority, to whom he may refer the matter, the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. This means that, if in Queensland at the present time, there was an industrial award by a State or Commonwealth authority, the grower would have to comply with the conditions of that award in order to secure the bounty. In the absence of such a standard, the Minister may refuse the bounty if the rates of wages and conditions of employment are below the standard rates and conditions of the locality in which the sugar is grown. In the event of the Minister being unable to come to a decision upon either of these bases, he has the power to refer the matter to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or to a State industrial authority, upon whose decision he may act. The Minister proposes to repeal these provisions and to substitute for them the following :9 -(1) . The Minister may make application to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation ancl Arbitration, or to any Judge of a Federal or State Court or to any person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority, for a declaration as to'what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the production of white,grown sugar-cane or beet. (2). On the hearing and determination of the application, the President, Judge, person of persons shall have all the powers which under the Excise Procedure Act 1907 belong to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and all witnesses and persons summoned to appear or appearing before him or them shall be entitled to the same privileges and protection, and be subject to the same liabilities and penalties, as witnesses or persons summoned to appear or appearing before the President on an application within the meaning of that Act, and the provisions of that Act shall, so far as they are applicable apply accordingly, mutatis mutandis, as if the application were an application within the meaning of that Act. Then sub-section 4 of the proposed new section 9, which is the critical provision, readsI f the Minister finds that the rates of wages and conditions of employment, or any of them(a) are below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by any Commonwealth or State Industrial AuthorityThat is exactly the same as in the existing Act, but the Minister proposes new paragraphs (b) and (c), as follow(b) are below the standard rates and conditions applicable to the locality and agreed upon between representatives of associations of employers and employees registered under any Commonwealth or State Act, or (r) are below the rates and conditions declared, as in the first sub-section of this section mentioned, to be fair and reasonable. The position really is that the honourable gentleman is proposing the repeal of the existing power to grant the bounty upon payment of the standard rates and conditions of employment prevailing in the locality in which the sugar is grown. He substitutes for paragraph (b) sub-section 4 of section 9 of the existing Act a provision that, to secure the payment of the bounty, there must be compliance with the Mr Groom. standard rates and conditions applicable to the locality, as agreed upon by collective bargaining between representatives of associations of employers and employees under an agreement to be registered under a Commonwealth or State Act.",29
173,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister is doing more than that; he is repealing paragraph (a) of sub-section 4 of section 9 of the existing Act.,30
174,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No, ; that paragraph is to be retained.",30
175,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; but there is now only the power to go to the Arbitration Court where there is not a local award, and in this Bill the Minister is proposing to go to the Arbitration Court in spite of a local award.",30
176,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister is taking power under this Bill to say, "" I do not care what are the standard rates and conditions of employment prevailing in a district ; I shall send a Judge into the district to prescribe what he believes to be fair and reasonable rates and conditions.""",30
177,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister proposes to go further. He says, "" I do not care what the standard rates are, or what the local award, if any, may be. I shall send a Judge into the district, who may ignore the local award.""",30
178,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. What we always required was that no grower should pay less than the standard rates prevailing in his district. We decided that if an award were made by a State industrial authority, its conditions must be complied with to secure payment of the bounty, but the Minister is proposing to take a new power under this Bill, and to say that, even although the grower is paying the standard rates prevailing in his district, he will send a Judge to the district, who may fix a standard above that of the local rates as fair and reasonable, and there must be compliance with the decision of the Judge to secure payment of the bounty. The Minister has affirmed that he is doing something to assist the cane-grower. I ask him to point out in what way the canegrower will be helped if his cost of production is increased, unless he is provided with a means of increasing the price of his commodity ?",30
179,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Bill will not increase the cost of production.,30
180,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It will do so if it results in the wages paid in the industry being increased above the standards which prevail in the different districts. We know, from information which we have received, that the regulations issued by the Minister have already had that effect. All I I say is that, when we increase the cost of production to the grower, we ought to make it possible for him to comply with the conditions which are laid down, and at the same time enable him to enjoy the same standard of living as is enjoyed by the worker.' I raise no objection to improving the condition of the worker. But I say that the grower, being a worker, is entitled also to be secured in getting reasonable standards of living. He is as much entitled to consideration as is the worker. This should not be made 3 party question. Any legislation affecting big industries of this kind ought to be considered in a fair and impartial manner.",30
181,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the honourable member of opinion that the grower pavs the Excise ?,31
182,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is such an authority upon this subject that I confidently leave the matter to him. But I do say that the cane-growers are the only persons engaged in the agricultural industry who are taxed in this way. When we come to carry out our White Australia policy,31
183,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There is more than a White Australia policy involved here. There is the question of the granting of fair conditions to the workers.,31
184,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am in favour of granting the workers fair conditions; but I ask the Minister why he should refuse to extend similar conditions to the growers?,31
185,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Nobod y wishes to refuse that.,31
186,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No matter what may be our preconceived opinions, when we come to deal with the problems which affect agricultural production, it is our duty to face the facts squarely, and to do justice between man and man.",31
187,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Evidenc e has been taken by the Sugar Commission upon this question for the past twelve months, yet we cannot get a decision from it. Why?",31
188,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the Minister imply that trie cane-growers have not treated the Commission fairly?,31
189,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,31
190,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"They are not to blame for any delay in the presentation of the port of the Sugar Commission. That Comthe House. mission was appointed to take evidence respect of every factor connected with industry, in order to enable us to do justice between all parties. But the Minister has issued regulations dealing with only one factor connected with it, before the Commission has presented its report. That being so, I ask him to, at least, exhibit a desire to do justice to ""the other factors as well. In saying this, I am pleading for justice for the producers, for the occupation of our lands, for the settlement of the northern parts of Australia, and the building up of a body of white settlers, who, in ths hour of need, will be a source of strength to the Commonwealth.",31

During the course of his remarks, he frequently referred to the Sugar Bounty Act of 1910 in such disparaging terms that I felt impelled to ask who was the author of it. In reply, he vouchsafed the information that he was its author. He then proceeded to make a most unfair attack upon me by affirming that he did not fix the rate of wages payable-to men engaged in the sugar industry at 22s. 6d. per week, as a previous Minister did, vvho was supported by myself.",31
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member only supported the Government which did it.,31
193,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is all that the Minister said.,31
194,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Every honourable member who speaks from this side of the Chamber is accustomed to receive assistance from the Labour corner. Scarcely an interjection can be uttered by an honourable member upon the Opposition side cf the House which is not immediately replied to or tortured into something to which it never bore the slightest resemblance by a member of the Labour party sitting in that corner.,31
195,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is not now telling tales to the Women's National League.,31
196,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"At any rate, I am not waiting for an honourable member's absence before attacking him. And the honourable member is not exercising that calm and discretion which should charreacterize one of his professions outside We expect tbose who in teach the people their duty to themselves the set an example. If the honourable member did that, we should have less of the unseemly interjections to which he - is so partial. I trust that I may be permitted to exercise the inalienable right of every honourable member who is charged with a thing which he abhors, to repel the accusation, and to show how baseless it is. I know there are some honourable members who, when an election is imminent, are anxious to fasten upon their political opponents statements which may be found usef u l during the election campaign. I am not going to allow the statement of the Minister to be fastened upon me. I have never heard of a proposal in this House to pay 22s. 6d. per week to persons engaged in the sugar industry, either in Queensland or New South Wales. I have never known any Minister to make such a proposal. I am unaware of any Minister having made it whilst honourable members were in their places in this Chamber. That a Minister, by an administrative act, may have fixed that vvage, is, however, quite possible. But I point out to the Minister that it is not playing the game to endeavour to fasten upon individual members the responsibility for such Ministerial action. Although honourable members do support Ministers iri their positions, it would also be manifestly unfair to compel every member to be responsible for the administrative acts of a particular Minister.",31

208,Dr CARTY SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Accordin g to the honourable member's .own statement that silence gives consent, he consented by hU silence. I decline for myself to accept that statement j and I wish 'it to be distinctly understood that I repudiate any responsibility for the administrative acts of a member of the Government which I was supporting. With reference to the measure before the House, I , as a supporter of the White Australia policy, do feel that we have scarcely treated fairly the men who - have loyally carried out the wish of Parliament and of the country. It has been a matter for wonderment in some circles that, notwithstanding the prophecies that were so frequently made that they would be utterly incapable of doing it, these men have been able to keep this industry going, and employ white labour. But, as the Minister and those associated with him, as well as_ honourable members on this side have pointed out, the payment for the work done is not regarded asanything like adequate. That possibility was recognised by the Government as early as 1905. When the Bounty Bill was first passed, it was passed-lik e other Bounty Bills have been .passed-wit h as few restrictions as possible in order to make the working of the bounty easy to those concerned; and the House was anxious-it was talked about over and over again at the time-that the employers of black labour should be encouraged by every means to substitute white labour. They have done this, and done it undoubtedly at great loss to themselves. I was very much struck with the statement made by the honourable member for Richmond regarding' the rule in the sugar districts, whereby the grower has submitted to him at the beginning of a season, or, at any rate, at regular periods, the price that is to be paid by those who will take his cane or raw sugar from him. I think that the honourable member there placed his finger on a tender spot. I believe that the grower is entitled to every consideration and all the sympathy that we can possibly give him in this House.",32

But if the position of a grower is to be made inferior to that of an employ^, we cannot expect the men to have any ambition to side, I feel sure, desire. become growers.

The honourable member for Richmond, who speaks with the voice of authority, and whose district very largely contributes to the sugar supply of Australia, maintained, with a great deal force-and , of course, we have heard nothing to the contrary since he spoke, cause all the speeches have come from this side-that the position of the grower will not be advanced, that there - will he benefit .it all, but rather the reverse, from I delivered the other day. these proposals; and he offered to the then that X had voted for the "" gag.""

Surely, when we passed the Sugar Bounty and Excise Bills, we did not intend that they should be like the laws of the Medes and the Persians; but we realized that we were trying an experiment. The experiment of ridding Australia of the employment of alien labour has been successful. But surely the. instrument whereby we accomplished that success is entitled to some consideration at our hands. I would, therefore, urge upon the Government that this question of a re-adjustment or rearrangement of the Excise and the bounty I should be taken at once into their most careful and sympathetic consideration. If that be done, I believe that we shall secure a longer lease of life for those who are in the industry, and at the same time make it more possible for the industry to be started under favourable conditions in the Northern Territory, thereby securing what honourable members on each We need to population there, but cannot expect to get it unless we make it profitable for people to engage in industries, and assure them that the Legislature will always be ready give them the assistance and support without which they could not succeed.
