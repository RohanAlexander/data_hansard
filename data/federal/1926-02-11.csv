2,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Defence noted certain comments in one of the morning newspapers as to the class of aeroplane provided at Point Cook for the training of airmen? Is there any truth in the statement that one death has already heen occasioned through the use of a defective plane for training purposes? Will the Minister make investigations, and see that our airmen arc trained in the safest aeroplanes that can be provided? Sir NEVILLE HOWSE;- I have not seen the newspaper comments to which the honourable member refers, but I am perfectly certain that no airman has lost his life at Point Cook while being trained in a defective machine. BUSH FIRES. AEROPLANE PATROLS.",14
3,Mr MARES,Unknown,"In view of the great loss of property and stock caused by devastating bush fires, such as have recently occurred, will the Prime Minister consider whether aeroplane patrols, sucb as are established in Canada, might not be used to locate outbreaks of fire, and to report them, so that men could be sent to put tbem out?",14

5,Mr MANNING,REPORT BY BRITISH TRADE,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the annual report of Mr R. W. Dalton, senior British Trade Commissioner in Australia, and especially to the section of it dealing with wool production, in which an entirely unwarranted, pessimistic, and distorted view is expressed, and false deductions are drawn from the facts? As this report has been issued by the Imperial Government as an oflicial document, and its publication may create a most misleading impression abroad with regard to the economic. position in Australia, will the Government make representations to the Imperial Government in 'order that the true position of our greatest industry may not be misrepresented, and that in future no officer of the Imperial Government shall be permitted in an official report to cry "" stinking fish"" about this part of the Empire?",14
6,Mr BRUCE,REPORT BY BRITISH TRADE,"I suggest that the question might appropriately have appeared on the notice-paper. In my view, the proper course to be pursued in the circumstances referred to is for the wool industry, wbicb is powerful and well organized, to itself make a reply to any statements regarding it to which exception may be taken. If the Government can assist in any way those connected with that or any other Australian industry to obtain publicity for replies to injurious statements about tbem, it will do so.

What is the reason for the changed attitude of the Department? 3. Why is it that similar action has been taken in connection with the proposed erection of new outbuildings at the Post 'Office, Port Pirie, South Australia?",16
18,Mr GIBSON,TAEIFF PREFERENCE ON,"The ansAvers to the honourable member's questions .are as f o l low :1 and .2. Subsequent to the formulation of the proposal for the erection of a new post office building at Iron Knob, it was found possible to effect material improvement in the standard of service rendered in the non-official premises, and, in view of this, as very little development in business is taking place, it was decided to postpone the erection - of the building, and to reconsider the proposal at the end of undergradu- of the current year. 3. Owing to the development at Port Pirie, it is necessary to consider the question of a new location for the telephone exchange, and. in the circumstances it is advisable to defer expenditure in the provision of outbuildings, as the proposal in that connection will be materially affected if the space iiow occupied by the telephone exchange in the post office building becomes available for other purposes. NA RETURNED SOLDIERS.  asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice Whether, in view of the fact that entertainments are being held to aid limbless soldiers in procuring artificial limbs, the Government will prevent the necessity for sueh entertainments by granting limbs free, on approved application, to limbless ex-soldiers?",16
19,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,ARTIFICIALLIMBS FOR,"The Government is unaware that any entertain-, ments are being held for the purpose mentioned. Furthermore, there is no necessity for any such action, as the Repatriation Department provides limbless ex-soldiers with all necessary artificial limbs (also renewals and repairs to same) and surgical boots and - appliances absolutely free of charge. These limbs are the best in Australia, and, at least, equal to those supplied in any other part of the world. PURE FRUIT JUICES.",17

23,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"Parkes-Honorar y M in ister) [ 2 . 4 8 ] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report thereon, viz.:-The erection of a building at Canberra for accommodation of Commonwealth Departments. This matter was previously referred to the Public Works Committee by an order in council on the 19 th of May, 1925. On the 9th of March, 1923, the proposal to erect provisional adminstrative offices at Canberra, was referred by Parliament to the Public Works Committee for investigation. The committee examined the project, and on the 21st of June, 1923, submitted a report, in which it recommended that the suggestion for the erection of provisional offices be not approved, but that two units of permanent buildings be erected, and the design be the subject of an architectural competition. On the 25th of August, EXCHANGE. 1923, a resolution was passed by this House that it was not expedient to carry out the erection of provisional administrative offices, but that it was expedient to invite competitive designs for permanent administrative offices as recommended by the Public Works Committee in its report. Arrangements were accordingly made to hold a competition among Australian architects for the design of a permanent building, and this was concluded in December, 1924, the first premiated design being that of Mr G. Sydney Jones, A.R.I.B.A., of' Sydney. After SPEAKER. investigation as to the amount of accommodation that might be obtained in two buildings on the sites indicated by the Public Works Committee, it was decided, after consultation with the chairman of the committee, to call for competitive designs for one building only, to be erected on a site within the governmental area, but somewhat to the north PAPERS. of that previously proposed, and to be sufficiently large to accommodate the whole of the public servants to bo transferred to Canberra. The competition provided, however, that the Government might utilize the design, without employment of the architect, for the erection of a second building of a similar character on a corresponding site on the opposite side of the main city axis. Since the competition was announced the Federal Capital Commission has been in touch with the author of the first premiated design, and sketch plans have been prepared upon the basis of that design which, it is considered, will meet the requirements of the various departments to be accommodated. The scheme provides for a reinforced concrete building, which may be faced externally with stone, terrathe cotta, or white cement plaster, or a bination of these materials as may be determined. The building would comprise a ground and two main floors, with a lower ground floor-or basement, and a mezzanine floor over portion of the area, providing 215,351 square feet of effective office accommodation after allowing for corridors, light areas, lift wells, and accessories. The accommodation is so fronts ""-concret e arranged that it could be subdivided veniently in alternative methods to any particular needs of departments of varying sizes-the main object being to secure conveniently disposed spaces. The preliminary estimate of cost submitted by. the architect is £ 4 5 1 , 5 this includes the provision of engineering services, and provides for facing the building in terra-cotta, but does not in clude the cost of the architect's commiswill sion, supervision, and overhead charges. I lav upon the table of the House (a) portfolio of eleven sketch plans of building prepared by the architect; and (6) a memorandum of description and estimate of cost.",18
24,Mr FENTON,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"Maribyrnong ) [2.52] Do I understand that the architect who won the competition has drawn the plans and specifications for i h e building, and will supervise its erection ?",19
25,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,Yes .,19
26,Mr FENTON,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"Will he have sole be charge of the construction, and will the Commonwealth Chief Architect have it is too glaring. nothing to do with it ?",19
27,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"I shall explain that later. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [2.53]. - I understand that when an architect's plan, and tenders based upon it are cepted, he is entitled to commission on much the total cost. If the successful archiwhite tect is to be paid commission on this building, which is to cost over £451,000, he should supervize the construction.",19
28,Mr GREGORY,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,He w i ll do so. Mr E . RILEY - I understand that decision has been arrived at in regard the facing of the building.,19
29,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"I think the proposal face it with terra cotta. Mr E . RILEY - I am opposed to that. Terra cotta will only give a cheap, gingerbread effect.",19
30,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"That matter will be decided later; this motion is only to refer proposal to the Public Works Comcommittee for investigation and report. Mr E . RILEY - That being so, we shall have another opportunity of objecting to the use of any cheap finishing material like terra cotta. The building should be made of either stone or brick.",19
31,Mr WEST,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"East Sydney) [ 2 . 5 4 ] - I other also have a strong objection to "" mud overplastered and conwhitewashed. I understand that builders meet nowadays use some patent material in lieu of lime for whitewashing buildings, but these cheap, glaring stucco effects do well-lit not appeal to me. All the permanent public buildings should be finished with 7 2: either stone or brick. Those are substantia l materials, and entail very little maintenance cost. Most honourable members agree that good brickwork nicely tuckpointed bas a pleasing and substantial a appearance. The public buildings of a the country are usually an outward and visible sign of its prosperity and the taste and culture' of its people. I cannot understand how responsible officials sbould bave entertained for one moment a proposal to have "" m u d - front"" buildings in the principal avenues of the Federal Capital. At one time the use of marble from the quarries adjacent to Canberra was suggested for the monumental Parliament House; but although marble may very effective in It a l y as a building material, in the strong light of Australia When I last visited Canberra, I saw a number of cottages built of concrete finished with plaster and whitewashed. That for m of construction does not look so well as tuckpointed brickwork, and involves a considerably greater accost for upkeep. Brick buildings are a more valuable asset. Even lead paint perishes very quickly in the dry atmosphere of Australia. There are no better tradesmen in the world than the Australians, and they sbould be afforded an opporno tunity at Canberra to display their to ability and originality. We sbould encourage beauty of design and quality of is to workmanship. I understand that for their sins some responsible public servants are required to read Hansard, and I hope the officers of the architectural branch will peruse two or three times my r.emarks on this motion, and be warned against the use of cheap building materials in a city that is to be the focus of Australian public l if e and ideals ",19
32,Mr GREGORY,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"Swan) [2.59] - When competitive designs for the first adminis* trative offices were invited, the conditions included an undertaking that the successf u l architect should have charge of the construction. Those who criticise the appearance of Parliament House should remember that it is merely a provisional building, although it may have a l if e of f if t y years. The building which is the subject of this motion, however, is to be one of the permanent public edifices of the Federal Capital, and therefore its design and construction require the most careful consideration. Parliament will have an opportunity to consider the form .of construction when the report of the Public Works Committee has been received. I feel sure that the committee will leave the matter fair l y open, so that there will be no need to refer it back to that body. Parliament will then be able to determine whether the facing of the building shall be of granite, trachyte, Sydney freestone, Stawell freestone, or terra cotta. The last-named method of facing is an innovation and has a good deal to commend it . Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [3.1] I realise that this is merely a motion to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, and that when its report has been received the subject will be open for discussion. Stucco walls for the provisional Parliament House should have a very pleasing effect, and. should be sufficiently permanent at least to last the life-time of ""members of the present Parliament. I trust, however, that Canberra will not be made the happy hunting ground of the "" j e r r y "" builder. When I was there about twelve months ago I found that the divisional walls in the bathrooms of certain cottages that were being erected by contract were built of bricks on edge, a practice that is not permitted in any other city in Australia, Even during the bnilding boom in Melbourne over 30 years agoi, when whole streets of jerry-built houses were erected in Elstemwick and other suburbs, the contractors were not allowed to build internal walls with bricks on edge, and the practice should certainly not be tolerated in what will be the model city of the Commonwealth. I hope that members of the> Public Works Committee will get into touch with reliable builders who will instruct them on matters of this kind, so that no undesirable practices in building will be possible in the f u t u r e at Canberra.",20
33,Mr FORDE,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,Capricornia) [3.5] I should like to suggest to the Public Works Committee that when it is inquiring into the subject it sbould take into consideration the possibility of utilizing some of the very .fine marble deposits in Australia.,20
34,Mr WATKINS,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,I suppose the honourable member knows that there are marble deposits not far distant from Canberra ?,20
35,Mr FORDE,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"Yes . My.purpose is to direct attention to the excellent marble deposits in Australia, and especially in Central Queensland. I understand that the deposits in New South Wales, although good, are not of the high-class quality of the Queensland marble, or of the deposits at Angas, in South Australia. 1I have been interested in this subject for ' some time. In a letter which I received from the Minister for Trade and Customs  last, I was informed that the Tariff Board had taken evidence in Melbourne on the 13th January, and in Adelaide on the 14th January, 19*5, in regard to applications for protection to enable the Australian marble industry to be developed. My grievance then was, and still is, that the Tariff Board did not visit Central Queensland to investigate the possibility of developing the deposits there. I see in this motion an opportunity to direct the attention of the Public Works Committee to the subject. The Tariff Board, after what I regarded as a more or less perfunctory investigation of the position, reported as follows to the Minister: With the exception of marble for monumental purposes it can be claimed that Australian marble has a high commercial value. In order to obtain the higher grade marble it will be necessary to encourage the. full development of the local quarries until the greater depths are reached. At present the Australian marble industry is in a very depressed condition, and several quarries have closed down. Meantime imports from Italy are increasing. There are, as I have said, some very fine marble deposits in Australia, and I hope that the possibilty of utilizing them will be full y inquired into by the Public Works Committee.",20
36,Mr FENTON,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,The committeeshould be instructed to visit all the marble quarries in Australia.,21
37,Mr FORDE,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,"I agree with. th& honourable member. I have visited the Central Queensland quarries, and bave a number of photographs which I would like to show to honourable members. Mr. Harold Parker, the well-known sculptor, states that the Central Queensland marble is equal to the finest in the world, and compares very favourably with the bast Italian marble. Some enterprising Queenslanders have spent £25,000 in the purchase and erection of the necessary machinery to work the quarries there, but unfortunately, owing to the competition of cheap Italian marble, the' demand for the Queensland marble has fallen off. Aa a result the quarries bave been closed, and hundreds of men have been thrown out of work. This appears to be an opportune time to suggest that the Publie Works Committee should visit Central Queensland, and make a thorough investigation of the possibility of utilizing Australian materials, marble and granite for the public buildings in Canberra.",21
38,Mr MARR,LAKEMBA TELEPHONE,Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [3.7] - The suggestion as to the nature of the stone to be used will be a matter for the House to decide when the report of the Public: Works. CoMMnittee comes up for consideration. If the. Government decides toi instruct the architect toi supervise the work he will be entitled to his fee. Question resolved in theaffirmative.

Commomiweailth Public Worts Aet 19-13-192.1, t h » following work be reieried to the Parliamentary Standing Committee cn Public Works for investigation and report thereon, na.mely, ""The construction of a dam and improvements on the Molonglo RLver in the Federal Capital.** This matter wasreferred to the Public Works Committee on the 19th May,, by order w council, as ths House was not then sitting. The design of the Eederal Capital City provides for an extensive Act lake scheme on the Molonglo River, Publicwhich would involvea very large exthereon, penditure and include also the regulaait 1 tion of the Upper Queanbeyara River. The Public Works Committee, in its report of the 28thNovember, 19 Iff, on ornamental waters, recommended-(a ) that the suggested eastern lake be indefinitely postponed; (6) that the provision of other ornamental waters be delayed for years. The desirability of postponing any consideration of a very large expenditure on the formation of these lakes is concurred in by the Federal Capital Commission; but, at the same time, it is deemed advisable to improve the river, from a scenic point of view, in the central portion of the city, and to. provide boating and bathing facilities, and to give necessary regulation to the flow. The course* of the river is at present itnsaliisfactory, and improvements to the waterway are very necessary. It is therefore proposed that, to meet immediaterequirements^ a weirbe constructed across the Molonglo River at Yarralumla, which would create a reasonably good stretch of water, and at the same time not raise the floodlevels in the city proper to any appreciable degree. The scheme includes the clearing of the river, both above and below the weir, and general' improvements to the waterway. - The design, proposed for the weir is such that none of the expenditure would be, lost, but would incorporate itself in the final dam when constructed to the 1,825-ft. level,, which is the level of. the lower lake showmr in the approved city plan. The waterway thus provided would conform to the natural features as recommended in the Public Works ComwLttee * report re1 ferred: to above.

In 1916, to meet the anticipated increase in traffic due to the commencement of operations at the Darwin meat works, the jetty was widened by 11 feet with timber piles, and a larger turn-table was erected. During 1923, a visit was paid to Darwin by Sir William formerly Engineer Vice-Admiral, tralian Naval Forces, who, as a result, submitted a report recommending construction of a solid wharf, south-westerly from the point of Stokes Hill, and a few feet shorewards from the edge of the mudbank between Stokes Hill and Fort Hill. The estimated cost of this new work was £120,050. alternative to the construction wharf, Sir William Clarkson suggested the provision of an island jetty in Fanny Bay, to be connected with the meat works by means of an aerial ropeway to facilitate the shipping of frozen beef. The estimated cost of this alternative was put down at £65,000. commendations of Admiral Clarkson were referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, for investigation and report. The committee ceeded to Darwin, and after exhaustive inquiries, submitted, in May, 1924, a report recommending that the proposals of Admiral Clarkson be not approved. were of opinion, however, that with the adoption of a progressive policy for the Northern Territory the existing facilities would be wholly inadequate for the efficient and economic handling goods to and from .Darwin. To permit of direct railway approach to the present jetty, and to obviate the use and expense of the present turn-table, the committee had estimates prepared of the cost of constructing a curved approach, so that the locomotive might be used on the wharf, and save the hand-shunting of trucks. The particulars submitted showed that a cast-iron and steel bridgework approach, to provide for a double track, would cost £137,233, while to provide for a single track would cost £98,920. The committee did not feel justified in recommending this' large expenditure full and detailed examination harbour had been made, and it was placed in possession of all the information sary to enable it to recommend adoption of a scheme of harbour ment which could be developed to meet all Mr Marr. future requirements. They, therefore re. about commended that the Government should forthwith instruct a harbour engineer to report upon a scheme of harbour improvement at Darwin. Following upon that recommendation,- a report was obtained, in October, 1924, fro m Mr J . F . Ramsbotham, M . Inst. C.E., M . A m . Soc. Clarkson, C.E.j Director of Lighthouses, and the Ausmatter was again referred for the consideration of the Public Works Committee the by executive council minute on 18th running February, 1925. On the 16th March, 1925, the committee re-commenced its in quiries, and took a large amount of evidence in regard to the proposition submitted by the Government for the conAs an struction of a concrete wharf in accordof this ance with designs prepared by Mr Ramsbotham. The inquiries of the committee had not been completed at the close of Darwin the last Parliament, and it is now desired to refer the matter to them again. M i \ GREGORY (Swan) [ 3 . 1 5 ] - I The re- should like to explain the attitude of the Public Works Committee towards this Standing proposal. A f t e r Mr Ramsbotham had prepared plans and specifications, and prothe committee had started investigationsj the Government engaged Sir George Buchanan to make a report. The committee understood that his report They would not be presented for at least six months, and obviously, in those circumstances, it could not reach a decision. wharfage The carrying of the motion before Sir George Buchanan has reported is futile, of because it is impossible for the committee to approve of any recommendation by any engineer until the report of such a high authority as Sir George Buchanan is before it . Sir George Buchanan was not asked to report on the scheme on which Mr Ramsbotham reported, but on a new scheme. The matter ought to have been left in abeyance u n t i l Sir George Buchanan's report had been received. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.16]. - It would be ridiculous to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee until a before the committee has received Sir of the George Buchanan's report. I assume that the Government has paid Sir George necesBuchanan a high fee for his work, and the the committee, when investigating the improve- matter, should certainly have the advantage of his views. . If I were a member of the committee, I should be in favour of delaying investigations until Sir George Buchanan's report had been received.",21
41,Mr MARR,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [3.17] - In seeking to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee, the department does not wish to evade any recommendations that Sir George Buchanan may make. Sir George Buchanan's report is expected at any time now, and so soon as it is received it will be made available to the committee, which will then be free to endorse the views of the department or incorporate with them the proposals of Sir George Buchanan.",23
42,Mr JACKSON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Will the Minister undertake that the recommendation shall not be sent to the Public Works Committee until Sir George Buchanan's report has been received?,23
43,Mr MARR,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"If this motion is carried, the recommendation must go forward to the committee, but, in view of the opinion expressed by honourable members, the committee will, I assume, defer consideration until Sir George Buchanan's report has been received. Question resolved in the affirmative. CRIMES BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from the 10th February (vide page 855), on motion by Mr . LATHAMThat the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Charlton had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the word "" That "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu - "" This House is of opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn wrEh a view to re-drafting so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to industrial disputes, as such clauses, sociated with the Crimes Act, are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour.""",23
44,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Wannon) [3.19] I commend the Government for the early introduction of this bill, which, on a close examination, substantially fulfills the promise made by the Prime Minister at the time of the election. He promised that the Government, if returned, would arm itself with sufficient legislative power to protect the Commonwealth in certain directions in which it was menaced. The bill deals with no imaginary ills, but with a positive and definite wrong perpetrated against Australia at a time when she was almost legislatively helpless to defend herself. It is to be hoped that the House and the country will not think, because the great strike that then held this country in a condition of paralysis has come to an end, and because the voice of the arch-mischief-maker has been silenced, that the need for such a bill bas passed. It is significant that the clear voice of the people has silenced these extreme men who, for the time being, are in our midst, but it has not got rid of them, nor can we hope that it has changed their hearts. I listened carefully to the comprehensive address of the Attorney General (Mr Latham), in which he outlined the causes for, and the difficulties under, which this country is suffering, and the remedial measures the Government propose to adopt. Personally, I feel that the greatest good that will follow the passing of this bill will be due to its preventive effect. The Government asked the people to authorize the granting of these powers, and it gained the most sweeping election victory in the history of federation. From every State, and, in fact, every corner of the Commonwealth, except the massed industrial centres, it received big majorities. There was a bounden duty laid upon it, therefore, to fulfill its promise. In my judgment, it bas substantially done so by introducing this measure. Comprehensive powers, some may even call tbem drastic powers, are being asked for in order to assure continuity in the essential services of the country; but surely the Government should be entrusted with such powers. thereof The Labour party bas long claimed that the fullest powers possible under the Constitution should be vested in the asParliament, in order that it might function in all respects for the benefit and protection of the nation. It hardly rests with those honourable members now, therefore, to challenge this Government for seeking full authority to protect the nation from attack. The bill deals chiefly with two aspects of wrongdoing. One of these concerns unlawful associations of people which, of course, usually centre round some evil genius who has sufficient power to control a crowd, and can find those who are willing, though thoughtlessly at times, to assist him in carrying out his nefarious designs. This type of man is responsible for much of the trouble that has come to Australia recently. In most of our great industrial upheavals the masses have surged around some individual who was the tarek mischief-maker, tihe evil genius, OT perhaps the misguided f anatic. The bill seeks to clothe the Government with powers which previously have mot been - vested im it, to deal with these unlawful associations, and to completely protect Australia from their machinations. The executive, however, will have no power to select certain individuals, and deport tbem. All persons who are charged must be presented before our law courts, and, if victed, the compound punishment of imprisonment and/or deportation may be imposed on them. It is significant that lw opposition of any consequence has yet been voiced to the provisions of the measure which deal with unlawful associations, 'and provide the penalty of deportation foi their members. Prom that we 1 may tafce it that honourable members opposite acqaaiesce in the principle of tation. Tbey have not challenged it in regard to .unlawful associations, and therefore we may take it as being agreed to. The principle having been admitted, it becomes a question of the degree in which it may ""be applied. The other substantial pr-ovision <£ the hill deals with industrial disturbances. Proposed new sub-section 30j (2) is hot couched in the language that I would choose, but that can be dealt with later on. In it the Government asks forauthority to take full responsibility for maintaining the essential services of the nation. Transport, both overseas and between the States, is included. Although oversea shipment is the life-hlood of this nation, for nearly three months last year the entire country was kept in a condition of complete paralysis because of the shipping strike. _ I venture to say that this was done 'chiefly by the miscbiefmaking activities - of one or two men. Nobody contends that the British seamen were communists, and that their special design was to play into the hands of those who wished to hold up the trade and commerce of Australia and of the British Empire; but crafty men who bad influence with tbem obliged' them to participate in such , a design, which was Mr Rodgers. foreign to the welfare of the nation. In my opinion, the Prime Minister's statement at Dandtnoug was carefully weighed by the people. They realized what was involved, and they gave a clear direction to the Government to obtain whatever power was necessary to preserve our industrial life. Personally, I should not like deportation to be resorted to except in extreme cases, but I believe that the Government sbould be clothed with absolute power to defend the country against these industrial wreckers. Honourable members of both Houses in this Parliament know the type of individual who is generally the king pin in indus'con- trial troubles. He is usually a knowledgable, vioJent main, who will desist from Ms destructive work only when he knows that ithe severest penalties may be enforced against bim. Human nature, it may be said, is prompted to its best or worse activities by either the hope of reward or the fear of consequences. Unless strong punitive powers are vested in the Commonwealth, the time will undoubtedly come when there will be a redeporcurrence of the trouble from which we have been recently suffering. 'There seems to have grown up in the minds of some representatives of the industrialists the feeling that the striker is entitled to absolute freedom in this country. He cannot have recourse to the courts of the country, the advantage of judicial awards, and at the same time the power to incite the workers into a state of revolt against society. The outstanding figure in the last great strike at the Australian end was the leader of the Australian Seamen's Union, Thomas Walsh. Mr E. RILEV - The bill does not mention bim.",23
45,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I am mentioning him. The person chiefly responsible for the whole difficulty goes scot-free with an advertisement that for the time being the was the supreme leader of the movement; but a loss of' £3,000,000 was incurred by the shipping interests, .and the families of hundreds of British seamen were brought to the verge of starvation. This man still masquerades as a "" great industrial leader,"" to use a phrase .of which honourable members opposite are very fond. They immediately cry "" Wolf.!"" when a measure is introduced to deal with such men. I say, as the Attorney-General said in introducing the bill, that were it not for the f a c t that thousands of industrialists and unionists voted for members of the paity en this side in the hope that it would introduce such a measure, the Government would not be where it iff. today. It is the bounden duty of the Government, and of every honourable member on this side, to honour the pledges made at the election. Imprisonment may not in all circumstanoes be a sufficient punishment. We had a notorious example of this in New South Wales some years ago. Certain members of the Industrial Workers' of the World were 1 convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Tliat merely created' an opportunity for apersistent agitation by supporters of the' Industrial Workers of the Worl d and other misguided individuals, u n t i l finally they prevailed with a government sympathetic with their views, and' secured therelease of the men. who had been convicted. This country - sbou'l'd have full power to protect itself from such individuals, who have become a proven menace to the welfare of the ration-..  that.",24

47,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I cannot see what the honourable member objectsto. H is leader spent a great deal of time explainmarks ing how the trade union movement was built up, and had worked for years to secure theemancipation of the cause workers from the objectionable, conviewed ditions under which they laboured. divided That, however, was all' by the way, and quiteirrelevant to the M l , which deals not with imaginary grievances but with definite and positive wrongs inflicted upon the Commonwealth. It is the duty of every member of this Parliament to give ample power to the Commonwealth to protect itself ini all emergencies and against all who menace its welfare. matter what party may be administering this legislation, I am quite sure that Executive of the day may be trusted to impose the penalty of deportation without good reason, and after the most careful consideration. Deportation is not the only punishment provided for in measure, and it may t e left to the good Bense of the Executive of the day to say when so drastic a penalty should t e imposed.. The Leader of the Opposition dealt with what he termed a new menace, the fascist. If it is thought that the bill makes. no provision to deal with him, and honourable members opposite submit a clause for the purpose, I shall support, it . No matter where the menace to the welfare of the Commonwealth may come from , the Government should have power to deal with it . Subject to a certain modification of sub-section 2 of the proposed section 3 0 J , I give my. unreserved support to this measure. I believe that f t will seldom have to be brought int o use in this country. It s chief virtue will be as a preventative and not as a punitive measure. I commend the Government for itsintroduction, and the Attorney-General for the wealth of information he supplied to honourable members in moving 6he second reading. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) 13.37]. - I listened carefully to the AttoraeyOeneral in moving the second reading of this bill , and the only evidence he adas a jiustificatioii for its. introduat i o n consisted of newspaper reports of speeches delivered by people who' were said to belong to the. Communist party.. It was upon those reports that the honourable sepagentleman built up the whole of his case. The honourable member forWannon. (Mr . Rodgers) appears to> think that there is only one side to this question. H i a rewere confined to strikes, and other ' disturbances by workers. It should not be forgotten that employersmay help to strikes, and this measure, should be ° from every angle. Th& bill, is into two parts, one. of which proposes to deal with persons of the criminal classes who are out to overturn society by a forcible revolution. The other part of ' the bill deals with the industrial classAs the Leader o i the Opposition (Mr Chaslton.) has said, honourable members on this side are prepared to support the first part of the bill dealing with law-breakers No and persons connected', with unlawful associations, formed to bring about revolutfae tion by force. We said throughout the not last election that we are against that class, and do not stand for what it desires. If there is any party in this House which stands for law and order in this the community it is the Labour party. It does not stand for lawlessness, nor does it preach, revolution. It believes in the adoption of constitutional methods. Its methods are evolutionary, not revolutionary. The Attorney-General went to some trouble to explain the reason for the provisions dealing with industrialists. He might have been candid enough to admit that those provisions have been introduced because we had recently a seamen's strike in this country. I point out that the Britisb seamen's strike was not brought, about by the industrialists of Australia. There was no strike amongst the seamen of the interstate shipping companies, the troll eymen and draymen, or the waterside workers of Australia. The strike was brought to this country by the British seamen. He would be a very callous man indeed who could not sympathize with men who resisted a reduction of wages as the British seamen did. They had signed a contract to take a voyage from Great Britain to Australia at a wage of £10 per month, and when they arrived here they were told that the monthly wage was to be reduced to £9 per month. was no machinery here to adjust the matter, because the British seamen were not members of our community. They resisted the reduction of their wages by the British ship-owners, and I say that they were justified in doing so. Labour organizations in Australia, and honourable members on this side, had nothing to do with the matter. If there was any criminal act committed in connection with the strike-and I do not say that there t was-it was brought about by the British shipping combine in reducing the British seamen's wages from £10 per month, for which they had contracted, to £9 per month. There were some men on the British boats receiving a wage as low as £5 per month. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) might have assisted to bring about a settlement of that strike. He could have said to Lord Inchcape and the British shipping companies, ""We do not want this dispute in this country. Unless you agree to pay your men the wages they contracted for when they left Great Britain, we shall not allow your ships to enter our ports."" The reduction in the British seamen's wages should not have been made until they had returned to British ports, and had been paid off from their vessels. If that had been done the trouble would not Mr E. Riley. have extended to this country. This bill has been brought into deal especially with the workers of this country.",25
48,Mr FENTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The action of Tom Walsh here did not affect the strike of British seamen in South Africa, New Zealand, and in Great Britain itself. Mr E. RILEY - That is so. In South Africa, British vessels were tied up for some considerable time owing to the strike. I admit that in England the strike did not last long. When there are 1,500,000 people unemployed in a country, whose wives and families are starving, men are compelled to accept work at reduced rates. In Australia the position was different. We had no great army of unemployed, and, consequently, there was no surplus labour. Tom Walsh cannot be blamed for the fact that the British seamen wenton strike in South Africa, New Zealand and Canada.",26
49,Mr A GREEN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The South African Government fed the strikers. There Mr E. RILEY - Because the unionists of this country sympathized with the British seamen in their protest against the reduction of their wages, the Nationalist Government, the alleged great champion of the people's liberty, has introduced this bill whose purpose is to place our industrialists under the criminal code. There are 791 unions in the Commonwealth, with a membership of nearly 800,000 men and women. When any section of these unionists takes any action that interferes with the trade, transport, and commerce, of Australia, its members may, under the bill, be treated as criminals. The Labour party stands for arbitration. There have been fewer strikes since it has been the law of this country. Sir John Quick, an ex-member of this House, was, when 70 years of age, appointed a Deputy President of the Arbitration Court, although he had had no previous industrial experience - His unjust judgments in the cases of Hoskins Brothers, and of the Kinross Cement Company, caused serious strikes. In the case of Mort's Dock his judgment was again at fault. It has always been recognized that the payment for casual labour, in any occupation, should be higher than that for permanent labour. That principle has been laid down by all Arbitration Court judges, including Mr Justice. Higgins, Judge Heydon, Judge Beeby, and Judge Edmunds. In spite of that fact, Sir John Quick has recently given an award in which he has determined that a man employed for more than four days is in permanent employment, and is, therefore, not entitled to casual rates. That award has caused a strike. The men concerned say that the reduction in rates .means a loss of almost £ 1 a week to them, and they will not accept the award, because other judges have treated their employment as casual labour.",26
50,Mr EODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"This legislation wil l not necessarily apply to those men. Mr E . RILEY - They are members of the painters and dockers union, and as their action is interfering with trade, commerce, and transport, they will be liable to imprisonment under this bill . Only 30 or 40 men at Mort's Dock were involved in the first place, but pressure was put on them to obey the award, and the dispute extended to the patternmakers, blacksmiths, moulders, and shipwrights. Over 1,000 men are now out on strike. Is the employer, who is responsible for lockouts to be subject to the provisions of this bill ? When this legislation is placed on the statute-book any attempt to give it effect will cause serious complications. Honourable members opposite always find excuses for unjust legislation. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) deplored, the loss of millions of pounds owing to the British seamen's strike. I have read speeches made by Americans in justification of the system of slavery. They said that if the slaves were emancipated a great loss of money would result through interference with trade and commerce. finest preachers in America were heard justifying the system of slavery. great reformer, John. Brown, had the courage to advocate revolution in order to free the slaves. He was executed, but his spirit went marching on. As the result of his labour the American slaves were freed. Men in this country have advocated Kanaka labour for Queensland. They said that North Queensland could not be developed with white labour. But the then Labour Government, with the assistance of the democrats of this country, abolished Kanaka labour, and today, notwithstanding the opposition of those who cry "" stinking fish "" when any great reform is proposed in this country, Queensland has developed under white labour, and is likely to continue to do so. Honourable members supporting the Government say that the bill is justified because it will prevent strikes. It will do no-' thing of the kind. Strikes cannot be prevented. Men of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic races have always resisted oppression and fought for their rights. . The bill will be as effective in preventing strikes as sticking plaster would be as a cure for cancer. No government can control strikes. I do not blame this Government for introducing the bill . It fought the election on this issue, and having won it , this legislation will be placed upon the statute-book, but never put into operation. The bill is a deliberate attempt to stifle the liberty of the trade unionists of this country, and to prevent them from selling their labour under the best conditions.",27
51,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,They cannot have both the right to strike and the Arbitration Court. Mr E. RILEY - The British seamen could not go to the Arbitration Court of this country to protest against a reduction in their wages.,27
52,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The British seamen were not under our jurisdiction. Mr E . RILEY - They were human beings, and my sympathies were with them in their action. The profits of the the British shipping companies are enormous. They are scrapping their old vessels, and building out of their surplus profits up-to-date floating palaces. Some of the vessels that come to this country are over 20,000 tons register.",27
53,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The shipping companies have to build that class of vessel Some of the to hold the world's tonnage. Mr E . RTLEY - That is so. Although One they are making immense profits, yet they deny the men the right to strike when their wages are reduced.",27
54,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Mr Havelock Wilson knows more about the conditions in Great Britain than the honourable member does. Mr E . RILEY - We helped the British seamen to keep them from starving. We have some of the milk of human kindness in us. We should deal justly with our unionists. I know that before the war Lord Inchcape formed the British shipping combine to compete with the German shipping companies, which were subsidized by the German Government. The British shipping companies have just as much right to combine as British seamen, and when two bodies organize to protect their own interests no government should discriminate ibetween them unfairly. But ""that is - what the bill discriminates im favour of the shipping companies and the employers of la'bour, but brings under the criminal - code the workers who are helping to develop this country,.",27
55,Mr ROEGEKS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The bill deals with lockouts as well as strikes. Mr E. RILEY - The employers are not mentioned in this bill.,28
56,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"That is not so. Mr E. RILEY - I ask the Attorney General to point out in what way the bill deals' with lockouts. An employer 'of labour can easily cause a lockout on the excuse that he is shutting up his works for repairs and alterations, or that there is a shortage of raw material or orders. But if, because of a notice in a workshop (that after a certain date the hours will be increased, or the wages reduced., a man calls together his fellowworkers, - and has the courage to say that they .should leave the job rather than accept the altered conditions, he will be liable to be - declared a criminal and fined, or imprisoned, .and deported. This clause makes it a criminal act for a man to endeavour - to sell his labour at the 'best obtainable price. I agree with the urovisioas relating to unlawful associations. Honourable members on this side do uot believe in the methods which those provisions are designed to punish. We desire this country to develop sanely :and steadily. We believe in the - settlement of industrial disputes by arbitration; but even under that system industrial peace will not be ensured if judges give unjust .awards. I have mentioned awards that were against the weight of evidence. The men who refuse to work under fair conditions imposed by a court will, by this bill, be made criminals and be liable ,to deportation. However, the Government, if it will not be advised by honourable members on this side of the House, must go its chosen way. Similar coercive tactics were employed during a strike of coal miners by Gregory Wade, the then Premier of New South Wales. Some of the men were put in gaol, and others in leg irons, but at the first opportunity the people annihilated the Wade Ministry. The bill introduced by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) to - deal with the Industrial .Workers of the World specially mentioned that organization. The present Attordoes. It- ney-General is too cunning to do anything like that. The Government says, that it has a mandate from the people.. It has no mandate to bring trade unionists under the criminal <code, I admit that many of them Voted against the Labour party at the last election. They were misled into the belief that the Labour party 'favoured the promotion of industrial strife. The Government may do what.it caii under this bilL We, who sit in opposition, will await with confidence the result when next the people have an opportunity to deliver judgment.",28
57,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.3] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat said that he agreed with the first portion of the bill relating to unlawful associations but opposed the later provisions. Having listened to the honourable gentleman very carefully, I am certain that if he understood the bill he - would accept it in its entirety. He .spokeas if it were .designed to prohibit .strikes^ and inflict punishment .upon those who engage in iheni. He said that it was directed .against trade unionists and their leaders. The truth is that it provides for none of those things. . It is introduced because the people clearly indicated their desire that legislation of this character should be enacted. Indeed, the honourable member for South Sydney frankly declared that the Ministerial parties won the election by promising this legislation, and he did not blame the Government for attempting to carry out the instructions of the people. It must be perfectly obvious to every one that the bill gives effect to the expressed will of the electors.",28

61,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Is the honourable memSir ber not a, democrat 1",28
62,Mr FENTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I do not prate of it.,28
63,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The basis of democracy is that the majority shall rule, and at the last 'election the majority gave to the Govermnent a mandate to introduce legislation of this character. It is, in fact a mere honoring of the pledges we gave to the people when we asked them to continue us in office. May I briefly remind the House of the conditions that preceded the introduction of this measure and the amending Immigration Act of 1925 ? For many months of last year. Australia was in the throes of serious industrial turmoil. Industry and transport services were held up repeatedly, not by mere local disputes, affecting a few employers and employee's, but by wide-spread and well organized troubles, which undermined the foundation of our national and economic life. Whether people agreed or disagreed with the methods adopted by the Government, whether they voted for or against the ministerial candidates at the last elec-' tion, the majority recognized that the time had come when, in the interests of the nation, steps should be taken to overcome and, if possible, obviate the difficulties with which we were confronted. I need not recapitulate in detail the interference with Commonwealth officers in the discharge of their public duties at Fremantle and elsewhere, but the House, is aware that, because of many sinister occurrences of that nature, the Government passed through Parliament legislation to grapple with this evil. Under the newly conferred powers, the Government took firm action, which was later supported by the people at the polls. The legislation introduced by the Government was acceptable to the electors; whatever the High Court may have decided, the people, at any rate, thought that the Government had taken the right course. After the Immigration Bill had been passed, and before our intention to appeal to the electors was announced, I made the Government's position quite clear. I said I believe the people are prepared to support me in what I have done, and I will not hesitate at any time to appeal to them for their endorsement of my actions, and, should necessity arise, to ask them for a mandate to take such further action as is essential in order tect the happiness and prosperity of Australia, and ensure the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. Shortly afterwards the Governor General dissolved Parliament, and again, in my policy speech at Dandenong, I said definitely what the Government would do if the people, by their votes, declared their , confidence in it . I saidThe Government is determined to defeat the nefarious designs of the extremists in our midst, and, armed with the mandate of the people, will take all necessary steps to accomplish this end. Although under our Constitution there is a King's peace of the Commonwealth which co-exists side by side with the King's peace within each of the States, up to this date in the history of Australia there has been little need for the Commonwealth to take action for its preservation. Generally speaking, the' authorities and laws of the States have been adequate to deal with what may be generally regarded as breaches of the King's peace. Eecent happenings have clearly demonstrated the existence of actions prejudiced to the peace of the Commonwealth. The time has now arrived when the Commonwealth Parliament should exercise its powers and pass effective legislation to deal with offences against the peace of the Commonwealth, including action against those persons who are actively engaged in associations and propaganda work having as their object the overthrow of the Constitution, interference with Commonwealth activities, resistance to its laws, and generally taking part in unlawful action' for the purpose of subverting external and internal commerce and intercourse in Australia. The measure now before the House carries out the pledge I then gave to the people. It deals with external and interstate commerce, and aims a blow at unlawful assor ciations which are trying to subvert the existing forms of government. I do not think any members of the Opposition will deny that during the election campaign the people understood thoroughly what the Government would do if it were continued in office. This bill is a natural sequel to our declarations on the hustings, and is, I believe, acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the people. It does not do the injury to trade unionists which honourable members opposite have declared to be our design. It is directed solely against those extremists who are trying to overthrow constitutional government and bring about political and economic chaos. It does not attempt to provide a method of settling industrial disputes; that problem is foreign to its purpose. The Leader of the Opposition declared yesterday that the Government has to prono need to seek further powers, and, in support of that contention, quoted section 24A of the Crimes Act. The honourable member could not have been sincere in suggesting that that section gives to the Government .the powers conferred by this bill. It does not deal with unlawful associations.",28
64,Mr CHARLTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,It gives power to deal with persons who try to create disaffection.,29
65,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable gentleman must realise that his statement thai, what the Government seeks to do can be achieved under the existing law, is con trarv to fact. If the honourable member will read the whole of the legislation referred to, he will realise that the case which he put forward cannot be maintained. Whether he agrees with what we propose to do or not, obviously we must pass this legislation to get the additional powers asked for. The law as it stands certainly does not give them. I regret that the measure which the Government hopes to bring down at a later stage, for the settlement of industrial disputes, could not be introduced concurrently.",30
66,Mr FENTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Why could it not?,30
67,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Because a tremendous amount of consideration and research is necessary before we can introduce it . That bill will deal with one of the most difficult problems that has ever confronted this country. It is a very grave misrepresentation to suggest that this bill can be regarded as an attack upon trade unionism. The Leader of the Opposition, in attempting to show that it was directed against trade unionists, asked why they were not exempted from certain of its provisions, as they are in the Unlawfu l Associations Act of 1916. The honourable gentleman suggested that there was something sinister in that. It is a pity that he had not read the act more carefully. By it certain organizations are declared to be unlawful associations, as, for instanceAny association which, by its constitution propaganda, advocates, or encourages, or incites, or instigates to, the taking or endangering of human life or the destruction or injury of property;",30
68,Mr CHAELTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The right honourable eentleman should read the proviso. It exempts trade unionists.,30
69,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I am about to deal with the point raised by the honourable member, If he will look at the proposed new sub-section 30A, paragraph b, of the bill, he will find that unlawful associations are to be deemed to includeAny body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, which by its constitution, or propaganda, or otherwise, advocates or encourages the doing of any act having or purporting to have as an object the carrying out of a seditious intention as defined in section 24A of this act. That provision is practically identical with paragraph b, section 3, of the act of 1916. Paragraph c of the same section addsAny association which the Governor General, by notice published in the Gazette, declares to be, in his opinion, an unlawful association within the meaning of the last preceding paragraph. Bnt there is this provisoProvided that this last sub-section shall not apply in the case of any association registered under any Arbitration law' of the Commonwealth or any State or any law relating to trade unions in any State.",30
70,Mr CHARLTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,That is the very point which I made. I was a member of this Parliament when the measure was under consideration.,30
71,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"If the honourable gentleman had read the act more carefully, he would know how hopeless his contention is'. The proviso exempting trade unionists relates only to associations which the Governor General, by proclamation, declares to be unlawful associations. Evidently he did not then protect the interests of trade unionists in the way he now declares to be necessary. I think I have made the position clear to the House, if not to the Leader of the Opposition. H is whole case rests on the statement that we are now proposing something different from what was done before. Trade unionists were not exempted under paragraph b of section 3 of the 1916-17 act, and they are not exempted under this bill . T suggest that the honourable gentleman has done a very or great injustice to trade unionists. Before a trade unionist could be convicted under the bill , it would have to be proved that he was one of a body of persons who advocated or encouraged the doing of a seditious act, as defined in paragraph b of proposed new section 30A. DO trade unionists encourage these things 1 I understand that they do not. Under the 1916 law organized trade unionists were properly exempted in certain circumstances, but there was no exemption for an offence against the community such as encouraging or instigating the taking or endangering of human life or the destruction or in j u ry of property. Trade unionists have nothing to fear. I think the Leader of the Opposition will realise, when he has thought the matter over, that the trade unionists have not very much to thank him for. They do not wish to be exempted in the circumstances which I have retailed. Another fact which the honourable gentleman stressed was that his party dissociated itself entirely from the extremists whose object is to subvert the government and destroy our economic system. He formed us that, during the election campaign, he had done his best to assure the people that the Labour party had nothing whatever to do with them. observed, however, that he spoke very quietly, and apparently did not display a great deal of courage.",30
72,Mr CHARLTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I was very definite, but, unfortunately, we got no publicity in the press.",31
73,Mr BEUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable gentleman, I venture to say, never told the people that, if returned to power, he would take drastic action against the extremists to prevent them from continuing their pernicious activity in the Commonwealth. I have no desire now to stir up feeling over this matter. Leader of the Opposition assured us that he and his party were in no way associated with the extremists, but he pointed the finger of scorn across the table and invited the people to compare the attitude of his party with what he regarded as the disreputable action of the Prime Minister in encouraging the Fascisti, whom he regarded as worse than the extremists. He suggested that we were encouraging these people to subvert the Constitution and bring about disorder in this country. I can only say that the honourable gentleman must have been carried away when he quoted the letter to the gentleman described as the organizer of the Fascisti movement in Australia. It passes my comprehension how the Leader of the Opposition could have been unaware of what had happened.",31
74,Mr CHARLTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Possibl y I did know, because I was out of the State during the election campaign.",31
75,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I can understand the letter being published by newspapers that were supporting the Labour party, I can imagine the letter being quoted by some of the honourable gentleman's followersI do not indicate to whom I refer-bu t it passes my comprehension that the Leader of the Opposition should quote it, and try to base an argument upon it . I can only assume that he does not know the circumstances of its publication. If he knows nothing about it, that is to his credit, because it was one of the most disreputable episodes in the recent election campaign. As the honourable gentleman has again referred to this letter, and has based his in- case against the Government upon it, I must, at the risk of being a little wearisome, once more state the facts concerning it. The letter was published in the I Labour Daily, Sydney, a few days before the election. It purported to be written by A . K i r by Hewlett, organizing secretary of the "" B r it is h Fascisti,'' to Captain Hatcher, organizer of the Australian branch. In the course of that letter, Mr . Hewlett was made to sayI t is pleasing to learn that your Federal Government has been assisting in initial organization work. ' Fortunately the last elections made the position safe in England, but in Australia the position is different. Labour is in power in four States, and our experience has been such that almost any means would be justified in The preventing it from ruling Federally. If necessary, steps should be taken to precipitate open hostilities with the militant unions. Open rioting would give us an opportunity to smash the unions and cripple Labour politically. In this we have the definite assurance that the present Federal Government would co-operate, and will secretly instruct its officers to work in conjunction with our forces. You need have no fear, tlierefore. Use your force to prevent Labour from assuming office should a Laibour victory at the polls eventuate. That is part of the letter, and I shall quote another part later. I was in Sydney about a week before the election, and a few days prior to the publication of the letter. I heard persistent rumours to the effect that the Labour party had a trump card that would be produced at the right moment, and that disaster would then overtake the Government. I waited with some interest until the letter was published. It was reproduced photographically, with the object of connot vincing readers of its genuineness. In vestigations were immediately made, and several things that made one wonder whether the letter was genuine at once caught the eye. In .the first place, the letter was dated the 17th September, and it contained a reference to the Australian election. On that date, no announcement of the election had been made, and no one knew that there was to be an election. The person who wrote the letter made that trifling slip in allowing sufficient time for it to reach Australia from London. There was also a reference to Mr , now Sir Austen, Chamberlain, as "" o u r chancellor of the exchequer."" The letter saidOur present Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Austen Chamberlain, said, "" Were Labour returned with a working majority, it would be necessary in the interests of the nation to suspend constitutional government, forcibly prevent it from assuming office. The person who wrote the letter described Sir Austen Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer, whereas he was Foreign Secretary, and had probably bad more publicity in the previous twelve than any other British Minister. two circumstances made the Government gravely suspicious. We succeeded obtaining a piece of the notepaper of this organization, and discovered slight error. The address on the letter was ""75, Elm Park Gardens, S.W.,"" but the actual address of, the Britisb Fascisti is ""71, Elm Park Gardens, London, S.W., 10."" Any one who is familiar with the London postal system knows that there is no district "" S.W.,"" without a number The telephone number was given as Central, followed by illegible numerals. actual number is "" Kensington 7683,"" and an address in Elm Park Gardens could not be on the central exchange, which is in the neighbourhood of Charing The title of the organization wrongly stated as "" British Fascisti,"" instead of "" British Fascists."" The signature of A. Kirby Hewlett-and subsequent history-bore not the slightest resemblance to a specimen signature of Mr Hewlett, received from Having so many grounds for we cabled to the High sioner in London, asking him to communicate with the persons concerned, and ascertain whether a letter of this character had been sent. He consulted Scotland Yard, which got into touch with the British Fascist officials. The reply received was that the man who was supposed to have signed the letter as secretary of the society, on the 17th September, retired from that position the previous July; that he cally denied that he had sent the letter-, and that officials of the denied that such a letter had been authorized. The alleged recipient made an affidavit swearing that he had never reMr Bruce. ceived such a letter, and knew nothing about it . The whole thing was shown to be a transparent and stupid forgery; and yet the Leader of the Opposition produces the letter as evidence that the Government is in close alliance with the Fascisti movement.",31
76,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The honourable the Leader of the Opposition was not aware and of the facts.,32
77,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I can only suppose that he was not.,32

I am amazed at the atmosArbitration phere of self-satisfaction and self-conwhatever gratulation that has enveloped honourable members opposite since the H i gh Court delivered its judgment. They have not hesitated to say, "" We told you so.

I do not wish to refer at length to the constitutional aspect of that measure, for the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham.)' has already discussed it . I shall content myself - with observing' .that if r . honourable members opposite were as confident that their legal luminaries were right, as the honourable member for Batman bas led us to believe they were, showed very little consideration for the the men who appeared before the board. Why did they allow tbem to become involved in an expenditure of from £3,000 or £4,000i f they really did become involved in newsit-whe n they were certain that the measure was unconstitutional? H a d they been certain of that there was a simple course for them to advise the men to to adopt. They should have told them not to take any notice of the summons served on them; to let the board recommend . their deportation;.and then to take action obtain a writ of habeas corpus from the is High Court, and the whole thing would have been ended. The fact is that they had not' the slightest suspicion that the bill was not within the ambit of the Constitution. The measure now before the House has been introduced to give effect I understand that no objection has been raised to the provisions of the proposed sub-section 30A, which deals with unlawful associations, and those connected endorse with them. Honourable members generally have expressed, the view that such associaunder tions and the people connected with them not are a menace to the country, and should I shall not, therefore, be spend any time on those provisions. The provisions that have been strongly .objected to are contained in the proposed new sub-section 30J. In discussing - them the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) asked, "" What is wrong in dealing with those people under the proto visions of the Commonwealth A r b i The Act, which has nothing to do with the matters referred to in the proposed new sub-section, bas for its purpose the settlement of industrial disputes, and the regulation and adjust1 The proposed new section is intended to become operative only wben persons in the community, at a time of national crisis, are endeavouring to take action which will seriously affect the whole of the people, and lead to chaos in our national life. The Leader of the Opposition said lhat many trade union leaders in a time of industrial disturbance work day and night to settle the dispute. I heartily agree with him that many of these men do invaluable work, not only in connection with the settlement of disputes, but in endeavouring to counteract the activities of a few wild leaders, .the extreme views of which if given effect, would damage the best interests of their own friends as well as those of the community at large. As a matter of fact, the provisions of this proposed new sub-section would never apply to reputable trade union leaders. Let us look at the matter from two stand-points. It has been suggested, in the first place, that the Government would not hesitate to cause to be issued, under the provisions of this proposed new sub-section, a proclamation declaring that some little industrial dispute that might arise to disturb the peaceful life of the community, was a ""serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States,"" and that persons who were connected with such a minor disturbance could then be imprisoned or deported. That is an utterly wrong conception. No government witn a proper sense of its responsibilities would think of issuing such a proclamation unless 'circumstances unquestionably warranted it. It has even been suggested that the Government would issue such a proclamation in the most light hearted way merely to serve its own ends or to deal with particular individuals. It is inconceivable that that should be the case. altogether from any idea of fairness or any sense of decency, no government with the slightest intelligence would falsely proclaim that a serious industrial dispute existed in the community. Would any government tliink of seizing men and compelling their appearance before a court if it thought that there was a possibility that they would not be. convicted? Some honourable members of the Opposition have argued that, in any case, the Mr Bruce. people are entirely opposed to legislation of this description. The reverse is the case. The people were consulted on this particular point, and, by a very large majority, they disagreed with the views of honourable members opposite and agreed with those of the Government. In this country governments have always to go to the bar of public opinion to ascertain the judgment of the people. No government would dream of exercising its powers despotically, for it would know that if it did so judgment would inevitably fall upon it. May I offer one word of advice to honourable members opposite? I know they do not like my advice^ as a rule, but perhaps they may be disposed to accept it on this occasion. I advise them to consider whether the people of Australia will tolerate them continually saying in this Parliament that the electors did not rightly determine the issue that was submitted to them at the last election. The people said, quite distinctly, that the Government acted rightly in endeavouring to suppress and deport those who were disturbing and prejudicing our trade and commerce. They said, in effect, ""We believe that the Government acted rightly in bringing tbese men before the Deportation Board. We believe that legislation of this character should be enforced against such men."" Honourable members opposite would be well advised to take the decision of the people in a more sporting spirit and not whine because they were defeated in the fight. The second point that ought to be considered is whether it is not necessary that the Executive should have this power. Seeing that the interests of the whole of the citizens of this country may be materially damaged by big industrial upheavals, which may be caused by even one man who deliberately aims at bringing chaos into our Apart economic life, surely it is essential that the Government should have power to deal with these people. It would never think of exercising such power despotically, because it would know that . the people are the masters, and can bring swift and rapid retribution on any government that misuses its power. Our object in including tbese new sub-sections in the bill is to give effect to the expressed will of the people. I assure honourable members, and, through them, the country generally, that these proposals are not aimed at trade unions, or at the leaders of trade unions. They are only aimed at those who are tryin g to destroy our national lif e and to bring untold misfortunes upon the whole of our people. Exception has been taken to the provision in the bill that individuals may be deported for two specific things. It has been said that the Government should not have power to send any one out of the country. I cannot understand the attitude that is being adopted by honourable members opposite. Persons have in the past been deported fro m Australia. Probably not one honourable member would agree to yield up the right that we possess to send men out of Australia if they commit certain unlawful acts. I have not heard any objection raised to the deportation of an individual upon conviction of any of the offences that fal l under the provisions relating to unlawful associations. I believe that every one is in favour of those provisions. A distinction, however, is drawn, in favour of British subjects, not because any principle'is involved, but because the idea is held that the power to deport such persons may be misused, and that the Government may take action against men who should not be subject to it . No government would dare to misuse those powers. But the righ t to take proper action must be vested in every government. For the moment I shall confine my remarks to the application of the bill to aliens. Take the case of a man who, after entering Australia, preaches doctrines that lead to industrial unrest, and commits acts which hamstring our transport system. taken before a court, and convicted. It is proved that he has been a source of trouble wherever he has resided,'and that nothing can be said in his favour. If such a person is sent to prison, he does not remain long in confinement. ""Upon his release he again moves about amongst the people, and continues to act unlawf u l l y , hoping that he will not again be convicted. Is it suggested that we shoiild not exercise our right to deport him ? Why should we shelter in Australia men who will not subscribe* to the views and the sentiments of the Australian people ? Every honourable member will probably agree with my argument in its relation to foreigners; but there are some who say, "" You must not deport British citizens. Once they have made their permanent home in Australia, no steps should be taken to get r i d of them, no matter what they do."" That has not been the practice in the past. Many British citizens have been deported from Australia. Twelve cases, at least, are on record in which that action was taken. Another matter to be considered is the maintenance of our White Australia policy. Does any honourable member subscribe to the view that we have not the power to deport a British citizen who is not a member of a white race? I cannot be charged with lack of sympathy with the British Empire. I believe in the Imperial connection. It is the greatest safeguard that Australia could have. Our whole future is wrapped up in the British Empire. But if a citizen of any country within the commonwealth of nations that form the British Empire enters Australia, and commits acts that menace our welfare, he should be sent back to the country from which he came. Why should we be saddled with him? Bolshevism is training its propagandists for the furtherance of its doctrines in very country. We in Australia do not believe in those doctrines. A citizen of Russia oan make littl e headway with his propaganda in a British' community. But many men have gone to Russia, where for upwards of two years they have undergone training designed to fit them to propagate in the British E m pire the doctrines of Bolshevism. Have we to keep in , Australia a man who so far forgets his own nationality and the promptings of patriotism, that he will He is submit to training in a foreign country in order that he may assist in the subversion of constitutional government within the Empire to which he belongs? We are not required to do that. On the contrary, he should be returned-to his own country. T should readily deport such a man. The power to deport will be exercisable in only two cases. That power is inherent in every government, and we should jealously guard it : F r o m every point of view we are entitled to get r i d of those who do not belong to our country, and will not conform to our national standards and ideals. One other point has been raised. It is said ' "" Y o u propose to deal with these men in a way different from that in which you would deal with Australian citizens. Why do you not get r i d of an Australian citizen if he commits acts which you believe are dangerous to the country ?"" It might be a good thing Australia if, in extreme cases, such could be taken. I believe that every sovereign government has the power banish its nationals. We might possibly banish Australian citizens; but probably no other country would take them in. can send back to the country to which belongs a person who is a menace to own country, but it is practically impossave sible for us to banish our own citizens.",33

He endeavoured to prove that the bill does not mean what it 'explicitly states it does mean. When the right honourable gentleman claimed to have received a date because of the action - that the vernment took prior to the elections, and the further action it proposed to take, be proved that he was given a mandate merely on what he told within the people, and not on what he advocate, actually intended to do.

The Prime Minister demade an attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). He spent a that considerable time in endeavouring to of prove that my honoured leader was quite do wrong in his reference to the powers under the Unlawful Associations Act. The Leader of the Opposition quoted a proviso to the effect that the Unlawful Associations Act should not apply to",36
91,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,That is not an existing act.,36
92,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"It was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and a proe viso in it specifically exempted trade unions. The Prime Minister endeavoured the to show that the Leader of the Opposition was wrong when he said that the proviso applied only to sub-section c, which provides for the proclamation by ihe Governor General of an unlawful manassociation. The rigbt honourable gentleGoman said that trade unionists were not exempted from the provisions of sub-section i . Those who read that sub-section will see that trade unions do not come its scope. It deals with those who encourage, incite, or instigate the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property. That provision was never meant to apply I to trade unions. But there is an exemption from the section under which the inproclamation of the Governor General Gobad to be made - During the debate that measure it was clearly inshown that that section should not is apply to trade unions, and ih order to protect them the proviso was inserted. I come to another point the Prime Minister tried to make. The-Leader of the Opposition yesterday declared in this House that honourable members on this side do not - stand for organizations that advocate force, violence, and bloodshed. He said that we stand for constitutional methods to secure a change in any system that we think ought to be changed. The Prime Minister complained that the honourable gentleman made that declaration in a very _weak voice, and did not proclaim it aloud. Another honourable member on the other side interjected, "" If you had said that before the elections, ycu would have won."" I heard the Leader of the Opposition, before the elections, make the same declaration most definitely, in a ball in the centre of the electoral division of Plinders, represented by the Prime Minister. I read the garbled press report of the honourable gentleman's speech which appeared the day after, and it was one of the worse pieces of reporting that ever came under my notice. The Prime Minister commented upon that speech, and says that it was very weak. I listened to the speech and it was a strong declaration, even more strongly worded than that made here yesterday. It ill becomes the Prime Minister and honourable members opposite, who won their election because of the powor of money and because a united press starred what they had to say and suppressed what was said by honourable members on this, side, to say that if these declarations had been made before the - elections, the result would have been different. In the circumstances, it is of no use for honourable members opposite to talk of their mandate and the power they possess. The election was a fight for the mass of the people against the privileged classes, 'and the people had, as always, to fight against the organized power of. wealth which finds its expression mostly in the press of this country. The Prime Minister was greatly upset about the reference made to the Fascisti. I am not concerned about tbem. In my view, the Fascisti and similar associations represent but a passing phase. If honourable members opposite point to the fact that a great organization, which does not stand for the constitutional methods in which we in Australia believe, holds the reins of power in Russia, we have an equa? bight to remind them that a similarly unconstitutional organization - governs in It a l y . I - do not believe that the methods employed in either of these countries can be introduced in Australia, and become a menace to this country, unless we bring about in Australia the same conditions as those which have been responsible for revolution in other lands. That is what this bill has a tendency to do, and the more of this class of legislation that is passed, the more likely are such conditions to be brought about. While I am not very concerned about the Fascisti business, the pointthe Prime Minister made to prove that the letter referred to was a fake, was the date of the letter,-17t h September-and the fact that that was a date prior to any announcement of the Federal election. That was the strongest point he made. Mr 6. FBANCIS - That is not so. It was that the man referred to neither signed nor sent the letter.",36
93,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"That is, after all, only a matter of denial. The Prime M i nister's strongest proof that the letter was not sent was that the 17th September, the date af it , was before the announcement of the election.",37
94,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Will - the honourable member suggest the evidence which he thinks proves that the letter is genuine?,37
95,Mr SCTJLLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I shall deal withone thing at a time. I have said that I am not concerned about the letter at all, but I want to stress another point, and it is that it was well known in this country long before any official announcement of it i ' that there was to be an election. The very date of the election was known before the official announcement - that one was to be held was made in this House. I can tell honourable members how we knew the date of the election.",37
96,Mr ATKINSON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Th a honourable member knew more than I did.,37
97,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"That is not so. At a certain stage I knew exactly as much as the honourable gentleman knew as a member' of the Government. I knew the date of the election because the Government stooped, for the first time in my knowledge of elections,' to a despicable electioneering trick. It s organization sent wires to those controlling every public balli n Australia that it wanted, engaging the halls"" for the night of the 13th November. Every town hall in my electorate was engaged for the night of the 13th November, and that before any announcement that there was to be an election. I was rung up on the telephone, and received the message, "" Do you kuow that the National party has engaged the Richmond town hall, the Collingwood town hall, and the Fitzroy town hall for the night of the 13th November?"" My reply was, ""Then the election is to be on the 14th November.""",37
98,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Is there any evidence of that?,38
99,Mr SCTJLLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The evidence can be obtained by askin c? those in charge of the town halls when they were engaged for that night. Does the honourable gentleman dispute my word in the matter ?,38
100,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I do not know anything about it . I say there was no evidence of the date. On what date was it ?,38
101,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I said it was before any announcement of the election was made in this House.,38
102,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Was it before the 17th September, the date on which the letter referred to is supposed to have been written in London?",38
103,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"We adjourned on the 25th September, and the announcement of the elections was made before that date.",38
104,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,But not before the 17th September.,38
105,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,My point is that it was well known for weeks before that that there was to be an election.,38
106,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Was it?,38
107,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Yes , and the actual date of the election was known because of the date for which the halls were engaged. This was several days before the official announcement of the date of the election in this House. I have said that I am not bothering about the letter, but Mr Hatcher said that the Prime Minister knew all about his organization. The Prime Minister said that that statement was untrue, but I read a statement in the press that Mr Robert Hatcher had expressed his astonishment that the Prime Minister should have denied any knowledge of the existence of the organization here, because he had himself made the Prime Minister acquainted with it, and wrote the statement which the Leader of the Opposition read in this House yesterday. The Prime Minister is angry that any suggestion should be made that he or the party opposite is in any way connected with the Fascisti. I do not wish to connect the party opposite with Fascism or with the things which are done by those who claim to be Fascisti, but I ask that in the same way honourable members on this side shall not be connected with communism.'violence, and bloodshed, as they were throughout the election. Honourable members opposite during the election were fighting the Labour party, and told the country that the issue was law and order versus lawlessness. What was the insinuation in that statement ? We were no more responsible for the wild utterances of individuals who happened to be associated with the working class movement than were honourable members opposite, for the wild and stupid utterances of some who stood for the employing class. We ask that we. shall be judged by our platform, our programme, and our record, and by nothing else. That was not the issue put before the people in the stunt election which was held. I should not have risen to speak upon this bill were it not for the provisions in it which are directed against the great trade unions of Australia. Under cover, of an attack upon unlawful associations, the bill makes a subtle, and in some provisions, an open attack upon unionism. I insist that unionists shall not be classed as criminals. It is an insult to the great body of trade unions to propose to deal with industrial disputes in a crimes bill. Tf the Prime Minister is in earnest, and does not believe that the bill should deal with disputes between trade unionists and their employers, let him accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and omit from the bill the clauses dealing with such disputes. They should be dealt with in an industrial bill, and not in a crime's bill. The Prime Minister said that the bill is not aimed at trade unionism, and that he believes in trade unionism. There was a chorus of cheers from his supporters when the statement was made. They believe in trade unionism. They admire it , and praise it-provide d it does not take any action. Mr G. FRANCIS - They have supported it, too.",38
108,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"No ; when it takes any action, honourable members opposite will not support it . When trade unionism takes action to maintain the rights of men, it is never supported by the majority of honourable members on the opposite side. With them trade unionism is never right, but always wrong. A hundred years ago, that was the attitude taken up by the people who then represented the interests which are now represented by honourable members opposite. There was a time in the history'of Great Britain when there was in existence what were known as the combination laws, which made trade unions illegal, and made it a crime to form a union, or to hold a meeting of a union. Men were deported for forming trade organizations. The combination laws were repealed by another law of Great Britain , but the law repealing them still provided that ""any action which may arise from deliberation of . workmen is illegal."" Whilst men could form their unions, and they were considered lawfu l associations, to take any action as the result of the deliberations of unions was illegal. That was the law in Great B r i tain for many years. That is indicative of the frame of mind of those who are responsible for this bill . Trade unions are all right, u n t i l they take some action, and then this law is to come into force, and jails, and deportaton are provided for those who take action to bring about better conditions.",38
109,Mr GARDNER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The honourable member does not suggest that the Bill would apply to ordinary conditions.,39
110,Mr SCTJLLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I ask the honourable member to read the bill . I say that it applies to any action, however small, taken by a trade union in the way of an industrial dispute.",39
111,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Le t the member read the words in the bill to which he objects.,39
112,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I shall come to them later. Let me lay it down that no law passed by the Parliament should be unjust. Not only should the law be just, but its """"application should be free from bias, and should be removed from party politics. I am sure that the honourable member for .Fawkner will agree with those conditions. A law should be just, and its application should be free from political and party bias. This bill does not comply with those conditions.",39
113,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Yes it does.,39
114,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I shall prove to the honourable member that it does not. This is a law dealing with industrial disputes, and it depends for its application upon a proclamation to be issued by the Government. Ordinarily, a law passed to doal with criminals depends for its application upon the police. force and the courts of the country, and not upon the initiative of the Government. But this law can come into operation only when the political head of the country says it ought to.",39
115,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Q u it e so. But t h at is not discrimination. Every one will be amenable to the law after the proclamation.,39
116,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable member knows enough about political bias to realise that matters which are lef t to the decision of a political head are not given that serene and judicial consideration which we expect from a judiciary. The proclamation of this law will depend entirely on the will of those who are for the time being in power. That is fundamentally wrong. In the case of a law against criminals, the police take action without any proclamation by the Government, and the courts decide the issues. Such a law comes into operation automatically. Similarly, this law should act automatically on the lockout, or on the strike, and , the very fact that ' it does not proves it to be biased, because its application rests on political opinion. While, on the face of it , it does not discriminate between strikes and lockouts, even if proof can be obtained that a lockout has taken place, we must wait for the Government of the day to proclaim that there exists a serious industrial disturbance before honourable we can bring the offending employer before the court and secure an order for his deportation, which, of course, is not likely to be made. Now I come to another phase of the Prime Minister's speech. The right honourable gentleman said that the people had endorsed the action of the Government in setting up a board in an attempt to deport certain individuals. The people did not endorse this action u n t i l they were well assured that it was constitutional. But the right honourable gentleman says that the constitutionality of the matter had nothing to do with the decision of the people. As a matter of fact if the people had realized that they were voting for something which violated the Constitution, they would not have supported it . It violated not only the technical point which the Prime ister emphasizes, but also a mental principle of our Just as trial by jury is laid down in Magna Charta, so is it also laid down in our Constitution, which is framed upon the principle of Magna The Prime Minister says that the proposed new section 30J, providing for the issue of a proclamation that there exists a serious industrial disturbance, not operate against leaders of the trade union movement. But it rests with the political head of the day to issue it. According to the right honourable man also, it would only issue in relation to a matter ""of national and vital ance. There are many big strikes dealing with matters of national and vital importance, for which there is more justification than there is for many strikes. There was, for instance, a coal strike in Australia when, in my opinion, the men had a just case, for when the case was fairly hear.d, they won it. in the meantime, their strike had a most paralyzing effect on commerce and industry. The recent shipping strike was only a circumstance compared with it; yet no attempt was made during strike to pass panic legislation this character. The Prime asked, ""Would any Government claim such a law without strong reason or justification for doing so?"" swer is a simple one-the Government has already done so. The right gentleman said the people would not stand for it, that they would fling the Government out. I thought the same prior to the recent election, but when a ""stunt"" can be worked up as it was during the recent campaign many a thing which the people do not intend to support can be carried through. The fact remains that, justification, the Government operation an iniquitous law, and it is idle for it now to put up the plea that it would not misuse its power in. this There was a time when I believed that no government of this country would misuse its power, but after our experience ing the last few months of the vindictive use of the power of a government two individuals in this country, I believe that anything is possible if we grant this power. The bill before us provides that any person who part in a strike in relation Mr Scullin. Min- transport of goods, or in relation to funda- employment in the provision of any pubConstitution. lic service by the Commonwealth, may be imprisoned and, in addition to being i m prisoned, may be deported. I invite the attention of the honourable member for Charta. Eobertson (Mr Gardner) to the words: "" An y person who aids or encourages a strike."" Surely that is the mildest action one could take. The man who gives a could few shillings to the wife of a striker, and thus helps him to carry on, is assisting in a strike. ' The Coercion Act of Victoria provided for exactly the same thing. gentleI t can be regarded as assisting a strike.",39
117,Mr GARDNER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Tba t is only after cirimport- cumstances have arisen to j u s t if y the issue of a proclamation.,40
118,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"- Yes; but the time at which a proclamation shall be small issued rests entirely with the political head of the country, instead of with those who administer the law free from political influence. The penalty provided may But. be imprisonment for one year, and, in addition, depostation. We have gained one point in this fight. There is to be no board. A court will now decide the issue. Surely the judge, who sees the prisoner the coal and bears the evidence, sbould be in a of better position than any one else to in Minister flict a penalty, and should alone impose pro- it. Does the honourable member for Fawkner endorse that? My an- Mr MAXWELL - Yes .",40
119,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Is it the law in any honourable country which deports people?,40
120,Mr SCULLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I am not concerned with that. I am concerned only with what is right. What authority has the Attorney-General to step over the power of the judge to inflict a penalty, and add something to the penalty imposed by without bim? put into Mr MAXWELL - Would the honourable member be satisfied if the proclamation were issued only after a judge had been connection. satisfied that a serious state of industrial unrest existed?",40
121,Mr SCTJLLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I would not be satisdur- fied with any law that makes it a crime to strike, or make criminals of those who against refuse to sell their labour at a given price, or those who close their shops and refuse to employ men unless at a wage which pays them. Those are matters that takes can be dealt with by other laws. They to the should not come under this bill . The offence of a man who may be charged with encouraging or assisting a strike may be so slight that the judge wbo bears the evidence may inflict a nominal fine. Tbat ought to be the end of it , but, for reasons that may be political, the At torney-General can then step in and add to the punishment already inflicted the penalty of deportation. It is an outrage on. justice to introduce a bill to permit this to be done. It sets up a political punishment, and not a judicial punishment. It is that sort of thing that is likely to create revolts in a country such as this. Mr A . GBEEN - And it will not prevent strikes.",40
122,Mr SCTJLLIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"It will have no more effect in preventing strikes than a mustard plaster would have on a wooden leg. The bill, in some respects, is an improvement on a previous measure, inasmuch as the Deportation Board has been abandoned. One of the big issues we fought in the election was the right of trial before a properly constituted court. We had previously fought it here against the unanimous vote of honourable members on the other side, and we fought it again in the country. Although we put ourselves in the position of - appearing to be supporting the actions of some men whose deeds and utterances we did not support, we stood for the principle of the riglit of those men to be tried by a court It is the right which is given to the worse criminal in the land. Although we went down fighting for that principle, evidently our protestations have had some effect on the minds of the people, and even on the Gtovernment, because the stupid and iniquitous policy of having a political board instead of a court to judge this issue has now been abandoned. When we went to the country, quoting Magna Charta and our own Australian Constitution, we were sneered at, but the High Court has since justified us in that regard, and scarified the Government. The deportation provided for in this bill is in addition to whatever imprisonment may be imposed by a judge. It is thus a double punishment-wha t I may describe as composite punishment. This bill deals with things other than unlawful associations. It deals with splitting bank-notes, forging documents, and stealing, side by side with the refusal of men to work because they do - not consider the conditions under which they are asked to work are suitable. It is a disgrace to this Parliament that the two things should be put side by side, but when we examine the measure f u r ther we find that there is in it that discrimination which the honourable member for Pawkner says should not be indulged in. The Attorney-General will not be able under this bill to deport any man who has been convicted of forgery, of splitting notes, or stealing; but no matter how slight may be the offence of a man who takes part in an industrial dispute, if he is one of. those who happen to give trouble to the powers that be, he may be shanghaied out of the country at the will of the Attorney-General. We are asked, "" Cannot we trust the Attorney-General?"" If the present Attorney General were placed on the High Court bench, tomorrow, I would trust him. I believe that he would carry out the traditions of the judiciary if he were placed, there, but I refuse to trust him while he is influenced by Cabinet or party meetings in a political action of this description. I am backed up in that belief by the statements of the Attorney General himself when the previous measure was being discussed. I shall quote from a report of his speech made at Kew on the 13th September of last year. I have never seen a contradiction of that speech. He was then j u s t if y in g the appointment of the Deportation Board to try Walsh and Johnson, and he saidThere were some facts that could not be proved by legal evidence. . . . It was found necessary to alter the law. I can imagine what the Attorney-General would say if he were defending a criminal in the courts of this country, and any attempt were made to find him guilty without legal evidence. The honourable member is a trained lawyer,, and understands the use of words and the weight of evidence, yet he makes. that statement in justification of a board that is not a properly-constituted body. Two days after he made thespeech at Kew, he came down to this House and protested against an appeal board deciding questions of taxation, because he said that it was not a court properly constituted under the laws of this country. On his argument we must not have a board to deal with taxation, but we should have a board that does not need to obtain legal evidence to order the deportation of a man wbo bas lived in this country for 40 years. Attorney-General is now to decide when a man shall be deported from this country. The bill deals with forgers and thieves, but deportation is not provided for them. We are asked to leave to the tender mercies of the Attorney-General all those who take part in industrial disputes. Certain honourable members for political purposes only, bave decried the credit of Australia. They that there was no great industrial heaval and disturbance sucb as they talked about during the elections. the trouble was confined to the shipping, and there was then not even an Australian strike. It was a strike of men who came from another part of this great Tbey were fighting against a disgraceful reduction of their wages, because of that, a proclamation issued. No sane Government have issued a proclamation unless the circumstances were serious; but in this case the circumstances were comparatively trivial. The British seamen went on strike as a protest against the reduction in their pay of £1 a month, and that was not a grave circumstance. A few ships were held up for a few weeks, but ships and industry also have been held up longer in this country. No previous Government ever introduced a measure like this. We are asked to trust the Government with the awful and enormous powers provided under the bill, which, it says, will only be exercised when circumstances are grave. Let me say to those honourable members, who for political ends, and to cover up their own political record when facing the certain vengeance of the electors, decried this country, and hold it up to the world as a place of continual trouble, that the statistics quoted yesterday, by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), proved this country to be the most peaceful in the world. Let me quote a recent opinion by Mr George Pairbairn, today the Victorian Agent-General, at one time a member of this House. Mr. Pairbairn was strongly opposed to the Labour party, politically, when he sat in this House, but he was recognized by both sides as a fair-minded man. I do not agree with his political opinions, but on a question of fact I believe that Mr. Mr Scullin. Fairbairn would give an honest opinion. On the 26th of last month he was interThe viewed by a representative of the Geelong Advertiser, and, after deprecating the sending from Australia of cables that were injurious to its credit, he dealt with the alleged disturbances in this country. He said, "" My own impression is that there is more disturbance in one day in Glasgow than there is in Australia in a year, and in my opinion Australia is about the quietest place on the face of opposite, the earth."" I believe that he is right. As one who believes in the progress of knew this country, and in the peaceful settleup- ment of disputes,. I deprecate the action of the Government and its supporters in All eternally talking about disturbances and disputes, and ruining the credit of Australia abroad. The Prime Minister said a great deal about the mandate that he Empire. received fro m the people. One point that he stressed, and which was stressed by and, every one of his supporters, was that was unionists should be given control of their would unions by secret ballot. Somebody suggested to the Prime Minister at one of his meetings that the wives of the unionists should also be given a vote, and he, the Prime Minister, thought it an excellent idea. That cry that every union should have a secret ballot before it could plunge this country into a strike carried the Government through the election. What does that mean? It means sanctioning every strike for which a majority of the members of a union vote. If a majorit y of unionists vote in favour of a strike, and a strike occurs, then the Attorney-General, under this bill, may issue a proclamation declaring the Commonwealth to be in . a state of grave industrial disturbance. In that case the men who voted for the strike, and also the minoritv who voted against it , and who would go on strike in loyalty to their comrades, could be thrown into gaol, and those who were not born in Australia could be deported. What about the wives who may have been given a vote ? They could be charged with encouraging a strike, and and also thrown into gaol, and those who were not born bere could be deported. We have the materials here for a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. The policy on which the Government received a mandate from the country was the enforcement of a secret ballot by unions before going on strike. Yet under this bill unionists, if they carry' out the decision of a majorit y in favour of a strike, may be declared criminals. How can honourable members reconcile these things?' I suggest that it would be analogous to insist on the taking of a secret ballot by burglars before they attempt burglary. If the Government authorizes a secret ballot-and it intends to do so under legislation to be introduced, and which should bave been introduced before t h is - I suggest that could be charged with encouraging a strike, and ought to be gaoled, and those of its members that were' not born in Australia deported. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday emphasized the fact that, ever since penalty clauses have been inserted in the arbitration laws, it has been absolutely impossible to prove a lock-out. Employers bave the position in their own hands. Every reasonable-minded man in this House knows that to be true. There is no need to put in the bill any provision relating to employers acting in combination. An employer is a combination in himself. A man who employs in his business 2,000 or 3,000 men can lock them out for some reason or other, and he need not act in combination with anybody else; but if his employees wish to protest against their conditions, they must act in combination, to be successful. ""We cannot compare things - that are different. It cannot be said that under the bill we are treating both sides alike by providing penalties for both strikes and lockouts. It is impossible to prove a lockout, although it is easy to prove a strike, since it must be done openly. We cannot compel an employer to employ men under any other than his own conditions.",41
123,Mr LATHAM,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I do not think that the honourable member has - read the second part of the definition ""of a lockout. will observe from it that a combination is not required. There can be a lockout by a single employer. Mr SCTJLLIN"" - That is true. know in the industrial history of this country of cases in which those who constitute the management have closed down works by provoking a strike. We know of mining frauds which have been covered up by forcing strikes. When any attempt has been made to expose the employers the men have been harassed, their conditions reduced, and contract rates decreased in order to force the men out on strike, with the result that the mine has been flooded, and the fraud thus covered up. ""Under those circumstances the men can be treated under this legislation as strikers and imprisoned. I do not say that all employers would adopt those tactics, because many of them desire to give the men a fair deal. According to the bill a strike is a it cessation of work brought about by employees acting in combination. Those who framed the bill know perfectly well that the men have to act in combination or else fail . We know that united action by the workers has enabled them to emerge from the p it of poverty, and that without that action their conditions would not have improved. What crime have the workers committed to warrant the Government branding them as criminals? The honourable member for Wannon. (Mr Rodgers) said that the workers could not have it both ways-the y could not bave both arbitration and the right to strike. Let the Government fight that out as an economic and industrial question, and let us put our views to this country. But we are not now arguing whether men have the right to strike, and at the same time have an Arbitration Court or Wages Board. We say that the Government has no right to make criminals of men who refuse to sell their labour at a price which they do not consider suitable. Contrast the attitude of this Government towards different sections of the community. Do they utter a word of protest against the men who combine and refuse to sell their commodities to the workers except at exorbitant prices? At one time we were supposed to have an act to deal with combines. Has there been any suggestion on the part of the Government to alter the Constitution to He deal with the millers' combine, which refuses to sell flour to any baker who will not sell bread at a fixed price. I know of one woman in Footscray who We struggled to get supplies of flour. The millers combine refused to supply her with flour unless she sold bread at an in creased price of i d . or l d . a loaf. One bag of flour that was being taken to her place had the contents of a bottle of eucalyptus poured into it . The Government has not said a word about those people who combine and refuse to sell their commodities except at exorbitant prices. If the workers who have only their labour to sell combine and refuse to work at a stated rate they will, under this measure, be declared criminals, and if a strike is an extensive one they may, if not born in Australia, be deported, bowever small the offence, merely on the word of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The workers of Australia are being told that it is high treason to strike, but if the employers or manufacturers refuse to sell their products at acertain price it is termed patriotism, and they are recommended for a title. Let me institute a comparison between the oonditiojns im Great Britain and Australia. In consequence of the decline in the coal mining industry in Great Britain there is likely to be a crisis. The question has to - be faced-it is a serious one - of . whether certain gentlemen are to give up life-long privileges or whether the coal miners are to submit to sweated conditions. A decision for the moment has been suspended by the payment of a large sum of money by the British Government, but the issue has to be faced. There is a good deal of speculation in Great Britain today as to what will be the ultimate result.' There are active spirits in B r it a in today. Some are preparing for the crisis which they believe is approaching. £o far as the evidence discloses they took no part in any acts of violence or force, but they urged the soldiers not to shoot down their fellow-workers if a strike should come. For that twelve communists were imprisoned, and public indignation aroused in Great B r i tain today over this question is most pronounced. I have read a report of the speeches delivered by respectable and reputable members of the House of Commons at a meeting held in London on the 14th December last, when they deliberately threw out a challenge to the Government of the day by repeating word for word the utterances upon which these men were indicted. That is the kind of challenge this Government will get when they bring this measure into force and a crisis comes. Let me quote the opinion of Canon Lewis Donaldson. He saidThe Government's fear is not communism but the Labor movement. They did not fear force, they feared the growth of the knowledge of the people. The basis of the present Mr Scullin. order of society is not service but self-interest. Its methods were not co-operation but competition. Its aim is not to make life but to make wealth. A good deal of interesting evidence has been given before the coal commission which is now sitting in England. One of the witnesses summoned before the commission was the Duke of Northumberland who, in cross-examination, admitted that he took £75,431 .out of the coal in dustry in the form of royalties during the twelve months ended September, 1925. He was asked if he thought he ought to draw such a large sum for doing nothing, and in payment for coal which he did not place in the ground. He was also asked if he thought he was rendering the same service as 440 miners, whose yearly wages would aggregate that amount; and he said he thought he was. He said that his expenses and the money he disbursed should be taken into consideration. I suggest that 440 miners would disburse their wages as freely, widely, and wisely as the Duke of Northumberland would disburse his money. It was also shown that for the twelve months ended September, 1925,. the Marquis of Bute drew £150,000 in royalties, and the' Duke of Hamilton £115,000. In a general statement submitted it was shown that no less than £6,000,000 was drawn in royalties.' Obsolete panicky legislation that has been a dead letter in Britain for centuries is now being brought into operation 'there, not because there is a fear of insurrection or . acts of violence being committed, but because the authorities areafraid of free speech on the the industrial problems which have to be' faced in the near future. That, I suggest, is what is actuating this Government today. There is a suggestion of a great crisis approaching in England, which will be to the detriment of these royaltymongers, who have rendered no service to Britain . A deliberate attempt is being made to interfere with the conditions of the men, and terrorize them by bringing them under old legislation, under which they can be placed in jail if they utter a word of protest. One of the great boasts of Britain has been that she has allowed freedom of speech in all circumstances, and the future peace of the country lies in granting freedom of speech in the widest possible sense. Even though the bounds may be overstepped at times and wild statements made, we will achieve more by sweet reasonableness than by force and coercion. In The Industrial History of England, H . D . B . Gibbons writesWlien we look back on the last century we can only wonder that trade unionists have been so moderate in their demands. We know that the workers have had to fight every inch of the way to their present position, and that, u n t i l the Arbitration Court was established, wages boards appointed, and the unions were strong, their only protection was the right to strike. In the past the workers of Britain faced .guns and swords, and heard the dungeon doors slam, but they fought on. Is it to be thought that the workers in Australia, who have sprung from the same stock, are going to take this kind of legislation lying down-that is, of course, if the Government dares to enforce it . Do the Government imagine that men whose ancestors fought for their rights in such a determined way, are likely to. cower like craven curs before any petty tyrant that may arise today in the Government of this country ? I believe that the workers in Australia are not getting a fair deal. I do not think that our social system is just, but I believe in the evolutionary method of changing it . believe in constitutionalism, and that even under a system that may not bring perfect justice to the workers, we ought to try to get together to settle economic questions in a reasonable and peaceable way. It is because of that belief that I denounce this legislation, which destroys the atmosphere that we should create to bring the opposing parties together. It destroys the very spirit of peace-the possibility of a better understanding, and the closer cooperation which must exist if industry is to be successfully, carried on. There are many thousands of thoughtful trade fore unionists, and thousands of thoughtful, honest employers, too, in Australia are anxious to see a cessation of strife, and desire that the workers shall receive a greater share of the wealth they prostate of the House. duce. There has never been a more opportune time than - the present in which to create and foster that spirit of co-operation. This legislation, however, drives us back to the dark ages of turies ago. It destroys the atmosphere necessary to bring about the results that we desire. It bas been said that it is not the great body of trade unionists, but only a few agitators, who nists during the election campaign. stir up trouble. Agitators, however, could not cause dissension in the ranks of the workers unless there was cause for it . Remove the cause, change the circumstances, and the agitators will have no chance of indulging in the stirring-up process. Not'a word do we hear from honourable members opposite concerning anything done by the employing class. We have frankly admitted that certain acts are committed in the name of labour of which we do' not approve. We have frankly admitted that we do not stand for all the utterances and suggestions made in the name of labour, but there is no such frank admission from honourable members opposite concerning employers. . There is no appeal by them to the men of wealth and education, who have had opportunities in life, to extend the right hand of fellowship to their fellow men. In the opinion of honourable members opposite, the workers are always wrong. In every industrial dispute which arises, the workers, according to them, are at fault. Are the workers to accept every proposal of the employers without opposition? They are spoken of as "" hands,"" in terms of "" hiring "" and "" firing."" The way in which the GovernI ment proposes to treat trade unionists is clearly shown in this bill . It in tends to brand trade unionists as criminals under a measure that should relate only to criminals. I strongly protest against industrial offences being in cluded in a measure of this kind. We should provide for them under industrial legislation, and not under a bill of this nature. The measure is vindictive and unreasonable, and will not produce the result we all should desire.  discussing the provisions of the bill I should like to reply briefly to some of who the statements made by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin).",43
124,Mr MAKIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I draw attention to the [Quorum formed.]  orable member for Yarra has emptied the House, but the action of the honourable cenmember for Hindmarsh enables honourable members to know that I am on my feet.' The honourable - member for Yarra said that the members of the Government did not believe what they said about commuThe statement of the honourable member for Yarra is unfair, and my reply to the honourable member is "" Evil be to him who evil thinks."" The honourable member for Yarra should credit honourable members on this side of the House with being as honest in their convictions as I hope they are. The honourable member also criticized the press of Australia because it did not give the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) a fair report of his policy speech, which he said was made to appear a weak effort. Included in my friends are a number of ladies who take a keen interest in politics, and a few days before the elections one of them said that she had "" listened in "" to the speech which the Leader of the Opposition delivered in Adelaide. The opinion she had formed was that it was a weak effort, and consisted principally, as she put it, of an abuse of the Prime Minister and his people. Another statement of the honourable member for Yarra . was that Nationalist candidates had engaged all.the halls in the principal towns throughout the Commonwealth; but in answer to an interjection it was disclosed that thore were only three halls in the vicinity of Melbourne that, were not available to Labour candidates. I emphatically deny the statement of the honourable member, because I know that a number of the halls in Adelaide and its suburbs were not engaged for a long time after the issue of the writs. The Leader of the Opposition stated that strikes are not as ""numerous in Australia as in other countries. He omitted to point out that in other countries the strike is the only weapon the worker has, whereas in Australia Parliament has provided an arbitration system for the settlement of industrial disputes. people of Australia were assured by the advocates of arbitration that .when it became the law of the land strikes would cease. Now the workers are told that they can try arbitration, and if an award does not suit them, they can resort to the strike, and no matter how they break the law they must uot be punished. Honourable members opposite have said that it is very easy to prove the existence of a strike, but difficult to prove that workers have been locked out, but in recent years the greatest difficulty has been experienced in the Arbitration Court in proving either the occurrence or authorship of a strike. Critics of the bill take exception  to the power to be granted to a Minister tb declare the existence of a serious industrial disturbance. Yet the Riot Act may be read by a sheriff, a magistrate, a mayor, and even a common or garden justice of the peace. When that emergency _ power is granted by the Riot Act to comparatively irresponsible people, there is nothing extraordinary in empowering a Minister of the Crown to declare the existence of a serious industrial disturbance. We have listened to heated protests against the principle of deportation, but deportation is only expulsion, and_ Labour unions expel members from their ranks almost daily. Deportation under this measure must be preceded by a conviction in the courts, and the deportee ""will not be prevented from earning a living in some other land. But men have been expelled from trade unions, and subsequently pursued with such vindictiveness that they could get no employment and were compelled to starve. The Leader of the Opposition quoted a letter which showed that some person or persons stooped to one of the lowest tricks that can be imagined. Apparently, that letter had been forged in order to serve a political end. No honourable member on this side knows who forged the document, and I hope none on the other side knows; but when the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) defended the incident, I became very suspicious that he had some knowledge of it. Mr Scullin. >- That statement is an absolute fabrication, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",45

This measure is designed to carry out the direct mandate of the people. It s purpose is to put an end to the disturbances that have caused the cessation of transport on a number of occasions in recent years. Those troubles were engineered by persons who, although posing as ' the custodians of the rights of labour, are in reality the greatest enemies of labour and all other interests in this country. strikes have been aimed at transport, and have occurred at such seasons and in such circumstances as to prevent the marketing of primary products, and cause untold loss to the producers. The one thing that tbese. organizers, or disorganizes, do is to rob the people whom they are supposed to help of the greatest g if t on God's earth-^-contentment. Adam was perfectly satisfied u n t i l the first agitator in the for m of a serpent preached discontent to Eve. It s interference was fol lowed by the deportation of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden: Right through the ages civilization bas gradually but steadily advanced, but not u n t i l the beginning of the Christian era, when the divine teachings of Christ began to be practised, did the lot of the worker substantially improve. The up lift i ng of the masses continued through the centuries; the signing of Magna Charta was the commencement of a new epoch. Another outstanding event in industrial evolution was Great Britain's stand for the abolition of slavery. ""Within the last 50 years the position of the worker bas continuously improved, and always the driving force has been the influence of Christianity. That, and that only, is the foundation of liberty. Long before there was a Labour party as we know it today, men imbued with the best of motivesChristian men-worke d for the emancipation of the worker. I state most emphatically that the root cause of the industrial unrest of more recent years has been the intrusion into the ranks of Labour of communists, who are anti-Christian. In contradistinction to Christianity, theirs is a creed of selfishness; it is vicious and uncharitable. Because of the communists, men like the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) have left the Labour party and joined that with which I have the honour to be associated. In the toils of the communists the Labour party is struggling and is almost strangled. Because"" I believe in this great country, the land of my birth , I intend to support the bill . It should have no terrors for the honest trade union leader. It is not an attack, fronta l or covert, upon the true ideals of trade unionism, in earnest support of which I yield place to no man. This legislation is The aimed at the men who in season and out of season are striving to tear down the whole of our social fabric that is built upon the teachings of the Bible, and substitute ungodly and inhuman terrorism. I say unhesitatingly that Labour is in the hands of the communists. The Leader of the Opposition practically admits that when at last he joins hands with us in endeavouring to cast out communism.",46
129,Unknown,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Sitting suspended from 6.89 to 8 p.m.  if a number of honourable members of the Opposition are sincere in their condemnation of communism. In this connection, let me quote from the Workers' Weekly, the official organ of the Australian Communist partyIt may occur during the progress of the fight that members of the Labour party, even the Labour party itself, may decry the Communist party. Let this not deter the communist members from doing their duty in this fight, which will be acclaimed all over the world ns a class fight. Mr Garden, speaking at a conference in the early part of last year, saidThe shadow of communism is over the Labour movement, and all efforts to banish communism and communists are bound to fail. The good old times of playing at politics are gone; revolution has stepped on the stage. Others contend that there is no such thing as communism, or, if there is, that the communists have no influence in the community. Mr Gillies, the ex-Premier of Queensland, speaking subsequent to the Queensland railway strike, saidThere are certain influences at work in the community. . . . These people have prepared communistic literature during the strike. Among other things, they said, "" Why bother about arbitration when you can fold your arms, and paralyze industry? And, again, on every burning question that affects the working class you will find that the nuclei leaders are first in the field to give direction to the working class how to meet the situation. I admit that tliese revolutionaries can destroy what has taken the Labour movement'25 to 30 years to build up.' I do not wish to see destroyed that which the Labour party has taken so long to build up, and for that reason I shall support any effort to r i d this country of communists. Mr Washington Mather, the secretary of the Albany branch of the Waterside Workers Union, and the representative for Western Australia on the federal executive of the federation for the last five years, saidThis big federation of labour was standing still like ships at anchor, while the wasps of communism were working round and getting control of the Labour movement by electing their representatives on the councils of Labour. It was time the Labour party woke up to the fact, and came out and fought the people who were trying to smash the planks Of its platform. W r it in g to a union official while at the strike conference, Mr Mather said I hear there are those who reckon Tom Walsh is a heaven-sent saviourof the worker. It is a pity some of them did not follow the occupation of wharf labourer. We have 3,000 of our men idle in Sydney, because heaven sent to earth a man named Walsh, and the committee is receiving daily requests from employers and employees to help bring a useless Btrike to an end. Some of the British seamen have lost two years' pay because of this man. who is simply using these poor devils as means to further his own ends, and he does not. give a damn about them and their wives and families. That all goes to show that persons outside this Parliament who are prominently connected with the Labour party are prepared to admit that communism is whiteanting the party and the trade The honourable member for Yarra Scullin) referred to the wages paid to British seamen. I agree with him that if those wages were paid in Australia the men could not live. I have, sufficient confidence in the leaders of the Labour movement in England, and sufficient respect for the good sense of British seamen generally, to believe that are able to manage their own affairs without any interference from Mr Walsh and others in Australia who induced some of them to strike, with such disastrous results to themselves. In all his campaign speeches regarding the Federal objective, drawn up before the la3t election, the Leader of the Opposition was as silent as the grave. Nevertheless, he and all his supporters were bound hand and foot, body and soul, by that That objective includes the socialization  of industry, production, distribution, and exchange. Socialization is communism. The socialization of production is production for use and not for profit. It was tried in Russia. The Russian peasant, knowing as little about the socialization of production as does the average preacher of the doctrine, went about his farming in the usual way. He produced as much as he possibly could, and worked more than. 44 hours a week. When his crop was harvested the communist officers arrived. They allotted a certain portionof the crop for the farmer's use, and took the rest.. The Russian farmer thought he had found an improved marketing scheme under government control, but when he inquired the price he was to receive for his produce, he was informed that he would get nothing, because he was producing for use and not for profit. The Russian peasant is supposed to be simple, but he was not simple enough for that. The next year he produced for use and not for profit, and grew sufficient for his own use only. The consequence was that men, women, and children died of starvation, and Russia, one of the greatest granaries of the world, had to f all back upon the charity of the noncommunistic world to save her from the results of communism.",47

131,Mr MAKIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Hindmarsh) [ S . l l ] The honourable member for Angas in the last Parliament (Mr Gabb), was sometimes designated ""Moses from the bullrushes."" Of his illustrious namesake it can t r u l y be said that he became a great leader. The honourable member for  may be described as a political babe in the' woods. He is entirely lost in the uufamiliarity of his surroundings. The insipid and inane speech which be has just delivered proves that he has not yet learnt to appreciate his oportunities as a representative of the people. He has yet to learn that substantial argument, and not the irrational conclusions to which he bas given utterance this evening, is necessary in this chamber if his remarks are to have any weight. paid a poor compliment to the intelligence of honourable members when he in dulged in such a tirade of abuse and misrepresentation as he has just given us. He contended that the Labour party is being strangled by communism, that the root cause of Labour's setback is that an irresponsible and extreme section is governing the activities of the movement. He also challenged the objective of the Labour party, saying that it is not consistent with Australian ideals. In that connection, let me read the remarks of one for whom the honourable member, no. doubt, entertains a high regard. One of the leaders of the party to which the honourable member belongs made the following remarks:- ' I liavc never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to obtain its objects by violence. The platform of the Labour iparty-abou t which, by the way, we hear vcrv little at election time-make s i fectly plain that that party aims' at securing its objects by constitutional methods. There ciinnot be the slightest objection to that. We on this side of the House hold views that are different from those which are held by honourable members opposite, but we are all entitled to uphold our views by fair argument. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) at least was prepared' to recognize and [39] admit the Labour party's dissociation with the school of thought that advocates alleged foreign doctrine. The honourable member for Angas declares that our views are entirely foreign to Australian sentiment, but the Attorney General admits that we do not countenance the doctrine of violence and the adoption of unconstitutional methods. - It is clear that -' the argument of the honourable member for Angas was based upon false premises, and therefore, his criticism of the Labour movement was structurally unsound. His opinion, I am confident, is shared by very few citizens of Australia. I remind him also that his presence in this chamber is in the nature of a political accident. Before he has been many months in this Parliament he will find that his views are not endorsed by the majority of the people of his division, notwithstanding that he secured a majority at the ballot-box a few months ago, and I have no doubt that, when next an appeal is made to the people, his predecessor will appear again in this chamber as his successor in the represenHe tation of Angas. The honourable member was unfair in his references to-night to trade unionism. I remind him that trade unionism is represented in this Parliament by honourable members on this side of the House, and our presence here is an absolute, contradiction of his contention that irresponsible extremists have captured the Labour movement. Indeed, it may be said that the irresponsible and arrogant advocates of outrage and violence are sheltered and encouraged byand in concert with the profiteer, rent racker, and the general exploiter of society. This subject has been treated with a certain amount of flippancy. Honourable members opposite bave attempted to pour ridicule upon the suggestion' that, in recent times, at all events, certain extremists have been in - their pay. All I can say is that these enemies of Labour could not have worked more effectively as the t per- paid agents .of anti-Labour forces than they did during the last election. Whenever the forces of reaction were impoverished for an election cry in order, to rjlay upon the emotions and feelings of a credulous public, there were ever at hand individuals ready to assist them. One man in particular, who was ""starred'* by the Government as responsible for so muchdisorder, and who, by the way, was not hindered in any respect during the election, volunteered the information that a certain group photograph of communists which he had supplied to a conservative newspaper in Sydney, was a genuine, and not a faked, production. This photograph, I may add, was printed on an election poster, with the inquiry, "" Are you going to vote for this or for Bruce ? "" I understand that the man referred to actually furnished the photograph to the newspaper which assisted the forces of reaction against the Labour party.",49
132,Mr LACEY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,He admitted that he was paid for it .,50
133,Mr MAKIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"In South Australia there are persons of the same class. They do not wish to see the genuine leaders of the Labour movement in the position of responsibility. They know perfecly well that were Labour in power they would get scant sympathy from the Government of the day. They believe that with th« advent of a government unsympathetic with the cause of the workers, there will be placed on the statute-book repressive measures that are likely to cause resentment aud lead to industrial strife. Tbey live in the hope that if disaffection can be caused among the workers, they will be driven to a state of desperation. They are well aware that a Labour Government, being sympathetic with the aspirations of the people, will endeavour to provide better working conditions, and by improving the environment of the people generally, remove any cause for revolt. Recent events have disclosed that the Government-is the friend of these and other reactionaries, such as Fascisti, who thrive on chaos and disorder. The policy pursued by this Government is calculated to contribute to this end. It is a matter for regret that during the recent election a fictitious issue was placed before the people, and that well reasoned argument proved of no avail. The Government, to save its face, bas brought down this bill. Recently I received a pamphlet entitled "" The Communist Danger."" Its author is Mr T. .R. Ashworth, past-president of the Employers Federation. The articles contained in the pamphlet appeared in the Melbourne Age shortly after the Government had decided to seek a mandate from the people. Mr Ashworth, wbo champions the Nationalist cause, stated in the pamphlet that the issue of the election was freedom versus authority-that Labour certainly stood for freedom, and the Nationalist party for authority. I agree that this bill indicates a display of authority rather than a desire to give expression to the will of the people. Strong opposition must be expected to provisions which seek to associate the legitimate efforts of organized labour with a criminal code. Part II . shows that the Government prefers repressive measures to attempts to improve the economic and industrial conditions of the workers, and seeks to provide further privileges for the wealthy section that it represents. Such a measure merits emphatic condemnation. If the Government had been sincere in its avowed desire to protect and maintain the great principles for which trade unionism stands, it would have been prepared to accept the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition; but it is not even ready to adopt an attitude of reasonableness. It does not recognize the rights of trade unionists to strive for improved industrial conditions and a greater share than they now enjoy of the wealth that they help to produce. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) stated this afternoon that the Government had no intention to intrude upon the domain of trade unionism, and that it was regrettable that the proposed amendments of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act could not be considered simultaneously with this measure. If the Government recognizes the desirability of bringing down those amendments at the present juncture, what is the urgency for this bill ? Does a state of industrial unrest that demands immediate attention exist in Australia today? The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) bas declared that for the last five years the Government has been aware of the presence of disruptive forces in our midst. It cannot, therefore, be said that this is urgent legislation. If Ministers desired to 'be fair to the workers, they would have brought down a bill to amend the Arbitration Act contemporaneously with the introduction of this bill. The far-reaching nature of the provisions of Part II . of the bill suggests a sinister motive on the part of the Ministry, in rushing this legislation throuerh immediately after the hysteria of the recent elections - Recognizing, as it does, the restricted powers and functions of the Arbitration Court in dealing with industrial matters generally, the Government must accept the view that Ihe amendment of the act is of paramount importance. Its plain duty is to seek authority from the people to give this Parliament full powers to deal with industrial matters. But that would not suit the purposes of the Government. It finds that with industrial unrest, it can play upon the feelings of the people and thus obtain a further tenure of office. From its point of view, that is the first consideration. This Ministry is unable to appreciate the industrial situation, because not one member of it has had a day's experience as an industrialist.",50

His standing in thb organization to which I belong was such that I would not regard him as a judge of that subject. Surely the evolution of industrialism demands that we shall meet the issues of the moment. Throughout the world there is a feeling of discontent in industry-a n aftermath of the recent war-and workmen bave failed to reap the reward that scientific discoveries and mechanical progress sbould have provided. Industrialists are regarded, not as beings with souls, but as mere machines. Tbey are looked upon as instruments for profit-making, and Httle consideration is shown for their welfare and the security of theirhomes. Therefore, they challenge the position that confronts tbem. Not until such time as the captains pf industry-wh o today, in many instances, have become insolent with wealth - recognize their responsibility to the community, will Australia be free from the disturbing circumstances that now exist in our community life. As a law-maker and a constitutionalist, I offer no objection to the Government providing safeguards against those who, by violence, would endeavour to overthrow constitutional authority, and adopt the tactics of the bully, but let the Government also remember that it is essentially its duty and obligation to secure to the great masses of the people a greater share than they now enjoy of the wealth, prosperity, and security that should be the portion of every citizen.",51
138,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Dalley) [""8.40] - My remarks in connection with this humbugging measure will be as brief as the occasion warrants. I have bad considerable parliamentary experience, and T regard this as the most humbugging bill ever placed before the House. During the war period, the ex-Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) introduced a bill declaring the Industrial Workers of the World to be an unlawful association. At least the right honourable gentleman bad the courage of his convictions, and was prepared to declare a specific organization to be an unlawful body. But we now have the spectacle of this Government telling the country that we are assailed by associations that seek to undermine constitutional government, whose object is to disrupt the peace, order, and good government of this country, and that the communists are the great menace. Wliy has not the Government shown the courage of its convictions and declared those persons to be members of an unlawful association? I challenge the Attorney-General to say whether the Government is prepared to take that step. It is time to end this humbug. On the hustings, the party opposite told the country that Messrs. Donald Grant and Jock Garden, and certain other persons, were "" out to dismember the Empire,"" to disrupt the Constitution, and to upset law and order. The Government obtained a mandate, so it said, to protect the community against the schemes of unlawful associations; but we have it from no less an authority than the Attoisney-General himself, that the Government does not intend-to declare unlawful the propagation of ideas, or to interfere in any way with freedom of speech. tlieir All it proposes to do is that if a persoa or an association decides to use force to undermine constitutional authority, it will declare that association unlawful, But the Communist Association will be allowed to preach its doctrine. According to the Attorney-General no action will be taken against the communists. W l i j should Parliament be asked to waste its time on such a humbugging measure as this ? ""Jock "" Garden is either a menace to the peace, order, and good government of this country, or he is not. If be is, it is the bounden duty of the Government to deal with him, just as it is the bounder, duty, of every Government, to deal with every man who is a menace to the peace, order, and good government of this country. MINISTERIALISTS - Hear , hear!",51
139,Mr MAHONIY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I am glad to hear supporters of the Government say "" Hear, hear!'' to that statement, and I therefore ask them whether they propose to take action against "" Jock"" Garden.",52
140,Mr MARR,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"'Certainly . Mr MAHONiY - The messenger to the Prime Minister says, "" Certainly."" I was not asking him, but I was asking the Attorney-General, as the bead of Ihe legal department of this country, what action he proposed to take against "" Jock"" Garden. Humbugging is of no use r.ow. No general election is in progress now, and there is therefore no conspiracy of silence by the press to prevent the views of members of the Labour party befng understood by the people. This"" is the Parliament of the country, and the Government supporters have to answer my question, or stand condemned as humbugs. This is the greatest humbugging Government I have ever known. ""We have heard a lot of talk ;bout traitors to Australia, and about people who are undermining the stability of this country. In my humble judgment, the greatest traitors, and those who do the mo3t, undermining, are those wbo broadcast over the world the statement that Australia is in the hands of revolutionaries who are destroying law, order, and constitutional government. Nothing could be more traitorous than such propaganda by a government. When thoso lying statements reach the money markets of the world, and are read by people to whom we have to apply for loan moneys, what will they think and do? The financial stability of this country is being seriously impaired by the statements qf members of the party opposite. The purpose of this bill is quite clear, and I challenge the Attorney-General to declare publicly that th© Government will suppress the Communist Association. The Government has no such idea, but will allow the communists to continue their preaching, so that the Nationalists, at the next election, will be able to gather together all the communist propaganda, and hurl it at the Labour party.",52
141,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Now we see the nigger in the wood pile!,52
142,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable member realizes that what I say is true. He was in the joke. We know how he won his seat. He did it by telling the people that if ; he and other supporters of the Government were returned, the communists would be given short shrift and deported. The Government has its mandate from the people. Has it the courage to put it into operation? The purpose of the bill is wrapped up in redcoloured paper-the red wrapper of Russia and communism. When that wrapper is torn off, we see that the object is to deal a deadly blow at trade unionism. If ever I was surprised it was when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) applauded the Government for attacking trade unionism, and compared the actions of trade unionists on strike with those of men engaged in a riot. I have a very lively and personal recollection of the right honourable gentleman not many years ago telling the wharf workers of Sydney when they were on strike how to deal with ""blacklegs."" He said: "" There is an easy way to deal with them. Let them go down the holds, and then drop a few bundles down, and it will be as hard to find a scab in the hold t of a ship as the cross of Christ in the bottom of hell."" That was said by the right honourable gentleman who now preaches to us ! It is about time we were done with this kind of humbug. The right honourable member, wbo condemns strikes today, made his reputation as a strike leader, and it ill becomes him, above any man, to cast reflections on trade unionists who stand staunchly and solidly for their principles. I am ashamed and astounded at his attack on trade unionists, and I am surprised that at his time of life he should think it incumbent on him to hurl stones at those who made it possible for him to enter public life. If it had not been for the trade unionists of. the' Sydney waterfront be would never have seen the inside of an Australian Parliament. The history of trade unionism, not only, in Australia, but also in other British communities, teems with illustrations of martyrdom and stories of men who sacrificed everything for principle. ' In Great Britain men were sent to j a i l , transported, and exiled from their wives and .families for helping to improve the conditions of their fellow workers. To-day we are throwing back hundreds of years. Coercion to suppress trade unions has been tried time and time again, and as fast as it has been tried it has failed. It will f a day, just as it failed centuries ago. Trade unionism cannot be suppressed by tyranny or coercion. There was never a revolution that was not born of the poverty misery, and despair of the people. The way to remedy the present evils is not to indulge in coercive legislation, but to face the facts fairly , as sensible men and women, and ascertain what is the matter with the system of today. As a life-long trade unionist, I say that the present arbitration system, which was created about 25 years ago, has outgrown its usefulness. It may have been all right 25 years ago, but. the conditions then were different from those of today. We must now adopt a different outlook. The Government has the mandate, and I am required only to point in a humble way to the fault .",52
143,Mr RODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,What new principle arbitration does the honourable suggest 1,53
144,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I will state my views on that subject when the Government has the courage and time to submit its promised Arbitration Bill . The serious problem with which we are dealing is facing not only Australia, but the whole of the civilized world, and it is of no use attempting to cloud the issue by screaming something about a red menace fro m Russia. To-day Russia is gripped by the capitalistic system as firmly as she ever was. Shouting little catch-cries or conspiring with the press wil l not silence the voice of Labour.",53
145,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Does the member think it is possible to silence the voice of Labour! . Mr MAHONY - The Government did it very effectively during the election campaign by means of its paid press. As a rule, I am able to obtain a little publicity from the press, but even I failed to do so during this campaign, and I assure honourable members that it was not for the want of trying. While we are talking about the press, I should like to ask the Government how much it paid the proprietors of the Sydney Daily Telegraph to distribute freely the thousands of copies of its newspaper that were broadcast just prior to the election. That would be in teresting information. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr . Hughes), to whom I referred a few minutes ago, will not be a member of this Parliament for many more months. ' It is an open secret where he is going, and that Mr Archdale Parkhil l will be his successor here. I am greatly surprised that he should conclude his parliamentary career i l to- with the attack on trade unionism that he delivered in.this chamber last evening, and that he should assist the Government to place this obnoxious measure on our statute-book. We shall not cure our industrial ills u n t il we improve anv arbitration methods. One of the glaring faults of the system today is that unsuitable judges are appointed. W it h all due respect, and without making any personal reflections upon them, I say that in some cases they are quite untrained and unfitted' to discharge the work that devolves upon them. His Honour Sir John Quick, for instance",53

147,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,For the working man.,53
148,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I wish to refer to an of award made by Sir John Quick. member Mr LATHAM - I rise to order. I submi t that it is not competent for an honourable member to refer to the conduct or character of a person occupying a judicial position, except upon a substantive motion.",53
149,Mr MCGRATH,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Speakin g to the point of order, I wish to remind you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that some years ago the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) threatened to Rack Mr Justice Higgins, and he discussed the matter openly in this Parliament with out being ruled out of order. Mr Acting DEPUTYSPEAK ER (Mr W at k in s ) - I did not hear the honhonorable orable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) refer in disrespectful terms to an occupant of the Bench. He was just commencing his remarks on that subject. I take this opportunity, however, of asking, him to connect his remarks with the bill before the Chair.",53
150,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"F a r be it from me, sir, to make any personal reflections upon, anybody holding such a high and honourable position as that of a judge; but I think I have the right, as I hope every other honourable member has, to make a reference to a judgment. I wish to call the attention of honourable members to a judgment delivered by Sir John Quick. May I say, in passing, that in my opinion, the judgments of that gentleman have been the cause of more industrial unrest tban any other single thing that I could name!",53
151,Mr HUGHES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,That is a silly statement to make.,54
152,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Naturall y the right honourable member for North Sydney would think it a silly statement, for he was responsible for the appointment of Sir John Quick as a Deputy President of the court. There were some reasons for that appointment which I shall take the opportunity of alluding to on some other occasion. The reference would be out of order just now. The judgment to which I draw attention has been responsible for Mort's Dock, Sydney, locking out 1,500 men, although the dispute really concerns only 20 men. It arose in this way. A certain number of men are casually employed by the company as painters and deckel's - Their duty is to clean and paint the bottoms of ships' while these are in dock. His Honour Sir John Quick, in an award covering their employment, provided that they were to be classed as permanent and not casual employees. It was pointed out to His Honour in court that if he made an award in those terms trouble was certain to occur; but he did so. Mort's Dock ""Limited naturally classed theso men as permanent and not temporary, and so was entitled to pay them less than casual rates. The men protested, but the management pointed out that it was acting in accordance with the terms of the award. Thereupon, the men ceased work. Subsquently the firm locked out from its employment 1,500 men. The remedy for that kind of thing is not to declare the strikers criminals, and imprison them for one or two years, with the option of deporting them at the end of that term if they happen to have been born out of Australia; it is to reconstruct our arbitration machinery so as to make such absurd award impossible. The only way to solve the industrial problem is to get into close grips with it . Employers and employees should meet round the table and talk matters over sensibly as man to man. If the Government does not improve our industrial arbitration methods and >ersists in placing on the statute-book ! egislotion of this description, it will be necessary to build many more gaols than we have. The number of criminals that may be made by reason of the provisions of this measure would more than fill all our jails. Australia is not in a state of industrial unrest, though one might think so from newspaper reports. We have, as a matter of fact, less industrial trouble than any other country in the world. America and Great Britain are seriously involved in it. But they do not advertise the fact to the world. They do not shriek from the house-tops that they are on the verge of a revolution, and so undermine their financial stability. Just recently Great Britain bas been through one of the most serious industrial upheavals in her history, but her statesmen did not broadcast the fact, nor were they afraid that the country would pass into the hands of the revolutionaries, or that Lenin and his ""red army"" would sweep down on London and take the city by storm. They faced the problem properly and solved it. It is of no more use for honourable members opposite to prate about revolution than it is for the editors of city newspapers to sit in their dingy offices and squirt their dirty ink over the trade unionists of this country. That may win a temporary victory for the Government, but it will do nothing to solve the problem. Seeing that the city newspaper editors are so interested in the industrial problem, may I suggest that the Primo Minister should call them to a conference, and ask them to submit to him their proposals for its solution. If we really desire to ensure permanent industrial peace we must treat the matter as serious minded men and women would do. The Government would be well advised to shelve this measure for the time being, and introduce its amendments to the Arbitration Act. We sbould then be able to see what practical proposals it has for improving, the machinery of the court. Coercive measures of this character, designed to suppress trade unionism, will not satisfactorily solve the social problem. I urge the Government to give some sane and calm consideration to devising constructive legislative proposals to assure the welfare ancl advancement of Australia.",54
153,Mr HUGHES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) stated during the course of his speech that I , on one occasion, advised the wharf labourers of Sydney to drop bundles upon non-unionists.",54
154,Mr MAHONY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The right honourable gentleman cannot deny that he gave that advice.,54

156,Mr SPEAKER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT," The right honourable member for North Sydney has corrected a statement which, he says, was made by the honourable member for Dalley; but he has not drawn attention io any words that he regards as offensive to himself, or that are unparliamentary.",55
157,Mr HUGHES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I take very strong exception to the statement of the honourable member for Dalley that I advised the wharf labourers of Sydney to drop bundles upon non-unionists.,55

161,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Wakefield) [9.17] - The matter with which this bill deals is one of the most serious that has ever occupied the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament. I was hopeful that honourable members would have had the opportunity to consider the measure in conjunction with the proposed amendment of the Arbitration Act . I quite appreciate the position in which the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) found himself. He has laboured indefatigably to frame these provisions, and I have no doubt that the demands which will be made upon him by the other measure will be even more exacting. This is merely a preliminary step in the direction of tightening up our industrial legislation. The speeches and actions of honourable members opposite have absolutely assured the passage of the.bill. It is of supreme importance not only to industrial workers, but also fco every citizen in Australia, and it will vitally effect the development of this country. I , therefore, expected honourable members opposite to assist to pass it , and thus place their party in a position from which they could face the future with confidence. Although they oppose it they have not advanced one reason in justification of the withholding of the unanimous support of the Labour party. At the recent elections the industrial conditions existing in Australia overshadowed every other consideration. The question was seriously weighed by the large body of unionists who have raised unionism to the position that it occupies in Australia today. Honourable members know how profoundly it moved the solid body of Labour from one end of Australia to the other. Before the introduction of this measure suggestions were made regarding the attitude that honourable members of the Opposition intended to adopt when it was brought forward. It was stated that they would champion the cause of persons who had proved a curse to Australia. Y e t since the inception of the debate not one word of apology has been offered for those men. If the Government had not taken prompt action to deal with this dangerous element it would be false to the promise that it made on the hustings. I want to state a few home truths for the benefit of my friends opposite. I like them; and if they would be guided by the dictates of their consciences they would be liked by everybody. They are not allowed to do that; they are merely machines that respond mechanically to the instructions they receive from outside.",55
162,Mr COLEMAN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Fro m Moscow?,55
163,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"It is not necessary to go so far afield as Moscow to receive bad instructions; they are issued from a spot not a great deal beyond the eaves of this building. I want to know whether my honourable friends intend to embrace the magnificent opportunity that now presents itself to bring about their political salvation. Before I embarked upon my campaign I had many casual talks with good, sound Labour men-the right type of Labour men. I have every sympathy with Labour, but I have no time for rebels.",55
164,Mr WATKINS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I suppose the honourable member knows that "" sympathy without relief is like - mustard without beef."" - Mr Foster - I thank the honourable member for his inspiration. I propose to give them relief, in spite of those who claim to be their representatives in this House. Numbers of genuine Labour men said to me: "" We are down and out; if you fellows do not save us. We cannot save ourselves. You are the only people who can save Labour."" Tbat was fully proved during the election, as honourable members opposite know.",55
165,Mr MAKIN,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,What nonsense!,56
166,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Why were honourable members opposite so mealy-mouthed concerning the men who were wrecking this country and ruining its interests, and at the same time doing a greater injury to the great Labour party than to any other section of the community? The bonor ton), along with other honourable members opposite, was notably prudent in his statements. The honourable member is always fairly so. His method of speech is mystifying. He has a. mysterious way of making a partial statement and coming back later to introduce the completion of it, where it does not fit, thus destroying the proper sequence of his remarks. The honourable member is a champion at that kind of address, and on that account is probably more dangerous than is the blatant fellow who says straight out what be thinks. Judging by the honourable member's smiles, he takes what I have said concerning bim as a compliment. I have no doubt that be will continue to speak in the same fashion to the end. All the talk we have had about the provisions of this bill being a direct blow at unionism and decent unionists is utter, abominable rubbish. It is hypocritical rubbish, as honourable members opposite know. The Prime Minister today delivered a very fine speech, witli a sincerity that is' characteristic of him. He uttered words of wisdom, and displayed a burningdesire to protect honourable members opposite from the error of their ways, and to save the people whom they were sent here to represent, but whom they will not represent if they do not vote for this bill. No man who took an interest in the last federal election and went from one end of the country to the other will refuse to admit that the electors never before expressed such an overwhelming desire for the return to power of the party on this side.",56
167,Mr WATKINS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Tb e £60,000 the party collected in Melbourne had something to do with its return.",56
168,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"It had'no more to do with it than the last little spider that bit the honourable member when he was sleeping. There never was a time in the history of this Parliament when the people of Australia were waiting so anxiously for a word from honourable members opposite on this question. What has so far been said in this debate from the other side to satisfy those souls that are in anguish lest the temple of Labour, built up by their struggles over a quarter of a century, be destroyed because men charged with its safety may prove unfaithful and permit a condition of things to continue in this country which may mean the loss for a score of years to come of the magnificent work done by earnest patriotic supporters of Labour? I sincerely appeal to my honourable friends opposite. Mr A. GEEEN - The honourable member should not be a humbug. He knows that this measure is intended to crush trade unions.",56
169,Mr SPEAKER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Order !,56
170,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I know a humbug when I see one. I know that the people of Kalgoorlie will learn what is taking place here, and so will the people, generally, of Western Australia. They will recognize that what honourable members opposite have to say will not help them very much. I am speaking to my honourable friends opposite, not in anger, but in sorrow, and with a desire to put them on the right track. It is unnecessary that - I should repeat what was said today by the Prime Minister. I made similar statements to the electors every night for six weeks, and I never met people more receptive or more terribly in earnest. Those people expect that the Prime Minister will fulfil every promise he made. If he does not do so, I for one shall turn against him without hesitation. I know, however, that he will do so. I shall have ten times as much to say on the bill which is to follow this measure, and when its pi ovisions are known it will be seen that this bill is much more necessary than honourable members opposite realise.",56
171,Mr FENTON,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The bill referred to by the honourable member should have been considered before this bill.,56

173,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Adelaide) [9.40] - We can see now how the last election was won. It was won by hysterical utterances which bore no relation to facts. Several ideas concerning the bill have been mentioned, and one by the honourable member for Angus (Mr. Parsons), to which a reference might very well be made. On the subject of deportation and expulsion, be told us that Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden for becoming communists. When that kind of metaphor is used, and is followed by the wild raving utterances of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Poster), it is bard to say how this debate will finish.",56
174,Mr EODGERS,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The honourable member for Wakefield presented the honourable member with a nice little bouquet.,57
175,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"He said of me only what he must say if he be the truthful man be would have us believe be is. I shall not say much about the labour which the honourable member claims to bave performed, but some day, when his biography is written, we shall find that he was never on the bread-line, and his hours of labour were not fixed by an Arbitration Court award.",57
176,Mr FOSTER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,I had not that advantage.,57
177,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"The honourable member had greater advantages, and when the history of his life is written it will be seen - that there was more luck than good judgment or hard graft in it. The honourable member made a most passionate appeal, and I want to suggest that that was the way in which honourable members opposite won the last election. I do not oppose the provisions of the bill which the Government secured a mandate to put into effect against unlawful associations and those elements in our midst which it was stated were menacing the welfare of the community. During the elections, consideration of strikes and their effect upon the development of the country went by the board.",57
178,Mr GREGORY,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,No .,57
179,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Ver y little was said on the subject when the community was being stampeded during the elections. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) knows what exerted the greatest influence during the elections. He knows that postcards were sent to every elector, exhibiting two flags, one the Australian flag and the other a red flag, with the question, "" Wliich do you stand for ?"" He knows also of the publication of a photograph in which Jock Garden appears, and which it is alleged was faked. I saw it for the first time today. It is a photograph of the executive of the Third International, with Garden crushed in at one corner and at an angle that does not fit the rest of the picture. Tbat is the kind of thing which the party on the other side used to stampede the people.",57
180,Mr BRUCE,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Mr Garden has said that it is a perfectly genuine photograph, and that be is proud of it.",57
181,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I would not believe Garden if he lay on his stomach in this chamber and swore that be was white. I should expect, if he were washed, to find that he was of quite a different colour. If the Prime Minister is prepared to rely on the word of Jock Garden, he can do so. I would not do so, and if the right honourable gentleman wishes to know something of Garden I advise him to look up the answer to a question that wa3 asked in the Senate concerning a man who was employed by the Defence Department, and the way in - which he was hoisted out of it . He might ask why he wasallowed to travel the country and scab upon Nationalist organizers. Men of his type were the best organizers the Ministerial party had. Mi*. COOK - Is not Mr Garden secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, in Sydney?",57
182,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Yes ; but, because ho acts in that capacity, it does not give him any authority todominate the political policy of the Labour party. His attainments may fit him for the position of secretary, and he may carry out his duties admirably; but I am not prepared to march behind him as a leader along the road to that social salvation for which we are all looking. I have no objection to that part of the bill which deals with unlawful associations, and makes provision for the deportation of certain people, because any man who adopts an attitude that is likely to bring bim within the purview of this measure, or any man who does not like the social conditions under which the people of this country live, and advocates such methods of reform, ought to get out of it. Although the Government was returned to power qn the issue of communism, it is not entitled to fasten communism on the Labour party. One of the methods employed during the election was the circulation of the post-card of which honourable members opposite are so proud. .1 trust that the select committee which the Government has foreshadowed will inquire into the working of the"" Electoral Act, will also ascerbecause its opponents tain who paid for these post-cards, and them sent them all over the country. formation might throw a little light the methods which were adopted to stamvernment pede the peopio into voting against the Labour .party. Then, a cartoon showed a big snake painted yellow, green, and white. I do not know why those colours were selected, or that there are snakes coloured yellow, green, and white; this particular snake had a great foot crushing it. The cartoon was an effort depict the voter crushing out of Australia. Again, there was the picture of Mr Walsh jumping the Union Jack and waving the red flag. On this cartoon the question wns asked, ""Do the electors stand for this?"" I can say that the Australian Labour does not stand for that sort of thing. may be Mr Walsh's attitude, and if so, it is only fair that he sbould be dealt with; but it is not the attitude of the Australian Labour party. Another toon showed a brush splashing red paint across a white Australia. most humorous cartoon, the issued; but it had the desired result, cause, like other cartoons, it drew the by the attention of the electors thing which did not gained votes for ""the party. The cartoon itself original. I had seen it twelve previously in Smith's Weekly; but then many the brush was a tar brush in the bands of the then Premier of South Sir Henry Barwell, and was splashing black over a white Australia. never been the desire of the Labour party to draw a red brush across the face of Australia. When the for a white Australia was in progress, there were certain people who said that coloured labour was not allowed on the sugar-cane fields, the northern part of Queensland would revert to virgin They claimed that sugar could not bo grown by white labour; but we know toloss day that it is grown by white labour, that the trouble Queensland now has. is to dispose of its surplus output. Liberals did not win the recent election on the issue of trade unionism, the question of strikes. Labour was defeated because it did not itself from communism, it did not put Australia Mr Yates. bad behind more money and a louder The inpress than we bad at our command. on Labour was overwhelmed, 'and the Gowas given its mandate, in consequence of which it has introduced this bill. I want to see it put into force, be1 cause it will cause the Government's funeral. As the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has already said, but the responsibility will rest on the Government to name organizations or indito viduals, and to give reasons for seekcommunism ing to deport people. It is a task I am quite willing' to leave to Ministers. While I can support the first portion of on the measure which deals with unlawful associations, I regard the latter portion of the bill, which links trade unionists with criminals, as totally unfair to those party who have done so much in their organiIt zations for the community as a whole. Honourable members opposite are loud in their praise of trade unions, and of what they have done for . the country. No carone can say that they have not done much that is in the interests of the whole world; It was the but everything gained from capitalism Nationalists has been wrested from it , in the .early bedays by combination and strikes, and later establishment of arbitration to some- courts and wages boards. The first exist, and method often led to the tightening of the Ministerial belt, and the starving of dependants, but was not it brought some results, though not such as we thought would he gained. The months iatter method was not secured without fights. In South Australia the right to have a wages board.for any in Australia, dustry was so circumscribed that the consent of both Houses of Parliament had It has first to be obtained. However, it graduAustralian ally came to be recognized that workers were human beings, and not chattels. In fight the State of South Australia today our industrial legislation has made considerif able advances. We now have boiler in spectors, scaffolding inspectors, factory laws, and compensation for accidents. I forest. worked in factories in my youth where almost every week a child suffered the of a finger or half a hand through and contact with machinery, and the bosses cared notbiug. The loss devolved on the The parents. If the father was maimed not one penny worth of compensation was paid by the employers. Holidays or periods or on of recuperative rest were never dreamt not of. Those dreadful conditions of labour dissociate have, ceased because of the efforts of or because organized labour. The' honourable mem first; but ber for Wakefield (Mr Foster) spoke of his working days, and of the labour he has done, but can he show a record like that of organized labour? The fight is even harder today because the combinations of capital are so intricate, and if a man should go off the beaten track and talk out of his turn he is likely to be treated as a criminal and imprisoned. If be persists in the cause in which he believes, he is liable to be sent overseas if he was not born in Australia. If I chose to take up a line of action that would bring me within the provisions of this bill, I might be sent back to England, while my daughter and her three children would remain in Australia. That is the sort of legislation we have brought in by a Government that, states its belief in trade unions and its love for its fellow men. We are now asked to link working men with the criminals of the community. I take it that a crime is something done to injure deliberately and with malice aforethought some person or persons, or the general community. We know what comes with in the category of criminal action, but when we have a body of men banded together with the idea of selling their labour in the markets of the world, it is, as I have said before, totally u n f to regard them as criminals. They are merely following the example set to them by capitalism. Capitalists who can corner a market, and secure a monopoly, in crease the price of the commodities they have to sell, and if there is a shortage of labour, men are brought in from overseas at the expense of the. general community to keep down wages. The workers cannot successfully compete with the controllers of industry, and this legislation will deal with them immediately they attempt to do so. It will not be the rank and file of unionists, but their leaders, who will be haled before a court, and deported, if they come with in the purview of the act, and if they were not born in Australia. Honourable members of the Opposition are acknowledging the result of the appeal to the people when they ask that the industrial provisions so obnoxious to labour sbould be taken out of this bill, and dealt with, if necessary, in an amendment of the A r b i tration Act. Certain penalties could be provided for in that act, but they should not be too drastic or of the unfair character of those contained i u the bill before us. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) has pointed out that no matter what legislation we may pass, we shall never prevent strikes or lock-outs. Wbo can define a lock-out? In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred disputes can be so manipulated that the blame is thrown on the operatives. The contention raised by honourable members of the Opposition is not ouly based on our perusal of the measure, but is also supported by certain sections of the press of the Commonwealth. I shall quote fro m the leading article published on Wednesday, the 3rd February, in the Adelaide Register- a conservative journal. Under the heading of "" Enforcing a Mandate,"" the leading article, inter alia, saysBut an objectionable feature of the earlier law-the distinction drawn between Australian-born and British-born disturbers of the social or industrial peace-is perpetuated in the bill. An Australian native, no matter how gravely he may offend, cannot be expelled, though he may be imprisoned up to one or two years; a native of the British Isles, even if he has lived usually here for 25 years, may be both imprisoned and deported. The latter, for the purposes of the bill, is classed with Russians and other foreigners; his British citizenship avails him nothing, and the longest term of residence in the Commonwealth fails to put him on a par a i r with the pure merino Australian. It is not wise for the Commonwealth, as we have urged before, to discriminate in its legislation between Australian-born and Australians who have settled here from the Motherland; and the discrimination is no less injurious because it is applied under the trade-and commerce or other provisions of the Constitution, instead of under the immigration section. That is the voice, not of Labour, but of the tory element of South Australia. In that State Labour has only a weekly journal; but no Labour newspaper could have dealt more effectively than the Register did with the Government's wrongful discrimination between British born and Australian-born citizens. The leading article also deals with the in dustrial provisions of the bill , and bears out the argument used by the Leader of the Opposition when moving his amendment. It readsThe association of revolutionary and industrial .activities is open to objection, but the difficulty of the Government is plain. Certain strikes which have inflicted incalculable loss and suffering upon the community have been of a frankly revolutionary character: they have not been genuine industrial disputes, but disturbances created for the purpose of making the "" capitalist"" conduct of industry impossible, and in the hope that they will lead to a revolutionary upheaval. Nevertheless, the Government is aiming at the acquisition of dangerously drastic powers. It seeks the right to imprison and deport persons engaged in "" a lockout or strike"" in the circumstances indicated. Imagine the position reversed, and a Labour Government in power proclaiming the existence of "" a serious industrial disturbance,"" and seeking the imprisonment and deportation of ship-owners who - may have been driven to lay up their steamers by a. course of WalshJohnsonism. Doubtless the word ""lookout"" - a n elastic indefinable term-ha s been inserted in proof of the Ministry's impartiality, and witli little expectation that the power will ever be invoked. But it is not good policy to pass laws in the belief that they will be permitted to remain inoperative; nor, for that matter, is it easy to believe that the expulsion of one or two strife-promoters, for whose benefit much of the elaborate mechanism of the new Crimes Bill appears to have been devised, would automatically terminate the troubles which have lately convulsed the waterfront. We shall nob reach finality in the Crimes Bill , and it is a dangerous power to put in the hands of any government. If this bill becomes law the Register foresees the danger of a Labour Government followi ng any example set by this Government. I remind the Ministry of the truth of Abraham Lincoln's words, that you may fool some of the people all the time, and you may fool all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. If this legislation is on the statute-book when Labour returns to power, according to the Register, we may use it , and if honourable members opposite know why strikes are caused, and who are responsible for them, it will be just as easy for us to gain that information in regard to lockouts.",57
183,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,We are quite agreeable that that should be done.,60
184,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"If this bill is passed, and is given effect in the manner advocated by some irresponsible supporters of the Government, the Labour.party, when in power, will in turn be able to take action against any Australian capitalist, born overseas, who causes a lockout in this country. The Register points out how the Labour party could use that power, and how dangerous it would be in the hands of any government.",60
185,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,Does the member think that there is anything in that argument?,60
186,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I do not think that those in control of.the Register would be pleased to hear that their leading articles were silly. I believe that the leading articles of that newspaper did a lot to secure a mandate for the Government. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) suggested that the Prime M in ister should call together the editors of all newspapers, and should ask them for their solution of the difficulty. If the honourable member for Pawkner suggests that the leading articles of the Register are silly, it might be as well to preclude its editor from the suggested conference.",60
187,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,It is quite on uhe cards that the Labour party when returned to power will have to administer the Crimes Act . The honourable member does not suggest that a Labour Government might do anything unjust.,60
188,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"No , but the Register suggests that a Labour Government might misuse that power. It may happen that in time of stress our passions will override our sense of justice, and we may do 1 things under this legislation which would not otherwise be possible. It is dangerous to have in the house poison which is uot labelled.",60
189,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Surely any Labour t Government would do what is just, as we intend to do.",60
190,Mr YATES,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I hope that if this legislation is passed the honourable member's intention will be carried into effect, but we have reason to doubt it , because during the election the Government made use of greatly exaggerated statements. It grossly misrepresented the menace of communism, and the Labour party's connection with that movement. It knew full well that communism played a small part in the Labour organization. The methods used by the Government are not always clean, and I should like an assurance from the honourable member for Fawkner that this legislation, if passed, will not be put to an immoral use. I take uo exception to that portion of the bill which deals with unlawful associations, but I hope that it will not be used injudiciously aud unfairly . The necessity may arise for the Commonwealth Government to be clothed with that power. I shall support the amendment'moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that the Government will accept it . The honourable trade union movement of this country should be placed on a proper footing, and any infringement of the arbitration laws should be treated as a misdemeanour, and not as a crime. The bill also includes job control. Paragraph 3 of the proposed new section 30j contains this definition"" Strike"" includes the total or partial cessation of work by employees, acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or by other employees on employers, and the total or partial refusal of employees, acting in combination, to accept work, if the refusal is unreasonable, and also includes job control. What is job control, and who is to define it? The definition of "" strike "" does not say what power is vested in the Minister to deal with individuals who are found guilty of job control. Every action taken by a unionist, including even the filing of the complaint in the Arbitration Court, may be regarded as a form of job control. As pointed out by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), the 25 munition workers who ceased work because they objected to being employed as permanent instead of casual hands, according to the award of the Arbitration Court, could be said to be exercising a form of "" job control"" The definition of "" j o b control"" contained in the bill consists of only a few words, the meaning of which may be expanded or contracted just as those administering the measure desire. 1 have placed on record my opinion of the bill. I defy any one to say that I have been in any way associated with communists, or any other section of the community which desires to bring about the realization of their ideals by force or violence. I would not harm any one. I do not wisb to see even my worse enemy suffer in the slightest degree. I desire to defeat my political opponents by means, but I do not .wish them any bodiily harm. The wildest ideas of the communists do not extend further than I desire in the hope for the regeneration of the world; but I . do not wish to force my ideas down the throats of other people. I wish them, however, to understand the principles which I advocate. Those of us who are seeking improved conditions for the working classes in Australia will, of course, make mistakes, and we may have to alter our methods; but we do not wish to be stamped as criminals. Those who are fighting_ today for what they believe to be right will eventually win out; and if the present generation does not derive benefit, our children will value the privileges we bave won for them,",60
191,Mr LAMBERT,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"West Sydney) [i0.5] - I desire to define my attitude on this measure as clearly and as briefly as possible. I am opposed to the bill, lock, stock, and barrel, as I believe it has been framed with the sole intention of suppressing trade unionism, and the persecution of trade union officials throughout Australia. We have been informed by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) that some of its provisions are to enable action to be taken against unlawful associations. No sucb association is mentioned in the bill, and if trouble occurred - it would be difficult for the government of the day to prove that any organization was an unlawful association. If the bill is carried, it will be within the power of - the administration to declare any trade union an unlawful association.  nition of an "" .unlawful association "" in the bill.",61
192,Mr LAMBERT,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I know what the bill contains, and bave no hesitation in declaring that it has been framed with the sole intention of destroying working men's organizations. Under this mea. sure, men or women who, through their industrial organizations, agitate for better conditions, may be regarded as criminals. Tbat is an insult to the trade union movement. I consider that my character is as good as that of any honourable member of this House. I have been a trade union officer - for. fifteen years, and in that capacity bave conducted various strikes in the Commonwealth. If I were directed to control an fair industrial dispute in the pastoral, or any other industry in Australia. I would, under this bill, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. It has been stated, particularly during the election campaign, that the members of the Labour party were associated with the communists. Thousands of pounds were spent on misleading the electors, and the Government was returned to office under false pretences. It attained power through the expenditure of unlimited capital, and I suppose one would be safe in - saying that probably £1,000,000 was spent during the last election in defeating the Labour party. The press of Australia was at the disposal of the Government and its supporters, and numerous canvassers went from door to door in the various constituencies misrepresenting the Labour party by saying that we were the agents of Russia, and were supporters of communistic principles. The electors were misled for the time being; but when an appeal is next made to the people, the Labour party will be organized in sucb a way that no sucb misrepresentation will be possible. The Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) did not receive a mandate from the people to legislate in the manner oroposed in the bill. I regard the measure as unconstitutional, as the Commonwealth has not the power to legislate in regard to trade and commerce within a State, and cannot interfere with the conditions governing interstate trade and commerce except in regard to navigation. It certainly cannot interfere with the registration of a ' company. How then can it interfere with interstate trade and industry other than in pursuance of the powers conferred by the Navigation Act? We have beard a great deal of the seamen's strike and those who are said to have been responsible for it. The real responsibility for it rested with the Britisb owners, who reduced the wages of some seamen from £10 to £9 per month, and of others from £9 to £8. When the seamen upon arrival in Australia found that the reduction had been brought about without their knowledge, between 4,000 and 5,000 of tbem spontaneously refused to continue at their work. Johannsen and Walsh were officers' of the Australian Seamen's Union. Were they to condemn their British comrades for going on strike as a protest against the reduction of their slavish wages by ship-owners who, whenever possible, employed black labour? They would have been cowards and traitors to themselves and their class if they had refused to help the strikers. Their duty was to support the strike, and had I been in their place I would have done as they did. Indeed, I told the electors of West Sydney that I was supporting the seamen, and would assist tbem in every possible way to win their fight. The Labour party opposed the deportation legislation regardless of the individuals to whom it applied. We did not care whether the men menaced were Walsh and Johannsen, or Brown and Jones; no government should have power to deport Australian citizens. Under the Immigration Act of 1925 the Commonwealth Government has power to secretly drag a man away from his wife and family and send him to worse than death --exile. Tbis bill will continue that power. Once a man, be he a Russian, Frenchman, German, Dane, or Swede, Mr Lambert. bas resided five years in Australia and becomes naturalized, he sbould not be deported. The only exceptions to that rule are Asiatics. This bill contains very drastic proposals relating to trade unionism, strikes, and lockouts. If honourable members will read the industrial history of some of the great trade unions operating in Australia today, particularly the Australian Workers Union, they will find that not many years ago workers were shot down like dogs, imprisoned for fifteen to twenty years, or hunted like wild beasts, because they had dared to attempt to improve their conditions. This bill is a return to the dark ages, when men were persecuted, racked, and thrown into dungeons for standing up in. defence of their rights. Honourable members opposite seek to blame the workers for every industrial ship- dispute. In the coal-mining industry the miners have always been fighting for safe working conditions, proper testing apparatus, and decent wages. In the metalliferous mines men had to work in heat, foul air,- and dust so thick that when they came off shift only the whites of their eyes could be distinguished. In the Broken Hill cemetery 80,000 of the young men of Australia, victims of dust, leadpoisoning, and other diseases incidental to the mining industry, are buried. Yet the miners who fight to improve their conditions will be classed by this legislation as criminals, and disturbers of the peace. What of the Broken Hill mine-owners, who have drawn from the bowels of the earth dividends amounting to over £20,000,000 ? What of the coal mine-owners who have been enriched by the industry? Tbey must share with the workers who produce the wealth at the risk of their lives the responsibility for industrial upheavals. The Government should not act vindictively towards the workers; it should not legislate hastily or hysterically. This rotten, brutal, unfair, and almost criminal proposal is a product of hysteria. It is a foolish and meddlesome measure that is liable to create more disturbances and strikes than any other legislation ever submitted to this Parliament. The Government may endeavour to suppress unionism, but the more it is oppressed the more virile it will become. That has been the experience of many tyrannical governments, czars, and dictators throughout the ages. It - is impossible to stem the tide of human progress. As humanity progresses the masses get a better understanding of their rights. ""With the greater facilities for education that now exist, the people have a new outlook. It is as futile to attempt to annihilate this movement as to crush the world by dropping a feather on it. The Government cannot rob the workers of Australia of their intellect, or suppress their longing for progress. The passing of this bill will not close my mouth. I refuse to be robbed of my right of free speech. I shall not act the part of a coward when the rights of the workers are in jeopardy. If Providence places me in a position demanding action, I hope that I shall be worthy of the trust reposed in me. I should be prepared to go to jail in the interests of my fellow men. Tbat"" spirit characterizes every union leader, and every sincere trade unionist in Australia. Tf the Government attempts to deport those who defy it, 50,000 militant trade .unionists, who vvill not stand for this legislation, will have to be deported. And if persons not born in Australia, but who are now citizens of Australia, are to be deported, it will mean the deportation of 50,000 more. Most of the men who have come here from other countries are genuine workers. They have joined the Australian trade unions, and are prepared to fight for better conditions. The Government proposes to deport citizens of this country if they do not subscribe to its political creed, or dance to its tune; it matters not whether they have been citizens of this country for 50 years. If my father were now alive, he would be about 95 years of age, and under this measure he would be liable to deportation if he raised his voice against injustice to the working class.",61
193,Mr MAXWELL,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,The honourable member's father would have far too much sense to act unwisely.,63
194,Mr LAMBERT,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"My father was an agitator for the rights of the working class, and in that respect he was for many years my tutor. I hope that I shall never be afraid to follow in his footsteps. This bill, if passed, will not do a great deal of damage, because immediately the Government attempts to imprison or deport industrial workers, there will be a general dislocation of. industry. I hope that it will not pass. If one or two of my fellow workers were deported, _ I should do my best to disorganize the industry in which I was employed, and I sbould probably succeed. If deportation became general, chaos, disorganization, dislocation, and probably revolution, would follow. If the liberties of the workers are to be interfered with in the manner proposed in this bill, they would be justified in taking any steps to preserve the rights for which they have fought for centuries.",63
195,Mr GARDNER,WHARFAGE ACCOMMODATION AT,"Robertson) [10.37]. - After the able introductory speech of the Attorney-General, it is not necessary for me to say a great deal. The Attorney-General referred to the dangers of communism. Those dangers are as real in Australia as in any other country. The Prime Minister, in an explicit addiess this afternoon, explained the provisions of the proposed new sub-section 30j. Like the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), I found the recent campaign very strenuous. Everywhere I went I was struck with the seriousness with which all sections of the communityparticularly trade unionists-regarde d the issues at stake. Consequently, I feel it incumbent on me to draw attention to what I consider is one of the most sacred promises ever made by an Australian Prime Minister, namely, that . if this Government were returned, the right honourable gentleman would take all necessary steps to deal .with the unrest in Australia caused by ihe British seamen's strike, or similar disturbances. He stated that his Government would act in the interests of all sections of the community. I also made a promise to my constituents, and that is the main reason for my rising to-night. T promised tbem ' that if I were elected to this Parliament, I would, by my voice and vote, support the Prime Minister in any action which he deemed necessary in the interests of Australia. We have had in the debate on this measure a number of good speeches concerning trade unionism. I have no doubt that honourable members opposite were perfectly sincere in' all that they said. They have had considerably more experience in industrial matters than I , and, perhaps, many other honourable members on this side of the House, have had; but I suggest that the excellent dissertations on trade unionism to which we bave been treated have nothing whatever to do with the bill. I fail to see how any of the privileges at present enjoyed by trad») unionists are to be filched from them. I know of no provision in the measure that attacks the working hours or conditions of the wage earners. It is unfortunate that we have not had an opportunity to consider the proposed amendment of the Arbitration Act, which may be regarded as the complement to the bill now before the House, but I am satisfied that the right honourable the Prime Minister will fulfil the promise which he gave to the people, and that when the measure referred to is before us it will be on perfectly sound lines. The Government represents the majority in this Parliament. Our friends opposite have, on many occasions, referred to Parliament as the high court of the land. That was before they became enamoured of the High Court in consequence of its decision concerning the recent deportation proceedings. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) will agree that it would not be right to expect any judge of the High Court to make a pronouncement not in keeping with the judicial functions of that tribunal, such as taking the responsibility to issue this "" proclamation. As the Prime Minister said this afternoon, any government that did not consider the interests of the community generally would be quickly hurled from office, because Australia is a democratic country, and any laws passed must be ratified by the people. I presume that before any proclamation is issued under this measure the Government will be satisfied that the circumstances justify drastic action, to prevent the community from suffering as it suffered during the unfortunate seamen's strike. Honourable members opposite have said a good deal about the interests of the wage earners' and trade unionists. I remind them of another section of the people-the primary producers-who bave to be content with what their produce returns to them in the home or overseas markets. fortunately, the primary producers in the Gladstone district of north Queensland, in common with other parts of the Commonwealth, . suffered very severely during the recent shipping strike. Their produce was rotting on the wharfs, and consequently their wages, in the form of returns on its sale, were withheld from them. I feel sure that honourable members opposite are broad minded enough to admit that the primary producers of Australia should not be penalized in this manner. I subMr Gardner. mit, therefore, that this legislation is entirely justified, that it will work no injustice.to.trade unionism, and that it will be distinctly in the interests of the community generally. I have very much pleasure in supporting the bill, and I am glad to kuow that the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Government, of which I am a supporter, is keeping faith with the people of Australia.
