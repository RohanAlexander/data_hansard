Last week of resolutions. passed in this State were put before me, the effect of whioh was that Parliament . should sit longer. This House, however, sits longer than any other legislative body in the Empire, excepting the House of Comhas mons; and I am not quite clear that, ing the whole year through,' we do - not sit as long as the House of Commons.

Is the right honourable gentleman, in view of this suggestion, prepared to agree to charging for questions upon notice, or without notice, and so much per yard for speeches, in order to bring about that ciency, economy, and effective despatch of business which is so desired by the honourable member for Cowper?",19

13,Mr WIENHOLT,ASSISTANT TRADE,"On behalf of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), I wish to know from the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, in view of the danger of citrus canker being introduced into Australia, it is not advisable, for the present at any rate, to prohibit the importation of all citrus fruits?",20
14,Mr MASSYGREENE,ASSISTANT TRADE,"The matter has received careful consideration. No citrus tree, and no portion of a citrus tree, may be imported into this country until it has been subjected to a rigorous quarantine, and under no circumstances may a citrus tree; or portion of a tree, including fruit, be imported from countries in which canker is known to exist.

I also saw a paragraph in the newspapers on the same date requesting assistance for a benevolent institution. In those circumstances, will the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) furnish me, not for publication, but for my own information, with the names of any of the gentlemen who are'in such a fortunate position, in order that they may be approached with a request to make-a donation of any cast-off clothing, or other - articles, they do not require, since it would be very acceptable to the poor in my district ?",20

25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MILLIONAIRE SAN D,"On the 7th June, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) asked a question in regard to vessels of the Commonwealth Government Line, said to be held up owing to lack of cargo. I have had inquiries made in connection with the matter, and find that the Eurelia is not laid up for lack of cargo, but for the purpose of undergoing reconstruction of her store freezing chamber. vessels of the Line are, however, held up through inability to obtain payable cargo. While there is a general shortage of cargo, business is offering in various directions; but freights have fallen so. low as to make this business, which consists mainly of bulk cargoes from Australia to places from the majority of which there is no back loading, quite unattractive on the present running costs. As I stated a few days ago, our vessels are, so far as I can judge, as well off as most vessels engaged in the trade from Australia to the United Kingdom.",21

How did the twenty soldiers who were ordered to be taken from No. 16 A.G.H., Mont Park, on 27th April, to the Sunbury and Kew Lunatic Asylums, come under the authority of the Inspector-General of the Insane? 2. What is the nature of the agreement between the Repatriation Commission and the State Government or the Inspector-General of the Insane in regard to the removal and future maintenance of those soldiers, and at what cost? 3. What certificates under the Lunacy Act have been given in regard to the mental condition of those soldiers? By whom were they given, and when were those certificates signed?",22
37,Mr GROOM,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- , 1. The extent of the Commonwealth's constitutional power to deal with mental cases is doubtful, and it - was, therefore, in 1915, deemed advisable to utilize the machinery of the power Lunacy Departments of the several States, dismachines, tinguishing, civil from military cases. With a view to saving the ex-soldier from certain disabilities which were regarded as resulting from the application of the civil law, certain States passed special legislation. In those States which have passed this special legislation, certification under the Lunacy Act is not required, but should an ex-soldier be transferred to a State mental institution, certification is necessary. In that case, the patient passes under the jurisdiction of the State Lunacy Departments, of which the Inspector-General of the Insane is the chief executive officer. [365] 2. The honourable member has already been informed by answers to his question of the 7th instant of the circumstances under which, as a temporary arrangement, it was proposed to transfer twenty patients from No. 16 A.G.H. to Sunbury and Kew Asylums. The relatives of the patients were communicated with to this effect. The per diem cost was to be 25s. 3. The certificates as required by the State Lunacy Act were signed by Drs. H. M. James and P. J.

39,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I suppose the honourable 'member cannot see his way clear to wipe out the duties altogether?,23
40,Mr GREGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I would be very glad to do so. It would be the best thing for Australia if this machinery could be brought in free. I shall endeavour to prove that the natural protection accorded, in connection with the importation of these lines of machinery, should be more than ample to give a fair measure of protection to Australian manufacturers.",23
41,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It is a pity Australia cannot afford to give you another taste of what you really want.,23
42,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I respect the honourable member, but it is clear that his sympathies are not with the people in the back country. I cannot understand that he should fail to foresee the trouble which is brewing for city workers with the discouragement, if not the destruction, of primary industries. It has been suggested during the deliberations of the Committee that I am delaying progress and generally incurring unnecessary expense to the country. But I am.here to put the case for those engaged in primary production; and, although there may be very little result from my efforts in this Chamber, I trust and expect that it will be perceived elsewhere, and in the country. The people today are realizing that every action or decision of this Government tends, as a whole, to increase concentration in the great cities. Already the evil resulting from concentration is apparent in the large numbers of unemployed to be found today in several of the State capitals. In the course of discussing the rates of duties as set out in the schedule, and as proposed to be amended by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), no effort has been made to prove.that the various increases have become necessary for the welfare of Australian industries. There has been much talk about a proposed Board of Trade; but nothing has been said of the fact that a Board of Trade was appointed by the Government nearly two years ago. Has that Board tendered any report concerning any of the grave matters which have come before the Committee during the Tariff discussion? Has the Board offered any opinions or recommendations? So far as honourable members have been advised, it has neither prepared nor presented any report concerning the huge increases of Customs duties. Another significant fact is that, in all that has been said during the deliberations of this Committee, honourable members have not been informed that either the primary producer or the importer or the consumer has been consulted. It appears that only one section of the community has been approached, and that is the section represented by the Chamber of Manufactures. There have been speeches by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene), and other members of the Government, one after another. All are in accord in realizing the effects of the war. They have impressed upon the public two great essentials for the well-being of Australia-the one being increased population, and the other enhanced production. I agree that without the latter, certainly, we shall never be able to pay off Australia's tremendous war debt. ""Without a big increase of population, the burden of taxation per head must become unbearable. Considerable expenditure is now being devoted to immigration. Are the newcomers being conveyed here for the purpose of entering our factories; or are we going to ask them, and our own young Australians as they grow up, to go out on the land and take up the heavy responsibilities involved in primary production today, while at the same time adding the further handicap of huge imposts by way of Customs duties? If industries are to be built up here, why should not the whole community share fairly in carrying the burden? It is grossly un. fair that one section should be loaded with the whole. I can only express the hope that punishment will fall upon this Government similar to that which was meted out' to the Government who stood behind the MCKinley Tariff, in the United States of America; that is to say, that they will be promptly kicked out. Can it be shown by the Minister, or by any one else, that Australian manufactures are languishing? Can it be demonstrated that imports are alarmingly increasing, and that business is being taken away from our own manufacturers? can show by statistics that such is not the case. It cannot be seriously suggested that our manufacturers are becoming impoverished. In all that has been said for the latter, no word has been heard about the grave injury which is threatening the Australian consumer. As for the Australian worker, I yield to none in my admiration for him.' During the great struggle no man of any of the nations showed finer initiative, sounder judgment, or greater courage. Surely, then, those same characteristics should make the Australian worker, as a factory employee, second to none. ""What with the natural protection afforded to our manufacturers, together with the consideration which has been given them by the framers of past Tariffs, they should be able to stand "" on their own"" today. I shall show that the agricultural machinery industry has prospered in Australia under the moderate duties that have been imposed in the past. One of the reasons given in support of high protective duties is the alleged low rate of wages paid by manufacturers outside of Australia, and I intend to expose that fallacy. I can show from Canadian and Australian statistics that the employees in this industry in Canada today are paid at a far higher rate than are those in Australia. I can show also that when, in 1914, the Inter-State Commission was giving special consideration to the question of increased duties, there was no request made for increased duties by the big manufacturers of agricultural implements in Australia. I intend to show further that, relatively to production and population, New Zealand manufactures more agricultural machinery than does Australia, and that machinery is sold more cheaply in New Zealand than it is here.",23
43,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,In spite of the figures quoted by the Minister.,24
44,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Can the honourable member vouch for the accuracy of his figures ? [365]- 2,24
45,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I intend to take up some time in the consideration of this question, and, amongst other things, I intend to let honourable members know that the farmer in Canada can purchase agricultural machinery for about half the price that has to be paid for it in AusI tralia. The natural protection from Canada averages nearly 50 per cent., including freight, insurance, and exchange. With a duty of 45 per cent., and taking present exchange values with an allowance for freight and insurance as well, the Tariff protection from Canada works out at 62.59 per cent., or nearly 63 per cent. I have mentioned some of the questions I intend to raise on this item, and they should be fully answered before these onerous duties are placed on this class of machinery. In connection with this industry, I wish to make some comparisons between Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Honourable members will understand that I quote from reports andfrom statistics taken from the latest Tear-Books available. I have said that this industry has made progress in Australia under the low Tariff we had in existence up to 1911. In 1908, the number of persons employed in the industry here was 3,134, and the annual production amounted in value to £879,000. In 1911, the number employed in the industry had increased to 5,156, and the value of the annual production to £1,656,000, or an increase of nearly 100 per cent., in three years. Another satisfactory feature was that the value of production per employee increased in the same period from £281 in 1908 to £322 in 1911. Whilst the value of local production was nearly doubled in the period, importations did not increase in the same way. The percentage of imports to local production in this industry in 1908 was 30 per cent.; in 1909, 24 per cent.; in 1910, 27 per cent.; and in 1911, 27 per cent.; an average during those years of, roughly, 25 per cent. In the years following, there was a decline in local productioi. due to many causes, and amongst them the drought and the war. The average percentage of imports to local production in 1913 was 25 per cent.; in 1914, 26 per cent.; in 1915, 28 per cent.; in 1916, 19 per cent.; in 1917, 25 per cent.; and in 1918, 32 per cent. I should like honourable members to pay particular attention to these figures, because they show that, roughly, 25 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used in Australia has been imported, and 75 per cent, of it has been locally manufactured. The reason why I wish to make this quite clear is that every £ 1 imposed by way of duty means actually, £ 4 added to the price of the article to the consumer. Despite what the Minister has said, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the local manufacturer has kept his prices well up to what similar agricultural machinery can be sold for by the importer.",24
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Tb e honourable member holds that the total charge on the industry is four times 'the amount of duty lected at the Customs?,25
47,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I say that as three-fourths of the agricultural machinery used in Australia is made here, and as the local manufacturer keeps his prices as close as he can to the price of the ported machinery, every increase of £ 1 in the Tariff duty means an actual increase in the cost of £4 to the consumer.",25
48,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Grante d that the honourable member's argument is right, which I do not admit, then the total charge on the industry represents four times the amount of duty collected?",25
49,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It comes to pretty nearly that.,25
50,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable ber can make figures do anything.,25
51,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I want those who have to pay for this machinery to take a greater interest in the Tariff. I have He saysstated that in 1911 the local production of this machinery amounted in value to £1,656,000. There was a fall in pro1914, duction, and in 1918 it amounted in value to only £1,415,000.",25
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Notwithstandin g the incent., creased prices.",25
53,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Yes , but the war and the drought have to be considered",25
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"There was an increase in the price of steel and general used in the industry, and the honourable member's figures of £1,415,000 would rethis present proportionately that much less. If the increase in the price had been 30 taken per cent., therewould be a reduction of attributable one-third in the value of agricultural macountries chinery turned out.",25
55,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The figures show that the reduction amounted to about £240,000 in value. In my view, the chief reason for that was the war, and, secondly, reduced consumption. No one knows better than does the Minister that the .area put under cultivation was considerably reduced before 1918.",25
56,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,There would be fluctuations due to big harvests and small harvests.,25
57,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"We had some very small harvests prior to 1918, and no one knows better than does the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Poster) that the prices of both imported col- and local agricultural machinery were soaring up, and that machinery that had been Qirown on the scrap heap was recovered, repaired, and put into use again. I received a most important letter about four months ago from the president of im- the Stock-owners Association of New South Wales, in which he told me that people were attending sales, and paying fabulous prices for old machinery, which was subsequently repaired and made effective, because of the heavy cost of new machinery. It is clear, therefore, that, owing to the war and increased prices, a falling off in production was natural in the period to which I have referred. There was also a reduction in our exports of agricultural machinery from Australia. In this connection, I propose memto quote a statement made by Mr. Waknsley, who was a member of the Tariff Commission in 1906, and who deals with this phase of the question. simply The Commonwealth Year-Book, which is an official compilation of facts, vol. 7, page 482, says:-""The following table shows the progress of this industry to have been very satisfactory. During the four years the number of establishments increased 13* per the number of employees 51 per cent., and the value of plants and machinery 107 per cent."" That was during the operation of the 1908-11 Tariff. Volume X . of the' Yearmaterial Booh for 1917, page 494, says:The following table shows the progress of industry in the five years, 1910-15, to have been very satisfactory. A general decline has place during the latter part of the period, to various causes, the recent drought, and a reduction of exports to other being the principal contributing factors.",25
58,Mr RIOHAED FOSTEE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Our export 4rade was destroyed when we lost the Argentine trade.,26
59,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The big reduction in the local manufacture of agricultural implements is largely due to the loss of our export trade. I have here figures showingthat the export trade from Australia in 1913 was valued at £192,000,, - whereas in 1918-19 it had dropped to -£28,036.",26
60,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"¥ e had Argentine trade, and lost it .",26
61,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I think that the stripper harvester has gone somewhat out of fashion in the Argentine.,26
62,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member's statement has no bearing upon the position unless he can show how much ^agricultural machinery the Argentine 'imported from other countries.,26
63,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am merely attempting to assign one of the reasons for our decreased productions in Australia. ""Why we lost the export - trade, I cannot say.  s-able member will admit that it was owing to the Canadian Government subsidizing - the vessels trading to the Argentine.",26
64,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I do not know anything about that. I wish, however, to - deal with the statement made by the ""Minister in connection with the subsidizing of shipping services from Canada to Australia. The Honourable gentleman's ^statement may have been correct, but if be referred to agricultural machinery, it - was his duty, before making it, to consult the importers with the object of ascertaining their views unon the auestion. Evidently he did not do that. When we - consider the effects of the war, coupled with the loss of our export trade, we - see that there has been no falling-off - production, so far as the industry tralia is concerned. It has been carried on successfully under the low duties which were operating, particularly in 1908 and 1913, when the industry made - much greater strides than it has made at -.any later period.",26
65,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable mem""$>er cannot get away from the' Argentine so lightly as that.",26
66,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I would further point out that the wages paid in the industry in Australia do not compare with those paid in the industry in Canada. I invite my Labour friends opposite, who so strenuously support the imposition of high duties, to carefully examine figures which I am about to submit in this connection. The contention that the wages paid in Canada are much lower than those paid in Australia, and that, therefore, the imported article can be prothe duced much cheaper there than it can be manufactured locally, is absolutely false, and false to the knowledge of those who make it . The fact is indisputable that the wages paid in Australia are very much lower than are the wages paid in Canada. The particulars which I am about to quote are taken from the Commonwealth Year-Boole No. XII . for the year 1918, and the Census of Manufacturers for the Dominion of Canada for the same year. In Australia the salaried employees numbered 346, and the average salary paid to them was £170 2s. In Canada there were 1,129 salaried employees whose average salary was £292 10s. In Australia, for 2,.846 operatives, their wages averaged £129 18s. In Canada, the factory operatives numbered 8,966, and their average wage was £192 12s. It cannot, therefore, be argued that the imposition of higher duties is necessary because the wages paid in Australia are higher than those which are paid in Canada. As a matter of fact, the wage-earners of the industry in the Commonwealth receive upon an average 32$ per cent, less than do the employees of the industry in Canada, whilst, taking all hands into consideration, the wages paid in Australia are 34 per cent, less than those paid in Canada for the. whole year When we were dealing with the iron duties, I pointed out how coal has to be shall imported by Canada for industrial puri n poses, and how the manufacturers of that in Aus- Dominion have to compete with the manufacturers of the United States of America. They have to' face similar competition in regard to agricultural machinery.",26
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,What is the Canadian Tariff upon agricultural machinery?.,26
68,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Speaking from memory, I think that it is from 12-J to 15 per cent. The cost of living in Australia has been high, and wages here ought not to be below those ruling in Canada. I should like to see our workmen getting wages equal to, or even higher than, those paid in any other country. But when we come to look at the added value of this class of machinery, we see at once that there must be something wrong with our manufacturers or our workmen, since we ought to he able to do at least as well as Canada in manufacturing agricultural implements and machinery. The added value of Australian agricultural implements works out at £652,406, or equal to £196 per person employed, while in Canada the added value works out at £3,506,76(5, or £347 10s. per person employed. The value of plant and machinery, is scheduled at £355,830 in Australia, which is equal to £107 per employee, while in Canada, at the time covered by these statistics, it was £1,194,506, or £118 per employee. If we divide the gross value of production by the total number of persons employed, we shall arrive,, at the average value of the work done by each employee, and we shall find that in the case of Australia at this time it amounted to £424 6s. per head, while in Canada it was £690 10s. per head. These facts demand careful consideration.. If our manufacturers are not following up-to-date methods, if they are not making the best use of the protection which has been afforded them by putting down complete plants, so as to be able to turn out their manufactures at the lowest rates, is it fair that other sections of the community should be called upon to carry these imposts in order that they may be protected? I think I have shown clearly that Australian workmen in this industry do not receive anything like the pay received by Canadian workmen, and that the value of the output per employee in Canada is considerably more than it is in Australia.",26
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The figures referred to by the honourable member relate to the year 1918. Since then there has been an increase in wages here, and a reduction in wages in Canada.",27
70,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Thes e are the latest statistics available. The honourable gentleman knows that our statistics are nearly always two years old.,27
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I think the honourable member will find that wages rates in Australia today are higher than they are in Canada, because since the year mentioned by him wages here have increased, while in Canada they have been reduced..",27
72,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable gentleman knows that wages continued to increase in Canada, the TJnited States of America, and the Old Country for some considerable time after the war. All over the world today there is a demand for a' reduction of wages. Wages here did not go up to anything like the level reached in America during the war. Even in Great Britain the wages paid in the steel industry were considerably higher than in Australia.  orable member's figures are three years old.",27
73,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I have taken them from the Commonwealth Year-Book for 1918, and they are the latest available. I stated at the 'outset of my remarks that the Australian manufacturers of agricultural machinery made no request to the Inter-State Commission when ib was inquiring into the Tariff for increased duties. ,1I have here a report by* Mr Walmsley, in which it is stated thatIn March-October, 1914, the Inter-State Commission held an inquiry to hear requests regarding the 1908-11 Tariff on agricultural implements, but according to the report, which is dated August, 1916-nearl y two years laterno information of any practical use was obtained, inasmuch as no manufacturer of consequence in Australia submitted any requests or furnished evidence in Australia. A blacksmith, who was about to put on the market a potato digger, and a maker of pegtooth harrows in Tasmania, who submitted that his trade was on the increase, and was profitably carried on, wanted a higher duty in order to expand his business more rapidly. The Commission's inquiries covered the period from March to October, 1914. At that time we had manufacturers carrying on here under low Tariff duties. They were doing well, but the Inter-State Commission was requested to collect evidence from all parts of Australia in regard tc* the Tariff, and to make recommendations to this Parliament. They set apart the period from March to October, 1914, toan inquiry into the position of manufacturers of agricultural machinery, and we have it stated that no manufacturer of consequence submitted a request or furnished any evidence in support of higher duties.",27
74,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,As far back as we tried to get a duty of £16 per machine on stripper-harvesters.,28
75,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am speaking now, not of politicians, but of manufacturers. Sworn evidence, taken before a Committee, and showing why these increased duties are necessary, should have been submitted to us; but we have had no such evidence. It is a shame that such duties should be proposed. The Inter-State Commission reported thatThe most noticeable feature in connection with this industry is the fact that, except in regard to three comparatively unimportant branches, manufacturers have refrained from approaching the Commission, either in regard to unsatisfactory conditions which may exist in the manufacture of machines and implements in which they are at present engaged, or in respect to an extension of their operations to machines and implements which hitherto have not been commercially made here. It is a fair inference from this that at lhat time local manufacturers were satisfied with the 1908-11 Tariff.",28
76,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Is the honourable member aware that most Protectionists regard the Inter-State Commission, which made that report, as a Free Trade body?",28
77,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"No . Any Commission that is appointed to take evidence will report according to the evidence sub-, xnitted, and not according to its personal predilections. The honourable member, as a member of the Public ""Works Committee, has had to bring in reports according to the evidence submitted, although they were contrary to his own views.",28
78,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I do not doubt the sincerity of the Inter-State Commission, but I would not expect them to propose higher, duties.",28
79,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Her e is a quotation from a report of the Commission, which shows that the honourable member, unintentionally, no doubt, was unfair in mak\ing such a remark:Notwithstanding that no evidence was adduced, the Commission did make some recommendations, chiefly in the direction of raising - the general Tariff, in order to give a preference to implements, &c, of United Kingdom origin, which may partly account for the preference in the 1914 Tariff brought in twenty-one months before the Commission's report'was presented to Parliament. 1908 Mr MATHEWS:-That gentleman says the Commission recommended increases in the duties without being asked.",28
80,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The Commission did recommend increases of the duties, although no manufacturer suggested that any 'increase was necessary.",28
81,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,That is a most remarkable statement to make. I think your information is astray.,28
82,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am quoting a member of the Tariff Commission of 1906, and I take his statements as being absolutely correct, as I think they will be found to be. When the Minister (Mr. Greene) was speaking on the Tariff he saidThere are some subsidized freights in existence at the present moment. I can quote one instance which has come under my notice. I cannot give the particulars, because I have them in confidence, but I can give the figures. The ordinary freight at the present time is £10 per ton on a certain article; yet one firm is able to bring it to Australia at the rate of £1 per ton. I am assuming that the Minister was referring then to agricultural machinery from Canada and the TJnited States of America, and, if that be so, the honourable gentleman's reference was incorrect. The following is information supplied by importers of that machinery:-The steamer freight rate on agricultural machinery from the east cost of America-Mon treal, and St. Johns, Canada, and New York, TJnited States of America-for the year 1911-12 was 20s. per ton; for the year 1912-13 it was 22s. 6d. per ton; for the year 1913-14 it was 27s. 6d. per ton. In the early part of 1914 an effort was being made to establish a new shipping line in the American-Australian trade. Agents for some of the old lines offered the agricultural implement concerns and some other large shippers afive-yearscontract at an average rate for the whole period to the five principal Australian ports of 22s. 6d. per ton. The contract was accepted by both the International Harvester Company and Massey-Harris Company. That contract was effective from 1st June, 1914, to 31st May, 1919, and to the credit of the shipping companies, it can be said that they honoured their contract through that troublesome period, and gave the shippers their fair share of space in every ship they loaded for Australia, altliough many of their charters cost them from £8 to £10 and more per ton. Had they wished to do so, the machinery companies could have made enormous profits for themselves out of the contract by charging their Australian customers the prevailing rates; but they did not do so. Their retail prices throughout the whole period were based on the average rate of 22s. 6d. per ton, and the farmers qf Australia, instead of the importing implement companies, got the full benefit of this exceptionally favourable contract, which accounted for the moderate prices of imported machinery in Australia during the war period. At 1st June, 1919, the rate on agricultural machinery from America to Australia was increased to 67s. 6d. per ton, three times the average rate that prevailed during the war period, which has been, next to the increased Customs duties, a most important factor in fixing the present high prices for farm machinery. The Minister laid great stress on the small quantities of machinery being manufactured inPree Trade New Zealand, and I said that I would show that, so far as population and production are concerned, they produce more than is produced in Australia.",28
83,Mr RIOHAED POSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Yes ; but they are not a farming people.,29
84,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"But I say that reagricultural latively they produce more, and this makes the Minister's argument of .value. Where there is a small market, and implements have to be sent to four different receiving houses, the cost ministration is thereby increased, so the Minister's statements are of little value.",29
85,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The freight from the eastern American ports is greater to New Zealand than to Australia.,29
86,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable memtotal ber for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) told of agricultural implements sold i Canada at £61, and in Pree Trade New which equals H i d . per acre. Zealand at £97.",29
87,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I shall show the tralian cost in Canada, New Zealand, and here. The Minister, in reply to the honourable  The honourable member claimed that if we had Pree Trade in agricultural implements, farmers would lie in a position to buy in markets of the world just as they are called upon to sell in the markets of the world. Hesaid that that would be an advantage to them. But why did not the honourable member arguehis case from the point of view of the price of machinery in New Zealand? For the simpleand sufficient reason that agricultural machinery there, which is supplied almost entirely by overseas manufacturers-becaus e there is.practically no agricultural implement making: in the Dominion-is without exception dearer than it is in Australia. To say that practically there is no agricultural implement making in the Do minion is much the same as to say that there is no agricultural machinery madein Australia in comparison with theTJnited States of America.",29
88,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,How can machinerybe produced in New Zealand without & Tariff?,29
89,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It is being .produced.,29

91,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I have the latestGovernment statistics of both countries,, which show that the Minister's statement: is incorrect.",29
92,Sir ROBEET BEST,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Are you referring; to Mr Massey's statement?,29
93,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I shall refer to that later. There is no more important, statement than that of Mr Massey-that owing to the increasing cost of machinery many people are going out of the industry in the Dominion.",29
94,Sir ROBEET BEST,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Because the i m less porters' are exploiting them.,29
95,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honorableof admember did not hear my previous rethat marks, and, therefore he cannot follow^ the argument. To continue the information I have-The acreage under wheat, oats, and barley, the three principal cereal crops in both countries, was, for the year 1918-19, 9,013,166 in Australia. The wages paid to the employees in the us Australian agricultural implement facn tories in the same year was £428,522, Thefinished value of the product of the Ausagricultural machinery factoriesfor the same year was £1,415,375, equalling 3s. 2d. per acre. The New Zealand acreage for the same year for the samecrops was 399,469. Note the differencethe between the small area in New Zealand the and the large area here. The wages paid' to agricultural machinery employees for the year was £128,185, equalling 6s. 5d. per acre. The total value of the finished product of the New Zealand factories for the year was £380,044, equalling 19s. per ^acre. The population of Australia for 1919 was 5,247,019. The wages paid in -?the industry equalled Is. 8d. per head. The value of the finished product was 5s. 5d. ;per head. In New Zealand the population that year was 1,164,405. The wages jpaid per head of population was 2s. 3d. The value of the finished product per liead was 6s. 6d. In the case of New Zealand, the population test is scarcely a fair one, for the reason that the population :has been increasing there in about the same proportion as it has i u Australia, while the acreage under crop has been decreasing. The acreage under the above three crops in New Zealand for the year 1909-10 was 729,500. For 1919 it was ""599,469. In Australia the acreage. in -1909-10 was 8,157,568, in 1919, 9,013,166. That calculation shows the wages to be l l ^ d . per acre in Australia, as against <5s. 5d. per acre in New Zealand, while the - value of the production was 3s. 2d. per .acre in Australia, as against 19s. in. New .Zealand.",29
96,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Thos e figures. might .mean anything.,30
97,Mr GEEGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member can try to work them out from the Year-Book, as I have done. I think I <did so on a fair basis. I took the basis <o.f the three principal crops which are applicable to both countries-wheat , oats, and barley, and their production per'employee engaged.",30
98,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Has the honourable member worked the comparison out on wheat, oats, and' barley only, and compared the relativeproductivity of the two countries on the basis of those three crops?'",30
99,Mr GEEGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I took wheat, oats, and barley because they are the principal cereal crops. I did not include other crops that are not common to both countries. In the New Zealand Year-Book other products, which are different from - ours-, are given; but, taking it as' a whole; I think it will be found; that the way I haveworked: out the comparison is fair"" .and equitable. If ' It had included .Australian hay crop it would have made: :the-comparison very - unfair:.",30
100,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I hope the Minister replies to those statements. They are very striking.,30
101,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It is easy to reply to that part of it.,30
102,Mr GEEGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I find from the statistics that the manufacturer in Free Trade New Zealand pays his workmen a higher rate, because the percentage of the wages paid to the value of the finished product is 34 per cent, in New Zealand, as against 30 per cent, in Australia. - I wish to deal mow with the prices of farming machinery, and quote the differences in various countries. I had intended to deal with the Argentine, but all the evidence I have shows ""that the reaperthresher has not been a success there.",30
103,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,They were a long time finding that out.,30
104,Mr GEEGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"They were a good time finding it out, but that machine has never been properly on the market in the Argentine. It seemed hardly worthwhile to deal with that phase of the matter, but, perhaps, it will be just as well to do so, because I want to get these facts into Hansard, so that the people may know them. The Minister has been getting information from the Argentine, and has been, asked how and from whom he obtained it, but he has not told us. It would be just as well if he did tell us how he obtains his information about prices in that country. A considerable time ago there was a good deal of comment on the difference in the prices of agricultural machinery in the Argentine and here; but I wish to deal more exhaustively today with the question qf the prices in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. I will come back to the question of the Argentineprices later on if necessary, merely emphasizing the fact that the reaper-thresher 1 never could be considered to be properly- upon the market there. Several machines were sent there, but they were never an unqualified success, for. several' reasons, which I do not propose, to go. into, now. As to reaper-threshers now being, tried in the Argentine, they are enginedriven machines, quite different' in design 1 7 and construction from those which are the' being sold in Australia.. Up to the present' time none of these machines bave been sold in the Argentine. The International Harvester people are still engaged in developing the machine which they desire to put on the Argentine market. The Minister compared the prices of different machines in New Zealand and Australia, notably disc ploughs, spring tine harrows, grain drills, and fertilizer drills. ""Why those machines, which have scarcely any sale in New Zealand, were selected it is difficult to understand. I have the following information:In pre-war times prices in New Zealand were, on the average, lower 'than in Australia, although the cost of delivering them, as well as distributing expenses, was much higher. Freight rates from the east coast of America to New Zealand were then from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, higher than to Australia. On account of the broken nature of the country it has been found necessary to have distributing warehouses in the four leading cities, while only one for a much larger business is required in each of the Australian States. Distributing expenses in New Zealand average from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, higher than in Australia. In Australia farm machinery is sold on the basis of delivery on rails at tion nearest the manufacturer's or distributor's place of business; the farmer pays the outward railage. In New Zealand the practice is to prepay carriage to the farmer's nearest railway station or wharf, and the cost of it, estimated at 3 i per cent., is added to the retail price. Then the equipment of some machines in New Zealand is materially different from the same machine in Australia. For instance, in Australia, drills are fitted with steel road wheels, while in New Zealand wooden road wheels, which cost more, are used.",30
105,Mr STBWABT,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"If you ask for specifications for any implement with wooden wheels in Australia, it is always as an extra.",31
106,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Yes Australian manufacturers charge £3 extra for wooden wheels where supplied. Zealand a canvas cover to protect weather is supplied with eacli drill at a cost of about £2. No such covers are used in Australia. Owing to the difference in seasons Zealand price lists are usually issued about months later than in Australia, and some interested parties, when it suited their have been known to compare current prices with the preceding season's prices in New Zealand. By reason of its more regular seasons, New Zealand has closely sold out supplies yearly at prices based on the landed cost of the importations during the year, quite the reverse has been the case in Australia, where it frequently happened that machines sold were imported two or three previously at lower invoice prices and with lower freights, and as prices there were also made on the basis of landed cost, they were, for the time being, more favourable to Australian than to New Zealand purchasers.",31
107,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member is now giving us the excuses of the International Harvester Company for selling: their machines dearer in New Zealand than here.,31
108,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The paper I have here is from the Massey-Harris people. It gives the reason why at times there were increased prices in New Zealand as compared with here. Nobody knows better than the Minister that the prices of these goods have been jumping up considerably month after month. Manufacturing costs have been going up month after month, and year after year, until they have reached an enormous figure. Nobody knows that better than the Minister does. He knows also that machinery canbe imported for one season's product, and:' I suppose nobody knows better than he does why the reaper and binder is being sold at its present price today instead of the stawith the duty added. It has been kept very secret up to the present, but althoughthe Minister knew it the House was not told anything of it.",31
109,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"But the beauty of the thing is that, notwithstanding these reasons in regard to New Zealand, the Australian manufacturers, who were subjected to all these extra costs, did not charge as much.",31
110,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Can the Minister tell us how the price of the stripper-harcharged vester has jumped up?,31
111,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Price s have not increased here so much.,31
112,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Price s have inIn New creased everywhere. The Minister knowsi t from the this quite well.,31
113,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"But the Australian New manufacturer did not have such large six stocks in hand. He was manufacturing purpose, all the time. The honourable member's Australian statements are pretty hot.",31
114,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I do not think they its are - I have at times questioned some.of the Minister's statements. He draws hiswhile information wholly from one source- I the might almost say a tainted source, because years it comes from those manufacturers whoexpect to benefit by the increased duties.",31
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,On e might as well say the same of the honourable member's in-' formation.,32
116,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Nothin g of the sort. I am quoting figures.that ought to have been obtained by a Board for the information of honourable members.,32
117,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The Minister's interjection is an admission that, if the information obtained by the honourable member for Dampier is unreliable, his own figures are unreliable also.",32
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I did not say they were.,32
119,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The Minister stands in an entirely different position from any other honourable member. His duty was to get the fullest possible inforpeople mation from every section of the community in regard to the effect of these duties, and allow honourable members to make up their own minds; although, of course, he would be entitled to throw his own weight into the balance if he so desired.",32
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"In Tariff matters one gets help from both sides, as the honourable member knows.",32
121,Dr MALONEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"'Why not pass Tariff in globo, so that we may deal with the dumping trouble?",32
122,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I cannot understand why some members opposite do not screw their courage up to the sticking point, and declare against the importation of any goods into this country. Why not increase the duties three hundredfold or five hundredfold, and test the issue at once ?",32
123,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,As we did on onions?,32

126,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,What is the price of the Sunshine implement?,32
127,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Mitchells and the Massey-Harris Company make the oddnumbered colters, whereas the Sunshine do not, so it would be hard to make a comparison, as the honourable member for Wakefield suggests.",32
128,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The actual price of the 15-hoe drill in New Zealand is £61 17s. 6d., but the farmer pays, in addition, £2 for a canvas cover, £2 extra for wood wheels, and £2 7s. 6d. for outward railage, which bring the landed price to £68 5s. Even with the addition of the3C items the New Zealand farmer gets a the cheaper machine than the Australian producer. I am told that the prices charged by Mitchell and the Sunshine Harvester people are approximately identical, but Mitchells have been chosen for the reason, as explained by the honourable member for Wimmera, that their drills are constructed with ^ odd-numbered colters, as are Reid and Grays, in New Zealand, and the Massey-Harris implements, while the MCKay drill is manufactured with even-numbered colters. Honourable members will note that the small New Zealand manufacturer, with an output that is' trifling in comparison with that of the leading Australian manufacturers, sells his drill in Free Trade New Zealand at a price 16f per cent, lower than the Australian manufacturer does in his highly-protected market, and lower also than the importers, whom the Australian manufacturers are attempting to exclude, can do. Current prices in the Commonwealth and the Dominion for the other items referred to by the Minister are as follow:jNeJw Zealand. Australia. disc plough Spring-tine harrow . . £58 £20 .. .. £65 £21 .. £34 .. £3510s.  chinery manufactured by a New Zealand firm?",32

130,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Thos e figures were supplied to the honourable member. The honourable member is wrong about the four-furrow disc plough. My figures are that in Australia, with a 40 per cent, duty, it is sold at £44, and in New Zealand, duty free, at £52 10s.",33
131,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The statistics I have used I collected for myself, except those which I quoted from Mr Walmsley, but these figures in regard to prices are supplied by Massey-Harris, and I believe them to be true. If I doubted their accuracy, I should not put them before the Committee. I have the assurance of Massey-Harris and Company that these are their prices, and, moreover, I have checked some of them with the printed price lists issued in Canada by Deering and MCCormick. I have taken all possible care to verify my information, and I would not read to the Committee any document if I thought it contained any misrepresentation. The Minister (Mr. Greene) said during this debateAgricultural machinery there (New Zealand), which is supplied almost entirely by overseas manufacturers-becaus e there is .practically no agricultural implement making in the Dominion-is without exception dearer than it is in Australia. . . . There are eighty-five items in this list, &c.

133,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Ba d though our local manufacturers are because of the low wages they pay, Massey-Harris and Company are worse, because they sweat their employees under contract.",33
134,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I have previously quoted statistics showing that the average wage per employee in this industry is considerably greater in Canada than in Australia, whilst the output also is larger.

137,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Wage s in Canada"" were about 25 per cent, higher two years ago.",33
138,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The wages I quotedrelated to 1918.,33
139,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,What is the good of quoting those?,33
140,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The average income of salaried employees in this industry in Australia is £170 2s., and in Canada £292 10s., whilst the average wage of the operatives in Australia is £129 18s., and in Canada £192 12s. I shall quote the prices paid for different articles of machinery, by thei farmers in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Australian prices of binders are quoted ou the basis of a 10 per cent, duty, because Massey-Harris & Company had a large number of machines on hand just before - the new duty became operative. Had."" that machinery arrived a month later, and borne the 45 per cent, duty, the increase would have had to be paid by the consumer.",33
141,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Can the honourable .member say why the Massey-Harris people knocked off £24 off their catalogue price for the reaper and binder?,33
142,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I can. While I was speaking on the first item, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Poster) interjected:-""The price quoted 7 did here for the imported reaper and binder"" was £130, but as soon as Mr MCKay quoted £100 for his machine, the price of the imported article dropped."" The explanation is this: The Australian retail price for a Massey-Harris 6-feet reaper and binder for the 1920 harvest was £102"" payable after harvest. As forward orders for harvesting machines are booked all* through the year, it became necessary to fix a price for binders for the 1921 harvest soon after the new Tariff was brought' down, and a price list was issued on 19th.' July, 1920, in which the price ""for the 6-feet reaper and binder was fixed at £130, which included the duty of 45 per oent. under the new Tariff. Honourable members are aware that in March of last year the new Tariff was introduced, which' imposed a duty of 45 per cent, on reapers and binders, but it did not become operasey-Harris tive until the 1st January of this However, a large number of reapers and binders arrived in December too late delivery for the 1920 harvest, before new duty came into effect, but after the High Court decision was announced under which the Customs Department charged prices continuesduty on the exchange. It is those reapers and binders, carried over from 1920, that are now listed at £105 for the 1921 harvest. Had they paid the new 45 per cent, duty and the duty on exchange, their price would not have been less than £135. The price established by MCKay Reaper and Binderhad nothing whatever to do with the question. Mr .RICHARD FOSTER - The only Mowertrouble is that they did not quote the lower price until MCKay quoted £100.",33
143,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable memHay Bakeber knows perfectly well that, up to that time, the Sunshine Works had turned out Side only one machine.",34
144,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I am speaking of quotations which I know were made by MCKay for this season in South Australia.,34
145,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The Massey-Harris people distinctly intimated that, as soon as they would be called upon to pay the higher duty, the price would be increased to £132.",34
146,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Yes ; but it fell to £100 when the Sunshine machine came out.,34
147,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The Massey-Harris people state that their price at the present time is based on the 10 per cent, duties paid by them on. these machines.",34

Tho present Tariff will injure the producer, and I do not think it will benefit the workers, although it plays into the hands of Trusts and monopolies, and tends to increase their number.. Honourable members know how the promises that were made when machinery duties were increased in 1908 have been broken. The farmer does not know from day to day what return his industry, will yield him. He has to compete without protection in the markets of the world, and he deserves special consideration. Land has been falling out of cultivation, and though the area that is being cultivated has increased this year, that is due chiefly to the efforts of repatriated men to make homes for themselves. The man who goes out into the bush to win a livelihood by tilling land that has hitherto produced nothing, and cuts himself off from the advantages of civilization, often being unable to get schooling for his children or a proper mail service, is surely worthy of consideration. Yet, these duties fall wholly upon such men and other tillers of the soil.",36

170,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Not that you are trying to do so, but that that will be the effect of the duties.",37
171,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"That will not be their effect, and were it likely to be so not one honourable member on this side would support them; because if the man on the land cannot make a living, the rest of the community suffers - We quite understand that; but we believe that the farmers' representatives in this Chamber are over-estimating the effect of the increased duty. We are charged with looking solely after the interests of the manufacturerj but we would rather do that than protect the importer. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has referred to the Massey-Harris Company. I have a particular objection to that firm, because I believe it is worse than the ternational Harvester Company. In connection with the assembling of these implements, the workmen are in a somewhat unfortunate position, as there is not a Federal award covering this particular trade. Victoria and South Australia are the principal manufacturing States, and operations are governed by the decisions of a Victorian Wages Board. Unfortunately, a mistake was made in preparing the Victorian rates and conditions, and the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester. Company are taking full advantage of the position. The representatives of the men had it arranged that these firms could not under-pay men, but under certain contract arrangements men are engaged in assembling the parts of agricultural implements at rates which do not allow them to earn a living wage. These firms, however, are controlled, to a certain extent, and we can demand from them wages and conditions which we cannot exact from importers.",37
172,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Is it not rather strange that men can be secured to work for less than a living wage?,37
173,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It is; and at times the firms find great difficulty in obtaining their services. At present there is a good deal of unemployment, and these firms are taking full advantage of the situation by employing men to work at wages.below those usually paid. Agricultural implements can be assembled by men who do not possess engineering skill, although a certain amount of mechanical knowledge is necessary. In many counr tries where there is over-production, the manufacturer is compelled to export his surplus to other countries, where, it is sold at a lower price than it is disposed of to the consumers in the country where it is manufactured. It is only six weeks ago that the South African farmers objected to Victorian wheat being dumped in that country, because it was detrimental to the interests of the South African producers. Australian wheat has been sold in South Africa at a lower rate than it was disposed of in the Commonwealth. The American manufacturers are not the only transgressors in this direction, because all manufacturers dispose of their over-production in a way that is detrimental to the interests of those in the countries from which they export. The honourable member for DamI n - pier (Mr Gregory) quoted the ruling prices in Canada, New Zealand, and Aus-. tralia, but Canada is really the same as the United States of America, because the .same firms are operating in the two countries, and the Tariff in the two countries is framed to suit the interests of both. The difference in the Canadian price of £61 and the New Zealand price of £97 is accounted for by extra profit, because in New Zealand"" there is no competition with the local manufacturer. If the New Zealandprice is £97 and the Australian. £102, the difference of £5 does not mean ruination to the Australian farmer. Surely the average agriculturist would be prepared to pay that amount if it would mean placing the industry on a sound basis and making the farmer independent of foreign manufacturers. I doubt very much whether, individually or collectively, the Australian wheat-growers would enter any protest if they realized that the imposition of the proposed duty would eventually be the means of placing them in a better position. I quite understand that the farmers' representatives are advocating reductions because they fear that some injury will be in flicted, and if they do not protest they may have to explain. I believe that some farmers' representatives are asked to make statements with which they do not agree. How much would it mean per bushel of wheat, oats, or barley if the extra price was paid ? - Mr STEWART - Will the honourable member encourage primary production by giving a price above the world's parity?",37
174,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I do not like being nasty, but 10s. 3d. per bushel for fowls' food is ridiculous. I have been informed by poultry farmers that it is impossible to carry on because farmers want so much for their wheat.",38
175,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The farmers are not receiving anything like that price.,38
176,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I know that, but they are receiving on an average 9s. 4^d. per bushel.",38

195,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"A number of men in my electorate are anxious to go on the land. I know of a farmers' representative in this Chamber who did not possess much training, and who made a success of rural work. There is nothing in farming that cannot be successfully mastered by a man possessing ordinary intelligence and physical fitness.",38
196,Mr FOLEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The best farmers in Western Australia were originally miners.,38
197,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Quite so. A number of old Cornish miners have made very successful agriculturists. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) must admit that a number of farmers have been so successful that they have been able to retire.,38
198,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Yes , and a number have been through the Insolvency Courts.",38
199,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,That is so. It is ridiculous to suggest that the imposition of the proposed duty will ruin the farmers.,38
200,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It may not ruin them, but' it may drive them off the land..",38
201,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The extra duty, represents about one-seventh of a penny per bushel, and if that is going to ruin the farmer he is hanging on by a very slender thread. The Australian farmer owes a good deal to the implement manufacturers of Australia, because the stripper harvester, which is an Australian invention waa largely responsible for making t wheat farming successful.",39
202,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Was not the chief inventor an agriculturist?,39
203,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Inventor s would be of little use without .manufacturers. Quite apart from sentiment, it is good business for the man on the land to encourage the local manufacture of the implements he requires.",39
204,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"But will the honourable member say that high duties are essential, either to the manufacturer or to worker ?",39
205,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"If I did not think so I would not support them. If I thought that, without imposing higher rates of duties, I could make Australian employers pay, and continue to pay, the wages which, their workmen earn, I would be satisfied not to go for increases.",39
206,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member knows that if the local manufacturer had to pay higher wages he would raise the price of his machines.,39
207,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"At any rate, he would not do so because of any lack of effort on my part to prevent that course. The experience which we had in Australia with the stripper-harvester very nearly killed Australia's Protectionist policy. I do not want to open old sores, but if our manufacturers had kept their promises, the Protective policy would have been much more easy of adoption than it has proved.",39
208,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It could not have been much more easily operated than at present. - Mr MATHEWS - But for the breach of faith which occurred in 1908, the duty on every machine would have amounted to £16.'",39
209,Mr GEEGOEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Unde r the duty which was imposed, did not Australian manufacturers do remarkably well?",39
210,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I believe they did.,39
211,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,And did they not hold their own?,39
212,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I do not know. They were not paying the wages that they should have paid in a country like Australia, and we desired increased duty to enable them to do so. If such increase had been injurious to the farmer, we would not have sought to impose it. But we knew, and we still know, that it was not injurious. We know, further, that without the imposition of additional duties the prices of imported machinery have gone up and up. The establishment of local factories tends, without doubt, to check importers. That has been proved in New Zealand. The figures which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) quoted in this respect were not accurate. I say that the machines are - cheaper in Victoria, at any rate, than in New Zealand. But even the statistics the which the honourable member gave proved that the importer is an exploiter. Unfortunately, he is often an individual whom we cannot get at, since the profits go elsewhere. I wish to quote some interesting figures for the particular benefit of country members. In the financial year 1905-6, the 5-ft. stripper-harvester cost the farmer £81. In 1909-10, the price was £70. The 6-ft. stripper-harvester in the earlier year was £94, and in the later period £78. I could quote similar comparisons in respect of other lines of machinery, but my purpose is to show that after the imposition of a Protective Tariff there was a decrease in the price which the Australian farmer had to pay.",39
213,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Whose figures are those?,39
214,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"They have been furnished for me by the trade. I have made the comparisons to show that, not only was the price to the Australian farmer reduced, but that the importer had to take less profit.",39
215,Mr HAY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Was there any local competition during those periods to account for the reduction in prices?,39
216,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"There was in those days. I am told that there is very little today. It will astonish honourable members in the corner to learn that, over a five-year period, up to 1918, the duty which the farmer had to pay upon his imported implements amounted to about one-seventh of Id. per bushel on all the grain produced in the Commonwealth. Such an imposition could not possibly ruin anybody. The amount of duty collected on agricultural implements of all sorts last year was about £450,000. The farmer says that that is a direct charge upon one class, namely, the primary producer. It is not so, for the reason that the primary producer passes it on. Honourable members will be interested, I think, in the following extract from the Farm Implement News, published in Chicago:During the month of February, agricultural implements to the value of $7,082,800 were exported, according to figures made public by the Department of Commerce last week. This is a large increase over February, 1920, when the value of implement exports $2,869,647: For the first eight months of the current fiscal year, implement exports were $37,272,683, compared with $19,552,593 during the corresponding period of. the previous fiscal year. The annual report of the International Harvester Company, made public 14th April, shows that, while the company's volume of business in 1920 was the largest in its the net profit was smaller than in 1919. The report states that the machine selling prices in 1920 showed an average increase of' GO per cent, over pre-war prices, and that the increase in repair prices was 40 per cent. The peculiar and significant fact is that while their exports were enormously greater than during the earlier period, their profits were considerably less. It is obvious that American manufacturers were accepting lower prices for their machinery. That is what we fear in Australia. I agree with the honourable member for Dampier that, with the up-todate furnishings of our factories, and with the intelligence and individuality of the Australian workman, we ought to be able to compete and hold our own with any one in the world. So long as the conditions are fair and normal, we should fear nothing and nobody. But we have to look out for the profit-cutting foreign manufacturer. TJnited States of America manufacturers have had to sell their products for less than formerly, and they will be compelled to continue to do so. They must find and keep and endeavour to expand oversea trade, andi they can only do so by selling for less profits than they were formerly making. Acute though the general position may be in Australia and Great Britain today, there are also great troubles and disabilities in the TJnited States of America. In their search for, and exploitation of, further markets, the American makers will resort to methods which, if they are not counteracted here, will prove considerably detrimental to Australian industry. It is "" up to us,"" and particularly to the representatives of the farmers, to see that Australia's industrial interests are conserved and protected. Does not the farmer perceive that an industrial smash would injure'him as much as any other individual in the community?",39
217,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,We do not want any smashes in this country.,40
218,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Then I ask the honourable member to assist in preventing was calamity. There need be only the small beginnings of a slide to precipitate an awful avalanche. While we are all desirous of reducing the prices of commodities generally, if reductions are to be brought about by the enforcement of lower wages, there is bound to be disaster. That consideration appeals to me as history, a representative of the worker more than it does to honourable members opposite. In 1893, there was a smash in Victoria, and, in common with many thousands of other persons, I had to leave this State and go elsewhere to make a living. Will honourable members opposite tell me"" that the farmers did not suffer then, as well as anybody else in the community?",40
219,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member is assisting to bring about a similar condition of things by injuring the producing interests of the country.,40
220,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,If the effect of this duty were to injure the interests of the producers of the country I should have nothing to do with it. I believe that it cannot possibly have that effect.,40
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The conditions in 1893 were as different from those existing now as daylight is from dark. We are suffering now from double and treble the prices that prevailed in 1893.,40
222,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"If the honourable member remembers the crisis of 1S93 he will know that we were then suffering from inflated values, which, in proportion to the value of money, were as great as the increase in prices today.",40
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,But the cost of living in 1893 was down to bedrock as compared with the cost today.,40
224,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I notice that in Brisbane recently Mr Andrew Fisher expressed the opinion that even the greatfinanciers of the world do not know where they are today. There is no one who really knows what is the true financial position in the world today. All the great financiers have been at sea. Our position today is peculiar just as it was in 1893 when the smash came. If it had not been for the discovery of gold in Western Australia at that time many people in Victoria would have had to starve. The State Government at the time were mad, and went in for economy.",41
225,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING, Does the honourable member intend to connect these remarks with the item before the Chair?,41
226,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I can do so. I am replying to the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), who says that these duties will ruin the farming section of the community. I am pointing out that there are other things besides the increase of duties which might ruin the farmers. A financial smash in Australia would effectually ruin them. have to look to the past for an example of this, and I say now to honourable members representing farming interests that the lowering of wages will bring about a financial smash in Australia more quickly than anything else. Unless we have duties to protect our manufactures against dumping from other countries we shall be likely to have such a smash.",41
227,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Would the smash come if, with a reduction of these duties, we had a corresponding reduction in the cost of living? Why should not wages come down as well as prices ?",41
228,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I would rather live in a country where prices and wages were high than in one in which wages and prices were low.,41
229,Mr RIOHAED FOSTEB,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"In other words, the honourable member would be satisfied with an effective wage value. Mr MATHEWiS - Exactly . I shall take no risks in bringing wages down until I know that the cost of living has been brought down. My duty is to consider the position of the worker.",41
230,Mr CHARLTON,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Wage s have not yet caught up - with the cost of living.,41
231,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"That is so, and the Basic Wage Commission proved it . fear the possibility of a crash. I do not wish, to use platitudes, but we all know that no nation can build up a. desirable civilization on agricultural production alone. There must be stable manufacturing industries to. make, the country what we should desire it to be, and no country can be independent without them.",41
232,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,We all agree with that.,41
233,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"My amendment provides for fair duties on these manufactured articles. Mr MATHEWS . T - I should not like to suggest that the honourable member is not sincere in his proposal ; but, as a matter of fact, I desire that the duty should be increased by the amount by which he is trying to reduce it , because I know from past experience what the Yankee firms will go for, and must go for. Australia will be one of the first of the. markets which they will try toexploit. The honourable member for Dampier quoted certain figures in order to compare prices in Australia, and New Zealand. I have already I said that, even if the honourable member's; figures are correct, I have so good an opinion of farmers in Australia that I believe they would be willing to pay the increased prices charged in Australia im order to have these industries established! in this country. .",41
234,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Can . the honourable member show me that the agricultural implement industry did not flourish im Australia under the low duties of the 1908-1911 Tariff?,41
235,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"What I say is that if a £12 duty was essential in . 1908, £16is useless now.",41
236,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,No ; because this is quite a new machine.,41
237,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It is useless to base estimates on pre-war values. Things areat present in a state of flux. We do not know where we are. Experiments aredangerous, and experiments in the lowering of wages are, in my view, more dangerous than., any others. In the circumstances, to give opportunity to importing firms to exploit our people is foolish om the part of members of this Committee. I have some figures here which institute a comparison between prices in Australia. I and prioes in New Zealand. I take> for instance, certain, manufactures of the International Harvester Company, and I find that this company sells the Mogul stationary engine, ,1 horse-power, for £26 in Australia, where the duty is 30 per cent. In New Zealand, where the duty on the machine is only 10 per oent., they charge £35, .or £9 more than they charge for it in Australia. For the Mogul stationary engine, 6 hors.e-power, the I ternational Harvester Company charges £125 in Australia, where the duty is 30 per cent., and in New Zealand, where the duty is only l'O per cent., they charge £146 10s.",41
238,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Is 'this an oil engine?,42
239,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I cannot say.' For the Mogul stationary engine, 10 horsepower, the International Harvester Company charges £190 in Australia, where the duty is 30 per cent., and £209 10s. in New Zealand, where the duty is only 10 per cent. These figures show that the importing firms sell more .cheaply in a protective country than in a practically Free Trade country. The reason is apparent, and it is that they have to compete here with local manufacturers.",42
240,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member's figures are extraordinary, because the figures I had showed that American 011 engines increased in price less during the war than almost any other article I know of.",42
241,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"My figures will be placed on record, and if the honourable member can refute them he will have an opportunity to do' so. For a fifteen-hoe grain and fertilizer drill the International Harvester Company chargehere, where the duty is 30 per cent., £51 5s., and they charge £53 5s. in New Zealand, where the implement is admitted free.",42
242,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I think the honourable member's figures are wrong.,42
243,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"They have been collected for me, and if the honourable member can refute them, so much the better for his case. The International Harvester Company charge, in Australia, where the duty is 25 per cent.,, £16 5s. for an orchard disc harrow, 8 x 16, with fore-carriage, and they charge £17 10s. for this implement in New Zealand, where it is admitted free. For a Diamond harrow, four sections, they charge £ 7 15s. in Australia, where the duty is 25 per cent., and £ 7 13s. 6d. in. New Zealand, where the implement is admitted free. The Massey-Harris Company sell a fifteen-hoe grain and fertilizer drill in Australia, where the duty is 30 per cent., for £51 12s., and they charge in New Zealand £53 7s. 6d. r though the implement is admitted free to that Dominion. They sell a fifteen-disc grain and fertilizer drill for £55 12s. 6d. in Australia, where the duty is 30 per cent., and in New Zealand, where the n - implement is admitted free, they charge £57 10s. for it . They sell a disc harrow, twelve discs, 6 feet, in Australia, - for £13 15s., though the duty on the implement is 25 per cent, here, and they charge £12 17s. 6d. for it in New Zealand, where it is admitted free. They sell a Diamond harrow, four sections, in Australia, where the duty is 25 per cent., for £7 12s. 6d., and for £ 7 12s. 6d. in New Zealand, where it is admitted free. For a disc plough, three furrows, 24-inch disc, they charge £35 7s. 6d. in Australia, with ai duty of 25 peor cent., and they charge £35 12s. 6d. for it in New Zealand, where it is admitted free. For a gang plough, two-furrow rolling coulters, they charge £15 12s. 6d. in Australia, where the duty is 25 per cent., and £15 14s. 6d. in New Zealand, where the implement is admitted free. I quote these figures to show that importers take advantage of the. state of the market, and where there is no local competition they charge all they can get. The funny thing is that the farmers' representatives regard them as most merciful people, and appear to consider that they are philanthropists.",42
244,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"No . We say that our local agricultural implement industry has been built up under a low Tariff, and now the honourable member desires to make a special concession to the men who manufacture these implements.",42
245,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The only concession I wish to make them is to enable them to hold the Australian market while paying fair wages to the men they employ and charging fair prices to those who have to use the implements they manufacture. Honourable members opposite know that if I get a chance I shall make the manufacturers sell at fair prices.,42
246,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I am interested te know what is going to happen af ter thia Tariff is passed.,42
247,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member is not more interested in that than I am. ThefiguresI have quoted represent in every instance net cash prices. The statement regarding this matter which has heen supplied to me reads:In New Zealand, oil engines are subject to a revenue duty of 10 per cent., but all other lines are 'admitted free. In Australia, there were duties of 30 per cent, on grain drills and oil engines, and 25 per cent, upon all other lines mentioned above. Notwithstanding this, it will be seen that prices in Australia were considerably lower than prices in New Zealand. That was in 1918-19. In 1920, the difference was even greater. Writing to the Argus of 18th April last, the Minister for Trade and Customs quoted the International Harvester Company's then current prices in the two countries, as under :4-Furrow DlscJPlough, 24-in. discs fi.. Spring line Harrow, 23-teeth 17 10 0 Eleven Disc Drill 51 10 0 Thirteen Disc Drill 55 5 0 These figures show that Protection on farm machinery does not raise prices, and that the New Zealand farmer derives no advantage from the free importation of his implements. Whilst the removal of duties is no advantage to New Zealand, it has serious disadvantages. The Dominion loses considerable revenue, which has to* be made good by some other form of taxation, and the farmer is charged more for his implements. May I add that the Minister is not encouraging the production in his own country of a commodity which ought to he encouraged ? That, to my mind, is the greatest crime of the lot. In New Zealand the duty was remitted, with the object of making these machines cheaper to the farmer, hut the result was that they were made dearer. I know that all business men will cut lines at times, just to show how much cheaper they can sell than can the fellow next door.",42
248,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"When I quote statistics, the honourable member complains if I go back to 1918.",43
249,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I have quoted the figures for 1919-20.,43
250,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member has not quoted the present prices of these machines.,43
251,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Le t us get down to the question of wages. As honourable members are aware, that is the question which most appeals to me. During, the war, the manufacturers of Canada, by reason of their proximity to of Europe, were able to.obtain contracts to the value of hundreds of millions sterling, whilst we' in Australia were unable to secure any such contracts.",43
252,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Contract s for the supply of agricultural implements ?,43
253,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"No ; unfortunately, they were for war commodities. As the honourable member knows, all the industrial establishments in Canada were converted into war-material establishments. Now that the war is over, these have reverted to ordinary manufacturing purposes. The wages paid during the war Australia. New Zealand. Net Cash. Net Cash. in Canada, because of the inordinate prices which manufacturers were able to # £ s. a. £ s. d. obtain for their commodities, were higher Duty 25 % Duty Free. than those paid in Australia. But since the armistice the manufacturers there 41 12 6 52 10 0 19 10 0 have discovered a most effective method Duty 30% 62 0 0 of lowering wages. I hope not merely to 66 15 0 maintain the wages which are being paid to the agricultural employees in Australia, but to secure an increase of those wages. At the same time, I say that the employer in Canada is not paying his employees the wages that he should. Figures prove nothing unless they are up to date.",43
254,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Figure s prove everything, according to the statements of some honourable members this afternoon.",43
255,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The statements which I have quoted can be disproved only by comparison with the selling prices extant. We, have .been told that the manufacturers of Canada are paying considerably higher wages to their employees than are the manufacturers of Australia. I hope that they are. But if they are doing so, the fact only makes me anxious to see our own employees receiving a considerably higher wage. Should there be over-production, either in Canada or the TJnited States of America, the manufacturing firms there will not exhibit any mercy or any consideration to the manufacturers of Australia. Thus, whilst it may happen that agricultural machinery may be imported at prices which for a time will suit the farming community, the latter should beware pf what is in front of it if dumping should ,take place here.",43
256,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It is preposterous to the markets talk about dumping.,43
257,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I take it that the honourable member for Dampier does not desire to see that state of things brought about. But he knows that methods are adopted in business-method s which are not conducive to the best interests of the community.,44
258,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I would like to see a body established, such as has been created by the Japanese. When goods are imported into that country and are offered at unreasonably low prices, the whole thing is sifted from top to bottom den upon the farmer. with a view to seeing that the people pay fair prices for them.",44
259,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,We have been promised that similar legislation will be from enacted here.,44
260,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,That Japanese arrangement is in addition to the ordinary duty. actually,44
261,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I hope that the. think members of the Corner party will not slip when we upon this side of the chamthe ber endeavour to get similar legislation duty enacted. We require anti-dumping laws.,44
262,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I hope that we shall be as solidly behind the honourable member as he is solidly behind the Governtions ment in connection with this Tariff.,44
263,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I hope so. Upon and page 7815 of Hansard of this sescrop i sion, the honourable member for Damor, pier (Mr Gregory), in discussing the for duty upon stripper-harvesters, affirmed that the present duty was' £50 Is. 5d. at the mint par rate of exchange, and liable that, the natural protection in 38 per cent. The duty upon harvesters imported from America is 40 per cent. ad valorem, so that if the amount of duty were £50 Is. 5d. at that rate, the chines invoice price would be £113 6s. The landed cost price of an imported harvester 'in 1920 would therefore be as under:Invoice price in America, £113 16s.; of Duty duty at 40 per cent, ad valorem, £50 Is. 5d.; natural protection, 38 per cent., £43 4s. 10d.; or a total of £207 2s. 3d. bushel. The honourable member did not state the size of the machine; but, assuming it to be the largest size imported, namely, 8 feet, it means that the importers were paying £207 2s. 3d. to land .it in Ausworth fostering. tralia, whereas the net cash selling price last year was only £174 10s., and this year is £184.",44
264,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I was then dealing with the price of the refcper-thresher.,44
265,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"No . The honourable member was dealing with the stripper-harvester, so that if these machines enjoy the natural protection attributed to them, by the honourable member, the importers are throwing away about £25 per machine. I am, however, chiefly concerned with the dumping proclivities of manufacturers abroad who have overestimated the requirements of their own local markets. I come now to the question of whether Protection imposes a burA newspaper article, which I recently perused, thus sets out the position:Assuming that the farmers get no benefit Protection, either in the way of reduced prices for their machinery or the introduction of up-to-dat e appliances, what do the duties amount to? To hear some of the statements that have been made, one would that the duties were a crushing tax on the farmers, and would soon drive them off land, hut an investigation of the figures shows that this is a fallacy. The amount of paid on all agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machines for the five-year period from 1914 to 1918 inclusive totalled £433,948. The value of agricultural producfor the same period was £286,075,000, so that the duty equalled only 3s. for every £100 worth of produce. If we take the same period spread the duty over the acreage under t works out to less than l i d . per acre, taking it another way, the duties work out at less than one-seventh of a penny per bushel all wheat, oats, maize, and barley raised in the years under review, namely, 1914 to 1918, that being the last year for which refigures are available. Value of crops for five-year period, from 1920 was 1914-1918, £274,156,452. Bushels of wheat, oats, and barley produced for five-year period, 1914-18, 652,101,816. Value of duty paid, on all agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural implements and mafor the five-year period 1914-18, £433,948. Acreage of wheat, hay, oats, and barley cultivated for five-year period 1914-18, 71,392,494 acres. equal to, say, 3 s. for every £100 worth produce. Or duty equal to, say, l i d . per acre. Or duty equal to, say, l-7th of a penny per",44
266,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member's figures go to prove the value of the agricultural industry. They show it is,44
267,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Yes . They . also show how lightly this impost falls on the farmers.,44
268,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"And they do not include anything like the .whole of our agricultural products, in the production of which agricultural machinery is used.",44
269,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Quite so. We are told that these duties are going to ruin the farmers. I should not have made this quotation but for certain figuresquoted by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), which, I think, it entirely refutes.",45
270,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I pointed out that, as 75 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used here was made in Australia, every £1 increase in the duty meant a 75 per cent, increase.",45
271,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member tried to prove that an increase of £1 amounted really to a £4 increase. I have heard that contention before, but it would be difficult to convince me that, if I received £1 for something, I had in reality received £4 for it. The honourable member, as reported in Hansard, pages 7815-6, said a good deal in regard to the supposed natural protection enjoyed, by Australian manufacturers. I have here a statement in which it is pointed out thatIf his figures are no more reliable than those Telating to binders, mowers, and hay-rakes, they can be disregarded altogether. He said the natural protection on binders, mowers, and hay-rakes, in 1913 and 1921, was as under:Binders ... . . 36.29 . . 60.99 Mowers -. . . 39.24 . . 62.01' Hay-rakes .. . . . 32.45 . . 55.72 He did not show how these figures were Arrived at, but there is no doubt they are incorrect. Natural protection is usually considered to be freight, insurance, and all other charges except duty. The natural protection on one well-known American make of machines in 1913 and 1921 is as under:Binders .. . . 20% . . 19% . Mowers .. . . 22% . . 22% Hay-rakes .. . . 20% . . 20% Naturally it was higher during the war period, hut the above percentages state the situation today. These figures include freight, insurance, bank exchange, wharfage, stacking, cartage, entries, and all other expenses except duty. The honourable member claimed that the natural protection was in some cases per cent., and in others, as. much as 130 per cent, greater than, the figures prove to be.",45
272,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The only exaggeration in the figures which I quoted was in the reference to assembling, which I quite agree should not have' been included. Apart from that item, I quoted the actual figures in regard to importations.",45
273,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member will recognise that in quoting these figures in refutation of statements made by him I have no desire to be personally offensive. He laid great stress on the natural protection which he claimed was enjoyed by local manufacturers, and I am showing that it does not exist.",45
274,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member admits that if exists, but not to the extent that I was advised.",45
275,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It does not exist, to anything like the extent claimed by the honourable member for Dampier.",45
276,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Tber e can be no doubt about that. The. honourable member probably included as a natural protection the loss in exchange between America and Australia, but this should not be considered, since it is only a temporary disadvantage. This Tariff will continue until we amend it, but the loss in. exchange between the TJnited States pf America and other countries cannot continue very long without bringing about a crisis. The present situation is of the gravest concern to financiers and businessmen in the TJnited States of America. Almost every week we read in the newsr 1913. 1921. papers cable messages setting out the concern felt by financiers and others in the TJnited States of America in regard to the exchange position. We are told that the. Government of the United. States of - America will have to enter, into some arrangement with Great Britain to do this, that, ortheother thing, and as soon as the exchange difficulty has been adjusted away will' go any natural protection that 1913. 1921. our manufacturers enjoy in that respect. I shall not enlarge upon the question. I have only to say, in conclusion, that if I thought these duties would injunouslyaffect the farmer, I . would not vote for them. I claim, however,, that the farmer must bear his share of the cost of administering the affairs of Australia. I claim, further, that, it is better for him 100 that he should. have his requirements satisfied by local manufacturers, since in it such circumstances he has ready access to the market, instead of having to satisfy his needs by imports from overseas. The farmer, like all other sections of the community; is also concerned in - seeing that we avoid such a financial crisis - as occurred here in the early, nineties- „ .Much as he may fear increased prices as - the result of increased duties on agricultural implements and machinery, he has far more to fear from a financial crash. I advise him not 'to take too much notice - of the statements of the Taxpayers Association, which is howling for economy, and wants to bring down wages. We had - exactly the same cry in the - early nineties, and the reduction of wages was followed by a financial smash. If we try - to bring down wages a great depression will' ensue, with disastrous results alike to primary producers as well as dwellers in our cities. It is up to the farmer to see that we build up in Australia industries that - will benefit him equally with all town Workers.  [6.15] - As one who endeavours to properly represent the primary producers of Australia, I desire to show exactly where I stand in regard to a matter of such vital importance as is the duty on agricultural implements. I do not feel justified in allowing to go uncontradicted the statements made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), in a telling' speech, has already replied to some of them, and I desire, also, to put before the Committee other aspects of the question. My only regret is that other members of the Country party are not prepared to follow the example of the honourable member for Dampier and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who feel strongly on this question, and do not hesitate to say exactly where they stand. Every honourable member should be prepared to substantiate the views he holds.",45
277,Mr WIENHOLT,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"We shall do that by. our votes.  all very well; but this is riot a question on .which we ought to register a silent vote, since the imposition of duties on agricultural machinery and implements is a bone of contention amongst so many people. If the honourable member for Dampier could support his statements by recourse to the history offiscalismin this or any other country, or by quoting authoritative statistics, I should be found voting with him. I go further, and say 'that if his statements were based on fact-if it .were true that the imposition of duties on agricultural implements and machinery or anything else used by the primary producer, had the effect of increasing prioes- I would mot vote.for,such duties.",46
278,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I believe these dutieswill have that effect.  the contrary view. Every figure quoted ; by the honourable member for Dampier came came from a biased source.,46
279,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"He acknowledged quite freely that he obtained his figures from the Massey-Harris people.  swer to my inquiry, he candidly admitted) that the figures quoted by him were supplied by the Massey-Harris Company-ta . company of importers. Such figures are absolutely unreliable.",46
280,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Then by the same token, figures supplied by Australian manufacturers must also be unreliable.  cause we are able to obtain the price lists1 issued by the Australian manufacturers. The honourable member for Dampier did not give us the benefit of any inquiries; he had made in that direction. He gave us, instead, a long series of figures. It is an old saying that figures' can be made to prove anything. So they can, if they are taken from only one source, and those at the source are interested parties. That is what the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) did.",46
281,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable member said he had checked the figures with the price lists from Canada.  he did not!,46
282,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I heard him say so.,46
283,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member said he had checked the figures in some instances.  so. I asked the honourable member if hehad checked the figures with the price lists, and he said that in some instanceshe had.",46
284,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"And found them correct.  know 'that the honourable member added those words; in any case, the ' "" in stances ' ' might be only 1 or 2 per cent. The fair thing would have been to-check thefiguresjright-through, and then quote them to the Committee; but, even rhacf the honourable member done so, the figures would not have borne out the statement supplied by the Massey-Harris Company. What I desire to do is to follow the orable member for Dampier in his contenmaterial tion, but it is difficult to know where to begin. Perhaps it would be better to begin where he himself began, when he made a great point of the ""natural protection"" which, he says, afforded. The honourable member contends that the freights represent a natural protection to our own manufacturers, mean a great deal to thom. When the Minister (Mr Greene) was speaking the first item, he expressed the opinion that this "" natural protection "" is largely bringing this .machinery here. a myth; and I am quite sure that could have proved to the satisfaction of any fair-minded person that it is deed. Had the honourable member Dampier troubled to ask those people, who have been so careful to supply with certain figures, to tell him what "" natural .protection "" really amounts I am quite satisfied that the reply have shown him that it has no existence. As the honourable member did not take always overlooked. that course, I shall, for the benefit of the Committee, the country, and the primary producers, supply some information, which is obtained from no tainted source, but, as I claim, represents the facts the position. I shall not bother to quote the exact words of the honourable ber for Dampier (Mr Gregory) when dealing with the first item, but he then - contended that this "" natural protection "" tries. represents a great advantage to the manufacturers of Australia. Is the honourable member aware that, in the period from 1st July, 1914, until the 30th June, 1919, those large Canadian-American firms, to which he referred, were able import the finished implements and machinery from Montreal to Melbourne or Sydney at a freight of only 20s. per ton of 40 cubic feet?",46
285,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The figure given by the honourable member for Dampier was £ 2s. 6d.  news to me that the honourable member gave that figure, but if he did, then his talk about natural protection is much thin air.",47
286,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Did the coming of thoee vessels not enable the primary proabout ducers of Australia to get their products - away ?  only fair to show how these importations compete with local manufacturers, who honhave to import their steel and other raw at freights representing ten and exactly fifteen times that amount.",47
287,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Hav e you forgotten the explanation of the honourable member for Dampier that there was an arrangeis ment made in 1914 for five years ?  rangement was for the benefit of those .and who were importing these machines into Australia, and it was mainly due to the on fact that the Canadian Government were subsidizing the companies which were The he paternal Government of Canada stands so, .inby the Canadian manufacturers i h a for way that we here in Australia would do well to copy. As a result of that assisthim ance, this machinery is brought over this 12,000 miles of ocean at a freight equivato, lent to that paid for carrying machinery would from, say, Melbourne to Sydney.",47
288,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"That is a point that is  and the comparison made by those who talk of ""natural protection"" is unfair to our own manufacturers, who have to of import their steel and other raw material at freights up to twelve times the amount. memAny Government might well follow the example set by the Canadian Government in their efforts to build up local indusI n the period from 1914 to 1919, Australian manufacturers were unable to procure supplies of steel from Europe and England, and large quantities were, thereto fore imported from America. On many occasions such steel arrived consigned to Australian implement makers at from £6 to as high as £12 per ton freight while in the same ships there were mountains high of agricultural implements from Cana1 dian-American manufacturers carried at a freight of about £1 per ton. This how our local manufacturers suffer in comparison with the manufacturers of all America and Canada, where the Governso ments stand by them and subsidize shipping .companies in their interests. When the honourable member for Dampier spoke this "" natural protection,"" he might have told us those facts; and, as I have already said, he might have asked the importing companies bow much this ""natural protection"" really amounts to, instead of endeavouring to create the impression that the freights paid hy them are enormous. I have here a photograph of a bill of lading from Melbourne to Buenos Aires by the Japanese steamer Luzon Maru, and it is a very interesting document to consider side by side with the statements of the .honourable member for Dampier. This bill of lading shows that 101 packages, representing 49 tons 5 cwts., were carried at a freight of no less than £20 per ton. The date is January, 1918, during the period that the CanadianAmerican manufacturers were landing goods in Australia at 20s. per ton, as compared with an outward freight of £20. It may be said that this is ancient history, but I have an instance, within a month or two, of a consignment of 10 tons of one-way disc cultivators, an Australian invention well known to our farmers, being despatched from Melbourne to Buenos Aires in the Citta di Qenova at a freight of £10 per ton. This competes with a freight from New York to Buenos Aires of less than £3 per ton; and it is manifest that if we value our export trade we must do as other countries do, and assist our manufacturers to - hold their own.",47
289,Unknown,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.  orable member for Dampier was good enough to admit that he did not take into account the question of the assembling of the machines, and that there was notvery much in the contention which he raised.",48
290,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Onl y in that regard.  orable member was not present when I showed from a bill of lading that it cost only about 20s. per ton to oversea manufacturers to land their goods here.,48
291,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Do you say that oversea manufacturers can land their goods at £ 1 a ton now ?  was during the war.,48
292,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I gave the full particulars.  showed how a consignment of about 10"" tons, consisting of one-way disc cultivators, an implement of Australian invention, was despatched from Melbourne to Buenos Ayres in the Argentine on the Citta de Genova at a freight of £10 per ton, while from New York to Buenos Ayres the freight at the same time was only £ 3 per ton. In that case there was a natural protection to the foreigner of £7 per ton.",48
293,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I explained that that was a contract entered into just prior to the war.  Canadian Government by means of a subsidy enabled their manufacturers to have their manufactures brought here at £ 1 per ton.,48
294,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Hav e you any proof of that?  I make it as a definite statement. Does the honourable member think it is unnatural for a Government to stand by their own manufacturers ? It is the duty of a Government, in the interests of the primary and secondary producers, to stand by the manufacturers of their own country if they can, in order to allow them to build up the local industry.",48
295,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"If the Government are going to stand by their manufacturers with cheap outward freights to the markets of the world, it would not be a bad thing to apply the same principle to the primary producers also.  orable member will find no more ardent backer than myself in anything he wishes to have done in the interests of the primary producer, but it is also in the interests of the primary producer to so build up our manufactures here as to enable him to have a good local market, which is the best market of all. I hope we shall see the honourable member fori Grampians (Mr Jowett) voting with us when the division is taken on this item, although we have not seen much of him during the debates on the Tariff. I canthe not do better than repeat the words he uttered when he was a candidate for Maribyrnong some years ago. I quoted them when I spoke in the general debate on the Tariff. He pointed out how unfortunate it would be for this country in a time of war if we did not so build up our industries here that we would beable to come to the rescue of our primary producers instead of leaving them to be 9026 Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] the prey of foreign importers. That, in effect, was his contention, and I hope that by his vote on this item he will show that he is still of that opinion. When I spoke on the general question, I referred at some length to agricultural implements,, and do not propose to go over the same ground again. I wish to give some figures, however, in answer to the honourable member for Dampier. refer to him specifically, because he is the only honourable member who has yet spoken on this item. He has, of course, a right to his own opinions, and I am sure he is perfectly honest in his convictions; but I cannot'see how he can represent the interests, or voice the true opinions, of the man on the land, when he says'that the interests of the primary producers are best served by doing something that will, kill the local market.",48
296,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,He did not say that.  the honourable member proposes would have the effect of leaving the primary producers at the mercy of a foreign monopoly.,49
297,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"^He does not propose to do so.  effect of what the honourable member advocates would, be to leave the primary producers of Australia at the mercy of the worse Combine of all, the one we cannot touch or deal with, and that is the overseas Combine.",49
298,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Not a bit of it . showed that the agricultural implement manufacturers here have flourished under a low Tariff.  figures I have here prove anything, they will prove the very opposite. The contention of honourable members in the. Comer is that the duty on agricultural implements is passed on to the farmer. The whole history of fiscalism in this and every other country goes to demonstrate the very opposite. I am not going to quote interested bodies. I have doue the honest thing by taking the price-lists. On 1st September, 1920, the Massey-Harris Company, an importing firm, quoted in their own price book the 6-ft. reaper and binder for delivery in 1921 at each. On the 21st September, 1920, MCKay Harvester Company announced Tariff. that they were making reapers and binders locally, and quoted the 6-ft. machine at £95 cash. On 21st February, 1921, the Massey-Harris Company issued a new price-list, in which they quoted the 6-ft. reaper and binder at £101 cash. There is a difference of £24. The only reason why they did that was because the implement was produced locally, and the I local competition forced them to reduce their price to the primary producer by that amount. Nothing could persuade me that, but for the local competition in this article, the Australian farmer would not be still paying that extra £24. I cannot see how the production of the article locally can be to the detriment of the man on the land. If it were, I would not be advocating it, but the whole history of Protection goes to demonstrate that it is to his benefit, and not to his detriment. The instance I have given is a complete answer to the argument that the duty is passed on to a farmer.",49
299,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Is that why they removed the duty on agricultural implements in the TJnited States of America?  dealing with Australia. Here is a set of facts about what has happened at our own doors. Instead of honourable members in the Corner being able to explain it away they call attention to other countries, and ask if that is why something else was done elsewhere. Why not get right down to tin-tacks, and deal with the question at issue here? We are concerned with I Australia. I will give another interesting statement from a price-list. It is not a statement from an interested firm like the Massey-Harris Company. When the honourable member . for Dampier was speaking, he told me that he was quoting from a document supplied to him from that company. We ought to have something more than that. It should be backed up by the price-list, at all events, but this was not done. I have here another printed price-list which was given to me. It shows that the pre-war price (1st June, 1913) for the 6-feet reaper and binder was £39, and the post-war price (1st February, 1920) £77 10s., an increase of 98J per cent.",49
300,Mr GREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"At the end of the year £125 the price was increased to £98.  that is so. The pre-war price for the - S-feet reaper thresher was £135, and the post-war price £204, representing an increase of 51 per cent., while the pre: war price of the 15-hoe grain and fertilizer drill was £38, and the post-war price £57 2s. 6d., an increase of 50 per - cent. We might very well ask ourselves why in the one case was there an increase of approximately 100 per cent, and in the other an increase of only 50 per cent., because during that period the duty was not altered. There was a revenue duty of only 5 per cent, on reapers and binders, and a protective duty on reaper threshers and drills.",49
301,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The price of reapers and binders increased because there was no competition, and every - farmer requires them.  orable member for Wakefield has supplied the answer. The importers of reapers and binders were able to put up the price nearly 100 per cent, for the simple reason that there was no competition in - Australia. Therefore, there is nothing in the contention of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that the duty caused the increase in price, because Teaper threshers and drills, which are on the protected list, advanced only 51 per cent.",50
302,Mr CHARLTON,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"And if they are put on the free list they will go up 100 per cent., too.  There is no necessity at all to enter into a labyrinth of figures to elaborate this argument; The comparisons I have been able to make furnish an unanswerable argument, showing that as soon as the - local industry is destroyed the primary producers of this country will be at the mercy of an overseas Combine ",50
303,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member for Dampier was not arguing that we - should leave the farmers at the mercy of a Combine.  that would be the effect of the policy advo4-Fuxrow-Diso Plough cated by the members of the Corner party. I propose now to deal with the comparison of New Zealand and Australian prices made by the honourable member for Dampier, and ih this connection I intend again to quote, not as the honourable member for Dampier did, fromfiguressupplied by the interested manufacturers, but from the price lists. I may add that this is not the kind of Tariff I want. I want the New Protection, under which we could control local prices, but, like other members of my party, I have to choose between this Tariff, which represents the Old Protection, and a Free Trade policy. The onlyfiguresthat are of any value at all in connection with this matter are to be found in the price lists, upon which the farmer would buy, and if the figures which I have are right, then those supplied by the honourable member for Dampier must be wrong. These are New Zealand prices under Free Trade conditions- 1915. 1921. Increase. £ s. d. £ s. d. Fer cent. 1-Furrow Disc Plough 21 15 0 42 10 0 126 2-Furrow Diso Plough 23 0 0 52 10 0 128 3-Furrow Disc Plough 27 10 0 62 10 0 127 4-Furrow Disc Plough 32 0 0 72 10 0 126J Honourable members will see that, in the course of six years, the price went up nearly 130. per cent. If there was anything at all in the Free Trade doctrine, such an advance would have been impossible. If we were not able to contrast those figures with the Australian position under Protection, it might be contended that the increase was due to enhanced cost of production, higher wages, and dearer materials; but I have been able to make a comparison between New Zealand aind Australian prices for the same class of implement. The following are the figures for Australia, under Protection1915. 1921. Increase. £ 8. d. £ a. d. Fer cent. 1-Furrow Disc Plough 15 10 0 26 10 0 71 2-Furrow Disc.

I notice that he did not quote Argentine prices, although Argentine, like New Zealand, is a Free Trade country. In 1913, the 6-feet Sunshine harvesters were quoted at £8'S in Australia, and £165 in the Argentine, and the 8-feet harvester, in Australia, £ 1 1 3 ; Argentine, £ 1 8 7 . I come now right down to 1920. and I find that, in Australia, under Protection, the American 9-feet reaper thresher was priced at £250, while in the Argentine, under Free Trade, it was £380.",50
304,Mr GBEGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Do you say it was the same class of machine?  was made by the same company.,51
305,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It was not an enginedriven machine.  stand it was the same machine. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) will correct me if I am wrong. I believe the Minister had something to say in reply to a letter which appeared in the Melbourne press, signed by a person styling himself "" Facts, not Fiction.""",51
306,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It was exactly the same machine.  so; and I think the Minister's statement showed that the letter contained more fiction than fact. I hope that before the debate concludes the honourable member for Dampier will take the opportunity of substantiating the figures he has quoted. Mr RICHAR D FOSTEB - The honourable member is quoting a machine without engine, and the honourable member for Dampier quoted one with engine.  quoting the same machine as the honourable member for Dampier quoted. I have tons of other figures of the same purport as those I have already submitted to the Committee, but I have quoted enough to convince every open-minded, person that the argument that Protection increases the price of an article is an absolute myth. And I say, with all due respect to honourable members of the Country party, that they are not voicing the opinions of the thinking farmer when they use that argument. I cannot imagine the farmers, who are amongst the most intelligent section of the community, agreeing with any proposal which would be detrimental to local in dustries. It is of the utmost importance to them that industries should be built up in Australia. The trouble, in the past, has been that the secondary industries have been confined to the cities; they should be spread throughout the Commonwealth. Apar t from that, the best market the man on the land can have is the home market. Nine out of ten men on the land will agree with that contention.",51
307,Mr FLEMING,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"If they do not have to pay too much to get it .  aspect does not enter into this argument. The home market must be destroyed if we are to introduce in Australia the conditions that obtain in New Zealand and Argentine. The figures I have quoted from the price-lists, if they do not lie, prove that under a sound system of Protection the man on the land gets the cheaper article. At the same time, be is deriving advantage from a good home market, with his customers at his own door, and he is freed from the operations of the overseas combines, with which he cannot get into touch. If he has to choose - between the two systems that are offered to him , the sensible farmer will say, "" Give me the industry built up in my own country and under the control of our own people, and do not leave me to the mercy of oversea combines that exploited me in the past, and will do so again if they can destroy local competition.""",51

I do not think there is one honourable member in this chamber who does not desire to see local industries built up and Australia made great.

I would not like to see our own k it h and k in walking the streets in idleness while we are purchasing the goods of the importer. No member of the Country party advocates that.

It depends on what the home market means, and the price ruling The ruling price of wheat in Australia is world's parity; in other words, the amount the farmer receives for the wheat consumed within Australia is no greater than the amount 'he receives for wheat sold overseas.

The principle of protecting manufacturers and their workmen from the operation of world's parity, the very with you in that. law which honourable members insist upon the primary .producer obeying. They mand that the primary producer's wages shall be fixed, not at a special rate in Australia, but at what he can get for his produce in the markets of the world, less the highest ocean freights in the they speak. world. How often have we heard from many a platform of the unfairness of pecting white men to compete with cheap coloured labour?

In reply, I desire to say a word or two from the point of view of the wage-earner outback, who works, not forty-four hours a week, but sixty-six, and often more, and who does not receive double pay for holidays and Sundays. Honourable members opposite talk about the high price of wheat, but I ask them what would be the price of wheat if the primary producers worked only eight hours per day, and received double pay for holidays and for the labour of pickling wheat at night and carting water on Sundays?",52

The wonderful unanimity now being displayed between representatives of city workers and representatives of the employers is rather interesting, but i be equally interesting to watch, when than Tariff goes through, who will get the bigger share of the bone.

The vote given only the other day upon the duty on wire netting was a distinct blow at every man and woman out-back. There are no better citizens in Australia than those men and women, and what is their reward for going into the back country, and opening up new land? Their reward is to live under the worse conditions with the worse railway services, the worse postal and medical facilities, and the worse means of educating their children. They are asked to work the longest hours for the least return of any section of the community. Why should the best citizens of the country suffer the worse conditions? It is up to this Parliament to ascertain the reason for this. If any proposal is on foot to cut down hours, and increase wages, let a start be made in the country districts. At least, let these improved conditions apply all round. The city end is not where a start should be made. The duties proposed in this schedule are not in the interest of the primary producers. The members of the Country party are not advocates for Pree Trade, but their belief is that the existing duties on agricultural machinery are quite sufficient. At any rate, they have proved to be sufficient up to date, and our manufacturers have flourished under them. Not one honourable member has endeavoured to show that the local agricultural implement makers are losing ground. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that their establishments are larger today than they have ever been, but it seems to me that the larger they grow the bigger is their appetite for protective duties. I suppose that in a year or two we shall have another Tariff brought down proposing still higher duties. Tonight, in a few minutes, duties have been agreed to, and not one honourable member opposite was in attendance.  member is well aware that the Sydney express was delayed for four hours.",53
327,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I am aware of that fact; but other honourable members oppomatter site did not come over from Sydney toafter day.' Honourable members have allowed duties to be passed as if they had no gard for the importance of the business before the Committee.,54
328,Mr FENTON,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The honourable memto ber's facts are wrong. Not one duty has been agreed to at this sitting. [366],54
329,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am merely drawing attention to the fact that honourable members seem to be getting tired of the Tariff discussion. Evidently those of us who are endeavouring to put a brake on the fiscal madness displayed by the majority of honourable members, are wasting their time and their breath. I do not suppose I have changed one vote by the few remarks I have made, but I have risen to put forward, as well as I can, a plea for the men and women of the outback. I do not propose to give any figures to the Committee. The case for our party has been put so well by the Deputy Leader (Mr Gregory) that I need not elaborate on his arguments. I simply lay down the principle that, if honourable members are anxious to give protectionist prices to the workers of the city, they should also give them to the men and women out-back. If they want a forty-four hours' week for the city workers, let them give a forty-four hours' week to the men in the back country.",54

333,Mr STEWART,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"In regard to dumping, the Minister (Mr Greene) has promised us something which is rather nebulous. He tells us that a Board will be appointed tc safeguard people In the Commonwealth against being exploited by the loeal manufacturers. If the duties are too high, the Board, he says, will act as a brake upon the local manufacturers and will review ithe rates. I argue the from the other direction. If , the passing of this Tariff, an Australian manufacturer can come forward reand prove, by producing his books, that he is being unfairly and unjustly treated by the dumper overseas, I am prepared give him a reasonable duty. But the local manufacturer, who has an obsolete plant, and who has not adopted up-to-date business methods in controlling his lishment, who gets a few members of Parpre-eminently liament together, and has a deputation to our genial friend, the Minister for and Customs, to ask for an increase duty, instead of seeking to place ness on a proper footing or obtaining an up-to-date plant, will have no support from me.

The statements of the last speaker (Mr taxed than our farmers. Stewart) were wide of the issue at present before the Committee, and, I think, have been fully answered by what has fallen from other speakers. I have already set out the view, which I hold very strongly, that the primary producer derives much general benefit from the establishment of industries in the country. For the honourable member for Wimmera and his party to say, "" We beindustry has progressed ? * lieve in the "" protection of and development of Australian industries,"" and at the same time, in regard to the machinery and implements which the farmer requires, to object to any but duties which do not protect, and to strive for the highest possible duties on our prifacturers. mary products is illogical. I believe in Protection, but I believe in applying i round. Where we can give the primary producer direct protection, I am in favour of doing so.

For one thing, he is relieved of much of the burden of taxation which would fall on his shoulders were not the taxable area increased by the establishwhich estabment of industries.

There is not a machine imported into this country for that purpose was not originally invented and designed in Australia. That is a fact upon which Australians have every reason to pride themselves.,55
346,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,The Minister is a little overstating the case.,56
347,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I have here set out the history of the development of these machines, and I shall quote some of it to let honourable members know what they, owe to the agricultural implement makers of this country and to the Australian workmen associated with them. The first successful stripper-harvester was invented in 1884, and patented in 18S5, by Australians. There had previously been attempts to devise a machine that would perform in one operation the whole work of taking off the grain and making it ready for market, but it was not t ill 1885 that a machine was produced in any country to fill these conditions. As the Australian stripper-harvester worked satisfactorily, it sold well when the growers realized its efficiency, and appreciated the immense reduction its use meant in the expense of harvesting. During the first fifteen years, comparatively slow progress was made, but the prejudices disappeared during that time. In 1900, the combined harvester, as it was then styled, was generally, if not universally, recognised to be the most efficient and economical machine for taking off the crop. Then the Americans took a hand. During 1900 and 1901 sample combined harvesters were purchased in Australia by the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company, both North American Combines. These machines were used as models for imitation, and both companies embarked in the manufacture of them on a large scale. They shipped considerable numbers of these imitations to Australia for sale. It was the only country using such machines. There was no demand for them in America at that time. Meanwhile, several Australian firms had gone into the manufacture of harvesters, but the wealth and weight of organization on the part of the American companies made the competition too. severe for them. Wellknown makers, such as James Martin and Company, Gawier, South Australia; Nicholson and Morrow, Melbourne; and Henderson Brothers, of Corowa, and other makers,, were forced out of the harvester business. In the Australian com[366]- 2 bined harvester there were embraced some features that were in the original stripper invented by Ridley, of South Australia, about seventy years ago. The .principal of these was the combination of a stripping comb and revolving beater, by which the ripe heads of grain were taken off the standing crop and threshed. During the past twenty years many experiments were made in various parts of the Commonwealth, with the object of developing machines which would do the same work in different ways. Among many abortive attempts, one change emerged, which met with a measure of acceptance. This was the adaptation of the binder knife and reel with the stripping comb to take off the heads, instead of doing the work with the comb and beaters. The list in the Commonwealth Patent Ofiice shows that patent rights were taken out by the Australians referred to as follows:-No . 2202/04, J. L . Smith, North Melbourne, 24th December, 1904; No. 4394/05, Matthew Wm. Charlton, of Newport, Victoria; and Douglas East Chapman,, of Ascot Vale, Victoria, 19th October, 1905. Honourable members will notice that in this instance the Australian inventors were responsible for a further improvement in this particular type of machine. The patent rights which embodied the inventions of Charlton and Chapman were bought up by the MasseyHarris Company, who employed the inventors to construct a trial machine in Melbourne, which was duly tested and then taken to the works in Canada. Its manufacture was entered upon and under the name of the "" Reaper Thresher "" was offered for sale in Australia in 1911-12. The Australian manufacturers were actively working also, but not having the vast selling organizations of the American firms, they at first made small headway with this type of machine. But a novel and important improvement in the method of taking off the heads was invented and patented by Hedley Shepherd Taylor, of Henty, New South Wales (under patents dated 22nd October, 1913, and numbered 10989). While retaining the comb of the harvester and the knife of the binder, he dispensed with the binder reel. This reel, which swept back the ears - of grain from the comb, was replaced by a double disc spiral, which forced the heads from the knife to the elevator. The elevator conveyed them to the threshing drum. Among many useful novelties on the machine, these formed the most striking departure from recogcharges nised practice. Mr H . V. MCKay, was approached by Taylor, recognised the possibilities of the invention, after securing the patent rights, once proceeded to develop the machine. It was placed in the harvest field, and and over again. proved a success. The marked advantage of the spiral conveyor, was specially manifest in "" rescue work."" In dealing with lodged, i.e., storm-laid crop, where tangled masses of ears and straw were flattened to the earth, this new machine achieved what seemed impossible. If ducer. they were not so fully attested, its performances would be incredible. Unthe seasonable storms visited the areas of New South Wales and South Australia. Coming just about harvest time, the rain and wind laid flat the heavy in many hundreds of fields. The grain appeared to be lost beyond any chance of recovery; in fact, in some cases, surance was paid on the crops. The grain was retrieved, however, with little waste, if any. This new machine, equipped with a crop-lifting attachment tural machinery. designed and made : in the Sunshine works, was found equal to the task, and yields of 12 to 15 bags per acre were safely garnered in cases where the owners had given up hope of reaping even a bushel. It was in connection disastrous storms that the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dunn, was moved to make the doleful statement during last harvest season that 5,000,000 bushels of wheat had been lost. But for the work of the new machine this might have been verified, but wherever this' machine was used it rescued fallen grain, and the actual loss probably did not amount to 1,000,000 bushels.",56
348,Mr RIOHAED FOSTEB,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,It was worse than that in 1915-16.,57
349,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am speaking of last year, and am endeavouring to impress upon the Committee that i been for the development of these machines with the crop-lifting which was designed in Australia, millions of bushels of wheat would have been to the primary producer.",57

[REPRESENTATIVES.] difference. I imagine that the sources which the honourable member for Dampier acknowledged were the same as those from which the Argus got information some time ago, to which I replied in the columns of that newspaper. To my communication the Argus had no other reply than to simply say that I was a ""bumptious individual."" There has never been any answer to the reply which I sent to the Argus on that occasion. Why? They could not answer it, because the information given to the Argus from that particular source, directly or indirectly, was false information. It was information which it was perfectly easy for me, with the resources at my disposal, to show was false. I do not know whether the prices, as stated by the honourable member for Dampier, are accurate or not, but there is certainly no question at all as to the prices in Australia and in New Zealand at the time the Tariff was tabled. We had the prices then in our hands, and could compare them. There was no question then as to the position. As I have already stated, I have here a list of eighty different items, and in every case at that time the New Zealand price was higher than the Australian price. In some cases it was very much higher; in some cases it was only a few shillings higher; but in no case was it lower than the Australian price. In connection with every one of these items, there was no duty on the article in New Zealand. There was a duty imposed on every one of them in Australia. It varied. In some cases it was 5 per cent. I speak of reapers, binders, and mowers. Oh hay rakes it was 10 per cent., on grain fertilizer drills it was 30 per cent., on spring tooth cultivators it was 25 per cent., on maize cultivators 25 per cent., on maize drills 30 per cent., on disc harrows, diamond harrows, spring tooth harrows, and on various kinds of ploughs, including gang ploughs, four-furrow ploughs, disc ploughs, and so on, there was a duty in Australia of 25 per cent. I do not propose to read the whole of this list of items to the Committee, as it is a very long one, but I shall quote a few of them to show that there is no question as to what the prices were at the time this Tariff was tabled.",58

365,Mr GEEENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I cannot say whether that is so or not. At the time the Tariff was tabled, I got out this list of items, and in the case of every one of them the price in New Zealand was higher than the price in Australia notwithstanding the fact that there was a duty on the article here. Eor reapers and binders, 5 feet, the cash price in New Zealand was £76, and the price in Australia was £75 10s., with a duty of 5 per cent, on the article.

366,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Price s in New Zealand today are much higher than those the honourable gentleman is quoting.,59
367,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I think I must have made it quite clear that I am quoting the prices at the time, the Tariff was tabled. I have not made these comparisons since that time.

382,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Fourtee n pounds.,60
383,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"That would represent a duty of about 6 per cent. That is the the rate which the honourable member suggests should be imposed with a view to encouraging the manufacture of agricultural machinery in this country. I think that the honourable member must stand amazed than at his own modesty. Why dpes he not suggest the imposition of a duty of either or 2 per cent. ? Either would be equally effective as a small revenue duty. If such a perduty were levied, we should probably only succeed in enabling the foreigfemanufacturer to further dump his products into are this country for the purpose of crushing the local industry, and afterwards of charging the Australian farmer just whafc price he pleased.",60
384,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"A 40 per cent, duty is a pretty stiff one.",60
385,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"It is. But we have to remember lhat the manufacture of purreaper threshers is comparatively a new honindustry. This machine was invented by brains, and what has been to done to improve it outside of Australia is the result of copying what had .been done in this country. I believe that it is for us to secure the industry for The duties which matwe propose are, in the circumstances, those which are required, and their imposition will result in these machines being actually - made pcheaperto; the. ^consumers:: than would otherwise, ba the case.",60

' Mr > STEWART (Wimmera) [10.6] The Minister (Mr Greene) has made one or two observations on this and the previous item to which I 'should like to briefly reply. The rather sneering charge has been made that a section of the primary ' producers are advocating Protection for themselves, with Free Trade for the rest of the community. My.reply to that frequent accusation is that the producers have, 'as it were, had Protection forced down their throats, and they insist that if certain secticms of the community are to have ""protective duties, they themselves may as well have ""a cut."" The inference of such remarks'as those of the Minister is that we are reaching out for protective duties, whilst seeking to prevent others having what we desire ourselves. Tbis I emphatically deny.

397,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.9] - As I explained before, this is one of the deferred duties, depending on whether the industry is established. However, I have no objection, if the honourable mem1 ber for Dampier (Mr Gregory) would prefer to alter the date from 1922 to 1923, though this duty will not be imposed unless the industry is definitely established to such an extent as to reasonably be able to supply Australian requirements.",63
398,Mr GREGORY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,I have no intention of moving an amendment.,63
399,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I only wish to make it quite clear that this is a deferred duty, placed in the Tariff as the definite promise of Parliament to anybody who establishes the industry; it means nothing more.",63

Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [10.11] - I intended to rise before the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) spoke, and it was that ""poor widow woman"" that I wished to speak of. There have been no profiteers like the exploiters of sewing machines in Australia in the last few years. The metalwork in the very best sewing machine, with all the inflated prices due to the war, is worth about £5, but with a little cabmetmaking thrown in they charge from £17 to £20 for it. If , thirty-five years ago, a duty had been placed on sewing machines in Victoria to encourage their local manufacture, as was then proposed, we should have been getting them for £10 or £12 each. As it is, they have, this market on their own, and have exploited the people of Australia. We have had the values of these machines explained to us time after time by those associated with their manufacture, and we know that what I am saying is a fact. In those days it was not the "" poor widow woman,"" but the poor seamstress that waspleaded for. The Free Traders pictured in harrowing terms the position of the poor seamstress in Australia, who had io work from the first thing in the morning till the last thing at night by candlelight, and the injustice of taxing the sewing machine by which she earned her living.",63
401,Mr ROBERT COOK,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"And now we are taxing her candle, too.",63
402,Mr MATHEWS,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"I am pleased te see this duty included in the schedule, but £2 10s. is not enough, though it is a start. I am sure that the manufacture of sewing machines would be undertaken properly in Australia if a decent opportunity were offered. As in the case of the wheelbarrow, there is nothing much ingenious> about the machine. The metalwork is all cast, and there are no great engineering difficulties associated with it. There is nothing in it but what can be made in Australia. If we cannot get new patents we should compel Singers and Wertheims to come here and manufacture their machines locally, instead of bringing them out in pieces and assembling: them here. I believe that hundreds of thousands of pounds might have been saved to Australia long ago and another industry established, by means of a duty on this item. Item agreed to.

408,Mr FOLEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Kalgoorlie) [10.15] The articles enumerated in . this item affect mining, which is one of those industries that have done a great deal towards the development of every other occupation in Australia. Every duty put on the machinery used in that industry means practically an impost on the industry itself. During the past five years it has had many imposts put upon it. Not only will it have to stand any increases in the Tariff, hut it has had to bear, in almost every instance, the extra cost imposed upon it by the conditions existing now as compared <with the pre-war period. There is not an article used in mining which has not shown a rise in price to the extent of at least 25 per cent, since 1914, whilst in some cases the price has increased ten or twelvefold. Mining, at present, needs the greatest protection that Australia can give it.",64
409,Mr BRENNAN,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Hav e you not found that the duties decrease the price?,64
410,Mr FOLEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"No . All the articles covered by sub-items A to p have increased in price. The duties on them have been raised, and that increase must be passed on, first of all, to the mineowner, then through the mine-owner to the workman in the mine, and then through him to the industry. I shall not say, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) does, that I do not care a jot for the manufacturer or the mine-owner. I do care for the mine-owner, and I care also for the men working in the mines and for the mining industry itself. If there were no men to put capital into mines, we should have no mining industry, and there would be no scope for miners to work. No man in that industry, whether employer or employee, begrudges any one doing well, beper cent.; cause a man working in the mines today might be a mine-owner tomorrow. I represent one portion of the mining industry, where the best possible conditions have been created by co-operation between employer and employed. The conditions were not changed until some one altogether outside the mining industry took action.",64

412,Mr FOLEY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member, I believe, was going to give every one in Kalgoorlie a brick house to live in, but the houses they have at present suit them much better. No doubt the honourable member thinks that, because he was over there during an election campaign, he knows all about Kalgoorlie, though I suppose he did not go outside the main street. I speak from a life-long connection with the mining industry in Kalgoorlie. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has expressed his indifference as to its future, but I can assure him that if this impost is placed upon the industry, it cannot be carried on much longer. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) has said, there are, on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields, men, who intend to remain there as long as there is gold to be won.",64

A littl e while ago, However, I received letter from Western Australia about metal industry was concerned. which I asked the Minister (Mr Greene) a' question, and instead of answerand ing it for t h with , ' he asked give notice of it : I now enter my .protest against an outside authority l i k e ' the Australian Metal Exchange being given administrative, control the export of metals from this country. I do not know what powers this organizaa tion has been endowed with, but I draw the attention.of the Minister to the lowing complaint contained . in a letter received by me from Messrs. Paterson & sary be done by' your Department with- Company Limited , of Perth. They saySome time ago we understood that metals, especially lead, could be snipped without a permit. . . .' Last week we received an order for 2 tons from Java, and there was a boat going out the following day, but before were able to ship we were asked for our perment over which I preside. mit, as the authorities had no advice being allowed to be exported. This meant that we lost the opportunity of shipping. Apparently they had not made applicatralia. tion to the Australian Metal Exchange not for a permit. I do not know under authority the Minister insists-if he insist-that any persons exporting metals from this country must obtain a permit and give full particulars in regard to the sale and the - place . of export. It is an extraordinary thing that' exporters should have to give this .'small organization in Melbourne full information about the disposal of their products. I wish to know from the Minister if it is neeessary, when metals are being sent out of the country, that full information about the transaction shall be given .to the Australian Metal Exchange, and' .a permit obtained from that body. If so, by what authority does Che Minister allow this organization to control exportation 1",67
432,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.53] - The honourable member mentioned this.matter' to ma some days ago, and I - must plead guilty to having forgotten it , having been much - engaged with ' other .business. Therefore, I have not had an opportunity to look into the facts. The position in regard to the exportation of metals is not exactly what the honourable member it to be. . It is common knowwe had ledge that, at the outbreak of the war Australia, in common with the rest of the world, was in the hands of a great a German Combine^ so far as her base Steps were taken to break down that Combine, to deal with the difficulties which its me to existence had created. Now, although there is free exportation of metals, we are keeping' a register-and shall do so for some time-of the movements of bur of metals, so that we may know where they go, and what'becomes of them. There is possibility of other combinations being formed, and of our base metal industry folagain passing into: foreign hands.",67
433,Mr GBEOOBY,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,Canno t what is necesv out requiring all the particulars of sale?,67
434,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXCHANGE AN D DUMPING,"The honourable member has suggested that it is the Australian Metal Exchange that grants permits for exportation, but that is not so. These we permits are granted only by the DepartThey are of it granted on the condition that the exporters register the channel through which the metals are to pass out of AusSo far as I know, we do ask for particulars as to the what price at which metals are sold, but does we insist on knowing their destination. That is all the information that is required - As the Australiau Metal Exchange was in existence, the Government thought that it would save) expense in getting it to keep this registration instead of doing it ourselves. If the honourable member desires, I shall look into the matter further, and see whether, without great additional expense, the whole business can be kept in the hands of the Government.",67
