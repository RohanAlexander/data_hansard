(2) That while there is a need to establish in Australia a Natural Disaster Fund to provide compensation for property damage and other losses resulting from disasters such as earthquakes, floods and cyclones, such a Fund can be established, as in other countries, using the medium of the existing private enterprise insurance offices. (3) That a plan for such a Fund was submitted to the Treasury in October 1974. (4) That no sound reasons for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) has been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the existing 43 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia, and that further competition from a Government Office would be harmful at this time. (6) That the insurance industry is already coping with (a) the effects of inflation, (b) increased taxation on Ufe assurance offices, (c) the effects of recent natural disasters, (d) other legislative measures already in train or in prospect by the Government, e.g. the National Compensation Bill, a National Superannuation Plan and improved Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation.

3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yesterday the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) raised a matter in the House relating to privilege and I undertook to give a ruling on it at the earliest time, after having made a judgment on whether the matter is of such significance that it should receive precedence over other business of the House. The Leader of the House raised the matter, feeling Radio 2JJ that the articles represented an attack on honourHouse able members and was a grave reflection on the of House itself. These indignities are referred to in North May's Parliamentary Practice on page 143. However, the only pertinent references which I have been able to find in the articles are: Politicians and pubUc servants are behaving like a lot of spoiled brats because they have been told they can no longer travel first class when they go by air. and to bring this matter to the atten(Politicians and senior public servants) 'are clearly more concerned about pampering their own egos than they are about eliminating wasteful expenditure'. Whilst these statements are unwarranted, extravagant and to be deprecated, in the context of Press reporting these days I doubt whether they are of such a serious nature as to warrant action by this House. Turning now to the publication of an alleged statement by the Leader of the House- a statement which the Leader describes as false- I think the House would agree that such wilful publication is damaging to the integrity of the person concerned and constitutes a serious infringement of his rights. Because it is not concerned with the actual business of the House, I feel that the pubUcation by the newspapers of such a report cannot be brought within the ambit of parliamentary privilege, but I am sure all honourable members would condemn this type of article. In the circumstances I am of opinion that the matter raised should not be accorded precedence over other business. NA NA NA",20
4,Mr FAIRBAIRN,HOUSING CORPORATION,"Is the Prime Minister aware that on Tuesday two of his Ministers were asked an almost identical question on the undertaking given to the Returned Services League that there would be an RSL nominee on the board of the Australian Housing Corporation? Is he aware that Senator Cavanagh said, and I quote from Hansard: PRIVILEGE I believe an undertaking was given by a previous Minister that there would be a representative of the RSL on such a body. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development said: At no time was there any comment by the GovernmentAgain, I am quoting from Hansard",20
5,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING CORPORATION,Order! The honourable gentleman is not in order in quoting from Hansard. I suggest he refer to what the Ministers said.,21
6,Mr FAIRBAIRN,HOUSING CORPORATION,"I am sorry. The Minister said that at no time was there any commitment by the Government to the RSL. I ask the Prime Minister Which Minister was correct? Will the Prime Minister please ensure in future that we get the same answer from his Ministers, even if it is the wrong one?",21
7,Mr WHITLAM,HOUSING CORPORATION,"I did hear my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development answer a question on this matter. I was not aware of a question having been asked of Senator Cavanagh on it. I do remember that when the Australian Housing Corporation Bill was being handled by the previous Minister for Housing and Construction he made a statement on this matter in the House. I have had a look at correspondence between him and the National Secretary of the RSL. The correspondence referred to a servicemen's consultative and advisory committee. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development, who now has responsibility for the Australian Housing Corporation, has also under consideration the appointment of consultative panels or a consultative panel for the Corporation. The matter came to my notice when the National Secretary of the Returned Services League wrote to me on 18 June. I wrote back to him on 15 July. He sent a letter of appreciation for my reply on 21 July. I think that it might help honourable gentlemen if I ask for leave to have the letter I wrote to the National Secretary of the RSL incorporated in Hansard.",21
8,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING CORPORATION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)Dear Mr Keys, Thank you for your letter of 18 June 1975 concerning appointments to the Board of the Australian Housing Corporation. I very much regret any misunderstanding which may have arisen over this matter. At the outset, I can assure you that the fact that a representative of the Returned Services League has not been appointed to the Board of the Corporation in no way involves any diminution in the respect in which the Government holds the Returned Services League and the many Australians it represents. As you pointed out in your letter, there has been a historic link between the RSL and the Defence Services Homes Division. You may be assured that considerable importance is attached to maintenance and development of the Defence Services Homes Scheme as an integral and major part of the task of the Corporation. I beheve that the housing benefits which have been introduced by my government under the Defence Service Homes Scheme since December 1972, are indicative of the importance that the Australian Government attaches to this aspect of its policy initiatives. I understand that it is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, to set up a consultative panel or panels representing the special interest groups affected by the Corporation's activities and this matter is currently under consideration by the Corporation. I feel sure that my colleague will wish to consult the League as a matter of pnority. WhUe I have not been able to meet the specinc request you have put to me, I should mention that the legislation specifies the circumstances in which a casual vacancy in the Corporation can arise and that in such an event the question of representation by the RSL would again be examined. I am attaching for your information a copy of a statement outlining benefits which the Australian Government has provided to housing for servicemen and ex-servicemen since December 1972. Yours sincerely, E. G. Whitlam Mr A. G. W. Keys, OBE., M.C, National Secretary, The Returned Services League of Australia, P.O. Box 303, CANBERRA CITY, ACT. 2601 NA NA DECEMBER 1972 One of the first steps taken after the Labor Government came to office in December 1972 was to carry out a comprehensive review of the then War Service Homes Scheme. The major changes which were made following this review were the most significant since the enactment of the original legislation in 1918. A further comprehensive review was made prior to the 1974-75 Budget and it was decided to make a number of additional major changes to improve the borrowing arrangements and scope of the Scheme. The following is a summary of the changes which have been implemented since 2 December 1972: Extension of Eligibility The categories of persons eligible for benefits under the Defence Service Homes Scheme were extended to include: . (a) Members of the Forces on continuous full-time service on or after 7 December 1972 who, whether before or after that date, complete three years' effective full-time service. 15 July 1975 (b) National Servicemen and National Service Officers serving immediately before 7 December 1972, who complete the period of service for which they were engaged to serve. (c) Representatives of approved welfare organisations who, subject to certain conditions, served overseas with the Australian Forces in the 1939-45 War or in subsequent military operations. (d) Single and widowed persons with qualifying service in the Forces. (The removal of the dependency requirement enables full recognition to be given to the principle that Defence Service Homes benefits are not only granted as a measure of repatriation but also as a reward for service). Maximum Loan The maximum lending Umit under the Defence Service Homes Scheme was increased from $9,000 to $12,000 in May 1973 and, in December 1974, the Umit was further increased to $15,000. Deposit Requirements The rninimum deposit required under the Act was reduced to 5 per cent of the purchase price of the home. A discretionary power in the Act to waive the deposit is being exercised more liberally in favour of widowed mothers, seriously incapacitated applicants and others whose family obligations make it difiicult for them to accumulate the normal deposit. Loans for the Discharge of Existing Mortgages Prior to December 1972 it was the general policy not to grant loans for the discharge of private mongages. While it has not been possible to lift restrictions on the provision of assistance for the discharge of existing mortgages, the previous policy has been relaxed and consideration is now given to the granting of loans for this purpose where the terms of the mongage are onerous and having regard to the applicant's income, payment of the commitments under the mortgage is causing serious hardship. In addition, the Act was amended on IS May 1973 to specifically provide for advances to be made to discharge existing mortgages where the applicant is a person entitled to the special rate of pension payable under the first paragraph of the second schedule of the covers totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners.) Assistance in Respect of a Second Home The general intention of the Scheme has always been that an eligible person will be entitled to the benefits of the Scheme on only one occasion and the long standing policy has been to grant assistance in respect of a second home only in circumstances of great emergency. For a number of years strong representations had been received seeking an amendment to the Act to enable loans to be transferred from one home to another where the borrower is compelled to move for medical or employment reasons. After reviewing the matter closely, the Government concluded that there was a need for a more flexible set of arrangements and the Act was amended on 6 December 1974 to include provisions which facilitate the transfer of the balance of an existing loan from circumstances. However approval to transfer a loan will only be given wherethe borrower, for reasons beyond his control, is compelled to move to another home; the applicauon for the transfer of the loan is made before the first home is sold and the liability under the Defence Service Homes Act discharged; the applicant contributes as a deposit on the second home the full net proceeds derived from the sale of the first home. Interest Rate The Government reviewed the interest rate charged in respect of loans made under the Scheme. The rate of 3% per cent per annum had not been changed since it was fixed at that level in 1946 and since risen from 3 per cent to 9!4 per cent per annum. It was decided to retain the rate of 3% percent per annum for all loans up to the previous maximum loan of $ 12,000, and to provide for interest at a rate of 2 per rate charged by the Commonwealth Savings Bank on housing loans, to be charged on the amount of loan in excess of $12,000. Special Arrangements for Persons on Limited Incomes In reviewing the interest rate on Defence Service Homes loans, the Government was concerned that an increase in the interest rate could make it necessaiy to refuse some applications for loans from eligible persons who ordinarily could not meet the obligations of home ownership except under the concessional conditions previously provided in the Defence Service Homes Act. Examples are widows, totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners, persons living on age pensions or small superannuation payments. To enable loans up to the new maximum loan of $15,000 to be granted in those cases, the Government decided that provision should be made in the legislation for a reduction in the instalments otherwise payable in cases where it is established that it would cause hardship to the applicant if he were required to pay in full the amount of the instalments based on the higher rate of interest payable on loan amounts in excess of $12,000. The amount by which instalments are reduced will remain as a charge on the property, but payment will not ordinarily be required while the purchaser or borrower continues to occupy the home, unless there is an improvement in his financial position, which permits him to make increased payments. NA Since the Labor Government took office, activities under the Defence Service Homes Scheme have increased as follows: Repatriation Act. (Broadly this 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 (To 30.4.75) Total number of applications received to purchase or build homes 11 844 15 758 12 265 Total number of applicants assisted to acquire a home 7 884 8851 8 190 Total expenditure on the provision of $ $ $ homes 74,326,455 102,000,000 111,155,529 An amount of $130 million has been provided in the Budget for expenditure on Defence Service Homes in 1974-75. one home to another in special From the inception of the Scheme in 1919 to 30 April 1975, 3S2 187 applicants had been assisted under the Scheme to become home owners and the total expenditure under the Scheme was $ 1,779,231,826. NA A special feature of the Defence Service Homes Scheme is the opportunity to purchase at cost, land or land and a dwelling-house in a Defence Service Homes estate. Upon the Labor Government coming into office, special action was taken to increase the stock of land to meet present and future demand. Land holdings, which at 30 June 1972 were estimated as sufficient to yield 4992 building lots were sufficient at 31 December 1974 to yield 11415 building lots. There are currently 49 Defence Service Homes estates in various stages of planning and development. then the long term bond rate had",21
9,Mr WHITLAM,GROUP HOMES,"I do not know what the objective of honourable gentlemen is in trying to make some great issue over this matter. The cent below the most favourable great issue is that, with the creation of the Australian Housing Corporation, the very great benefits which the old War Service Homes Division was able to give to returned servicemen for some 50 years will be enhanced. The Corporation obviously will have a much greater future than the old War Service Homes Division. I have noticed over the years that a very great number of Liberal members of Parliament have objected to the War Service Homes Division because it was an outstandingly successful socialist enterprise. Ex-servicemen were able to get the best of attention at a minimum of cost. The old War Service Homes Division was not only better than any bank or any building society but also immeasurably better than any insurance company. It also made available for ex-servicemen the services of such skilled people as conveyancers, sohcitors and architects. There was, as I would expect honourable members to have realised, some diminution of morale in the old War Service Homes Division because, with the cessation of overseas wars and the aging of people who had taken part in them, the future of the Division was rninimal. That was one of the reasons why the Australian Government-m y Government-decide d to put the whole of the War Service Homes Division on a much wider basis. We would hope that, in due course, the services which previously were Umited to those who had served overseas on active service will become increasingly available to aU those who fall within the Australian Parliament's jurisdiction. There is no substantial difference opinion between the Returned Services League and the Government on this matter at all. The RSL has acknowledged the fact that conditions of housing for returned men or for serving members are immeasurably better than they were when this Government was elected. NA",22

11,Mr RIORDAN,WELFARE HOUSING,"I can well appreciate the criticise honourable gentleman's concern about the order reports because I suppose that nobody has illusIn trated greater concern for welfare housing he has. If the New South Wales Government were prepared to use in order to omic problems of that State half the energy that it has used in the last 24 hours to misrepresent the effects of the Australian Budget, New South Wales would be a better place in which to Uve. It is difficult to imagine a greater collection drivel and grizzle than we have witnessed so far. The claim by the Minister as reported in the Daily Telegraph, that New South Wales will receive only $90m, is completely false. New South Wales will receive for welfare housing in this financial year an amount of $123,411,000. That is the same as last year. Let us look at what happened in the last full year of Liberal-Country Party rule-1971-72.",23
12,Mr HUNT,WELFARE HOUSING,In real terms.,23
13,Mr RIORDAN,WELFARE HOUSING,"The honourable member can do the calculation in real terms if he likes or in actual terms, but the amount was $55.5m. So the criticism of this Government's provision for welfare housing has come about as a result of an increase of 122 per cent in the amount actually aUocated as compared with 1971-72. In fact, the amount of $123.411m compares very favourable indeed with the amount allocated in the last 3 full years of office of the Liberal-Country Party Government. In those 3 fuU years it was able to muster and allocate $138.55m. Last year the Australian Government advanced amounts to the States for welfare housing that were consistent with their capacity to spend the funds; in other words, every cent that they could spend of was allocated to them. In 1973-74 the New South Wales Government had to carry over an amount of $ 17m which had been allocated for welfare housing because it did not have the capacity or the abiUty to spend it. The amount of $123m is to be spUt up between the Housing Commission of New South Wales and the Home Builders Account. The allocation is a matter to be decided in negotiations between the New South and Wales Minister and myself. The New South Wales Government has over a period oftimethat it has severely the people in need of welfare housing, Wales will receive particularly respect of community services.

Is he aware of Mr Hawke's view that if employment were to increase the Prime Minister should stand ready to bring in supplementary Budget measures? Will the Prime Minister bring down a supplementary Budget if, as expected the President of the ACTU, the unemployment situation does get worse? If the Prime Minister Highway. doubts that I have correctly stated what Mr Hawke has said, I have a transcript of what he did say.",23

I regret seeing the television performance on Tuesday night in which Mr Hawke and, I believe, the Leader of the Opposition featured as, whatever finance. may be the future of Mr Hawke, I have no doubt that he will collaborate with me in ensuring that the Leader of the Opposition remains in his present position.

17,Mr CHARLES JONES,EYRE HIGHWAY,"Recently members matter of my Department had discussions with the printralians. cipals of the Department of Transport in South Australia who advised that they expected to also complete the sealing of the Eyre Highway during 1975-76. There have been some problems with some of the contractors, one of whom had to corporate relinquish his contract which in turn has been taken up by other contractors. So that part of the work is proceeding quite satisfactorily. At moment, apart from the 3 earthwork contractors, the South Australian Highways Department and the contractors who are doing the priming sealing have 6 tankers working on the job.

18,Mr HUNT,THOMAS BARTON,"I ask the Attorney-General: Is it correct that the court in Paraguay which refused extradition of the Bartons did so because it did not consider that the British extradition treaty with Paraguay applied to Australia? Do we rely on British treaties for extradition procedures with a substantial number of other countries? If the Paraguayan decision brings into question extradition arrangements between Australia and other countries, what special steps are being taken to have the Paraguayan court decision reversed or otherwise to overcome this dangerof the expected ous situation?",24
19,Mr ENDERBY,THOMAS BARTON,"I thank the honourable member for the question because it involves a of considerable concern to many AusThe Barton case, of course, highlights not only the difficulties with extradition law but the sorry state of corporate law generally in Australia. I have in mind matters relating to the proposed corporations and securities Bill, the affairs bureaus as they exist in the various States and matters of that sort. It is true in regard to extradition law that Australia still dethe pends in large measure on old treaties, and a consequential element of uncertainty comes into the situation. For some time the Government has and been embarked upon an ambitious program of I negotiating and upgrading the extradition law. anThrough the Department of Foreign Affairs and be my own Department work is in hand on these of our objective to matters. So far as the particular court case is concerned, although it is early days yet it is my understanding, as I indicated to the House yesterday, that an appeal will be lodged and our lawyers in Paraguay, who are versed in Paraguayan law, not Australian law, are optimistic about our chances. I would Uke to make a final point before I sit down. When one thinks of the Barton situation and other situations that were in the news even this morning-Queenslan d Mines Ltd, Nabarlek, Patrick Partners and matters of that sort, all at different levels-w e can only say how lamentable is the Australian legal situation, mented as it is through the various States, each section unable to take care of the situations that can develop at any time and how much we badly need corporations and securities legislation of a kind that we introduced into this Parliament as long as 7 months ago. One could go on and say that the Rae Comdedicated mittee in the Senate sat for 4 years exposing chief and abuse of this sort. My predecessor introduced the Bill into the Senate, I think in sector. December of last year. That Bill went through this House, I think in February, or perhaps ea'rly March, of this year. It is now bogged down in the Senate on the motion of the Opposition parties in the Senate. It does no credit to this Parliament. certainly does no credit to the Liberal Party the National Country Party which must be seen to be opposing reform measures of this sort. It only when we get reform measures of this that abuses of the sort which the honourable member has in mind will become a less frequent feature of the Australian scene.",24

21,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,THOMAS BARTON,Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a statement this morning that adverse community reaction to Tuesday's Budget has been excessive and dangerous? Can the Treasurer say whether the statement refers to a genuine community feeling or to synthetic indignation manufactured by some newspapers and some individuals for party political purposes? Can he say what the dangers are for Australia in conduct of this kind?,25
22,Mr HAYDEN,THOMAS BARTON,"I noted the comment in the newspaper which is not usually regarded as a socialist journal, making this point in defence of the position of this Government. The point is well taken. First of all, much of the indignation and perhaps just about all of it is manufactured. Most of the manufacturing is coming from the benches of the Opposition. I find that rather puzzling because if honourable members opposite were successful in sowing discord and pessimism in the community-that is their purpose because they have only one objective in mind and that is to try to undermine confidence in the community so that hopefully they can capitalise on that for a very narrow, very short time, and very selfish poltiical purposes-the n the corporate sector of the Australian economy would suffer more frag- seriously than any other sector. The corporate sector is showing signs of an early recovery. I have said that many times and I repeat it. We should not try to frighten this development.

Can he compare the increase in payments to the States for which provision is made in the Budget with the increase in Australian Government outlays? Can he say whether there is any justification for the reports?",25
25,Mr HAYDEN,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"There is no justification for the reports. The States have never been better treated financially than they have been under this Government. For instance, this year financial assistance grants to the States will be of the order of $3,185m, an increase of 34 per cent. Additionally, we introduced an improved betterment factor which increased the multiplier for that purpose from 1.8 to 3 per cent. We added $220m to the base grant. But the overall picture is even more generous than that. The estimates for 1975-76 of total funds going to the States from the Australian Government-the y cover capital funds as well as funds for recurrent purposes and include specific grants-sho w that the States will get $8,566m from the Australian Government compared with $6,567m last year, an increase of some $2,000m. That is an increase of a much greater order than the order by which we have increased our outlays of expenditure under the Budget. If one bears in mind that some 25 per cent of our commitment for expenditure in the Budget is for the States one can readily gauge just how generous this Government has been, at some sacrifice to itself, to the States.",26

Who is responsible for this undertaking being sought? Have refugees from any other country coming to Australia ever been asked to sign a similar undertaking?

27,Mr WHITLAM,BUDGET OUTLAYS,"Certain South Vietnamese refugees, quite properly, were required to give such an undertaking. We ought to know from our experience throughout the 1960s that there are very many people on the other side of poUtics, both within the Parliament and outside, who wiU try to exacerbate divisions in the community in the Ught of the Vietnam situation during that period.

They are balked at the fact that this issue is no longer available to them; that the West as a whole, not only in Europe but now also in North America and Oceania, has woken up to the cruel exploitation of the people of Vietnam. There are some people still in Australia who would like to cash in on the consequences of the disastrous policies that previous Australian governments supported in lndo-China. There were a few people-m y memory is that they were mainly diplomats-wh o sought asylum in Australia, and in those circumstances very properly I said that they could have asylum if they undertook not to engage in political activity or aUow themselves to be exploited in poltiical activity.

30,Mr ARMITAGE,BUDGET TAX REFORMS,Has the Treasurer seen reports of a statement yesterday that families deriving benefits from Tuesday's Budget tax reforms are spendthrifts? Can he say what advantage the half a million famUies newly exempted from taxation payments were previously able to gain from the Liberal taxation deduction system? Can he say whether there is any reason why famUies which simply cannot afford large outlays for insurance and school fees should be denied the advantages of tax reform?,26
31,Mr HAYDEN,BUDGET TAX REFORMS,"The Leader of the Opposition has set himself firmly against the redistributional reform effects of the new personal income tax scale. He has established his position in defence of a privileged minority in the community. What he has effectively said is that, given the opportunity, he would prevent the introduction of this personal income tax scheme; he would prefer to persevere with the present system of taxation, with aU its inequities and all its serious defects in administrative and operational respects. He is saying, in effect, that the half a million people who currently pay tax under the present scheme, his who are among the most needy in the comhonourmunity and who would cease paying tax under our scheme, in fact will be forced to continue paying tax if he has his way. He has a rather curious argument to the effect that his defence is in support of the thrifty-thos e who save, those who work hard, those who keep their nose to the grindstone. Surely a marginal tax rate of 35 per cent, for instance, for people with incomes between $5,000 and $10,000 a year, compared with the present rate of between 44c and 48c in the dollar, is an incentive to more industry-if the proposition upon which his assumptions are based is that people work harder if they are given more return for their work. We ought to be clear about the position of the Leader of the Opposition and the philosophical inspiration upon which he proceeds-the very philosophy of objectivism, the Ayn Rand school of thought. That is that man stands alone and stands for himself and to hell with anyone else; that what happens to others is their fault their responsibility. To put it in its simplest form, those who make it in our sort of society should able to hang on to everything they get and if get it from their forebears in the form of a wealthy inheritance, perhaps a large pastoral holding, then the case becomes even more perAustralian suasive. This is a sort of reversion to socialthe country. economic Darwinism. If, on the other hand, they fall flat on their face in the struggle in our sort of system and cannot get up, they have freedomthe Leader of the Opposition is talking about freedoms lately in a rather vague way which in general sense sounds unexceptionable but, if one knows the inspiration that is guiding him, I it is rather exceptionable-and their freedom is stay flat on their face.

32,Mr SINCLAIR,BUDGET TAX REFORMS,"I ask the Prime Minister a question that is a supplementary to the one that was asked of him by the honourable member for Warringah. Was any undertaking required of the Chilean refugees that they should not participate in politics or poltiical discussions in Australia? Has any undertaking similar to that required of refugees from South Vietnam been required of any other category of refugees admitted into Australia since the admission of refugees first began? Does he believe that, as a result of the undertaking given by those of whom he has required that there should be no political involvement, they wiU be second rate Australian citizens in that apparently they are not to be allowed to participate in poltiical affairs in the same way as every other Australian citizen is? Mr WHITLAMThere is no requirement of the character that I earlier described for categories of refugees as a whole. Hundreds of Vietnamese refugees have come to this country. They were in general refugees who were not going to be admitted by any other country in our region. There is only a handful of people who are Vietnamese citizens and who have been required to give the undertaking which I have described. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman is frustrated that he wiU not be able to exploit these people who have given the undertaking unless they break their word of honour. They were, as I say, principally diplomats. They were not and people who would ordinarily have come within any category for admission to Australia, but they be were aUowed in on condition that they gave this they undertaking- a very proper undertaking.

There has been no history of Chilean political activity in this country. I certainly believe that the Chileans who have been given refuge in this country should refrain from poltiical activity as should Ugandans and others. But there has not been a history of Chilean or Ugandan political activity in Australia. There has been a regrettable history for the last 15 years of the exploitation for internal Australian political reasons of the situation in South Vietnam. The honourable gentleman wants to continue to exploit for his poltiical purposes those refugees who have come to Australia as a result of the astrous failure of the poUcies which his Governried ment supported in Vietnam throughout the 1960s.

43,Mr ENDERBY,QUEENSLAND MINES LIMITED,"I have seen the report referred to by the honourable gentleman. Indeed, I referred to it in answering an earUer question. The report is almost a notorious fact in Australian pubUc Ufe these days because it has been the subject of so much comment. I think I heard Senator Rae on the radio program A.M. this morning describing the situation revealed in the report, the conflict of interests, the insider tradsituation ing, the reckless representations made and the opportunity for and abuse of privUege. These have become well known to all honourable members as a feature of that industry to the detriment of many Australians. The report also set out that not only were people being unjustly enriched by abusing their privUege and their position but they were doing so at the expense of ordinary Australian investors who were being defrauded and taken down. I remember the report saying- I am sure Senator Rae said it-that the adverse effects on the capital market of Australia were something that should not be overlooked. It has been said over and over again that Australia needs a single, all-embracing corporwas ations and securities law. One asks: How often are we to hear that said? It is as easy to transfer capital in Australia today as it is to make a teleopinions phone caU. It can go from Sydney to Perth on making of a telephone call. Yet the States persist in their 6 separate puny attempts to regulate these abuses. I have no doubt at aU that in their own minds they concede the futihty of the effort. Yet they oppose this Parliament, this ment putting the situation right or moving in the direction of putting it right. As I said in answer to the earUer question, we introduced into this Parliament the Corporations and Securities Bill in, I think, February or It had previously been introduced into the Senate in December of last year. We are now in August of 1975. It went through this House after a full debate. The Opposition did not move single amendment to the Bill when it was here because it had not really thought out its Yet the Bill had been the subject of close, detaUed, prolonged pubhc discussion and conMinister sultations with the various professional associinformation ations throughout Australia. Representations were received. I have certainly made it clear we are not dogmatic on it as. a piece of legisand lation. We are flexible. We want there law. We have certainly said that we are prepared to consider any reasonable amendment put forward to the Bill. But in the Senate predictably the by the Opposition-the Liberal and National Country Party people who insist upon preserving the present inadequate system-insiste d upon referring the legislation to a Standing Committee, despite the opposition of the Government. The Bill is with the Standing Committee now. It has to be said that, as I understand it, the Standing Committee has barely begun to consider the task and is already asking for an extension oftime.If amendments are to be moved they can be moved and the Government wiU consider them. But this does this Parliament little credit. It does great discredit to the Liberal and National Country Party people for their continued obstinate opposition to measures of.reform of this sort because all it means is that cases like Patrick Partners, Queensland Mines Ltd and the Bartons will be a continual affliction on Australian corporate Ufe for years to come.

49,Mr WILSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes. On Tuesday at question time the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) said that I had suggested an optional preferential voting system in which a voter had 'only to vote on a group basis for one candidate'. I have never advocated or supported such a system. I have proposed a simplified preferential system- a system which would enable the voter who wishes not only to support a particular candidate but also to record his preferences in the manner recommended by that candidate to use a shorthand method of voting. The proposed simplified system of preferential voting would enable a voter to place a No. 1 beside the name of the candidate he most prefers, to have his vote counted and, if necessary, to have his preferences distributed in the recommended manner, without the need to number each square. If a distribution of preferences became necessary the votes of the candidate to whom the No. 1 vote was given would be counted in accordance with the recommendations of the candidate's how to vote card. What I have said is that if the voter wants to record his preference in some other way he should still have the right to do so by placing a number in each square according to his preference, as at present. What I have said is that, in either event, a voter should have the right to vote for an individual candidate. He should not be compelled to vote for a list on an all or none basis. To imply that I would support this form of depersonalization of parliamentary representation is to misrepresent my views.

50,Mr LUCHETTI,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The matter I wish to raise in this debate concerns many Australian citizens who are victims of an unjust system of land valuation as it affects local government ratepayers. The matter has received some attention fromtimeto time and is mainly one which comes within the jurisdiction of State governments. I raise this matter in the House today because I believe it is of very great importance. Perhaps it is a question that could usefully be discussed in conferences between the Australian and State governments. It also might be discussed, to some advantage, at the Constitutional Convention meetings. I ventilate this matter today because the Australian Government has shown initiative in a number of areas and here is another opportunity for the Australian Government to deal with a question. Ratepayers-good s citizens of this country-ar e suffering from an oppressive land valuation system when appUed to the collection of local government rates. The New South Wales Government is unmoved by the burden being borne by some of the nation's best citizens. I make a plea today for thought and consideration to be given to these people who have helped to pioneer our country, have reared famUies and have buUt homes for the purpose of having a place in which to live in the closing period of their lives. Theyfind,unfortunately, that because of the present land valuation system quite frequently rates skyrocket and land values increase as a result of the activities of speculators, developers and others who buy lots of land. This, in turn, affects the people who do not wish to be moved and whose property values remain approximately the same over the years. Honourable members would know that local government rates are based on the unimproved capital value of land. Recent land sales are taken as a measure of the unimproved capital value. I should Uke to point out how injustice is brought to citizens. This affects people in cities, towns and the countryside. No one is exempt from this form of land valuation and rate collection. A particular case which has come to my attention is in the city of Bathurst. Flats were permitted to be buUt in a residential areas in which people had bought or buUt homes so that they might live the rest of their Uves in a decent environment and in the company of friends and relatives. They were disturbed when a developer paid a high price for a property and that high price was translated into the value of all the other properties in that area. I ask honourable members to consider the plight of citizens who had their homes buUt and who have now been shocked to find that the valuations on those homes have increased sharply. The savage rates that have been imposed on them are of such magnitude that they find it almost impossible to pay the rates levied on them. These savage increases in rates ought to be which halted. I believe that action needs to be taken in bought this country at thistimeif the situation is to be purely eased in any fashion at all. I bring to the attention of honourable members a number of cases that have come to my rates notice. The first concerns a valuation in the city of Bathurst which rose from $2,800 to $22,000. which The rates for these ratepayers-mor e than one years was involved-rose from $280.26 to $1,669.30. yond These rates must be paid by pensioners, retired people and those reaching the period of liament retirement. This is an unjust burden. It is an intolerable burden. I feel that parUaments and governments ought to be speaking out about matters of this kind. Through the initiative Government, greater grants are being made local government. But, despite what may be said to the contrary, the situation with respect to rates cannot be overcome merely by the making of grants. These peaks will remain the peaks. They will continue to be great hurdles for people to surmount. In other cases, I found that ratepayers living only on their savings, pension or wages were called upon to pay as much as $2,000 a year in councU rates. This situation is utterly unbearable and requires correction. I also bring to the attenticularly tion of the Parliament the problem faced by farmers. These matters have been referred to from time to time.A developer-speculator comes along and seUs some lots of 25 acres or 50 acres and, as a result, land values increase. Those land values bear no relationship whatsoever to the earning capacity of the land, the economics of the land and the abiUty of the people to pay way, having regard to aU the costs involved, increases in charges, the depressed cattle market claims. and, as a further example, the fact that potatoes are an uneconomic proposition at this time. All these are issues of great concern. Only this week, to add to all the other representations which have been made to me by numerous people in many places throughout the electorate that I have had the pleasure of representing, I received this letter I wish to place before you details of rate assessment property on Singles Ridge Road, North Springwood, and to ask your support in an effort to remedy the very inequitable position in which I have been placed-wit h many others like circumstances. Attached are copies of relevant correspondence which taken place over a period of almost one year protest to the Valuer-General on the valuation increase of over 500 per cent, from $7,500 to $44,000. That is an increase of almost 600 per cent. The letter continues: It appears that the only criterion recognised by the V.G. is that of value of sales in the area, regardless of the basis on such sales were made. In my case adjoining land was by speculators at highly inflated prices founded in fictitious rumour. Since my land is zoned Non-Urban 'E' the restrictions imposed by this zoning make it impossible for me to sell my property. I am therefore placed in the position of being forced to pay based on valuation of $44,000 (this year $953.75) or by default lose the property where my family was raised and I have held for 28 years. As I am a war widow, now 60 of age, with a very limited fixed income it is quite bemy capacity to continue to pay rates at this level. I beg you, as a last resort, to please make an effort in Parburden. to bring about some alleviation of this intolerable This letter is representative of the feelings of many people. I ventilate this matter in the hope of this that Parliament-the Minister for Urban and to Regional Development (Mr Uren) and those who speak for this Parliament on these matterswUl seek to stir the States into activity to take a stand in defence of these people who in their closing years deserve justice and not burdens of to try the type that I have Ulustrated.",30
51,Mr GARLAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) who has just spoken, is, I believe, assiduous in representing the views of his electors. The purpose of this debate is to enable members, parprivate members, to express any grievance on matters affecting the conduct of governme ment. In the short time that is allowed to me today I rise to speak on the conduct of many Ministers of this Government, probably the majority of Ministers. I believe that it is valid and necessary to say that the present Labor Government is characterised in large part by incompethentence, maladministration, waste, secrecy and the evasion. I will give some Ulustrations of those One of therightswhich every citizen of this of country has is the right to make representations to a Minister, if he or she wish through a member of Parliament. Every citizen has the right to expect that such representations will be dealt with quickly, fully and responsibly. This is a most important part of our parliamentary representative democracy. I have at present the largest bundle of outstanding representations to Minison my ters that I have ever seen in the period that I have been a member of this place. I can get very little in response from most Ministers of this Government. The unrepUed-to representations that I had have make a pUe four or five inches thick. Let me since my initial mention some of them very quickly. I mention first those deaUng with immigration. This is a particularly bad area. I am sure that my experience is shared by other members in this place. I should not be at all surprised if this ation applied to Ministers themselves when dealing with other Ministers. I mentionfirstthe case of a Miss Carnevali- I apologise if I do not pronounce the name correctly-wh o is making representations on behalf of her sister and brother-in-law, a Mr and Mrs Angelo Gismondi. Sponsorship was sought on 18 October 1974. I made representations on 4 November. I sent a follow-up telegram to the then Minister for Labor and Immigration on 5 March 1975 after no response of any kind was forthcoming except for an acknowledgment of my letter, and that is useless. The Minister sent a letter on 12 May in response to this representation. That letter begged the question so much that additional representations had to be made on 22 May. Today is 21 August, and no substantive reply has been received. This is a bad case. It is one of the worse that I have, but it is by no means atypical of the whole situation. Under the Regional Employment Development scheme, a primary school in the suburb of Hollywood in my electorate according to my advice actually received approval from the then Minister for Labor and Immigration for a project. With the disruption that has gone on in the preparation and in the dealing with the Budget and all the chopping and changing that has occurred, that school has now been advised that the project has been cancelled. The school already has incurred expenditure of $2,000. We cannot get any reply of an urgent nature out of the Government. There is no response by telephoning, writing letters or sending telegrams. I am advised that there are many similar cases and that the whole administration of this scheme is a complete mess. For thefirsttimein my knowledge one now has people desperately ringing and saying that the Government owes them such and such an amount for goods sold or services supplied and one has to ring up the Treasury or some other department and try to get the wheels moving so that those people will be paid. Surely to Heaven the Government has an obligation to pay quickly. One can send telegrams and letters or ring and get very little response in this respect. I turn now to the operation of the National Employment and Training scheme. I have had four particularly bad cases drawn to my attention in this respect. Of course, the people to whom I am about to refer were attracted to make their inquiries at the beginning in November of last year. They have come to me in desperation months later-in March or May. The 4 cases to which I am about to refer-ther e are more in the situ- files-are still unresolved. A Mr N. Cote, who made an inquiry, was refused. Mr Cote has an appeal pending. He cannot get a reply. I made representations on behalf of a Mr R. Hall on 25 March. There has been nothing substantive in relation to them. I made representations on behalf of a Mrs Wearne on 28 April. There has been nothing substantive in relation to her. Mrs Wearne was encouraged by the Commonwealth Employment Service to enrol as a trainee in the Nedlands Teachers Training College. They said to her: 'Your appUcation wiU be approved. You are in the category of those who will be approved'. So she enroUed. She has 4 chUdren to support. She engaged in such study because she had been encouraged to do so. I repeat that the Minister has not given a substantive reply to my representations on her behalf. Mrs Robin Bremner was also assured by the Department that she would qualify under the scheme. She did not qualify. She has lodged an appeal. The appeal is to be held in Melbourne. She has since been told by departmental officers that the only thing they can suggest for her to do is to get in touch with her member of Parliament so that he can make representations. She did so and I made representations. What has happened in relation to them? Absolutely nothing. A telegram was sent on 13 May. No response has been received to it. One of those people has written in a letter to me that the NEAT scheme appears to have been 'UI planned and poorly administered'. I can only commend her for her restraint because obviously the conception and administration of this scheme is incompetence in the extreme. The people to whom I have referred sit during their courses besides people who are receiving aid and who are in comparable positions. Surely the whole situation has reached a ridiculous stage when members of the Public Service, feeling no doubt out of a sense of decency that they have to say something to these people, have to say to them: 'Look, we cannot get any quick response. We suggest that you go to your member of Parliament and get him to raise the matter'. The acknowledgement by Ministers of letters written to them is perfunctory. I suppose the making of such an acknowledgement is poUte but it does not get one anywhere. One wants a substantive result to representations, even if the answer is no. In many cases the decision may not be the right one, but at least the person concerned knows where he or she stands and is not going to continue to incur expenditure and to run up UabUities unnecessarily. One may follow up a matter by way of a telegram and still not get action taken any more quickly. From time to time. I have heard it stated by certain people that they have not got sufficient staff. For heaven's sake, these new schemes were instituted by this supposedly bright, radical Government. The Government went to the people and said that it was going to do this, that and the other and those matters were debated and voted upon. The Government should not be saying that it has not got enough staff to deal with the problems which it has caused. That is no excuse. I say that the Government has a deep responsibility to regard the administration of its schemes seriously and not as something to be left to others and to be ignored. That results inevitably in much waste and dilatory conduct. It should be made quite clear that it is for the isters to insist upon efficiency being shown by their staffs and their departments. If the adminishis tration of a scheme is beyond a Department then that is something that the Minister and the Government ought to have weighed up at the beginning. I say that the whole tone of the actions of the Government has been to neglect the area of administration, which causes waste and extravagance. When Ministers stand up in this Parliament, as they did during question time this morning, and talk about their generosity they should remember that the money they are spending is the money of the taxpayers of this country. Figures have been supplied, in response to questions that have been asked, that indicate that the Ministry has double the number of staff employed by the previous Government. There is now double the staff on double the salaries with double the degrees, with every office machine and aid known to man and with a vast PubUc Service back-up. We have already had certain hard evidence of inefficiency in this field. We have had the comment by Dr Anthony, who was the Private Secretary of a Minister, that there were a thousand unanswered queries, or something to that effect, on his Minister's table. We have most Ulununating statement by a former Secretary of the former Treasurer, who said that the filing system was not well kept. In fact, he went on to explain that everything was kept loose and that one had to shuffle through everything in order to find documents. That was happening in the office of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. Surely to Heaven the situation has reached a ridiculous stage. I make a plea to the Government to endeavour to overcome the problems. Beset as it may be by its poltiical problems, the adminstrative problems are its responsibUity to overcome. The Government is creating hardship, anxiety and expense to thousands of Australians by its reprehensible conduct.",31
52,Mr MCVEIGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I want to take the opportunity of this debate to support the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland). Like him, I want to take the opportunity, without acrimony and without making any personal attack on any Minister or officer of any department, to spur on the Ministers and their advisers to treat the Australian pubUc with a greater deal of respect than they have shown in recent times. To my mind in the final analysis politics is about people and the rights of people. We have a great tradition in Min- Australian poltiical Ufe of giving to even the humblest citizen in the country the right to have particular grievance aired in the national forum of the Parliament. It has been both disappointing and depressing to note that there have been long delays by some Ministers in answering correspondence from members of Parliament who, in all good faith and honesty, have made representations on behalf of aggrieved constituents. I submit that it would befitand proper if all Ministers were to adopt the practice of those of their coUeagues who are most prompt in replying to the queries raised. It is disappointing to me that I have had to rise and support the honourable member for Curtin in bringing to the notice of the Australian people the very great discourtesies that have emanated from some ministerial offices. It gives me no personal pleasure and certaintly no deUght to have to get up in this chamber and speak like this, but I am concerned and worried about the increasing tendency towards discourtesy on the part of the administrators. Heads of Departments are involved as well as Ministers. It is simply not good enough that citizens have to wait many months for replies to their queries. I am also concerned about the types of replies that quite often are received. Many members of Parliament are very had a upset when they receive a stereotyped or roneoed reply signed by a Secretary and not the Minister on which is printed the name of their constituent, often without any address, and do not want to hand on the reply to their constituent because of the discourtesy that is inherent in that type of reply. The long administrative delays are creating great hardship in relation to such schemes as the National Employment and Training scheme and in the field of social security. They are areas in which deep personal emotions are involved. It is to be regretted that the system instead of getting better is getting bogged down and becoming hopeless and rather chaotic. Our office staff in our electorates is spending a great deal of time going through past correspondence in an endeavour to satisfy the requests of the constituents. I think it is appropriate on behalf of all members of Parliament to record in this national Parliament the great measure of thanks that we all owe to our own staffs. Mr Lucock-Hear , hear!",33
53,Mr LUSHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hear , hear!",34
54,Mr MCVEIGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I appreciate the support of my 2 colleagues, the honourable member for Lyne and Hume. I want to record my own deep personal appreciation of my dedicated staff-m y secretary, Miss Ann Harber, and my research officer, Trish BurreU. I hope that the infectious enthusiasm that they and members of the staffs of other members of Parliament display will flow over to ministerial staffs. Their dedication could well be copied and their devotion to their duty and concern for people could well be foUowed by the PubUc Service with very great benefit to all people involved. We have noted the vast increases that have taken place in ministerial staff establishments. The honourable member for Curtin touched on this. I note that the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) asked a question on 27 April 1972 on this matter and that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) repUed to a simUar question from the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) on 21 November 1973. As a rule of thumb it would appear that the startling increase in the number of people working for Ministers under the Labor Government is roughly of the order of 60 per cent. I am not opposing that increase, but what I do oppose with all the strength at my command is that, notwithstanding this great increase in staff, the service is getting worse. I except from this criticism some Ministers who are superb in the way that they answer correspondence and queries but others just seem to treat us with complete disregard. It is depressing to note that notwithstanding the great innovations and improvements that have been made in such matters as communications some Ministers are more intent on being jet trippers and empire buUders than keeping theirfingeron the pulse of their departments and getting on with the job of giving service to the people whom they should be proud to represent. Having spoken in that vein I want to comment on a few administrative matters that are causing very great concern within my own electorate and I know that the same situation permeates through many other electorates. I refer to the problems of getting payment under the Regional Employment Development scheme. I might say that I appreciate the fact that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Stewart) has seen fit to come along and participate in this debate. I thank him for the courtesy that he is displaying to back bench members. I have had complaints from several city councUs in my electorate that whUst they have appreciated the funding for various essential RED projects under their care, the Federal Government has got the praise and the UmeUght although in effect the city councils have been picking up the tab because of long delays in receiving payment for the various projects. On many occasions this has resulted in the city councils and shire councUs showing a debt on their books as at 30 June. This has a psychological effect on people and on councUlors. The councils have to pay interest on the overdrawn amount. The Warwick City Council has been overdrawn by some $ 100,000, at certaintimesall appUcable to RED grants not being paid by the Australian Government. The Jondaryan Shire Council has $50,000 owing. The Council has to pay interest on its overdraft. The Toowoomba City Council lodged claims at the end of May for' which no payment has been received. There has been further delay and further-bogging down of the administrative machinery. The Glengallen Shire Council owes $35,000. The final matter on which I want to comment is the cavalier manner in which the Minister in charge of the Grants Commission (Senator Douglas MCClelland) treated back bench members when he was the Special Minister of State in charge of the Grants Commission. I specifically refer to the manner in which allocations under the Grants Commission were made known. When I picked up my local paper, the Toowoomba Chronicle, I found that Senator Ron MCAuliffe had made an announcement in regard to the grants. At thattimeI knew nothing about the grants. I took the matter up with the Minister and he reaUy pooled himself when he said that every senator and every member was advised by telegram on Monday, 26 July. Yet the Toowoomba Chronicle rolled off the presses at 3 a.m. on the Monday morning. Obviously the information that Senator MCAuliffe had given to the newspaper had been released to him the night before the telegram to senators and members. I want to know whether the local member of Parliament is to be treated as being a secondrate member?",34

58,Mr YOUNG,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to refer to one of the most significant poltiical events that took place during the winter recess of the Parliament. As we have seen the Opposition drift further to the right in its statements and as we have tried to analyse the criticism that it has made of Government programs, we have been able to observe that it has put up nothing in place of these programs or said what it would do if it were in government. I think one of the most interesting statements to be made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) since he became Leader of the Opposition was that made at the Press Club luncheon and reported in newspapers on 1 August. I want to quote what he said because it may be of interest to some of the other members of his own Party and of the National Country Party of Australia who have not already read what he had to say on their behalf. He said: We reject enforced equality in the work place, omy, in education. We have been unable to get either the Leader of the Opposition, any of his shadow Ministers or indeed any of the members of the Parties opposite to teU us exactly what they mean by not enforcing equality. Obviously it is a direct criticism of the manner in which this Government has carried out its program. I want to go through some of the programs of the Government so that we can see what would happen and what the Opposition would do should it ever return to government. I know at the moment that members of the Opposition think that they are high levelling flyers because the computers tell them that they high are more popular than we are. The computers EquaUty told them that in April of 1974 and they sitting in the same place as they were sitting in April of 1974. One of the great Government and one of the things that wiU hold it in good stead in any future campaigns will be opportunities the community programs which have ried out and which are now threatened to be destroyed by a conservative government. Let us have a look at the manner in which the previous Government did not enforce equaUty this country and wiU not enforce equaUty when it returns to government at some time in the future. It may be of interest for honourable members opposite to know that when the Australian eral Schools Commission did a survey on the Australian schools system after we took over after 23 years of government by the present Opposition there were no fewer than 809 government schools classified as disadvantaged and no fewer than 211 CathoUc schools classified as disadvantaged, making a total of 1020 schools with a total enrolment of almost 400 000 chUdren that were going to schools classified as disadvantaged. This is a situation to which we could return if the Opposition should come to power. It would consider the operations of the Schools Commission and the classification of schools as something not in the best interests of Australia-as something that we are trying to force upon the community. Let us have a look at what it meant. Most citizens of this country get their opportunity at the beginning-at school or pre-school. It is too late after they havefinishedtheir schooling. Whilst the Liberal Party and the National Country Party might be critical of what we have done, I ask them to remember the mess in which they left us. There were 400 000 chUdren who were just disadvantaged; there were many other schools on the border but those chUdren were the ones whom the Schools Commission thought it could help most readily. But under the previous in the econLiberal Government almost half the number of children who went to university or colleges of advanced education came from 17 per cent of the community-the professional classes. Sixty per cent of the Australian community made up of the skilled and the unskilled-the manual workersprovided 20 per cent of the intake. That was an enormous waste. It was an absolute waste of ability of children who were going to those schools. Let us recall what Dr MCKinnon had to say sometimeago in relation to equaUty of education. He said: Equality of opportunity does not mean conformity or down. In an equal situation there will, of course, be flyers and slow plodders within all groups of children. does mean, however, that there ought to be roughly the same proportion of good, bad and indifferent students are still among all groups in the community. strengths of this He goes on to say: Should children from disadvantaged suburbs not have to complete secondary school and university simple because their parents are poor? Is there really evibeen cardence that they are less able? Of course what has been exposed by the Karmel Committee report and the carrying out of the poUcies by the Schools Commission is that those in children are not less able. Thefigureswhich I cited about entries into universities and colleges of advanced education will change as a result of the poUcies of this Government. But if the Liband National Country Parties return to office we will return to the old system because we cannot have enforced equaUty. The Leader of the Opposition promised in his speech 'an exciting approach to choice in education'. For 23 years we have had a look at that excitement. We have had a look at how the community Uved with that excitement. We see the poUcies indicted by the way in which they were carried out at the end of 1972. Let us look at some of the other areas. In going through what one might analyse as 'enforced equaUty', I suppose that the Liberal Party would regard Medibank as enforced equaUty. What did it have at the end of 1972 when it went out of office? There were 113 private health schemes. There were 113 separate and distinct administrations and 1 500 000 people Uving in this country with no health coverage. I repeat, there were 1 500 000 people involved. At the time of the introduction of Medibank, working people were paying as much as professional people for the right to have some sort of health cover. Are honourable members opposite saying that the introduction of Medibank is enforced equaUty? Is Medibank to be dismantled whenever a conservative government returns to power in this country? Spokesmen on the other side of the House have a responsibUity not to leave it at the statement: 'We wiU not have enforced equaUty'. They are expected to detaU what they would do in office. For too long honourable members opposite have been saying that it is not their responsibility to say what they would do-that they are just here to criticise the Government. Medibank covers 13-mUUon people. What are honourable members opposite going to do about it? The Schools Commission gives aU chUdren an equal opportunity. What are honourable members opposite going expired. to do about the Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory? Are we to understand that this is another instance of enforced equaUty which never took place under previous conservahonourable tive governments? Would that event of Saturday have taken place under a conservative government? Would honourable members opwhether posite have looked on that event also as enforced equaUty? Let us look at cluld care which was miserably neglected under the previous GovernAustraUan ment. Report after report by professional people shows that it is absolutely essential to give cluld an opportunity at school and to give them pre-school education and pre-school care for assistance of the famUy and for the benefit of the cluld. Nothing of any significance happened under the Liberal Government. We are trying to do something. We have planned to ensure that aU chUdren are catered for in child care centres by 1985. Is that enforced equaUty? Is this a waste of resources to assist the families around this country? Honourable members opposite should say what they mean. Between 1949 and 1972, the standard rate of the age pensionfluctuatedbetween 18 per cent and 20 per cent of average weekly earnings. Whenever it reached 20 per cent and looked Uke going higher, in that year the conservative government of the day would give no increase to the pensioners. If there were to be an election, the government would look upon it as atimeto gjve a substantial increase. We said when we came to office in 1972 that the age pension should be 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. One also has to look at what has happened to average weekly earnings since 1972. As has been stated in the House many times, average weekly earnings have risen much faster than the consumer price index. So I think that not only have we kept our pledge to make the pension 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, but we have kept pensions at a much higher rate than was expected in December 1972. Is it the intention of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party to reduce the pension rate from 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Is that giving the pensioners of this country too much equality? Are we enforcing standards on the community which are unacceptable to the Liberal and National Country Parties? It is the opinion of a lot of people in this country that perhaps spokesmen opposite should say a Uttle more in detail about what they mean and what they are going to do should they ever return to office.",35
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr M a r t in Order! The honourable gentleman's time has,36
60,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At question time this morning the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and the member for New England (Mr last Sinclair) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) two simple questions. They asked it was true that the Government had instructed certain Vietnamese refugees to sign so statements requiring them not to be involved in political Ufe. The impUcation of those questions and the manner in which they were the answered emphasise once again that this Government has plunged to new depths of politithe cal hypocrisy. This Government of compassion and concern has now found itself able to discriminate between people who Uve in this country. It is worth whUe reminding this Parliament and the people that in 1972 when this present Government went to the people, one of the objectives of its policy was to estabUsh a bUl of humanrightsto be appUed throughout Australia. On page 45 of the Platform Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party, we see that the Australian Constitution is to be amended to provide for the protection of fundamental civil rights and Liberties. Paragraph 2 of the section on civil Liberties states: The Australian and State ParUaments to pass Acts ing for human rights and civil ible legislative and administrative action and judicial ceedings to prevent infringement of such rights and Liberties and in particular to prevent discrimination on the grounds colour, race, sex, creed or poUtics. I stress the word 'poUtics'. We are faced today with a blatant attempt by this Government to eat pression; away at the fundamentalrightsof the Australian out people. I should like to draw the attention of the and House to the comment of the great French The phUosopher, Voltaire, who, in 1764, at the time of the French Revolution said: ' I disapprove what you say, but I will defend to the death right to say it'. We on this side of the House know the views which the present Government has on Vietnam. We understand the attitudes of the Prime MinisWe ter, but we do not necessarily agree with nor accept them. But to suggest that people who have been aUowed to come to this land, who have lost so much, their possessions, their rights in their own country and above all some of their self is respect, should now be permitted to enter Australia as second class citizens and be denied the inalienable rights which we all take for granted, is a situation which I for one view with abhorrence and dismay. I wish to make it quite clear at this point that, whether a person is ChUean, a Bait, a Ugandan, a Cypriot or a Vietshows namese, once given permission to enter Australia they should have the fuUrightsand responsibUisition ties under the law of this land. These inalienable. They cannot be divided, and above aU they should not be appUed, on the basis of race or poltiical beUef. What people were in last country of residence is irrelevant. What important is that the Government of the day mitted them to enter Australia. In allowing them to do so, it should have taken into account the fuU implications of that action. Above aU, it essential that people who Uve in Australia be given the fuUrightsunder the law. I submit that the Government, by this action, has contravened Articles 14 and 19 of the versal Declaration of Human Rights. Let read out, for the benefit of this House, what those articles contain. In Article 14 we are told: Everyone had therightto seek and to enjoy in other countries an asylum from persecution. We have brought into this land poltiical refugees from many lands. In recent years the 2 most notable groups have been the ChUeans and the Vietnamese. They came specifically with the objective of finding a new home free from persecution and where they would be allowed to live their lives as they wished with only one control, namely, the laws of Australia. Certainly there is providno law of which I am aware which dictates that Liberties, and to take all possproany person or any citizen living in this land should be prevented from enjoying to the full his of democraticrights.Article 19 of the Declaration is also relevant and states as follows: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and exthis right includes freedom to hold opinions withinterference and to seek, receive and impart information ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Prime Minister, in justification of his action, made the spurious point that he was trying more of or less to protect these people against us memyour bers of the Opposition and against those elements in the Australian community who, he aUeged, would use them for devious political ends. I suggest that the Prime Minister should give us some credit. The Vietnamese war is over. have to live with Vietnam, regardless of its poltiical complexion. I would hope that he would expect this Opposition to have the capacity to know that, having seen the march of history, we now have to live with the outcome tomorrow. It not in our interests nor in the interests of the Vietnamese refugees for us to continually rake over old coals. We have to buUd our relationships with Vietnam. To suggest that we are going to utilise these people for so-called nefarious poltiical purposes is a deliberate attempt a to discredit the Opposition with no evidence and the Prime Minister for what he is- a shallow person who assumes that his political oppohas no moraUty and does not support rights are Australia's essential interests. I hope that this House wdl take this matter their seriously, because there are many migrant is groups in Australia, whether they be Jews, perArabs, Czechs, Yugoslavs, people from the Baltic states, Ugandans, ChUeans or Vietnamese, who came to this land with the presumption that is they were coming to a country of freedom. In Australia therightof freedom of speech is a fundamental human right. It is one which this Parliament must forever be wiUing to defend, for should we lose in any degree therightof freedom Uniof speech we will be faced with the situation me which Edmund Burke described so well: Whilst freedom is true to itself, everything becomes subject to it. This Government should remember well the advice of the great Roman philosopher Cicero, who said: Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never endangered.",36
61,Mr KEATING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I take the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) to task fbr what he said about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as appUed to Vietnamese migrants in Australia. He might consider for a moment applying the same argument to the period only a few years ago when the Party to which he belongs shot and destroyed Vietnamese people in an undeclared war in Vietnam, not because of any territorial infringements on Australia by the Vietnamese and without a declaration of war. So much for his pious words. The Liberal Party has used the Vietnamese people for its own political ends since about 1965, and apparently it continues to do so. I think the speech of the honourable member for Bradfield could be regarded as complete humbug. I want to speak today about the marvellous protestations and speeches of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of recent times and to refer in particular, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) did, to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition at a National Press Club luncheon. I point out to the House that it is 4 months since the Leader of the Opposition took power in Australia as leader of the alternative government. To date there has been no enunciation of poUcy by him. He has been preoccupied with ridding his own Party of all vestiges of Sneddenism. The moderates in the Liberal Party are completely persona non grata. It is a case of cleaning out the stable. Anyone with any moderate thoughts has been suppressed and expunged from the Liberal poltiical landscape. It is a case of returning to the right. The whole idea is to have a general drift back to the right, unfortunately for Australia. Again we see the hair trigger mentaUty being displayed. An amusing article written last Sunday related that the Leader of the Opposition became so annoyed because apparently one of the bulls on his home property in the electorate of Wannon was breaking through the fence regularly that finally he leaned over the fence with a shotgun and blew its brains out. The same hair trigger mentality applied when be blew the brains out of his former leader, Prime Minister Gorton. When Prime Minister Gorton annoyed him to the point where it was intolerable for him, he denounced his Prime Minister, knifed him and destroyed him. He has confirmed aU along up to date that his poUtics remain on the right. He said in the National Press Club speech: I have no intention of leading a government which is only going to socialise Australia at a slower pace than Labor. In other words, there is to be no return to Gortonism. Moderation will not be in vogue at all. It is to be the hard line aU the way. The Leader of the Opposition is to be the high priest of small government. No longer is big government to be considered. There is to be a tearing down of wealth equahsation. He believes in privUege. He says that he rejects enforced equality which will result from things such as Medibank, which will give protection to people who in the past could not afford to insure themselves against health expenses. Of course, that is under chaUenge by him in the event of the return of a Liberal government. Things such as child care benefits, free university education for chUdren who could not afford to go to a university, equality in taxation, redistribution of incomes and all those things he calls enforced equaUty will be rejected. In other words, privUege will be restored. That is what he really campaigns upon. His speech to the National Press Club was couched in marvellous imprecision. There was nothing precise about it. In fact, the Melbourne Age, which could not be described as a journal supporting this Government, said that his speech was imprecise, disturbing waffle. They are the words of a respected journal, the Melbourne Age, about his speech. It was the first major speech he has made since he became Leader of the Opposition. He said that if he becomes Prime Minister he intends to give an exciting choice in education, as if to say that people in Australia today have no choice in education. What rubbish! If people want to send their chUdren to a private school they can; if they seek to send them to a pubUc school they can. AU the Government has done has been to try to see that all schools in Australia are fit for chUdren to go to. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned, when we came to power in 1972, there were 1020 schools described by the Schools Commission as being sub-standard, affecting 400 000 chUdren. To bring them up to a decent standard of education and a decent standard of quality is, in the terms of the Leader of the Opposition, enforced equality. On the one hand he talks about enforced equality, and then on the other hand he says in terms of Government spending that he intends to encourage immediate massive investment in private mdustry through investment allowances and restructured taxes. So in respect of anything which affects the community in general, there is no big government for the middle-income earners and the lower-income earners. There is no government participation to help them to improve their standard of living, but there is government participation to make sure that all of the benefits are returned to industry. When the Leader of the Opposition talks about enforced equality in education what he means is that all the previous benefits will return to the upper crust and that tax deductions will be there for them to send their children to the greater pubhc schools and the rest. He says he will wreck the Prices Justification Tribunal. He will banish that because it has been an impediment to prosperity. The fact that for years the major corporations in Australia have had no scrutiny has led Australia into the position where inflation is in a bad situation, but he intends to get rid of that tribunal. He says he wants freedom to strive, to achieve and to seek excellence, freedom to be different and freedom to conform. Have honourable Medibank, members ever heard so much drivel from the leader of a major Australian party? If the Leader of the Labor Party had proposed that sort of rubto bish in 1972 he would not have been elected Prime Minister, nor should he have been. Here this man, because of the problem of inflation because he believes that the Government's stocks are down in the electorate, thinking that he wiU inherit the mantle of the Primeministership. But I put it to the House: 'On what?'. What is his policy? Where is his poUcy? There is expired. not one explanation on pohcy, just all of these generaUties and they are aU couched in obUque terms as to serve whichever pohcy he would Uke to introduce into the laws of this land. He says the Liberals reject enforced equaUty the workplace, in the economy and in education. He says a Liberal government wiU use example, encouragement and specific legislation to rid country of discrimination. So he is going to legislation to rid our country of discrimination; that is apparently to ensure that there are not great gaps between privilege in Australia. He going to rid Australia, on the one hand, of ance equaUty and on the other hand he says he rejects enforced equaUty in the workplace, in the econquestions omy and in education. He rejects deal with discrimination yet he says in the same speech, 2 paragraphs away, that there wiU be specific legislation to rid our country of disthe crimination. How could anybody trust this man? How could anybody rely upon him at aU? What is Mr Fraser's view of where Australia should going? He has no view, of course. All he knows that he is propped up by the establishment to work for the establishment, to work for privUege in Australia. The whole tone of his addresses on so many occasions now has been against what he terms government interference in the lives of Australians, which is just so much rubbish. Again he offers criticisms of taxation. He said in his speech that the tax on average weekly earnings should be reduced for the average working man. We reduced it in this Budget from 48c to 35c in $ 1 and he is reported to have said in today's Press that the tax reforms would only encourage people to be spendthrifts. So on the one hand he says in a speech that there should be a reduction in taxation that appUes to average weekly earnings and when we virtually index tax for the $6,000 to $9,000 a year group and reduce the application of tax on that group to 35c in $ 1 he says that it encourages people to be spendthrifts. This Budget saves about $530 per annum for the 2-chUd famUy-ove r $10 a week relief. In addition, this Government has provided which is avaUable to everyone in the community, chUd care facUities, urban development and all these other infrastructures which go improving the quality of Uving for people on or below average weekly earnings. It should not is be considered that most Australians are on averand age weekly earnings. Of course most Australians earn less than average weekly earnings.",38
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has,39
63,Mr RUDDOCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I such want to address the House on an area of administration in which I consider the Government has shown its most glaring incompetence. It is in relation to the administration of the tertiary in allowance scheme. This scheme was one of this Government's initiatives and for that it deserves, I suppose, to be commended, but for the way in our which the program itself is being administered use the Government deserves only to be condemned. I point out that I have drawn to the attention of the the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) that I is proposed to raise certain matters in this grievdebate today and he has indicated that he is proposing to have made certain notes on the that I raise in order that he may conany moves to sider them later tonight. The tertiary allowance scheme is one in which administration has practically broken down. There are tremendous delays in terms of considering student entitlements to benefits under be the program and the administration has been is organised in such a way as only to encumber the ability of students to be able to receive benefits under the program. I am told that even now there are many students who are receiving only at this late date the benefits to which they would otherwise have been entitled. The scheme has been the subject of considerable public distogether cussion. I note that a report has been tabled the tertiary education assistance understand is to be known as the Williams report after the name of the chairman of the inquiry. The parts that I want to refer to relate not to the and 30, but benefits that students are entitled to, although I might well be critical of the adequacy of those benefits and I might well be critical of amounts that are being made available under to students who, along with other people, have suffered a good deal as a result of inflation and have not in any way been aided by the Budget that has been presented. I want to refer to the comments of the Australian Union of Students in relation to the appeals tribunals. The Students Union had this to say about the appeals tribunals in general: AUS is concerned at the time taken for the Appeals Tribunals to be set up. The appointments to the Tribunals have still not been made public, and the machinery is still unclear. Of equal concern is that the Tribunals will offer little in the way of appeal, as they will the present regulations. AUS believes that the Appeals Tribunals should operate to interpret the principles of TEAS-of providing finance to students in economic need-rathe tions. Consequently, the Appeals Tribunals need to have discretionary powers, otherwise they cease to function as an appeals body. The Williams report has made no comments on the appeals structure. The student assistance regulations are the statutory rules of 1974 No. 179. There are 91 regulations and they are, in my view, cumbersome, difficult to read and to understand and certainly to be able to use these regulations in considering one's entitlement under them a person would need to have considerable legal training, in my view. In the time available to me in this debate I would like to take honourable members through the provisions of the Students Assistance Act, particularly divisions 2, 3 and 4 which provide for the student assistance review tribunals. The tribunals were established under section 18 to review allowances under the regulations. Division 3 provides for requests for reconsideration or review of decisions and it sets out the basis upon which a dissatisfied person should seek to have an authorised person review his entitlement. After a certain period of time if the authorised person decides against the request a person who is aggrieved may lodge a request for the matter to be referred to a tribunal. Upon receipt by an authorised person of a request under section 23 for a review by the tribunal of the decision of the authorised person he shall forward the request to the chairman of the tribunal, with all the records and other papers on relevant to the decision and its reconsideration scheme which I by the authorised person. The manner of taking proceedings before the Tribunal are set out in sections 25,26,27,28,29 I particularly want to refer honourable members to the procedure of the tribunal because it is required to be informal in its delibthis Budget erations. Section 27(1) says: In the exercise of its powers and functions in relation to the review by a Tribunal of a decision referred to it(a) the procedure of the Tribunal is, subject to this Act and to the regulations, within the discretion of the Tribunal; It is absolutely discretionary as to how the tribunal shall consider its own functioning. The section goes on: (b) the proceedings shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as the requirements of this Act and the regulations, and a proper consideration of matters and questions before the Tribunal, permit; and be so hampered by the rigidity of I have already referred to the considerable delay. The section continues: (c) the Tribunal is not bound by rules of evidence. r than restating the regula(2) A party to proceedings before a Tribunal may, whether or not he is present or represented, make submissions to the Tribunal in writing. (3) A copy of any submission so made shall be furnished to the other party to the proceedings. A party cannot be represented by a legal practitioner, notwithstanding the 91 regulations to which I have referred. I raise these matters because I want to refer particularly to the case of Robert Stephen Llewelyn of Marrickville. He was a student. The initial decision, as described in the public document being the particulars of the request for review No. 158 of 1975, was as follows: Mr Llewelyn was ruled ineligible for benefits in 1975 because he had studied in his course for the maximum number of years required to complete it and had not done so. This was modified on reconsideration and he was ruled ineligible because he was half a year behind normal progress. This decision and the request for review were put before the Board on 23 July 1975. The Tribunal considered the matters raised by the authorised person in the first instance. The reasons for the decision of the Tribunal were given as follows: The authorised person ruled Mr Llewelyn as ineligible under Regulation 34 (1) (h) (vii) because he had studied in his course for the maximum number of years required to complete it and had not done so. At the hearing the authorised person resiled from this decision but contended that Mr Llewelyn was not eUgible because of Regulauon 44. In other words, this young gentleman was subjected to something that no court of law would ever accept, and that is trial by ambush by the Depaitment of Education. He was led to believe that his application was to be rejected under Regulation 34. He prepared his case on that basis. But at the hearing the authorised person the came up and said: 'No, it is not that Regulation miles about which we are concerned; it is now Regulavehicles tion 44.' Without adjourning the hearings, withmissions. out considering other matters that might have dealer. been placed before the Tribunal by the student, it went on to deUberate on the matters put it by the authorised person under Regulation It decided: . . . the decision of the authorised person must to decide that he is not entitled of Regulauon 44. In other words, the Tribunal decided that he was entitled under Regulation 34 but, on reconthat sideration, as requested, in the trial by ambush, wide of this young gentleman was not entitled to a Uving cent aUowance under Regulation 44. I am informed- I am not one who readUy understands these regulations-that under is Regulation 44 if certain information had been put before the Tribunal by this gentleman's these teachers it may have been decided another way. But the decision has been taken. There is no further avenue of appeal. These informal prothe ceedings, which had no legal basis, which are the discretion of the Tribunal, quite clearly wreak of injustices of this nature. I believe that that has occurred. Regulation 44 says: Living allowance is not payable in respect of a who is undertaking, or proposes to undertake, in the relevant year less than three-quarters of a year's work for a engaged in full-time studies in that part, or those parts, approved course that the grantee It was alleged that he was undertaking only half of the work load for the third year in which he was studying but I am informed that his acaor demic advisers indicated, and would have indisumer cated to the Tribunal had he been given an opit portunity to bring forward that evidence, that was in fact a fuU year's work load that he was undertaking. This is a grave injustice. I believe that the procedures we have are provide a proper method of review for people aggrieved in this way.",39
64,Mr BENNETT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I rise to draw attention to the material which I and no doubt other members of Parliament have received from the Car Consumers Association of Victoria. I understand that the Association has a branch Sydney also, and I am pleased to represent it in Western Australia. This particular pubUcation is titled The Secret Repair Policies of Car Manufacturers. It draws attention to a public notice that was pubUshed in the Age in Melbourne on Thursday, 15 May 1975 by the Association. It relates to Holden and Torana owners and says: Car Consumers' Association wishes to advise owners of existence of a GMH policy relating to the extension of cover of Trimatic Transmissions from 12 months, 12 000 to 3 years, SO 000 miles. This policy only applies to built before June 1974fittedwith Trimatic TransIf need of such a cover arises, contact your GMH It has been drawn to my attention that up to before 500 000 consumers who have bought these 44. vehicles over 6 years could be eUgible but unaware of this poUcy. So I can understand why be varied this has been termed a secret repair poUcy. to a living allowance by virtue I am also given to understand that these repair policies apply to other makes of vehicles. I feel there must be some way in which to give pubUcity to this situation as in up to 60 per Holdens fitted with Trimatic Transmissions faults have occurred and the usual repair cost of the Trimatic can be between $325 and $375, and perhaps more in some States. This particularly appalling for the average working man who is faced with the cost of repair of one of transmissions. Usually he trades his vehicle in and changes his car because he cannot meet the cost of repair. Today most repairers demand vehicle or the cash. That is the attitude they in take. I am not making an attack on General can Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd because, as a Volvo owner, I am aware that in some cases they want the cash or the car. They do extend credit to some grantee people but in most cases onefindsthat there are no credit facUities avaUable and the only solution student is to purchase another vehicle on hire purchase. of the This is not really the owner's responsibUity but is undertaking in that year. that of the manufacturer. Perhaps one reason onewhy the manufacturer has not made the owner aware of this policy is that he could be the second third owner of the car. But the cost to the conof this secret poUcy- I will continue to call a secret policy-is tremendous. I hope that the it Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron) will be able to develop a system whereby people are made aware of their rights in inadequate to these circumstances. I would Uke to draw attention to another point which has been raised by the Car Consumers Association, lt is quite a serious matter and one which has received some pubUcity, but unfortunately not sufficient pubUcity. There could be in up to half a million GMH cars on the road today with lethal steering locks. The Car Consumers Association newsletter says: Reports to CCA of the anti-theft steering lock model Holdens suddenly locking on unintentionally bringing about an accident were confirmed on 6 June when a Wagga Coroner investigating the road death year old girl said he agreed steering lock system on the HQ Holden was unsatisfactory. The motor mechanic had told the Coroner's Court considered the system unsafe and that it could be a trap driver not familiar with the mechanism. In the case of the girl's fatality on as the driver turned off of 2 reports to CCA, the driver is positive that he had not touched the ignition key at the time the steering activated. In one of these two incidents the Holden careered uncontrollably onto a footpath being driven alongside the winding Murray River at of the occurrence and only good luck prevented the vehicle from careering into the river. On 8 June 1974 a GMH official, while describing the key movement needed to select the 'lock' position, was quoted the Sun as saying: 'This is clearly set out in the owner's handbook, which emphasises that the lock position never be selected while the vehicle is moving'. The quoted the official as saying that 'switching off the while moving could be dangerous, particularly on hilly and winding roads'. What a fatuous sort of statement to make about the information being pubUshed in the owners handbook! A vehicle is sold to the owner, driven by members of his famUy and then driven by the following buyer and the handbook is not always passed on. It is not sufficient to pubUsh a warning in a handbook and expect that everybody will read that handbook and take cognisance is estimated that approximately 500 000 HQ Holdens and LJ Toranas which have this dangerous steering lock are still on the road today. If General Motors Holden's has quietly taken some action to correct this problem I will be happy to hear about it. After almost 2Vi years during which the HQ Holden was producedthat is from July 1971 to the end of 1973-the cars are still fitted with this hazard. Judging from the GMH service letter from which I quoted earlier a revised design of the steering lock viding for a more positive detent was not heater, introduced until about the end of 1973. These cars are getting older, cheaper and more readUy avaUable, and no doubt they are more worn and more dangerous. I feel sure it would a step in the right direction towards national road safety if GMH were to recall those locks to make avaUable to dealers and to service stabottom. tions throughout Australia the faciUty cost to solve the problem. It is only a matter of time before these half a mUlion GMH vehicles which are affected will cause more deaths, injuries and suffering unless is no good saying that there are not sufficient reports of this type of accident to warrant such in HQ actions. It is not one which people would closely and investigate. If somebody had switched off the 1974 ignition there is no guarantee that they would of a 19 admit to it because of insurance problems and with a motor mechanic that the because of their fear that the insurance company that he would not pay out on the ground of the neghfor a gence of the driver. This is another aspect of the matter. the steering lock had locked the ignition. However, in the case If there is an inbuUt defect it is the manufaclock turer's responsibUity, no matter how old the vehicle is. Once the defect is discovered I feel it is while in the other the car was the time the manufacturer's responsibUity to take some positive action to make sure that all the vehicles are modified. To emphasise the point and to show the impact and the horror of such a thing I shall describe a further accident which arose out in of this type of defect. It involves a famUy which was travelling along a straight stretch of country should road early one Sunday morning. The driver Sun then wanted something from the glove box but it was ignition locked. Noting the straight road and as there was no other traffic he slowed to about 30 utiles per hour, turned the ignition off and handed the keys to his wife. Perhaps it was wrong to do that. But how many people do that type of thing? I would like honourable members to think about this. However, they soon neared a sUght curve in the road where a bridge went over an irrigation canal. The driver turned the wheel to take the curve but the steering had locked when the igniof it. It tion was turned off. The car faded to take the sUght curve, went through the bridge into the canal and began to sink. Two of the bridge raUings went through the car. One went between the driver and his small son who was in the middle of thefront seat. It went on and badly gashed the head of his little girl in the back and finally lodged in the camper van which the car was towing. The other raUings prowent through the glove box, knocked out the narrowly missing the mother in the front seat and another son in the back. Fortunately, the famUy escaped with their lives, although 18 stitches had to be inserted in the gash in the little girl's head. The car was a write-off. The famUy be was extremely lucky. A tow truck driver who dived into the canal to rescue some of the family or belongings said that he was unable to touch the These are the sorts of things which are at their possibly happening every day.",41
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has the recall is made. It expired.,42
66,Mr MACPHEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 3 June I spoke against the granting of visas Australia to members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. I did so because that body stiU remains committed to the destruction of Israel force. During the pariiamentary recess developments occurred which lead me to raise the matter again. First of aU, a statement was Conference made by the gendeman to whom I referred on 3 Australian Government June, Mr Gamal el-Surani, who was whom the visa was granted. In the Age of Organisation of African Unityrecognised Saturday, 14 June, there is a report from Hobart which, in part, reads as foUows: Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, Surani, says only his age has prevented him from physically fighting for the PLO cause. Mr el-Surani, head headquarters in Cairo, said with the organisation's pohtical wing, and, as such, nothing of the military division's activities 'until happened'. But he supported such events as the Munich Olympic lage massacre and said he regarded the PLO members had been killed in such incidents as 'martyrs' and heros'. The report continues: During the Press conference he said he was 'very of Australia opening diplomatic relations with the that his talks with Government officials on this subject been received well. But he did not discount the possibiUty that if Australia refused to sidered by the PLO as an enemy and open to attack. This ought to come as no surprise to us. It is sistent with the sort of thing said by Mr Yasser Arafat at the United Nations and elsewhere. There has been no denial and no accusation that that was in any way a misreporting of what el-Surani said. He was here for quite some days after that report. Mr el-Surani's trip surely proved to the PLO that the Australian Governare ment, by granting the visa, was in fact encouragThe ing its terrorism and its poUcy of the destruction would of the sovereign state of Israel. After having had an audience with the Prime Minister (Mr mittee Whitlam) Mr el-Surani said he was hopeful that would there would soon be an office in Australia. The other matter which concerns me relates to the attitude of the Australian Government to the Conference. recognition of the PLO at international forums. The Government's ineptitude regarding the mission of the PLO to observer status at the United Nations and at the United Nations EduLabor cational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation been widely condemned for simUar reasons to those which related to the granting of visas PLO representatives. If the PLO dropped its mands for the destruction of the would agree that it ought to be heard. Sinular action to that taken by the United Nations and tragic UNESCO has been taken by the International entity CivU Aviation Organisation, the World Health by Organisation and the World Meteorological Organisation Conference. Again in those instances Australia has taken action which by encouraged rather than moderated the PLO pol2 further icy for the destruction of Israel. At the International Labour Organisation in Geneva on 12 June this year the voted for a motion to the man to aUow Uberation movements and the by the League of Arab States to attend the conference. The PLO, being one of the Uberation movements recogGamal elnised by the OAU and by the League of Arab States, was able to attend and participate in the of the PLO deliberations of the International Labour in Hobart yesterday his role was he knew Organisation Conference while still being after they pledged to destroy a member of the ILO, namely, Israel. The motion as it was put before Vilthe conference was subject to considerable dewho bate. Mr Hawke, the President of the Australian 'national Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, along with union delegates from other democratic countries, moved hopeful'an amendment requiring that all those seeking PLO and admission to the ILO should agree to abide by had the rules and principles of the ILO. One would not think that that was an unreasonable request. grant such ties it would be conThis would have enabled the PLO and Israel con-to co-exist at the ILO. But that also would have required that the PLO drop its demand about the destruction of an ILO member, Israel. The Australian Government, to its eternal shame, acMr cepted the report recommending the admission of the PLO to the ILO. The Australian Government delegate explained the vote in words which very far from being explanatory. He stated: Australian Government delegation had hoped that it have been possible for what has been referred to as a compromise formula to have emerged either in the comor at this Plenary Session so that this matter could have been adopted by an overwhelming consensus which have recognised the principles which were embodied in the compromise proposals which were under discussion. This did not prove possible, and therefore my delegation voted in favour of each of the proposals before the The Australian Government, by its attitude, ran adaway from principle. It ran away from its own trade union movement and from the Australian Party President. It also ran away from has integrity. Contrast the Australian Government's attitude with the attitude of the United States to Government delegate. On 21 June of this year dethe New York Times editorialised on the matter state of Israel aU in these words: The American delegation walked out, calling the vote a decision because the PLO was a poltiical, not a labour, under the ILO charter. And the American position was made official by Secretary of Labor John Dunlop, who had planned to address the Conference but refused to attend after the vote to seat the PLO. UNESCO itself has already suffered. Some of its important programs are imperiled because the United States and other concerned nations have properly resisted making contributions to the agency while it violates its mandate and tradition of nonpartisanship. One should add that one of the consequences of the admission of the PLO to the ILO will be that the United States again will deny its contribution to the ILO budget-it s contribution, if my memory serves me correctly, is about one-quarter of the budget-and that will greatly handicap the work of that international agency, the point being that the PLO is not a labour entity and has norightat the ILO in thefirstplace. The editorial in the New York Times-this is a most important point-continued : The United States contributes a significant amount of funding to the specialised agencies, in some instances as much as a quarter of their total budgets. The $ 16m contribution to UNESCO has been held up, the $29m for WHO in next year's authorization measure has also been delayed. A large group of members of Congress have warned WHO's director-general that expulsion of Israel would undermine support and confidence in the international health organization. It has become clear that the Arab bloc-the greatest beneficiaries, along with the Third World nations, of UN aid and expertise-is willing to agencies even if this means depriving millions of people, including its own, of health, welfare, educational and other direct assistance. And too many short sighted members of the UN, prey to Arab petro-politics, have acquiesced or abstained when the agencies are grade the organisation's charter and covenants. It is most important that the Australian people are given an explanation of the Australian Government's attitude towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation. How does the admission of the PLO to United Nations agencies advance the prospects of peace in the Middle East? How does it improve the operations of the United Nations? How does it serve Australia's national interests? How does it advance harmony within Australia? We have seen campus riots. We have had peaceful petitions to this Parliament. There have been letters to the Prime Minister which have been unheeded. The Australian people are entitled to an explanation of the Government's poUcy on this matter.",43
67,Mrs CHILD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance today, I am sure, will receive the support of every member of this House, whatever his party affiliation. I should Uke to say a few words about the anonymous letter writer and the anonymous telephone caller. I do not believe that there is any person in this community more despicable than the one who makes anonymous telephone calls or writes anonymous letters. There would be hardly one member of this House who has not at some time received an anonymous abusive letter or telephone caU, albeit the odd one here and there. But there are within the community people who are being subjected to a continuous stream of abuse from anonymous letter writers and telephone caUers. Of course pohticians are not the only butt for these people. I am well aware, as you probably are, Mr Deputy Speaker, that some of the people who make these cahs or write these letters are medicaUy sick; but there are also others who, for one reason or another, support a cause and believe that they have therightbecause they support a cause differing from one's own, to intrude anonymously into one's Ufe. Scarcely anyone who is in the pubUc eye or who receives a certain amount of pubUcity is free from this type of rubbish. Recently I have come into contact with this practice personally, and I do not like it. During the last 2 election campaigns I became accustomed to going without sleep. For some odd reason people started telephoning my house at 1 o'clock in the morning and they would telephone through until 6 o'clock in the morning. Eventually I got a telephone I could unplug. But did that unnamed caUer or those unnamed callers consider my elderly father for whom sleep was a risk destruction of the specialised brief interlude without pain? They did not at all. I became accustomed to that practice. It is a political thing and one learns to Uve with it. But what I will not become accustomed to is the way locked into positions that dein which an anonymous letter writer or telephone caUer can prey on people within the community to the very severe detriment of their health. I suppose that what really brought this to my mind was one middle aged woman in my electorate who was driven almost to suicide by people who were telephoning-it seemed to be a bit of a campaign-impugnin g her morals. She was a very nervous Uttle thing. When I found her she was almost at the stage of suicide. We got her an unUsted number which cut off the problem. But one cannot cut off what is in the minds of people who do things such as this. Some problems cannot be as easUy solved and they cause real suffering. I have a friend who receives abusive letters everytimeher name or her photograph appears in the Press and another friend who, when she answers the telephone-it rings very oftensometimes hears only heavy breathing. These things may sound unimportant, but to the recipient they can cause real suffering and pain. I shall address myself for a couple of minutes to those who send me anonymous letters and make anonymous telephone caUs to me. I hold them in supreme contempt. In my opinion they are completely without integrity and completely without guts. I am prepared to receive any letter or any call of criticism; indeed, I will protect right of the individual to criticise me. But that individual has to sign his name to the letter or to give his name over the telephone. My staff is instructed to hang up on anyone who will not say who is calling before he starts speaking. We do not read anonymous letters. We look at the end. If there is not a signature we put the letter in waste paper basket. So, such people are wasting theirtime.I do not receive many abusive letters, but my advice to anyone being abused is to follow my example. The anonymous letter writer is sick. Also he does not have the courage of his convictions; if he did he would want to debate his grievance. He is the cowardly type who wants to hit and run. My office is open to anyone who wants to come into it. I am committed to my philosophy of Uving. I am committed to my political Party and its poUcies. But I am prepared to discuss and to debate them with anyone, quite freely and openly-that is, anyone with a name. There is no one harder to fight than the who hits and runs. No accident arouses more pubUc hostility than the one caused by the hit and run driver. That is the type of person with up whom the anonymous letter writer belongs. What satisfaction he can get from shooting an arrow into the air without knowing whether it will hit its mark, I do not know. I also do not know what satisfaction he gets from making unwUl founded accusations from an anonymous position. It is time some of these people grew up had enough maturity to promote some discussion on whatever then: grievance is out in the open. There is very Uttle that cannot of us respect those who open the lines of communication and discussion, even if we completely disagree with what the other person to say. In my opinion the anonymous letter writer is a cowardly and gutless person. I hope that few of those who have been making the calls or writing the letters are listening to this debate. They might take a hint from what I have had to say.",44
68,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," that During the recess I took the opportunity ing central Australia and northern Australia. I did this for 2 reasons. I wanted to see something of the resources and nature of the place and wanted to get a further insight into what is hapknow, pening to the Aboriginal population. On that secin ond point I shall say nothing at this moment although I hope I shall have an opportunity of saying something later. I want now to say something about the nature of the place and the possibitities that Ue inherent the in it. As honourable members, would agree, I think, a great part of Australia's economic future is bound up with its mineral industry, its mineral products and its mineral exports. I think that this is something which needs to be developed as quickly as possible and as thoroughly as possible. I want to draw to the attention of the House the the possibilities that Ue inherent in the centre of Australia and some of the things which we should be doing and putting in hand in regard to them. I hope I shall be constructive in this regard. A large part of the centre of Australia-it may amount even to a quarter of the continent-is covered by a fairly thin and recent layer of sand. Sometimes the rocks stick up from this layer but over many hundreds of mUes there is no indication of what lies under the surface. Yet that surface is covered by only a few feet of sand. Some of that surface contains potentially valuable mineral areas. I refer particularly to the old rocks, the pre-Cambrian, the protozoic and even perhaps the archaeozoic rocks which underUe the surface. one We do not know what they are. We do not know in detaU what they are like. We do know something about their age. From the rocks which stick from the surface from time totimewe can get some vague idea of what Ues under that shallow sand surface. It would help us if we knew more, if we knew the rocks and if we knew the dip of the rocks. Sometimes, of course, the valuable ores stand out because they are harder than the folded rocks which surround them. A good and example of this would be at Broken HU1 or even, indeed, at Mt Isa. In other cases the valuable rocks are not hard. They are soft shales which be discussed. Most will not stand out. I believe that this is the time when we should has be doing something about the delineation of these areas. May I say, with satisfaction, that we a found the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics actively working in this area. We found its people trying to identify the rock outcrops. I have a great deal oftimeand admiration for the work which is being done by the Bureau of Mineral Resources. I am not trying to criticise it. I am trying to say that more should be given to body and that we should be going on with it of visitin a faster way. I believe the first thing to do is a certain I amount of drilUng. As honourable members will a large number of drills are idle at present Australia. They fall, I suppose, into 4 classes. The shallow driU was used for seismic work, for putting down shot holes and the like. It is a truck mounted driU which goes only to shallow depths and is very light. Second is the diamond drill which is used for exploring ore bodies. Third is the deep stratigraphic drill which is used for oil drilling. It can put down a really deep hole on land. Fourth is, or used to be at any rate, the drill which is capable of operating off-shore. In the first 3 categories we have idle resources and we used to have idle skilled teams. We have not got them now because they have been dissipated by reason of the under-use of our facilities. I would like to see a drilling program really put in hand not just on particular targets but in order to ascertain the nature of the sedimentary basins and the old rocks which are not sedimentary or old folded rocks but which are in very old sedimentary areas in Australia. In that way we can learn something about our mineral potential. This is thetimeto do it because we do have idle machinery. The sooner we start building up our skilled teams again, the better. I would think, for example, that in these areas covered by this shallow sand film we should be using our shot hole drills which were used in the seismic program in determining the depth of the sand and roughly what is underneath. By use of coreing one can find out and by use of dip meters one canfindout the Ue of the strata and be able to ascertain what is happening. In selective areas we should be putting down our diamond driUs and finding out more. In order to find the main structure of the continent we should be using our deep drills onshore to find out the nature of the underlying basins to great depths. I want, in the next few months, to try to program of this kind accepted. I shall be trying the next few months to find out what can be done and what resources can be devoted to it. Again want to commend what the Bureau of Mineral Resources is doing. I do not want to criticise Bureau. I want to say that it should be getting further resources and that the program of drillthe ing, particularly in the centre of Australia, be very much stepped up. This will help- I say this incidentaUy-the Aboriginal communities. One of the things which will be discovered is the extent of our water resources and underground water. In this area there is plenty of rough feed. I know this is a particularly good season but think that even in normal seasons there would rough feed. There is virtually no naked animal Ufe because there is no surface water. If we find out from this driUing where water can found and easUy brought to the surface we may be able to help the Ufe of some of these Aborigiple nal communities. I put this as a side issue. The first point I make is that at thistimewe should be using our unused drilling resources and, once more, buUding up our skUled driUing teams in the 3 categories: The shot hole drill, which wiU go down and pierce, for example, a thin sand film; the diamond drill which will tell us more in detail; and the deep stratigraphic drill which will determine the nature of our main basins. There is much we do not know.",45
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr M a r t in Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
70,Mr RIORDAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) in the debate this morning made some allegations which certainly deserve to be answered. I propose to answer them in part now and give a more detaUed reply on the adjournment debate this evening, if I am able to exercise my privilege in that regard. The honourable member made a number of allegations. I simply say in respect of his allegation about Ministers fading to answer questions that if there is any deficiency in my own Department I will certainly give attention to it. I do believe that this is a matter that can be considered. I think aU honourable members will appreciate, after all, that the number of questions coming from honourable members is growing as the activities of this Government expand. In other words, there are more areas now about which to ask questions than there were previously. I am advised by the longest serving member of this Parliament, the Leader of the get a House (Mr Daly), that what has happened is in nothing new and that there were occasions in the past when questions were simply wiped off the I notice paper. In his long service, lengthy delays were experienced under the Liberal-Country the Party Government. But there is a matter that cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. That is criticism by the honourable member of the should National Employment and Training Scheme. This re-training scheme was introduced by the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron). That scheme will I stand as a monument to his name. This was the be first Government even to consider seriously the introduction of a re-traming scheme. Certainly can there have been delays. Of course there are be delays in having some of the applications finalised. The reason for such delays is very simindeed. When the scheme was announced, there was a virtual flood of applicants, such a flood of applicants as to indicate the unsatisfied need of this community over a generation for retraining. People who are applying include those who have not had the opportunity to be trained in their youth, who have not had the opportunity to have a reasonable education, new settlers to this country, migrants from other parts of the world who have not had the opportunity to be trained in the skills required in this community. ill behoves a former Liberal-Country Party Minister whose Government presided over the years of neglect in this field, to come along now and to criticise this Government for the deficiencies which may exist in the initial stages of an exciting scheme which will satisfy a great community and economic need for Australia. Let me illustrate my point by referring to what we saw on many occasions in respect of unemploymentfiguresduring the reign of office of the Liberal-Country Party Government. There was unemployment amongst unskilled workers and shortages of skUled employees. This situation arose because there was a massive imbalance in the Australian work force. That massive imbalance grew up in the years of neglect from 1949 to 1972. 'The generation of neglect' it wiU be known as and will be so described by historians. We had a situation almost with great regularity in which there was unemployment amongst unskUled employees and a shortage of skUled employees. This is an unfortunate, regrettable fact It is not appropriate for the honourable member for Curtin to launch a criticism against this Since scheme. In my view, it also is in very poor taste for the honourable member to make an attack those who are doing their best to administer scheme. They have been subjected to severe sition. difficulties indeed in trying to cope with the large number of people seeking assistance. But I should say this: Those who are presently applypation ing for retraining under NEAT are receiving prompt attention indeed. This is done at great expense and personal cost to the officers of the Department of Labor and Immigration who are working very hard to administer the scheme. The delays to which the honourable member referred are in respect of people who have appealed against decisions ruling them ineUgible to participate in the NEAT scheme at this time. This Government could not possibly hope to be able to satisfy the demands which have buUt up over 23 years. We will eventually have a scheme whereby every citizen who wants to be re-trained will be able to be trained to acquire greater skUls. We will do this because it is a job that needs to done. This nation needs to do it. But it will take time. Nobody could reasonably suggest that such a mammoth and massive task could be underforum taken without friction or without delay. As I said, I will take the opportunity if I am able this evening to reply on the adjournment debate in some detail to these allegations.",46
71,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It is now 15 minutes to 1 o'clock and, in accordance with standing It order 106, the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",47
72,Mr WHITLAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I move That the resolution of this House of 1 August 1974 concerning the participation by the Australian Parliament in the Constitutional Convention be amended as follows: (1) Paragraphs (1) (b) and (2) (c) omit 'The Australian Country Party', substitute 'The National Country Party of Australia'. (2) Paragraph (2) (b) omit 'The Right Honourable B. M. Snedden, QC, substitute 'The Honourable J. M. Fraser'. On 1 August 19741 moved that this House: . . . affirms the decision taken by resolution of the House on 31 May 1973 that the Australian Parliament join with the parliaments of the States in the Constitutional Convention to be convened to review the Australian Constitution in September of that year, and at such subsequenttimesas the Convention fromtimetotimedetermined . . . That motion also proposed the composition of that portion of the delegation from this House. that time there have been certain changes with respect to the Opposition, namely, the Australian Country Party has become the National on Country Party of Australia and there has also this been a change in the leadership of the OppoIn order to take account of these changes I have therefore moved that the resolution of this House of 1 August 1974 c»nc«rning the particiby the Australian Parliament in the Convery stitutional Convention be amended as foUows: (i) Paragraphs (1) (b) and (2) (c) omit 'The Australian Country Party', substitute 'The National Countiy Party of Australia'. (ii) Paragraph (2) (b) omit 'The Right Honourable B. M. Snedden, QC, substitute 'The Honourable J. M. Fraser'.",47
73,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," Mr Speaker, the Opposition Parties welcome the change in approach by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) which enables the Constitutional Convention to be held in September, and welcomes therefore the motion that he has moved. The Opposition be Parties, as this House knows, endorsed the initiative of the States for a Convention in 1972. It is our hope that this Convention will be a useful in which State and Federal representatives may constructively consider constitutional reform in a way which will advance the good government of Australia. There are changes which can be made to the Constitution for the improved working of the Federal system. Real difficulties have obviously been involved in this. There have been difficulties in obtaining the agreement of this Parliament in respect of the measures which ought to be put, on the precise changes needed, and in persuading the people of Australia of the benefits of such changes even sometimes when both Government and Opposition Parties officially have agreed on those changes in this House. There have, however, been too many hasty and Ul-considered initiatives which have led to rejection of referendum proposals. I do not think they serve anyone's purpose. They waste the time of the Parliament and of the people. The Constitutional Convention does present an opportunity to identify areas where change is needed. It will ascertain what sort of consensus exists for change. It will provide a place where constructive efforts may be made to work out constitutional reform. For aU of these reasons, the Opposition is glad that the Constitutional Convention will be reconvened in Melbourne in September. The Opposition ofcourse recognises that the Convention itself cannot make any constitutional change. However, it can be the base from which constructive proposals can emerge. The Senate's resolution makes the way clear for the Convention to proceed. The Opposition Parties welcome the opportunities that the Convention offers.",47
74,Mr WHITLAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"in reply- I would not want the House or the pubUc to draw any inferences from the phrase which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) used about the change of attitude by the Government. The fact is that the Government has consistently taken the attitude that the Australian Parliament should participate in this Constitutional Convention. I believe it was I who moved the motion on 31 May 1973 that the Parliament should participate in the Convention. It was certainly I who moved the motion on 1 August last year which I recaUed when moving my motion today. The Government has been committed aU along to participation in the Convention. The delay has taken place in the Senate. Honourable gentlemen should be reminded that the matter has arisen twice in the Senate. Last August the Leader of the Government the Senate (Senator Wriedt) moved that the SenHouse, ate should send some of its members to the ConThere vention, as it had done in September 1973. Under that motion there were to be 3 members of the Australian Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party of Australia, one member of the Australian Country Party and one member of the Liberal Movement. In the previous Parliament the delegation had been 3 members of the Labor Party, one member of the Liberal Party, one member of the Country Party and one member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. The change to the appointment of a member of the Liberal Movement instead of a member of the DLP was due to the fact that there were no longer members of the DLP in the Parliament but there was a member of the Liberal Movement who had been acknowledged by the Senate as the Leader of a Party. Mr Kilien-We do not have any permanency in this place, do we?",48
75,Mr WHITLAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Non e of us. I am merely quoting what the Senate acknowledged. It is plain looking at any copy of the Senate Hansard since July or August of last year that Senator Steele Hall has been acknowledged to be the Leader of a Party. So the Government moved last July or August- I think it was last Augustthat Senator Steele HaU should take the place of the former DLP senator who had represented the Senate at the Convention. An amendment was moved to delete Senator Steele Hall from the delegation and put in a second member of the Liberal Party. The amendment was put and defeated on an even division. The motion was then put and defeated on an even division. There the matter stayed until, as a result of negotiations in which I participated, it was again raised in the Senate. The same motion was put on behalf of the Government and the same amendment was moved to it. On that occasion the amendment was carried and, becoming the motion, the motion was carried. I have gone into that detaU in order to refute the suggestion which has been made on many occasions- I think it was impUed by the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion; it has certainly been the subject of newspaper articlesthat in some way the Australian Government was impeding the meeting of the Convention. In fact the Australian Government took the earliest opportunity in every case to put the motion in this House, through myself, and in the Senate, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that the Australian Parliament should participate in the Convention. Later, as a result in of negotiations that took place outside the that motion was again put in the Senate. has been no change of attitude on the part of the Australian Government. We believe that the Australian Parliament should participate in the Convention. There were a couple of other matters mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition to which should respond. He referred to referendums. Four referendums were put to the people last May. Three of those referendumsfloweddirectly and entirely from the recommendations-mos t of them unanimous recommendations-of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review that were made back in 1958 and 1959. The fourth referendum-the one concerning local government-flowe d from undertakings which I had made in the election campaign in 1972 and to local government representatives in Australia in January 1973. The honourable gentleman then referred to some other matters which I believe show some confusion in the ranks of those behind him their coUeagues in other ParUaments. The fact that there has been a difference of attitude tween the Liberals-Federa l and State-o n of the matters which have come before this Parhas Uament by way of BUls. It is significant this Parliament, including in the Senate, there has not been opposition by way of a vote to programs which have, however, been chaUenged in the courts by State Liberal governments. Quite obviously things Uke the Australian Assistance Plan, which has been chaUenged by State Liberal governments, and the Regional Employment Development scheme, which has been challenged by State governments, were not in fact opposed here. The Government beUeves in these matters. It pursues them. I believe that comes UI from the Leader of the Opposition that he should raise here matters which have been chaUenged not by him and his coUeagues but their counterparts in the State ParUaments. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr MALCOL M FRASER (Wannonwith Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",48
76,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Does the Leader of the Oplet position claim to have been misrepresented?,49
77,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Yes , Mr Speaker. the I would not have risen if the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) had not involved poUtics in a matter which one would have hoped could have been to this matter. approached in a reasonably bipartisan mannerthe Constitutional Convention. If agreements are going to be reached on some matters they are going to be agreements that are reached between the various parties not for the purpose of ing but for the purpose of uniting Australia.",49
78,Mr WHITLAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Where is the misrepresentation?,49
79,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,The point of misI representation is that if on the first occasion the motion was put in the Senate for membership of the delegation the Government had accepted the view that it accepted the lasttimethe motion was put in the Senate the Convention could have proceeded many months ago.,49
80,Mr WHITLAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I wish to make a personal explanation, Mr Speaker. In fact the Constitutional Convention could not have proceeded last year not just because the Senate could not agree on a delegation from the Australian Parliament but because there was at least one other Parliament-the Queensland Parliament-whic h also had not agreed to send a delegation to the Convention. It did not do so until well into this year. My comor ments were devoted entirely to refuting the is suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr beMalcolm Fraser) that there has been a change of many attitude by the Government. The Government always done all it can to see that the Parliathat in ment participated in the Convention. DEFENCE FORCE RE-ORGANIZATION BILL 1975 In Committee Consideration resumed from 20 August. Clauses 5 and 6-by leave-take n together. Sitting suspendedfrom 12.58 to 2.15p.m.",49
81,Mr KILLEN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"When this it Bill was in Committee last evening I asked the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison)- I thought, in terms of poUteness and reason-to give the by Committee an explanation of why the nomenclature in many parts of the Bill had been altered. It was not as though one were indulging in some captious form of criticism. The request was made poUteness and reason. But the Minister was emboldened to embark upon a course that I can only describe as not doing himself justice as a gentleman and as a Minister of the Crown. But us put to one side his exuberance of spirit and come to the explanation that he has offered. I think that the Committee, the Parliament and country are entitled to an explanation when alterations of these characters are made. I ask the Minister again whether he would mind adverting I am not going to argue the merits of the stand that I take. What I am submitting to the Committee is that the stand taken by the Government dividis tainted with UlegaUty. 'Commonwealth of Australia' is the proper term to be used. The term 'Australia' is not. I speak now in the constitutional sense. I gave the Minister section after section of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. But what was the reason given by the Minister last evening? I ask the honourable members to listen to it. He said: The reason why the definition of Commonwealth is excluded from the new Bill is that the definition of wealth in the old legislation said: 'The Commonwealth' includes the territories Commonwealth to which this Act extends. In point of fact, the section which is being amended by the clause presently under considerfence ation reads as foUows: This Act shall extend to the Territories of the wealth as if each of those Territories were pan of monwealth. What is the Minister putting in its place? putting in this: This Act extends to the external Territories as if each of those Territories were part of Australia. I am not asking this in any sense of the Government wants to behave Uke a collection of gypsies, it will be treated as such. the Minister's speech last night I interjected; Like Christmas Island. I ask honourable members to Usten to the extraordinary statement that the Minister made in reply to my interjection. He said: The honourable gentleman would be very much aware that Christmas Island is not a territory of the Commonwealth. I think it is about time he brought himself up date. The former honourable member for indication StirUng, Mr Webb, is the Administrator of the Christmas Island. Christmas Island, whether the Minister likes it or not, is a Territory of the monwealth of Australia. If that is the basis of honourable gentleman's argument, it does not dismiss or diminish our anxiety on the point; the contrary, it heightens it. I ask the honourable gentleman- I trust that if I offend him in any at aU he will draw my attention to it-in terms simple civiUty: WUl he please give the ComwUl mittee a reason why the term 'Commonwealth' Force. is being dropped throughout the Bill. If the Minister would do that, I think we would be able to make progress at a pace that might even bring pleasure to his frame.",49
82,Mr MORRISON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) will be very much aware of the drafting practices of the present Government which relate definitions to 'Australia'. reason and the reason I gave hitherto, we do not consider it necessary to hold the term 'Commoncommander wealth ' in every part of the Bill. Clauses agreed to. Clause 7.",50
83,Mr KILLEN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Clause 7 is what I described last evening as the central feature of this Bill. It seeks to repeal sections 8, 9 and 9A of the principal Act, namely, the Defence CommonAct. That central feature is the purported conferment upon a Chief of Defence Force Staff of of the command of the Defence Force. Again I asked, during the course of my speech in the second reading debate, whether the Minister for De(Mr Morrison) would give an explanation - of the apparent conflict- I put it no harsher than Commonthat-wit h section 68 of the Constitution. I do not the Comtake the view that this legislativeflourishcan put at nought the constitutional provisions which He is exist in section 68 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. But let us put that to one side. I want to come to the exceptions in proposed section 9A, of obstinacy. If which sub-section (1) states: Subject to section 8, the SecretaryDuring meaning the Secretary of the Department of Defenceand the Chief of Defence Force Staff shall jointly have the administration of the Defence Force except with respect toThe sub-section then gives the 2 exceptions, one being matters falUng within command and the other those matters specified by the Minister. I deal with the second exception. I invite the to honourable gentleman to give the Committee an of what matters may be specified by Minister. I also invite the honourable gentleman to give an account of how he assesses posComsible difficulties of Ministers coming and goings the and changing their minds so that a matter is not within the joint control of the Secretary of the on Department and the Chief of Defence Force Staff. I believe that this is quite crucial if we are to way have afluctuationof ministerial edict as to what of comes within the second exception, I think we have a very curiously administered Defence But, more importantly, I turn to thefirstexception; that is to say, matters falling within command. I express my misgivings-agai n I put it no more emphaticaUy than that-as to the efficiency running a diarchy, and that is precisely what is involved here. The Minister attempted, during the course of his speech winding up the second reading debate, to define what is meant by 'comFor this mand'.He said this: Command is to be taken as meaning the authority which a in the military service lawfully exercises over his subordinates by virtue of rank or appointment. There is no difficulty in comprehending that. went on to say: Command includes the authority and responsibUity effectively using avaUable resources and for planning employment of, organising, directing, co-ordinating controlling military forces in the accomplishment of assigned duties. The proposition I put to my friend is this: Under that definition, which is the one he embraces, there is not one matter that could not be properly described as being administrative. So I say to honourable gendeman: It is not as though one can, with surgical accuracy, divide matters administrauon from matters of command. This is exactly the area that has given rise to widespread anxiety throughout the country. The honourable gentleman last evening indulged himself to make, I thought, some ungenerous references to Dr Millar, a very tinguished Australian. He taunted my colleagues and me with the view that every sentiment uttered by us had the fountain of origin in Dr MiUar's writings. With great respect to my friend-it is my Irish mood of agreeableness prompts me to say this to him-that is simply not true. We are quite capable of forming opinions on these matters for ourselves upon proper inquiry, upon proper reflection and upon proper discussion with people who have views in this field. The Minister has not put at rest the anxiety that exists in this field. As was so cogently pointed out last evening by my friend, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr WaveU Connolly) this is the question: What are matters of administration and what matters of mand? It is not enough for the Minister to read out a definition and to say: 'Look, here it is. should satisfy you. Go back and be rested with fence the assurance that I know what matters of mand are'. I venture the view that considerable confusion wiU occur in thisfield.The Minister's recitation of a definition of a command is unsatisfying and is unhelpful. But let us matter a little further. The Minister's disDefence) tinguished predecessor when he made his secondable reading speech on this Bill, said: Ministerial directives establishing the arrangements the inter-relation of the high level Service and civiUan itions in sharing of responsibUity stating the responsiveness expected of the departmental structure to the operational pnorities of the Chiefs have already been drafted, in fuU consultation among Chiefs of Staff and Secretary. There is a teasing measure of ambiguity about that statement. I could have a fuU consultation with the Minister for Defence but one could reasonably draw from that the conclusion that we were in splendid agreement about the matter. He Why have these directives not been made pubUc? If the directives have been drawn and are in for existence already, is there any reason why this the Parliament should not have access to them? I and invite the Minister to setde our anxiety on that point. It is to no avaU the Minister taking a position of dogmatism on this point. We have our anxiety. We are not seeking to impale one side or the other. What we are asking of the honourable gendeman and of the Government is simply this: the Please give us the information so that we may better form a judgment on these matters. I put of what seems to me and what seems to my coUeagues to be the gravamen of our charge that we do not know what are matters of administration and what are matters of command. rather I sum up by referring to the honourable disgentleman's own definition. There is not one matter there which falls under a matter of command that could not, without resorting to any fertUity of imagination, be put under a matter of administration. The smears which came from the that Government benches last evening to the views offered by two of the greatest commanders in history, Montgomery and WaveU, do no credit to a Government which dimisses the views of men of courage and of character by saying: 'Ha! You are going back a few years'. That may be true but they were great men and they were responsible for great feats of arms. Their reputation is not to be diminished by smears. As Marshal himself put it, he ranked administration ahead of tactics. If a man of the eminence of comField-Marshal Wavell puts administration ahead of tactics, then I think it is at least incumThis bent upon the Commonwealth Minister for Deto offer an explanation to us why it is in this comapparently confused area, the Government is reluctant to give information. take the Mr MORRISON (St George-Minister for (2.29)-Las t evening, as the honourmember for Moreton (Mr KUlen) pointed out, I gave a definition of the concept of command. I think the essential feature there is the for words 'which a commander in the mUitary serposvice lawfully exercises over his subordinates by in appropriate areas, and virtue of rank or appointment '. This is a difficult of Staff, area as the honourable member for Moreton the himself would have recognised having at one stage exercised the position of Minister for the Navy. Under the Constitution, any Minister is responsible for the administration of a Department not of State. One cannot be a Minister under the Constitution unless one has a Department of State to administer. The manner in which that administrauon takes place comes under the varigeneral ous rules and regulations which have been estabthe lished by precedent-the Pubhc Service Act so on. In this area of command and administrapointed tion, the Bill provides that the Minister shall responsible for the adrninistration of the departcontext ment and the defence forces under the Act. This provides, as any Bill provides, for the Minister have the opportunity to decide to allocate these functions. I am sure that the learned and honourimply able member for Moreton will recognise great difficulty- I am sure that he felt this himself when he was administering a Department of State- in defining precisely concepts such adrninistration. What the Bill seeks to do-thi was on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel who recognised the great difficulties associated with precise definitions-is to ensure that the Minister has the responsibUity under the Act. Two people would assist him in that administraused. tion-on e being the Chief of the Defence Force Staff and the other the Secretary of the Departfinition ment. Perhaps here there is the element- I agree with the honourable member for Moreton-of the way that the defence re-organisation must administered. I should like to draw on a comordinating ment made by His Excellency the GovernoraccompUshment General because I beheve that it is pertinent the whole notion of making any administration work. In December last year, the Governor General said in his speeches at Duntroon and times Point Cook: It has, for as long as I can remember, been a problem persuade military people and civilians that they operate with one another if both groups are to make nificant contribution to the formulation of defence policy. is simply the case that neither purely civilian oflicers, can provide the country needs in the defence field. Only by co-operation can done. In this field of distinguishing as between connotfitwithin cepts of command and concepts of adrninistraMinister tion, I know that the honourable member for Moreton, having had to face up to this himself a Minister of State, will recognise the supreme difficulty of drafting a watertight definition. What we are being guided by here is the element of co-operation, the element of common sense, and the notions of command and of administraorganisation tion that have applied in the defence forces structure. I recognise the difficulty that the ParliamenThere tary Counsel had. He, in his wisdom, decided that this was a matter for the administration. We accepted his advice in this.",50
84,Mr CADMAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The Ministhe ter for Defence (Mr Morrison) expressed the difficulty a Minister has in his position as adminHere istrator and as the person responsible for the control of a department. He expressed difficulty in aUocation of responsibilities- I and think those were his exact words. He then out the problem of command flowing be from the Governor General. I suggest that in this it is not the Minister's responsibUity but may well be that of the Executive Council or the to Cabinet rather than the Minister as to who will command. I do not think the Minister meant to that but his words sounded very much as if the very he were implying that. I raise again this matter of command and the as difference between command and administras tion. There is constant reference throughout clause 7 to command. It provides that the Chief of Defence Force Staff shaU command the defence force. It mentions 'command by the Chief. Throughout this clause, the word 'command' is I think my friend, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) referred to the deof command used by the Minister last night. He drew attention to the responsibiUty for effectively using resources and for planning the be employment of, or organising, directing, coand, controlling, mUitary forces in the of assigned duties. That also to includes the responsibUity for welfare, morale, discipline and personnel under his control. Dr MUlar has been mentioned a number of in this debate. I refer to him in this instance although I have not done so previously. Dr to MUlar, in his article of 9 July, sets out the responmust cosibUities as he sees them and indeed as we see a sigthem, of the civil section. They cover the whole It area that the Minister defined last night. They purely military officers, nor with what it cover things like defence manpower, pay, this be recruitment, conditions of service, personnel policy, and training and education pohcy. If they do the definition of'command' as the gave it last night, I do not know what does. In fact, we have further evidence which as would tend to support the proposition that there is great difficulty in deciding where the distinction Ues. The former Minister, when introducing the Bill-and again I refer to it-said : The Secretary . . . will be the adviser on policy, on and on financial planning and programming. is great conflict in the Government's mind; I am sure of that. It would seem that if the matter is to be cleared it is not for the Minister to say to us in Opposition: 'Why don't you go along and talk to the Secretary of the Department or Chief of the Defence Force Staff andfindout what they have in mind?' This is the Parliament. is where decisions are made. Here we have the right and the responsibUity to find out the Government's intentions. What are the direcrepeat tives? Again I request the Minister. What are the directives you are going to issue for the operation of the defence forces? I think that we as a ParUaplanation. ment need to know and the people of Australia need to know. One other matter is of great concern to me. relates to the whole Bill but particularly to this clause. It is the Government's power to cause actions on the part of its servants regulatory or legislative basis. We were told last night, and indeed it is in the documents, that the reorganisation of the defence forces has going on for something Uke 2 years. What the basis, what was the power that the Governanother ment had to carry out those actions? I equate with things like the regional employment needs. development scheme, the Australian Police and the various interim commissions which were esment tabUshed when the Government had no directive or power from the Parliament to carry out those actions. It is government by stealth. I feel that defence reorganisation the Government done the same as it has done in other areas. We could easUy refuse this Bill, I suppose. That would tend to be irresponsible. But if the Government is going to treat the Parliament the people of the nation as it has and to opt government by stealth I think that sort of action deserves reciprocal action. It is time Government went back to a democracy and allowed proper consideration of these measures. The only way under this Bill and particularly under clause 7, which we are considering, that we can understand the Government's intention and aUay the ever-present fears that are welling up within the defence forces themselves as to how much say the PubUc Service is going to over their actions it is for the Minister to tell what his directives are, how the thing is going to work. What is the translation of the Bill? What the relationship between civil and military men? I think the Minister owes a great deal to the liament and the people of the nation right now during this debate to teU us his intentions. Clause agreed to.

85,Mr KILLEN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION," I will not delay the Committee long. I again make a formal inquiry as to why this amendment is necessary. The effect of this amendment is to take from section 4 of the Courts-Martial Appeals Act the term 'Royal Australian Air Force'. I will not the argument I pressed upon the Committee last night, but I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) whether he wiU give an exIt is true that the Defence Act does not use the term' Royal Australian Air Force', but do not teU me that it is because of symmetry of drafting or a passionate desire to have a splendid It sense of uniformity running throughout all defence legislation that the term 'Royal Australian Air Force' is being deleted from the Courtswithout any Martial Appeals Act. I shall not, and my colleagues shall not, seek to been delay the passage of the Bill through this was chamber. We rest with the assurance that place in all probabUity will examine the it Bill at a pubUc hearing, because that is what it I am sorry that we were not able to convince the Minister as to the merit of that argulast evening although, if I may say in summary, I thought he came perilously close to accepting our argument. He listened to the in speeches- I repeat, the very cogent speeches-of has the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr ConnoUy) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I thought: 'Well, there it is, KUlen. You have faded to convince him, but those 2 stirring speeches and the speech of my and honourable and robust friend from Kennedy for have convinced him'. One could almost see the look of apostasy on his face as though he were that the about to go over to the other side. Probably when the Bill gets to another place we will find out a little more about it than the Minister has been pleased to assure us. I ask him again on the basis of simple candour and friendship and I trust in terms of courtesy whether he will please give us an explanation as to why the have term 'Royal Australian Air Force' is being us dropped from the Courts-Martial Appeals Act. .",53
86,Mr MORRISON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"In the spirit of courtesy that prevaUeth today-ther e was not quite so much Parlast night-ma y I make the observation that the Air Force Act until 1964 contained the following words in section 3(1): There shall be an Air Force, to be called the Royal Australian Air Force, which may be raised, maintained and organised by the Governor General for the defence and protection of the Commonwealth and shall be part of the Defence Force constituted under the Defence Act. Section 3 was repealed in 1964, not by a Labor government but by a Liberal government, by Act No. 94 of 1964. A new section 4A was inserted and it read: The Air Force of the Commonwealth consists of three parts, namely, the Permanent Air Force, the Air Force Emergency Force and the Citizen Air Force. There is no reference at all in that Act to the Royal Australian Air Force. The drafting change we have introduced here is to caU it the Australian Air Force, but I want to assure the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien), I want to assure the Australian pubUc at large, and particularly do I want to assure the members of the Royal Australian Air Force that the nomenclature 'Royal Australian Air Force' wiU be maintained. Clause agreed to. Clauses 113 to 187-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Remainder of the Bill-by leave-take n as a whole, and agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Morrison) read a third time. NA Debate resumed from 15 May on motion by Mr Barnard: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",53
87,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE FORCE OMBUDSMAN BILL,"I suppose I should apologise to the House for inflicting mychief self once again upon it, but I will not delay the House very long. The Opposition supports the Defence Force Ombudsman Bill. Its purpose is to establish an ombudsman to examine complaints (7) in the area of defence administration. I suppose one would be at Uberty to foresee some should the matter of administration come up, if a person in the defence area says: 'No, matter of administration; it is a matter of command '. So no doubt the Ombudsman's ingenuity will be put to the test in that area. The purpose of the Bill was summed up by the previous Minister for Defence quite succinctly in his second reading speech. At the risk of wearying the House may I recapitulate what that honourable gentleman said. He said: The function of the Defence Force Ombudsman investigate complaints made by members of the defence force, former members of the defence force or their dependants with regard to any action in relation to a matter administration which arises from the fact that a person serving or has served in the defence force. I suppose it is a matter of notoriety that all and Government departments have as one of their case constant companions inertia, and frequently this affects serving personnel and their famUies in a most grievous way, and to that extent the creation of the office of Ombudsman is welcomed. It will enable those who feel that they have been treated in a dUatory fashion, treated unfairly or treated with scant regard for their problems to have some redress. I am bound to say that the Bill is a splendid Ulustration of what I have described as inertia on the part of the Government itself because there has been in existence the office of Ombudsman in a de facto way since November 1973, with a very distinguished Australian, Mr David Hay, filhng that position. I suppose the nulls of God may grind slowly as long as they grind with exactness. In this case it has taken from November 1973 untU August 1975 for the Bill to be produced. May I offer just one bland criticism of the Bill: The Bill Third Reading having been presented on 15 May 1975, we are now greeted with some 17 amendments to it. I would have thought with all my simphcity of mind that it would have been possible for this Bill to be settled in the first place and that it would not have been found necessary for all these amendments to be introduced. 1975 May I make clear for my part and for the OpSecond Reading position's part that the Bill does not give to the Defence Force Ombudsman the power to interfere in respect of matters which are disciplinary in nature. If I may put it in a homely way, if a seaman should tell the chief petty officer to go to Bourke, and tender further advice to him, the petty officer is not left in some powerless, hapless state of mind unable to rectify the blemish of conduct. One of the proposed amendments to the Bill excites my curiosity. It is amendment which deals with clause 5 relating to the jurisdiction of the Defence Force Ombudsman. Subdifficulty, clause (3) of clause 5 reads: (3) The Defence Force Ombudsman is not authorised by this is not a this Act to investigate(a) action taken by a Minister; (b) action taken by a Justice or Judge of a court established by a law of Australia; (c) action taken by a magistrate or coroner of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or (d) action taken by way of, or in connection with, proceedings against a member of the Defence Force in respect of a naval, military or air force offence. Proposed amendment (7) seeks to omit subclause (4) of clause 5. As I say, this proposal exwill be to cites my curiosity. Sub-clause (4) reads: (4) Where, at anytimeduring an investigation into action of taken by the Defence Force or a public authority, the Deis fence Force Ombudsman becomes of the opinion that the action was taken in the course of giving effect to a decision of the Cabinet, of a Committee of the Cabinet or of a Minister that the Defence Force or the public authority, as the may be, did not act improperly in the course of giving effect to that decision, the Defence Force Ombudsman not investigate the action further. I am interested to know why that sub-clause is being expunged from the Bill. As the Bill now stands the Ombudsman must become seized of an opinion that the action was taken pursuant to, say, a Cabinet decision, and he says-this is the next consideration-it was not taken in properly, and that being the case he should not further investigate the action. Under the proposed amendment that provision will be deleted from the Bill. Is the position then to be that the Ombudsman can investigate a decision taken by the Cabinet? I draw the attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) to what would seem to me to be, with great respect, some mild conflict in the Bill, that is that if the Ombudsman cannot investigate an action taken by a Minister it would seem to me, a fortiori, that he could not investigate an action taken by a collection or a grouping of Ministers. If that is the basis upon which the provision in sub-clause (4) becomes unnecessary then it would seem to me to be a rational explanation, but if on the other hand it is to be taken out of the Bill in the expectation that the Ombudsman can investigate action or a decision taken by Cabinet or a sub-committee of the Cabinet it would seem to me to be a rather curious form of trenching into the whole system of responsible government. I invite the Minister when winding up the debate, if he would be good enough, to give an explanation as to why this amendment is proposed.",54
88,Mr KATTER,DEFENCE FORCE OMBUDSMAN BILL,"My comlegislation ments will be quite brief. As the Opposition shadow Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien), has pointed out, we do not oppose this Bill at all. In fact wdl be delighted to see it at least pass through this House because in effect the concept of fence force Ombudsman was accepted quite some time ago. I share the pleasure of the honourable member for Moreton, that the appointment of the Defence Force Ombudsman will in no way affect the distipline that is an integral and critical part of the forces. Discipline these days is not based on the martinet attitude of a regimental sergeant-major but on underthe standing and mutual respect between officers and non-commissioned officers and those serving under them. It is because of this respect understanding which inevitably grows between good NCO and a good officer and their men I am pleased to see that there is special mention in clause 7 of the Bill in relation to a provision that a serving member of the defence force can have a complaint dealt with by the Service shall authorities before submitting the matter to the Defence Force Ombudsman. The relationship which exists between an NCO and the men serving under him is of a very special nature. I would think that the average serviceman would much rather approach the Service authorities than rush off to someone who is virtually a stranger to him. So I join the honourable member for Moreton in endorsing and supporting this Bill. May it have the speediest possible passage.",55
89,Mr CADMAN,DEFENCE FORCE OMBUDSMAN BILL,"My comments also will be brief. I think that this right of investigation allowed to servicemen is a step forward. I think the name 'ombudsman' is a misnomer. I do not consider that an ombudsman is responsible to anybody other than the Parliament, and in that respect I think in it is the wrong term to use in view of the role to be played by the Defence Force Ombudsman. However, I think that the activities of the Ombudsman will be beneficial to many people within the Services. I have one small reservation in relation to clause 5(1) which mentions investigating the matter of administration. Here again we come to the problem of command and administration. Until we have some clearing up of these definitions we are going to be in trouble. If in this case 'administration' is to apply to troops or men in thefieldand is to refer to matters of discipline or morale I find it most concerning. I trust that this will not be the case, but I sincerely press the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) to give us the reassurance we need in regard to that clause. I commend the the term in concept although I disagree with used.",55
90,Mr MORRISON,DEFENCE FORCE OMBUDSMAN BILL,"in reply-In response to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) let a deme say that the reason that there are so many amendments- I apologise for it-is that, as he will be aware, on 6 March my colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) introduced the Ombudsman Bill, which I suppose is the civilian equivalent of this Bill, to establish the office of the Australian Ombudsman. A number of amendments were made to that Bill, and because Defence Force Ombudsman Bill follows very closely the Ombudsman Bill we felt it necessary to make the same amendments to the Defence and Force Ombudsman Bill as were made to the a Ombudsman Bill. That is the explanation for the that amendments. The honourable member for Moreton also raised a question relating to the amendment to clause 5(4). That sub-clause has been the subject of pubhc criticism on 2 grounds. The first is that there is no similar hmit on the powers of State ombudsmen. The second criticism is that, if the intention is merely to exclude cases where no independent discretion at all is exercised in giving effect to a Cabinet or ministerial decision, it is too wide and is unnecessary having regard to paragraph (a) of clause 5(3) of the Bill which excludes actions taken by a Minister from investigation by the Defence Force Ombudsman. In addition, the clause is inconsistent with sub-clause 17(1) of the Bill which contemplates that the Defence Force Ombudsman can investigate actions taken in accordance with an ordinance or regulation, in which case he can call into question the reasonableness of a decision of the Executive Council. So on these grounds and in responding to what we thought were very justifiable criticisms of the original clause we now propose in the amendment to omit the clause.

CRIMES BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 23 April on motion by Mr Enderby: That the Bill be now read a second time.",58
94,Mr STREET,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"This which seeks to amend the Crimes Act, makes it an offence under that Act for somebody who is an officer, member or employee of an organis-: ation registered under the Conciliation and tration Act to steal, fraudulently misappropriate or fraudulently convert to his own use any money or property belonging to the organisation. the legislation a person found guilty of such offence is liable to a penalty of imprisonment 7 years. The Opposition agrees that there need for this Bill. It is extraordinary that, where organisations' funds are misappropriated, under existing Federal legislation all that we in the Federal jurisdiction can say is that the person sponsible must stop doing it. We cannot do anythreats thing further than that. The organisations have to rely on State action if proceedings are to be instituted against the person who is guilty of offence under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Clearly, in respect of organisations which are registered under a Federal Act, such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Federal Government should be able to initiate action in these circumstances. This Bill will enable it to that. The Government is right in estabushing machinery to deal with this despicable form of crime in which a person who is put in a position of trust by his fellow workers violates that trust and steals from his mates. Third Reading Unfortunately, there have been blatant examples of this abuse of trust in recenttimes.There have been cases involving the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia, No. 2 Branch, in Victoria. There have been cases involving several members of the Builders Labourers Federation. These are some of the more well known cases which come to mind. This Bill will ensure that the Senate acquainting it of the earlier action can be taken under Federal jurisdiction to 1974 bring to justice people who engage in criminal in practices of this nature. Clause 3 (2) of the Bill recognises the fact that such crimes are often difficult to prove if proof requires the identificaBILL 1975 tion of specific sums of money or items of property. Under the Bill it will be sufficient to prove a general deficiency in the books of account. Upon proof the penalty is, as described in the Bill, imprisonment for 7 years. The Opposition agrees that the Bill makes adequate provision for dealing with the situation for which it is designed. However, it is worth mentioning that the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act dealing with annual reports andfinancialstateSecond Reading ments of organisations probably need tightening to ensure that rank and file members of organisations are kept fully informed of where and how their membership dues are being used and of the generalfinancialposition of the organisation to Bill, which they belong. I said a moment ago that the Bill is adequate to deal with the specific problem of the stealing of Arbithe funds of an organisation. But since the introduction of this Bill we have received an interim report from the Royal Commission Into Under Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conan ducted by Mr Justice Sweeney. His interim report for was tabled in this House this week. I find it is a difficult to choose language to describe adequately the situation which is revealed by this interim report. Contained in its pages are cases not only of theft of union funds but also of blackremail and extortion accompanied by menaces, and intimidation. It sounds and reads like a story about the Mafia, but the tragedy is that it is not. It is about a small group of ruthless and that dishonest people in the Australian union movement thieving from their workmates and extorting money under threats. Such actions are clearly of a similar kind to those covered by this Bill. As the Bill is presently drafted, some of those do actions would not come within its provisions. In due course my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who represents in this House the shadow Attorney-General, will be moving an amendment to correct this deficiency. The amendment is entirely consistent with the objective of the Government's legislation and therefore it should be acceptable to the Government. I do not blame the Government for not covering the appalling situation disclosed by the interim report of Mr Justice Sweeney because the report was not available when the legislation was brought down. But if the Government does not take the opportunity provided by this Opposition amendment to correct what is now seen to be a deficiency in the legislation it will be very clearly to blame. It would be intolerable if the practices described by Mr Justice Sweeney were allowed to continue. The Government must act now to put a stop to this long standing campaign of blackmail and extortion. So that the House will be aware of the full implications of what has been going on, I shall refer to certain specific cases mentioned in the Sweeney interim report. Before doing so, it may be appropriate to remind the House that section 288 of the Navigation Act provides that no ship shall engage in the coasting trade unless it licensed to do so by a single voyage permit is commonly known as an SVP. Section 289 of the same Act provides that seamen employed on vessels engaged in the coasting trade shall paid at the current ruling rates for seamen in Australia. The first case mentioned by Mr Justice Sweeney in his interim report is that of the Wakasa Maru. That was thefirstoccasion which demands were made in relation to the coastal trade. Those demands were made some years ago. In fact, the issue trade. The Wakasa Maru was to transport machinery to the Ord River scheme in north duress Western Australia. Mr Rawlings claimed that the demand Australian vessel Wollongong should be used. It my is interesting to note that Mr Justice Sweeney boatsopinion rejects this claim, as the Wollongong the capacity. Then Mr Rawlings imposed a ban on the ship. Hefixedthe sum of $2,500 for ban on the vessel to be lifted. This was paid. Justice Sweeney comments in his report: I am satisfied that the demands made had no relation any union policy concerning foreign vessels on the Australian coast. Mr Justice Sweeney also makes reference to what is known as the Marine Industry Group. This group of unions concerned with maritime matreplied ters and affiliated with the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council. Mr Justice Sweeney comments: It had no books, no clear constitution and there seems to be considerable doubt whether it had properly elected officers, or whether it really had meetings. No cashbook, journal or ledger of any nature was kept. The only books available were sets of cheque butts, bank statements and incomplete sets of receipt books and bank deposit slips. Listed in the documents referred to above was a note which stated: 'Loan to member-$250' . Tracing the cheque butts revealed that the member concerned was Mr RawUngs, who then claimed that he had used this money for a union trip. The cheque was then traced through the bank to York Motors Pty Ltd. It formed part of the transaction in Mr RawUngs' purchase of a motor car. The loan was not approved by the union or by the Marine Industry Group. Mr Justice Sweeney comments: I am satisfied that there was an attempt to conceal the payment to RawUngs and a further attempt when the payment to Rawlings became known to conceal the purpose. I am satisfied that the reason this payment was demanded and received was to place money at the disposal of Wells and RawUngs, which could be used for their own purposes, and in Rawlings' case-hi s own personal benefit. The payment was not related to any union campaign at all. We now come to the case of the Bay boats. The is Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd wanted to ship which 400 vehicles to Western Australia. No other means was avaUable to get them there; accordingly, arrangements were made to take the cars be by the Moreton Bay and Botany Bay. I point out that neither of those vessels is in any sense a flag of convenience vessel. The cars were shipped to Western Australia and they were then unloaded. on Mr RawUngs' name crops up again. He demanded $288 for every day involved in the ship4 ment, a total of $2,500. Mr Justice Sweeney related to intrastate comments: Quite clearly the payment was made under . . . I am of the opinion that the purpose of the was to replenish the funds of the maritime industry group and not to further any union policy at all . . . In the demand was made in respect of these two primarily for the purpose of allowing Rawlings to did not have obtain $250. The next case is that of the Manchester Vigour. It the involves joint action by Mr RawUngs and Mr Mr EUiott of the Seamen's Union of Australia. This ship was diverted to coUect containers from Fremantle and to carry them to Melbourne. Mr to RawUngs demanded the difference between the Australian and British rates and placed bans on the ship. When he was advised that the voyage, under section 7 of the Navigation Act, did not is a form part of the coastal trade, Mr Rawlings that he did not care what the Act provided and his demand still stood. The payment was refused by the British crew who were already on a bonus system considerably more beneficial to them than the differential payment which had been demanded by Mr Rawlings. Mr Enderby- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise with some reluctance to take a point of order in relation to the remarks of my good friend the honourable member for Corangamite. The Bill is simply to insert a single clause into the Crimes Act. Although my friend's speech is interesting I suggest that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matter that is before the House at the second reading stage. It may be that the remarks would be relevant to what I understand one of the honourable member's colleagues will move at the Committee stage. If they are I suggest, with respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that will be the occasion for a speech of this kind, not at the second reading stage.",60
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,Yes. I uphold the point of order.,62
96,Mr STREET,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"Speaking to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the title of the Bill which states that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Crimes Act for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. 'Certain organisations'include the maritime industry group of unions and the Seamen's Union of Australia. The comments that I have been making have shown what was said by Mr Justice Sweeney. He said that he was satisfied the demands made had no relation to any union poUcy concerning foreign vessels on the Australian coast, and simUar comments. This money was obtained aUegedly for an organisation and was not properly used for that purpose. My remarks are consistent with the title of the Bill. This is what we are talking about. It is misappropriation of funds which aUegedly were for the organisation concerned and which were put in individuals' pockets.",62
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I appreciate the Because honourable member's point. However, I ask him to be careful to keep within the actual confines the Bill.",62
98,Mr STREET,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I come again to this case of the the Manchester Vigour on which bans pending payment of certain funds. Speaking about that, Mr Justice Sweeney said: It is my view that the initiative for the action came Rawlings and was an arrogant misuse of power . . was acting in open defiance of the provisions of gation Act.",62
99,Mr JAMES,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a tain point of order. I repeat the point of order taken by the Attorney-General. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are permitting the honourable member for Corangamite to introduce these shortcornings as pointed out by Mr Justice Sweeney and related to the maritime unions I should think it would be appropriate for me to rise in this debate and to speak about Alexander Barton and some of the arch friends of the Liberal Party who misappropriated the funds of their shareholders to the extent of $22m.",62
100,Mr STREET,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"That is absolute nonsense. It has nothing to do with the question. Mr Enderby-Speakin g briefly to the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope we can keep the exchange more or less civihsed. My friend from Corangamite is making points that perhaps are quite relevant to a question of menaces, threat or intimidation. But they are the subject of the amendment that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I understand, will move at the Committee stage.",62
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,I think the Attorney-General is right. The comments would be more appropriately made in relation to the proposed amendment at the Committee stage.,62
102,Mr STREET,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I defer to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in due course at the Committee stage I shaU refer in detaU to further cases referred to in Mr Justice Sweeney's interim report. I am sure the Bill aims to correct some of the abuses such as are outlined in the interim report, but in its present form the Bill is not fully capable of doing so. But I accept your ruUng, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shaU refer to this in detail later when we get to the Committee stage of the Bill. I impress on the House that conduct of the nature I have just described has been held by the royal commissioner to be 'entirely improper and contrary to trade union standards and ethics'. of that and because of the fact that the Bill as drafted is not capable of coping with all of the irregularities which were brought to attention by Mr Justice Sweeney, the Opposition will be moving to widen the terms of the Bill to provide against further abuses such as those outlined in interim report which we will be discussing at were imposed the Committee stage. I trust that the Government, in the spirit in from which the legislation was introduced in the first . It place-to stop flagrant misuse of organisational the Navifunds-wi U see fit to support the amendment which is designed to protect the property of cerorganisations in conformity with the title of the Bill, when individuals misappropriate funds which have been paid to them and do not transfer them to their proper destination. Leaving aside for a moment whether the persons concerned were paid the money legally in the first place, it is a matter of great concern, it is a new intrusion, and a most unwelcome one in the industrial relations affairs of Australia. I think is wise of the Government to move in at this stage to try to prevent the extension of such abuses. We will co-operate with the Government in widening the terms of this legislation to ensure that the abuses do not occur in other areas as well.",62
103,Mr HOWARD,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I have only a few remarks to make at this second reading stage. They relate mainly to the reasons which prompted the Government to introduce this measure, or rather the lack of explanation of the reasons why this measure was introduced. The second reading speech of the Attorney General (Mr Enderby) was conspicuous for the omission of any explanation as to precisely why this measure should be introduced. The Opposition is ready to accept that if there are reasons for measures of this nature the Bill certainly should be introduced. The Opposition has absolutely no intention of hindering the passage of the Bill in that context, nor indeed does it in any way oppose the Government's remedying what it apparently regards as an unsatisfactory situation. I hope that during the course of his remarks on this debate the Attorney-General will explain the reasons why the Bill was brought forward. I understand that Senator Greenwood, the Opposition's spokesman on matters relating to the Attorney-General's responsibUities, has written to the Attorney-General on a number of occasions endeavouring to obtain some information as to the reasons for the introduction of this measure. Senator Greenwood requested that information of the Attorney-General to enable the Opposition to make a responsible and considered assessment of the Bill so that it could make up its mind as to what attitude it would take. So far, the Attorney-General's response has been courteous but unhelpful. I hope that during the course of this debate we may be able to find out precisely why the Government has brought in this measure. I would Uke to . commend to the House the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) regarding matters disclosed in the interim report tabled recendy by Mr Justice Sweeney. Matters involved in the Royal Commission into AUeged Payments to Maritime Unions that Mr Justice Sweeney is presently conducting have prompted the Opposition to move an amendment during the Committee stage of the debate. The amendment has been circulated in my name. I again ask that the Attorney General explain to the House the reasons behind this legislation and, in particular, why in an area which is normaUy covered by the crimes Acts of it the various States he has seen fit to introduce measures which are essentiaUy amendments to the ordinary criminal law.",63
104,Mr HEWSON,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"This Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914-1973 for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. I could not think of anything that would be more important than the protection of the property of people or organisations. The Act, of course, is cited as the Crimes Act 1914-1973. If it is amended by this Bill it may then be cited as the Crimes Act 1914-1975. It shaU come into operation on the day that it receives royal assent. I commend the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) for disclosing some aspects of the Sweeney report. I think that whUe it may have been ruled that that report is perhaps irrelevant to this particular part of the debate, it has certainly disclosed the necessity for the implementation of such legislation. This Bill will make it possible to bring to justice people who commit crimes against their own unions or organisations but who, at the moment, are outside the authority of State jurisdiction. The Bill, I believe, is adequate for dealing with persons who have misappropriated union funds, particularly those in authority as officers or members of an organisation upon trust. I refer to the unions which are registered under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. It is therefore, appropriate that ; provision be made by this Parliament for such offences, which I believe are associated only with the lowest form of human beings, to be dealt with. Section 71 of the Crimes Act 1914-1973 is the pattern used for the drafting of this legislation and should be adequate in bringing to justice all persons who commit such offences. The Government is endeavouring, I believe, to remedy a situation which has caused concern for some time for so many unions and so many organisations which have been the victims of stealth and misappropriation over the years. The amendment which wiU be moved by the Opposition will help to rectify and wiU help tofiUin the gaps which we believe stiU exist in this legislation. I commend this Bill to the House.",63
105,Mr ENDERBY,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"in reply- I should Uke briefly to reply to the remarks that have been made. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) was good enough to indicate, first, the support of the Opposition for the Government's proposal and, second, to go on and say that certain regulations made under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would probably-as a consequence of this measure becoming law-hav e to be amended. I am happy to tell the honourable gentleman that I understand it is the intention of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCClelland) to make such amendments, which will give further efTect to methods of dealing with the social mischief which he described so eloquently in his second reading speech. I should also like briefly to say in reply to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that we try to be courteous but we also try to be helpful. I have written to Senator Greenwood on the subject setting out the general circumstances of the necessity to amend the regulation.",63
106,Mr HOWARD,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,When ? We have not received letter.,64
107,Mr ENDERBY,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,It has been sent to him and should have reached him. It may not have been passed on to the honourable member for Bennelong but it has been sent. Those are the prime reasons for the introduction of this Bill. is introduced in the context that the present on the subject is all State law. It is in different forms. It is somewhat old fashioned and out date in many ways. This Bill is Government to be a general improvement on the situation that exists at the moment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill. Proposed new clause 4.,64
108,Mr HOWARD,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL," I move: - Add the following new clause: '4. The Crimes Act 1914-1973 is amended by adding the end thereof the following section: ""92. Any person who being an officer member ployee of an organization registered pursuant to the ciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1975 by menaces, threat or intimidation of any kind to whomsoever compels or induces an employee, employer or any organization so registered (or any member or servant thereof) to pay any money or deliver any property self, to any organization or to any other person shall be guilty of an onence. Penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years."".'. The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new clause 4 in the Bill to amend the Crimes further by adding a new section 92 to the Crimes Act. Mr Enderby- I rise to order. My point of order is that it is not in compliance with the Standing Orders that such an amendment can be moved. At this stage, I say nothing about the merits of the amendment except to say that the Government certainly has not had an opportunity to consider it. In terms of the amendment being in compUance with the Standing Orders I direct your attention, Mr Chairman, to standing order 227 which states: Any amendment may be moved to any part of the Bill, provided that same be within the title or relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, and be otherwise in conformity with the standing orders of the House. If one looks at the Bill one will find it is a Bill to amend the Crimes Act for the purposes of the protection of the property of certain organisations. It is for the protection of the property of the unions in this particular case. It is pursuant to that tide that the amendment to add proposed a new clause 4, which would insert proposed new section 92 into the Crimes Act, is moved. That, of it course, will make it a crime for a person to, in effect, steal, take from or convert property belonging to an association-to take from a union. The title of the Bill is to achieve the proIt tection of the property of unions and to make it a law crime for people to steal from unions. That is putting it as simply as I can. The amendment of would have to be consistent with that title and considered by the those purposes. If one looks at the amendment we find that it has nothing to do with protecting the property of certain organisations. Neither does it have anything to do with stealing from those organisations. What is does is seek to create quite a In Committee different kind of offence. It seeks to make it an offence-and it may well be proper that such an offence should be proscribed under our law-by menaces, threat or mtimidation of any kind to whomsoever directed, to compel people of other groups-no t the associations covered by this at Bill-to give money to the associations. In other words, the Opposition is seeking to make it an pr emoffence to enrich unions, not to steal from unions. ConThat is not consistent with the title. It is not condirected sistent with the purpose of the Bill.",64
109,Mr HOWARD,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I rise to speak to the point of to him- order. The purpose of the amendment is to deal with other categories of behaviour by officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. The Bill as it now stands deals with Act certain categories of behaviour. Those are covered in clause 3 of the Bill. It outlaws behaviour of the type specified in clause 3 by officials, members or employees of particular organisations. The purpose of the Opposition's amendment is to extend the ambit of the Bill and to deal with another aspect of the behaviour of those officers, members or employees. I would ask you, Mr Chairman, in ruling on the point of order taken by the Attorney General, to bear in mind that the Bill attempts to deal with the behaviour of certain categories of people and the Opposition's amendment deals with the behaviour of the same categories of people. Therefore, I would submit, that the amendment is clearly within the terms of standing order 227 as the subject matter of the Bill is the behaviour of officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the subject matter of the amendment is likewise the behaviour of officers, members or employees of organisations registered pursuant to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act.",64
110,The CHAIRMAN,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"I have considered the point of order raised by the Attorney General. The honourable member for Bennelong will appreciate that I allowed him quite a lengthy explanation in speaking to the point of order. I will have to uphold the point of order. As the honourable member for Bennelong says, the Bill deals with a certain category of persons. It deals also with the protection of property of certain organisations. The amendment takes the category of persons and then extends the resultant questions to other than the certain organisations that are contained within the title of the Bill. As such, I would have to rule the amendment out of order. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report-by leave-adopted . Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Enderby) read a third time. NA Debate resumed from 21 May 1975 on motion by Mr Beazley: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",65
111,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on the Australian National University Bill 1975,1 would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill 1975, as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, that you permit the subject matter of both BUls to be discussed in this debate.",65
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate on the 2 measures? As there is no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",65
113,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,"The purpose of the Australian National University Bill 1975 and the Canberra CoUege of Advanced Education Bill 1975 now before the House is to put into legislative form decisions which have been taken and put into effect in relation to universities and coUeges of advanced education in the States. They foUow as a consequence of the Government's announced proposals that certain fees payable by undergraduate students at university should be aboUshed. With regard to the States, this could be done by poUcy announcement of the Government or by the funding by this Government of the State governments with the request by this Government that State governments where necessary amend the statutes governing universities and colleges of advanced education. So, in the States where there were requirements upon universities in their statutes and where there were requirements in the legislation setting up colleges of advanced education that those bodies charge a fee, the States have now appropriately amended the relevant legislation. When the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) intoduced the 2 BUls which are now the Third Reading subject of this debate, he asked that the matters be speedUy dealt with. They were not dealt with as speedUy as he then hoped. There was no great need to delay them a longtimebecause there is no dispute with regard to the passage of this legislation. The Opposition supports the proposals because, in dealing with these 2 BUls, we BILL 1975 are acting in relation to these 2 institutions as Second Reading State governments would act in relation to their colleges of advanced education and their universities. The principal purpose of these BUls is to authorise the Australian National University and the Canberra CoUege of Advanced Education to undergraduate students without charging fees. The BUls do specify that they can charge certain types of fees, that is, those that are not fees in respect of tuition but rather fees and charges for university student unions, sporting associations and the like. In the case of the Australian National University Bill, there are 2 other amendments which the Opposition supports. Thefirstexpands the membership of the Australian National University Council by aUowing for admission to that council of a representative of the staff of that university. The Opposition supports that proposal. The other amendment which we applaud is the clarification of the powers of the Council of the Australian National University with regard to the statutes that it itself can make. Under the Act as it now reads, that Council has power to deal with the terms upon which students become matriculants for entry to the University. In these days when there is an effort to broaden the opportunities of people to expand their education by entering tertiary institutions and, in sities, to confine the power of the Council to regulations relating to matriculation is, if one puts a strict interpretation on that word, to limit the opportunities for tertiary education to people who have obtained traditional academic qualifications at secondary level in the form of matriculation examinations. We, therefore, are very keen to indicate our support for the amendment to this statute-making power on the part of the Council of the Australian National University to enable it to make statutes with regard to the matriculation, admission and enrolment of students. We have in mind that this change will clarify the position and, in so clarifying, expand the capacity of the Council to admit as students to the University people who in their later Ufe wish to complete a university course but who find that at the time when they undertook their primary education foUowed by secondary education they did not quaUfy at the traditional matriculation examinations. The provision of an expanded opportunity to obtain further education is deserving of further study so that more and more people who in the more mature years of their life want to undertake further university study will be able to do so. That is particularly relevant at a time when, as they have found in recent years, universities are finding it necessary to impose quotas on admissions to a large number of courses, if not to all courses. The imposition of those quotas has tended to restrict entry to universities to those who have quatified academically in school examinations. I think all honourable members are aware that some of the most brilliant scientists, doctors, lawyers, teachers and members of other professions are those who have come up through a training based on practical experience and for whom the development of their abilities has come later in Ufe. In the past many such people have found it difficult to qualify themselves by attaining university degrees because of the rather strict requirements with regard to matriculation as a means of entry into universities. I hope that this sort of matter will be examined closely and that adequate opportunity will be given to more and more of the people who in later Ufe find that through the experience of life they have an aptitude for university study. I hope that the basis for admission to such courses will not be restricted to the passing of the formal and traditional matriculation examination. Insofar as this legislation will enable that type of person to undertake degree courses at the Australian National University, we members of the Opposition apparticular, univer- plaud the measure. As I indicated in my opening remark, these pieces of legislation are designed to put into practice and to confirm a course of action that has been in operation now for nearly 2 years. In that respect the legislation is retrospective because it authorises the 2 institutions concerned not to collect fees, although under their existing statutes they may have had an obhgation to do so in respect of the 1974 year and so much of 1975 as has already passed. We join with the Minister in his expressed desire and hope that these 2 BUls will receive a speedy passage.",65
114,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY," I want to speak very briefly in support of these BUls. Both of the organisations mentioned in them-the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education-ar e in my electorate. They are, of course, very important national institutions. Apart from the political or moral desirabUity of increasing the representation of students on the Council of the Australian National University from one to three, I suggest that the proposed changes are in accordance with the changes in society generally and the aspirations of the Government to ensure that people are represented at all levels. A few statistics about the student population of the ANU may be of interest to honourable members. The ANU has made very significant growth. Its student population now stands at about 5500. Of those, about two-thirds are fuUtimestudents and about one-third are parttimestudents. The ANU plays a very significant part in relation to the education of people within the PubUc Service in Canberra and has been largely responsible for the quite large percentage of graduates in the Pubhc Service. The deletion of the reference to matriculation, of course, will only regularise what is actually happening within the the University. At present there is no matriculation requirement. A person is either admitted or not admitted. The matriculation requirement has no relevance to the present situation. It is therefore quite right that any reference to it should be deleted. It is quite well known, of course, that within some of the other universities people who have satisfied the matriculation requirements are not necessarily admitted. Such a requirement is quite irrelevant and out of place in this situation. The Canberra College of Advanced Education is a fairly recently established institution. It is not so many years ago that the foundation stone of this institution was laid by the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton). It has made quite remarkable progress. It is now in the top ten of some ninety similar institutions. The College has quite a broad national role to play in that among other things, it provides education for quite a number of overseas students and provides special courses in local government. For those reasons this institution attracts students from a very wide field. As a matter of fact, more than 800 students at the CCAE come from outside of Canberra. The aboUtion of fees has resulted in some changes being made in the content and make-up of the students. There are now many more mature students at the College. That reflects the use to which the employees of the Public Service put the CoUege. Many of them are people who have degees and are seeking further education. So, the College is playing a very valuable role in relation to government and the PubUc Service. A wide range of courses is avaUable. The courses are generally vocationaUy oriented. They have been developed to fit the needs as they have emerged, in the community. The progress that the College has made in the very few years in which it has been in existence is quite remarkable. It now has 4500 students. The pressure being exerted on the courses avaUable at the CoUege is continuing to grow. An interesting development has occurred at the College in relation to the provision of accommodation. I think that it is one of thefirstinstitutions-it is certainly the first in the Australian Capital Territory-to provide communal-type accommodation in which students are given sepforthwith. arate rooms but share communal kitchens. That is in contrast to the fuU board accommodation that is provided at other institutions. This new time. development has taken place because of certain demands by the students. The general feeling among the students was that what was being provided was more than what was being asked for and was unnecessarily expensive. Students were paying $25 to $30 a week for full board, which they did not always want and could not always afford. Under the new arrangements students pay for their accommodation-thei r rooms-and share a kitchen and provide their own food. Of course, they can do that much more cheaply. I think that costs them something like $8 or $10 a week. That is a new development which has proved to be very successful. I know that it is now being followed in other institutions. GeneraUy, the CCAE has been a very progressive institution. It has served its purpose well and I am sure that it will continue to do so.",66
115,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,"There is no need to delay the passage of these 2 pieces of legislation. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson), who represents the shadow Minister for Education in this House, these BUls simply seek to bring into Une a situation that has operated for some time. They refer primarily to the aboUtion of the payment of fees for tuition. The Opposition Parties have supported the Government's policy of assisting students at tertiary mstitutions by that means. I can only say that we wish these BUls a speedy passage through the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beazley) read a third time. NA EDUCATION BILL 1975 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 21 May 1975, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative.

NATIONAL HEALTH BILL (No. 3) 1975 Debate resumed from 21 May 1975, on motion by Dr Cass: That the Bill be now read a second time.",67
116,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) in his second reading speech indicated that this Billflowsfrom a report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices presented to Parliament in November 1973. On article the basis of 3 preparations a general recommenUeve dation was made for the compulsory disclosure of individual cost of manufacturer panies. As the report was presented in November 1973 it has had a long gestation. The Bill was given its first reading here in May and it again comes before the House, the impUcation being that the Bill is obviously not considered urgent by the Government. I think really the events that have taken place since the report on prices was presented indicate that in many ways the Government has changed its mind, that at that time it was very much in ideological 'hit everything in private industry' phase. Now it appears to be relenting somewhat. But the Bill as it now stands gives frightening power to the Director-General of Health and through him to 3 unknown people in the Departdrug ment of Health who form the pricing bureau and who decide what prices will be paid to drug manufacturers for prescription drugs dispensed under the national health scheme. In fact one could caU the Director-General of Health a dictator when he received this power. The legisnationals-an lation would give him, or through him the pricdealing ing bureau, the power to rhake or break comrangements panies that could be employing thousands of kind. people. It gives them the power to decide believe whether or not a company wiU continue in lance Australia. No other department, no other person to my knowledge, would have such power over people in this country, nor for that matter in this price. area of drug revelation and cost, in any other western country. The Government has not spelt out a clear requirement for this legislation. In fact some its later actions have been contradictory. On one hand it used to claim that the cost of drugs was too high. Now a committee has been estabthose lished on an informal basis between the Departthink ment of Health and some of the drug manufacCertainly turers to look at the possibiUty of increasing drug prices because of the impUcations of bankruptcy and unemployment in the drug manufacturing field. The present situation was not explained to the [No. 2] Joint Committee on Prices at the time when it Second Reading made its recommendation. I think that the extent of the knowledge avaUable to the Depanment of Health is not generally known. There is a voluntary arrangement with the drug companies which I am told is gaining increasing acceptance. The present arrangement allows for a certain amount of give and take between the Department and companies in which the Department says: 'Well, we will let you have the price on this but we want a cut in something else'. I bethis approach is better for the overaU Australian community and the cost of the pharby drug commaceutical benefits scheme. The Department has avaUable to it information from other countries. In particular it has avaUable the cost of drugs from those countries which do not belong to the international patent convention. In other words, these countries do not support patent rights and offer drugs free of patent on the international market. The Department also has avaUable to it information on the general wage level, the cost of packaging and an manufacturing and so on. In addition to the Department of Health having this information avaUable to it the Taxation Office has a special group which is investigating pharmaceutical companies. I understand that 28 of the major manufacturers in this country have had this special taxation team going right through their premises and books to ensure that there is no double dealing between an Australian offshoot of a foreign company-and certainly most of the drug major drug companies in Australia are multid to see that there is no double in regard to transfer prices, technical aror contractual arrangements of any I believe that is right and proper, but I also that this indicates the degree of surveilalready provided to see that drugs sold to the Government through the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements are sold at a reasonable I would like to say something about the price . of drugs sold in Australia compared to the price in other countries. I have seen tables for of Australia, the United States of America, Canada, the Britain, West Germany and New Zealand which indicate that some of the prices we pay are above paid in other countries, and some are less. I that is probably a reasonable situation. Australia is not one of the most expensive drug countries in the world. If one looks at the cost of drugs to the Government under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme it can be seen that the actual cost of drugs has fallen by 16 per cent in the last 10 years. This has taken place during a dme of rapid inflation. At a time when the actual cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has escalated the cost of drugs has generally fallen. The Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) acknowledged this in his second reading speech on the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Charges) Bill which he made in this House yesterday when he stated: Fortunately, the rises in the wholesale prices listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme have been as great as for the more labour intensive health He is at least acknowledging that there have been the runaway price increases. If one looks the average cost of a prescription under the pharment. maceutical benefits scheme, one will find that the actual percentage going to the drug manufacturer is falling. This is because the labour intenaUy sive sector of the total payment for the benefit, particular the chemist, is rising because of our rapid inflation. There are some fundamental issues in this question of the revelation of drug costs. The first is whether we want Australian production of pharmaceuticals. Do we want the technology have that this production in Australia brings with Do we want the employment that this brings tainly with it? Do we want the continuity of supply this brings with it? If we do-and I believe that we do and that it is to the benefit of Australiathen it is no good persecuting drug companies. One cannot have it both ways. It certainly would be possible to buy cheaper drugs on the intering national market from time to time, but one would miss out on all those other things includrequired ing the guarantee of supply. One would also miss out on something which tends sometimes to provide make drugs more expensive in Australia than some other countries, and that is our stricter code of good manufacturing practice. I believe that is correct that we should have a strict code to force quaUty standards not only for prescription drugs, but for over-the-counter drugs. The danger of losing production in Australia is not just an idle thought. It is just about here and now. For example, penicUUn production in Australia was carried out by 3 companies. I think that now down to 2 companies and in fact the second company, Abbott Laboratories Pty Ltd, has ary closed production for thetimebeing and has distainly missed 70 people from its plant. edge, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory is the only remaining manufacturer in Australia of penicillin and its derivatives at present. In the next few weeks or few months, there wiU be a report from the Industries Assistance Comminimum mission. Mr Chipp-Who owns that company?",68
117,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The Government owns CSL. One can see from the Budget that the Government subsidy for CSL is double what it was in the previous Budget. In the next few weeks there will be a report on tariff protection for penicillin. If, as the rumours have it, the recommendation is that there be no tariff protection for penicillin, it will mean one of two things: CSL stops proof drugs duction of penicUUn or the Government subsidy not to CSL is increased dramaticaUy. That is a real services. crunch point as to whether or not we want to not have in this country some of the production, at some of the technology and some of the'employI mentioned earUer that presently there is actua special committee comprising officers of in the Department of Health and some manufacturers who are looking at this cost price squeeze of drug manufacturers in Australia. As a result, a number of drugs have been increased in price in the last 2 months. These are increases in price agreed to by the Government. I believe that that attitude, when compared with the Bill which we before us, is contradictory. It certainly does it? not indicate a clear government poUcy and cerdoes not provide the situation for this Bill that to be accepted as it stands at present. This Bill, as it is now, as I said earlier, gives frightening power to the Director-General of Health or to these 3 unknown people in the pricbureau. For example, it places no limitation on the amount of information which can be from a drug manufacturer. It allows no reasonable time Umit for that manufacturer to that information. It allows no accounting of the overall profitabUity of the drug company in examining the cost of a particular drug. When it one looks at the drug industry, one sees that so enmuch depends on one or two particular drugs in respect of which the results of research have put a company ahead of others. This drug may have saved the lives of thousands of people. In this legislation, no account is to be taken of research costs or the overall profitabUity of the pharit is maceutical section of a company. One should certainly not have to take into account a veterinside or a cosmetic side of a company, but certhe pharmaceutical section of the company To my knowlshould be considered. There is also no guarantee of confidentiality of the information obtained. There is no provision for any independent arbitrator. Everything is decided by this pricing bureau. I would believe as a requirement that there should be some sort of arbitration arrangement. There is also the question of whether the establishment of a price fixing power by one, two or three people in a department is constitutional when this country has not accepted a referendum in favour of price fixing. If one looks at what is required in other countries, such as Great Britain, one finds that there certainly is a requirement for information. I am told that in Britain this is basically in the form of a report on the profitability of a particular company rather than on individual drugs. When I was in Britain, I was told that in some cases the Government itself helps the company because of the importance to Britain of its export market. In New Zealand, information is required on imported drugs, not by the Department of Health, but by the Department of Trade for other reasons. In the United States of America present there is discussion of lowering drug costs. This centres around America's Medicare Medicaid programs, where there is Government financial support for drug prescriptions, where generic drugs are prescribed-this is only a small percentage-and where it is shown by the Food this office and Drug Administration that all the drugs ments. prescribed have the same therapeutic value. When this is all sorted out, the medical titioner will be required to prescribe drugs lowest cost. But none of the proposals make demands on the drug companies for which this legislation will provide. This leads one to ask what is the genuine reason for the Government wanting this legislation. Is it something to do with its ambitions in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals? Is there also the question of unfair competition from a Government subsidised and supported company? This brings us to the interesting question of Fawnmac Industries Pty Ltd. This was purchased by the Government recently and I have here a Press statement of the Minister for Health in which several things are stated. One in particular is: It would also give the Government reliable information about the basic production costs associated with tical manufacturing. If the purchase of this company Government this information, why does it want this legislation? If one were suspicious, one could say that perhaps the Government wants this information on individual drugs from other companies so that it can pass this information on the company that it now owns and provide unfair competition. There is also the question of the suitability the taxpayers of Australia of the Fawnmac purselUng chase. The Press release at the time Fawnmac had cost $6m. In the Budget on Tuesday night, we learned that the purchase of Fawnmac had cost $8.4m- a sUght discrepancy of $2.4m. That is no meanfigurewhen one is handling the taxpayers' money. I think that any explanation on this discrepancy would be welcomed by the people of Australia and certainly by the Opposition. But one could look more closely at the Fawnmac purchase. Was it a good buy or was it goodbye to a lot of taxpayers' money? I have some information on this matter. It has been very difficult to obtain. My office telephoned the manager of Fawnmac to obtain copies of the annual report to ascertain the degree of profitabUity of this company. This information was refused. We then approached the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office to obtain at information about Fawnmac Industries and obtained particulars of the shareholding but not or of the profitabUity. I was informed: As disclosed by the returns, the companies are exempt proprietary companies and as such exempt from lodging at copies of their annual reports and financial statepracThe shareholders in those companies, who at the appear to be very few and who appear to be the members of the management, which is continuing under the new arrangements, have done very well out of this purchase by the Government. I hope that the Government will provide for Parliament full detaUs on the profitabUity of the Fawnmac purchase and some good reasons why it was necessary to buy this company with taxpayers' money. I have been told that this company was for sale for $2m for two or three years. I think it was the only company that the Government could purchase because it was the only one with a manufacturing capabUity that was for sale. Since the purchase-as I said, the previous ownership has continued in management-the manager has sent letters to overseas suppUers to the company to the effect that as the company is pharmaceunow an Australian Government instrumentality special treatment wiU be provided. These letters have gone to eastern European countries and gives the China, among others. This raises the very serious question of the action of the Government in purchasing this to company, both for financial reasons and for policy reasons, and how much this piece of legislation is tied in with its ambition, at all costs to the taxpayers, to get into drug manufacture, beto cause there appear to be very few lines of special abitity and the plant is not of particularly stated that noteworthy capabUity. Will special treatment be given to the Fawnmac company by the Government? The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, the long-standing government corporation, requires a significant subsidy. I do not criticise the subsidy for CSL, because CSL is required to manufacture vaccines and other products which are not commercially available. But it still raises the general quesdon of efficiency of any government drug company. If the Government is sincere in wanting to cut drug costs, then perhaps it should be looking at its own actions rather than at the actions of the private drug companies to the degree that it is. I certainly support the need for careful evaluation and checking of what any drug company may put up as a reasonable price. At the present time there is an Industries sistance Commission hearing on pharmaceutical and veterinary products. The matter was referred to the Commission sometimeago by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). I am told that this invesstituting tigation has turned into a general investigation of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and I think that is a good thing. I think it is good that we find out what the true position is because we have not been told yet. I am told that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, within the last two or three weeks, has presented a 50-page submission to this hearing costs of production and cost structure. This to is important information for the IAC to have. cause of this, the Opposition has decided that this legislation should be deferred until the Industries Assistance Commission report is completed and pubUshed and everybody on both sides of the Parliament and outside Parliament in the general pubUc has had the opportunity to see what is the position with regard to drug facture. The Commission's inquiry was initiated by present Government. Therefore it sees this as matter for genuine and serious concern. We the Opposition see it as a matter of genuine serious concern. I think it is a reasonable osition to defer this legislation until that report presented. After all, it is not as if the Government has wanted this legislation urgently because, we are told, this legislation is based on recommendation from the Pariiamentary Joint Committee on Prices almost 2 years ago, in November 1973. So ifwe have to wait another two or three months or however many monthsdo not think it wdl be more than 6 months-unti this report is out, I think it is reasonable request a deferral of this Bill. If the Government wants the information earUer, it can teU the that it wants it earUer. Until now the Government has not made a case for its legislation. Much of its action, particularly recently, has been contrary to the points contained in this legislation, which, as I say, stem from an earlier, more ideological period. When we have the information from the IAC, a final decision can be made whether or not to accept the legislation. I issue a warning that if the Opposition is to accept the legislation- I am not saying that it wiU-majo r amendments will be required to. guarantee confidentiaUty, the inclusion of overall profitabUity, of reasonable time limits and of reasonable requirements on information provided and on the question of an independent arbitrator so that everything is not only above board and just but is seen to be just. If the public can see the position more clearly rather than Asthere being a hidden bureau, that is probably all the better also. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the Industries Assistance Commission has completed and published its report on pharmaceutical and veterinary products'.",69
118,Mr SPEAKER,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Hodges- I second the amendment.,71
119,Mrs CHILD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The National on Health Bill was introduced by the Minister for me the Media (Dr Cass) acting for the Minister for BeHealth (Dr Everingham). It requires drug manufacturers and distributors to furnish the Government with information on prices and costs of pharmaceutical benefits. It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who showed a tremendous concern for the drug manufacturers and distributors. I wish manuthat he would show the same concern for the consumer and for the taxpayer who foots the bill for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The the introduction of this Bill follows a recommendaa tion by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on in Prices, whose membership includes representaand tives from aU parties, in its first report in propNovember 1973. The recommendation said that is the National Health Act should be amended to allow the Department of Health to obtain cost as and financial information in respect of products a simple in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There is at present no power under the National Health Act to require that the GovernI ment be given the detaUs of costing. All we can l do is foot the biU, even though 80 per cent of all to dispensed medicines are supptied under the provisions of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. IAC This is tantamount to the Government signing a blank cheque in the name of the taxpayer, who foots the bill, and it leaves the Department of Health dependent on negotiations with drug manufacturers and distributors to try to achieve fair and reasonable prices for pharmaceutical benefit items. One has only to look at the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme over past years to see the extent to which the prices have escalated. It would be an irresponsible government, and certainly an irresponsible opposition, which was not prepared in some way to try to see that we pay fair and reasonable prices for anything that goes on to the pharmaceutical benefits list. While such negotiations can be successfully conducted with mutual co-operation, if a satisfactory price cannot be arrived at an item may have to be removed from the pharmaceutical benefits list, and this is certainly not in the pubhc interest. Indeed, it could lead to medical, physical andfinancialhardship on the part of an individual dependent on a particular doctor's prescription, who would have to pay the full cost of a certain drug removed from the Ust. If this legislation is deferred until a report is presented by the Industries Assistance Commission on the whole drug industry, very many consumers may have to pay the fuU cost of the drugs they need for their health's sake. I consider waiting for an IAC report quite irrelevant to this Bill. We still have to protect the consumer and protect the taxpayer who foots the bUl for pharmaceutical benefits whatever the result of the IAC investigation. As the Government in this instance is reaUy acting as an agent for the taxpayers, it would be completely irresponsible not to make every effort to control to some extent the cost of the drugs on the pharmaceutical Ust. The provisions of this Bill are designed to protect the taxpayers from excessive prices being set for some items which are manufactured in a monopoly situation by some drug companies. As the Australian Government heavUy subsidises the purchase of the vast bulk of prescription drugs, it is only reasonable to require drug manufacturers to provide fullfinancialinformation to justify the prices charged for medicines included on the pharmaceutical Ust and especially when they control the patents. Such information will be provided in the same way as information is provided in income tax returns. It will be completely confidential and certainly will not be in danger of being disclosed to competitors which I imagine is probably the main worry that drug manufacturers have in this respect. The suggestion that the Bill be withdrawn until the Industries Assistance Commission has completed its report on the protection of the pharmaceutical industry is really a red herring in this case and it shows an irresponsible attitude on the part of the Opposition. The IAC is examining the viabUity of the industry as a whole in terms of tariff protection which is really a different area. The Bill relates to the protection of the consumer. There is no reason for the Department of Health to delay negotiations with individual companies over the pricing of drugs marketed in Australia as this is a separate although it may be a related issue. The proposal by the Opposition to defer consideration of this Bill is rather confusing. The introduction into this debate of the Fawnmac purchase I found irrelevant. I was tempted to take a point of order but I thought I would hear what the honourable member had to say. However, it was really another red herring. Does the Opposition believe that the Government should allow the price of drugs to be inflated at the will of the industry and to heck with what the consumer, who, incidentally, is the taxpayer, has to pay for them? Such an interpretation is unworthy of any Party which claims to champion the pubUc interest and which advocates an unrelenting attack on inflation and restraint on Government expenditure. I would have thought that the Opposition would have supported this Bill right up to the hilt on that point alone. The hypocrisy of the Opposition is all too apparent. If the Opposition is sincere in its statements that Government spending must be restrained, then it will fully support this Bill. If it is not just paying lip service to its statements that prices must not gallop ahead of the electorate's abiUty to pay, then it will support this Bill. The Government cannot sign a blank cheque on behalf of the taxpayers in the way that the Opposition when it was in office signed blank cheques to buy the F-111 aircraft.",71
120,Mr HODGES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"Before giving my reasons for supporting the Opposition's stand on this Bill I want to take up a point that was made by the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). She asserted that waiting for the report of the Industries Assistance Commission will perhaps prevent drugs from coming on to the pharmaceutical Ust. That is a red herring if ever I have heard one. I wantfirstof all to draw attention to a statement that was made this morning by Britain's Prime Minister, Harold WUson. He said that 'too great a squeeze being placed on companies would result in lower profits and create more unemployment'. I think this is a very pertinent comment and that a very simUar situation will no doubt arise if this Government is given the opportunity under this Bill to put the finger just a Uttle harder on the drug companies. I will develop that argument a Uttle later on.",72
121,Mr JAMES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,Profits .,73
122,Mr HODGES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The honourable member talks about profits. If he knew what he was talking about, if he had a look at thefiguresas I will explain in a few moments in relation to a breakdown of thefigureson total health expenditure for 1973-74, he would know that drug companies in Australia are not making very high profits. Of course one must also consider the employment opportunities which drug companies provide, the fact that the drug manufacturing business can expand and thereby provide many more employment opportunities in this country. If you have capital invested in this industry, as many people have, obviously you want a return on your capital. I do not hear any Government supporter saying he wiU lend money to anybody without a reasonable return on his capital. I am not here to defend the large companies but surely they are entitled to make a profit for their shareholders. They are entitled to make a profit so that they can operate their business and provide employment for Australians. The urgency for this Bill appears to have arisen from the report of the Joint Pariiamentary Committee on Prices. As the Prices Justification Tribunal is now carrying out virtually the same function as the Prices Committee, I want to refer to a comment by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in November last year in relation to the Prices Justification Tribunal. He said: . . . to give particular attention to the problems of sustaining and stimulating an adequate ment and maintaining rates of return on capital which will induce new investment required to maintain economic growth and employment. That is the very point I was making a Uttle earUer and the very point that Britain's Prime Minister, Mr WUson, made today. I want to refer to the Prices Committee. I am currently a member of this Committee. I was not a member of the Committee when it brought down the report containing the section referred to in the second reading speech deUvered by the then Acting Minister for Health, Dr Cass. I want to refer to this Committee because I believe that it is somewhat redundant. I also believe that the Prices Justification Tribunal has faded dismally in its attempts, has done nothing more than to produce a lot of extra unemployment and has created a lot of hardship in business in this country. I believe that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be abolished. In relation particularly to the personnel of the present Prices Committee, not the personnel at the time when this report was produced- I say this with due respect to my feUow parUamentarians who sit on this Committee-it is interesting to note that during one of the earUer meetings of the Committee I asked members of the Committee whether any of them had ever had any business experience. The answer, with the exception of myself, was that none of them had had any business experience. I do not subscribe to this view and do not suggest that if a person is going to be the Minister for Health he should be a doctor or he should be a lawyer if he were going to be the Attorney-General or an engineer if he were going to hold a portfolio that had something to do with Works. Nevertheless I believe that experience in a particularfieldcan be an advantage. The point I make is that I believe that at least some of the personnel who comprise these committees should have experience and expertise in the subject that is being examined. As the Acting Minister for Health pointed out in the second reading speech, this Bill resulted from the report of the Prices Committee. The actual recommendation of the Committee was quoted by the Acting Minister who also went on to state that 80 per cent of aU dispensed medicines are suppUed under the provisions of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So that is the basis upon which this Bill is now before us. In his second reading speech he also said that negotiations are currently carried out between departmental officers and the drug companies concerned. He said that in some instances there was a faUure to achieve satisfactory prices. He went level of private investon to say: If a satisfactory price cannot be achieved an item may be removed from the list of pharmaceutical benefits. He further stated that such de-listing may not, however, always be in the pubUc interest because of the therapeutic value of a particular drug. It has been my experience, as a pharmacist for some 20 years, that no company wants its product to be de-Usted. If a satisfactory price cannot be achieved, then the company has no alternative but to have the product removed. What the Government is saying is that it knows best how to run the pharmaceutical industry and, in particular, the company that appUes for a drug to be listed. I want to dwell a Uttle on quaUty. I believe that the quaUty of the drugs we receive in this country is extremely important and that no inferior drugs should be introduced. I believe that the Government would agree with that. Drug research is extremely important. It may not be quite so important in this country, but one has only to look overseas to realise that the large and reputable drug companies are providing the greater proportion of the new drugs that come on to the market. I mention them as distinct from a number of smaller companies-the backyard operators, as they are sometimes called-whic h in the main do very Uttle research. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that 19 new drugs were introduced to medicine in the United States of America in 1973, and of them were from American pharmaceutical in companies' research. In 1974, 18 new drugs appeared in the United States, I2¥i from the America and 12 were developed in American pharmaceutical companies. Of the 37 new drugs past appearing in 1973-74, 35te were developed pharmaceutical manufacturers. Twenty-six depressant manufacturers were involved in the United States marketing of the 37 new drugs. It is ble that during that period no new drugs them. appeared from die socialist countries, other than Sweden-and its new drugs were developed earUer in a free enterprise society.",73
123,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"Are the sociaUst societies drugged, do you think?",74
124,Mr HODGES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"They are drugged, and they Therefore, produce no new valuable drugs for the world.",74
125,Mr JAMES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,They have fewer drug addicts.,74
126,Mr HODGES,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"That is debatable. I would Uke the honourable member to produce some figures to back up that statement. Does the Government intend to require every suppUer to supply the structure of all goods it purchases? Let us go side the pharmaceutical field. WUl the Governable ment squeeze suppUers and manufacturers and cause the companies to face Uquidity problems, to reduce their overheads and thereby add to the unemployment market? I wonder whether it will try require companies overseas, perhaps those from which we purchase our defence equipment and aircraft, to produce detaUed statements of their costs. I want to refer for a moment to the dear image of pharmacy, because it is closely Unked with Bill. It is true that pharmacy in this country dear image. I believe that that image is not warpeople ranted. The pubUc has gained the impression that all master pharmacists are rich. I can assure honourable members that that is not the case. It is interesting to note that at the moment huncUe dreds of pharmacies in Australia are for sale and there are no buyers. It is also interesting to that in the last few years hundreds of pharmacies in Australia have closed down. The manufacinterested turers have been labelled as making excessive bring profits. In his second reading speech the then Acting Minister for Health referred to patented drugs and stated that the voluntary system had not always been successful hi obtaining information from manufacturers on costs of patented drugs. Let me point out that in the vast majority of cases this information is suppUed voluntarily to departmental oflicers. Let us look at this question of patented drugs. I mentioned a Utde earlier the 13 numbers of new drugs that have been introduced the United States. It is interesting to note the patentrightsthat are appUed for and granted on discovery of drugs. One must look at some of the wonderful advances we have seen over the 20 or 30 years. I refer to antibiotics, penicilby lins, tetracyclines, antihistamines, antidrugs and drugs to treat cardiac disease, just to name a few. These have been notapatented by the companies that have produced The discovery of and research into drugs is a highly expensive business. It requires expensive and complex equipment and highly skilled research personnel. I might add that countless thousands of drugs are developed which, when tested, are found to be not effective, perhaps unsafe or no more effective than existing drugs. successfully developed new drugs are indeed rare. I ask: Who is to sit in judgment on the price received for these hard won patented drugs? WUl it be the Minister for Health or some of his bureaucrats? After all, if this happens and if drug cost companies are to be screwed and squeezed to outsuch an extent that they do not receive a reasonreturn on their outlay, we are going to jeopardise drug research in the future. In my opinion drug research would grind to a halt in exactly the same way as oU and mineral search in this counhas ground to a halt. I daresay that if the drug companies had a budget deficit in the order, proportionately, of this Government's Budget deficit all it would be catastrophic for the industry. I want to go into the question of quality because I believe that is very important. It is importhis tant to the Government because we hear so much has a about improving the quality of Ufe of those who are less fortunate than many of us. I agree that we should endeavour to uplift the quality of Ufe, particularly for those less fortunate people. Therefore, I find it difficult to reconthe Government's attitude in this area. After all, it must be interested in quaUty. I would hope note that the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham), who is a medical practitioner, would be in the quality of the drugs that we on to the market in this country. It is a well known fact that if one reduces the price one often gets cheap and nasty goods. These cheaper brands are more likely to be of less therapeutic efficacy than those brands in respect of which greater care in manufacture is observed and more advanced techniques and better quality control are exercised. The extent to which active therapeutic agents are absorbed is influenced by many factors, previous which incidentally may be compounded. I take the example of tablets, which represent by far the greatest form of intake of drugs today. The tableting process is important because of the crystal size of the drug, the excipients or the substances that are added to facUitate the division of dosage and to aUow for granulation to the tableting process, the method of the admixture of the drug in the excipients, the type of quaUty controls employed during stages of manufacture and, of course, the disintegration the tablet in the stomach after it is taken-no t mention the experience of the personnel who produce the tablets and the developed techone nology that comes only with many years of perience. Thetimethe drug takes to disintegrate and to be freed in the stomach is extremely important when a tablet is taken. I can cite ples of patients coming back to my shop and teUequately ing me that a certain enteric coated tablet that was designed to be swallowed and to disintecountiy grate in the abdomen had not disintegrated had passed through and come out in the faeces. The enteric coated processes and film, coated processes which are used by some companies processes which have been developed years. It is important that in the selection of processes we do not disadvantage these companies by screwing and squeezing their profits such a great extent. If we look at the generic medicines, as they are commonly referred to, we find that those companies which do not indulge ness. in research tend to produce the bigger volume drugs which are the more profitable ones and leave research to the larger companies. I hope that the Minister for Health who is at the table will agree that quaUty control is of the utmost importance. Of course one must also look at brand prereaUy scribing. As the Minister no doubt appreciates doctors often brand prescribe selectively when prescribing medicines. We had an instance fairly recently where doctors and chemists were ought advised that a particular type of heart prepof aration should be adhered to according to the brand which the patient had been period of time. Although the dosage was the same in other brands they suggested it was wise After to keep the patient on the brand become accustomed. If we look at the total expenditure for 1973-74 wefindthat a little over $3 biltion was spent on health and yet prescription medicines required $299m. Of that amount the manufacturers' profit ended up at $10.3m. The chemists' share was $107m and the wholes salers' share $24m. The manufacturers' share was $ 168m. It was interesting to note that on the year there was a fall from 3.6 per cent to 3.4 per cent in the manufacturers' profit in the total cost-of medicines. I believe we have to be extremely careful that we do not apply too many restrictions to drug manufacturers in this country inert because the countiy's health is at stake. prior Mr BOURCHIER (Bendigo) (4.48)-I join in the debate on the National Health Bill (No. 3) because on reading the Bill and listening to the various speakers from the Government side I feel of that one or two areas are being glossed over. In to my opinion the Bill refers mainly to the monetary side of the drug industry. When one looks at that hardly ever notices that the highest profit exmaking and highest dividend issuing companies in Australia are the drug houses. I wonder what is the purpose behind this Bill. The honourable exammember for Petrie (Mr Hodges) quite adexplained on the technical side how one of the most comforting things we have in this is the fact that the drugs which are but manufactured here are of a particularly high quaUty. This quaUty is brought about by the amount of money the companies concerned are are able to put into their research and into the over many development of their products. High standards result because some capital is to put back into the business. We are all well aware that at the presenttimeit is very difficult for any business tofindcapital to put back into the busiIt is difficult to understand just exactly what this is all about. The honourable member for Petrie mentioned the point of profit. Of course we accept- I am surprised that he did not mention this-that the socialists favour profits in companies. It is a rather staggering thing that they have acknowledged, but they have not worked out exactly what they mean. I do not think they understand. It really means that if a company can make profits it can keep on going; it can actuaUy keep operating and by doing so it can keep up its employment. I think the socialists to be looking at all of these things instead trying to bring in rules and regulations which will bog down industry. I refer now to clause 3 of taking over a the Bill which states: section 102 of the Principal Act, the following secto which he had tion is inserted . . . I shall not read the whole clause. The relevant part states that the Director-General may call for such information as specified in the notice being information that is information with respect to financial matters in relation to the manufacture or distribution of the drug or medicinal preparation including information with respect to prices and costs. I believe that this is starting to eat at the very existence of the free enterprise system in this country. One wonders exactly what is behind the socialists ' emotional attitude that everyone in business is making rniUions of doUars at the cost of the rest of the community. As I said before, one does not see these people Usted as providing the biggest dividends. Why are they not if they are making such huge profits? Surely the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) and his sociaUst government should take a reasonable attitude and try to promote the free enterprise system which has been the most successful way of producing goods in this country. The industries that are controlled by the Government cannot make profits. This has been proved. This leads me to the next interesting point. I believe this is the real crunch behind this Bill. I draw the attention of honourable members to section 11 of the platform of the Labor Party or the socialist party whichever way its members prefer to be caUed. Under the section dealing with health sub-section 17 reads: The promotion of the manufacture, bulk purchase wholesale distribution of pharmaceutical products through the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I believe that members of the Labor Party have posite found some hitch in doing that and so they have purchased the Fawnmac company to overcome the reverse. that problem. But reaUy this is the real thrust of the Bill. It is the start of the whole scheme. The people of this country have to be alerted that Bill that is put forward by this Government start to get its meddlingfingersinto industry the first step to nationalise that industry. There no way in the world that this Government is not planning to take on the manufacture and distriare bution of pharmaceutical goods. On that basis, the Opposition will oppose this Bill. I wanted bring only that point forward. I felt it was a very relevant point. Sub-section 22 of the same Party platform reads: The dispensing of prescriptions without direct charge the patient . . . Again we have the same system. Everything is being bunt up for a total sociaUst system and we will oppose it.",74
127,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The honourable member for Henty (Mrs Cluld) has covered most of the petition. Government's case in this matter. The initial speech of the Minister for the Media (Dr Cass) as Acting Minister for Health outUned the intentions of this Bill when he presented it. 1 will confine myself to answering some of the points raised by members of the Opposition in support of their amendments. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) mentioned, as did the other two speakers for the Opposition, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), the profitabUity aspect of drug manufacture in Australia and pointed out that the manufacturers' contributions to the cost of drugs in this country has actually faUen over the last 10 years while the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme escalated. The honourable member further pointed out how a firm was dipping out of production of penicUUn manufactured by the Abbotts company. If one follows that logic I suppose one could say that the way things are going even without this Act that we are proposing it looks as though the poor pharmaceutical drug firms and drug manufacturers are going out of business. I suppose if one believes that sort of phUosophy one will say that there is a cause for alarm in seeing something happen which will accelerate the faUure of pharmaceutical manufacture in Australia. No responsible government wants to see that happen any more than it would like to see it happen to any and other vital, essential and worthwhUe industry in this country. We do not want to see it fail. Therefore I can assure the honourable members opthat this is not the intention, nor the object, nor can it be the effect of the legislation-quite If we can get better information, true informaany tion, on which to base proper estimates of the to profitabUity of these companies-whethe r they is are going to the waU, whether they will cease to is produce these essential drugs-w e will be in a far better position to ensure the very thing that they asking us to ensure, namely, that we maintain the benefits of having this expertise in Australia, to having the employment that results, having the technology, the continuity of supply and all these other benefits which are attributed to free enterprise. However, the Commonwealth Serum to Laboratories also takes a part in this. It provides technology, expertise, employment and continuity of supplies. That was the reason for setting it up. It has nothing to do with free enterprise as such. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are some benefits in having free enterprise and comOtherwise why do we foster a 2-airlines policy? Why do we subsidise private medical practice? Why do we subsidise private retail chemists? This is the Medibank scheme, among others. We even subsidise private hospital accommodation in Australia at a liberal rate. So do not let it be said that because we are extending health benefits to a wider range of people without so much direct cost to the patient and the consumer we are trying to disturb, destroy or displace the private sector. On the contrary, we want to keep the private sector on its toes by giving it a dose of the very medicine that it is prescribing for us-fre e enterprise competition, fair competition, not unfair competition. The honourable member for Murray said that it would be cheaper at times for us to buy on world markets. But if we always go for the cheapest item we will then be saddled with all the disadvantages that go with some of the cheap drug markets. Government purchasing officers are not fools. They are not dolts. They have been in the game for a longtimeunder governments of many colours. They buy all sort of things, not only drugs and military hardware. They knowthis is not confined to the drug industry-that tainly if one always goes for the cheapest item one does not always get the best product, and it may end up dearer in the long run because one has used an inferior product. We know all this. It is a complete red herring to suggest that because we get more information of the true cost structure of these firms therefore we will thumb our noses at that information and say: 'We are not interested in the extra cost of your quaUty controls because we do not want quaUty controls; we want the cheapest product'. This is the reverse of the intention of the Bill. So the argument is against the very amendment that the honourable members opposite are proposing. The point about penicUUn manufacture by Abbott Laboratories Pty Ltd being discontinued, leaving only one producer in Australia, which happens to be CSL, is not, to my mind, an argument that therefore we will have to double the subsidy to CSL or in some way dramatically increase the subsidy to CSL or have it stop production. It may be that CSL, Uke Abbotts, will decide within a year or sometimeof that order that it is not profitable to produce penicUUn in Australia., If Abbotts is such a marvellous multinational corporation- I think it is; it has a very successful image in the free enterprise field and in the drug production field irrespective of private or public enterprise-wh y did it decide to close down production? Evidently because it saw that it was more profitable to buy its penicUUn overseas and to have it produced overseas. If it is good enough for the goose it ought to be good enough for the gander. It ought to be good enough for CSL to make the same decision and say: 'It now appears because there are huge economies of scale to be obtained by Australia getting its penicUUn overseas that CSL also will bow out of the penicUUn production field'. But CSL is not committed to doing that. I believe that it wiU not. I believe that through the updating procedures which are even now in train it will be able to manufacture fairly and competitively and continue in the future to export penicUUn, which it has done in the past in the face of private enterprise competition both in this country and overseas, even though it may be importing some - during its retooling period. So that is not an argument for or against the Bill or for the amendment. If anything, it only reinforces the arguments of the Government. The honourable member for Murray said that there is no clear pohcy, and that the Director General and the three unknown people in the pricing bureau have expounded no clear policy cer- on this Bill or the phUosophy on which the Bill is based. I should have thought that it was pretty plain. The Acting Minister in his second reading speech made it pretty plain to me. Surely the crunch comes in the extract he read from the first report in November 1973 of the Joint Committee on Prices- a joint committee, not a Government committee; it has Opposition members on it too-whic h stated that the National Health Act should be amended to allow the Department of Health to obtain cost andfinancialinformation in respect of products in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Although a couple of speakers referred to that report, to my mind none of them gave a convincing answer to why that is not a good enough reason. They have not canvassed the reason put by the Committee. Let me state briefly the reasons as I see them. The Department depends at the moment on negotiations with the drug manufacturers to arrive at what is considered by both sides to be a fair pricing return for drugs and medicinal preparations Usted as pharmaceutical benefits. This is its duty in the pubUc interest, when 80 per cent of prescriptions are in the pharmaceutical benefits listing. Those negotiations have not always been successful. The multi-national corporations particularly are a Uttle shy about these things. They say: 'You want aU this information. We will give it to you if you pass a law'. Surely that is the very reason the Government is seeking to pass a law. The honourable member said that there is already a trend in thesefirmsto give the Government the information, so why does the Government want to force them. The answer is that that trend has its limits. Some of the firms say: 'Pass the law and then we will give you the information'. That is why the voluntary system will not work. The honourable member said also that overall profitabUity is not taken into account when the Government is looking at the pricing of individual products. He cannot have it both ways. Either he wants to give the Government power to get information on the particular products it is considering for listing or has listed as pharmaceutical benefits, or he wants to give the Government power to get all the information about aU thefinancialtransactions of aU these manufacturers world wide. Now, which one is it that the honourable member wants? If he wants to bring in an amendment to look after that aspect, then his amendment should be that the terms of reference for the information avaUable should be widened to state: 'We want to know all about yourfinancialaffairs world wide, not just information that bears on the pricing of possible pharmaceutical benefits.'The honourable member did not say that. He just said that the Government is not going to take it into consideration. In fact the Government does. I have met with representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturers and we have assured them that we are interested in pricing in a total context; we are interested in the survival of the industry; we are interested in mamtaining expertise and continuity of suppUes, in a reasonable degree of competition to keep people on their toes and to keep quaUty as a factor. The Government is interested in all these factors, but it has not written them into the Bill because if it did another amendment would be moved to restrict the information that can be made avaUable under the Act. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. The next point is that the honourable member said that there is no provision for confidentiality. This is not so. ConfidentiaUty of information which is obtained under this Bill is provided for under an existing section of the Act. I draw the honourable member's attention to section 135A of the National Health Act. This came into operall ation on 1 February of this year. It is very broad. It appUes to any person who has acquired any the companies? information by reason of his office or employment under the Act. It prohibits any such person from divulging or communicating to another, either directly or indirecdy, any information so acquired which concerns the affairs of another except in the performance of a duty or exercise of a function under the Act. The exercise of his function under this proposed new section will be purely for pricing for pharmaceutical benefits purposes. It will have nothing to do with giving information to Fawnmac. It wiU have notliing to do with giving information to CSL. It will have nothing to do with giving an unfair advantage to pubhc enterprises over private enterprises. The information obtained under proposed new section 102A wtil be squarely within the terms of section 135A. The honourable member should revise his opinion. Stringent penalties are provided. The penalty for disclosure in breach of the section is a fine of up to $ 1,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months. To ensure compliance with section 135A by the officers concerned, access to information obtained within my Department will be very limited. In fact, it is now very Umited-so much so, that the honourable member cannot even say who the officers are. Most of the drug firms cannot say who the officers are either, though they may suspect. Even the identity of the officers has, so far, remained confidential. I am advised that disclosure of this confidential information to Fawnmac or CSL would incur this penalty. In view of the honourable member's statement that somefirmsnow disclose the information needed for price negotiations then he and the drugfirmswhose cause he espouses ought to be reassured by the fact that neither CSL nor Fawnmac has benefited in the past from this voluntarily tendered information obtained for the Department by the officers of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Bureau. If it has remained confidential in the past, why should it not in the future? Why is the honourable member prepared to say that he supports detaUed investigation of the affairs of companies by taxation officers-h e says that is good practice and he supports it-ye the is not prepared to have a similar and confidential investigation by officers of the Pricing Bureau of the Department of Health which has to disperse the pubUc money that the Taxation Office collects? Why is it aU right to trust the taxation officers with confidential information in taking tax money off the companies when it is not right to trust officers of the Department of Health who are going to give tax money back to",76
128,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,They have nothing to do with the pricing.,78
129,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"They are the pricing officers. They belong to the Pricing Bureau of the Department of Health. I think the confidentiality issue is another red herring. The honourable member for Murray then said that there is no independent arbitrator. I do not know how independent he wants these things to be. I would have thought that conscientious, dedicated and long-serving officers as these men are-the y are senior officers-woul d have been indepenedent to the extent that at least they are entrusted with negotiating for the Government as buyer with independent firms as sellers. Although they do pay for more than 80 per cent of the prescriptions written in this countiy, that is not a monopoly. There is still an open market for drugfirmswhose items are not listed as pharmaceutical benefits and which doctors, dentists and whoever else prescribes drugs can prescribe. They do not have to prescribe even the drugs listed as pharmaceutical benefits. They are not bound legally to prescribe them as pharmaceutical benefits. They can be prescribed outside the Government subsidy scheme and paid for by the patient. Mr Hodges-That is not practical. Be frank about it.",78
130,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,Of course it is not practical. That is why we have a pharmaceutical benefits scheme and that is why it is essential that the people responsible for dispensing pubhc money have accountability. Mr Hodges-Why are you making that point?,79
131,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"I am making the point because there is an independent arbitrator available for the drugs that are outside the pharmaceutical benefit sehemes, the drugs which we will delist if ever we delist any. I do not think ever happened. Those drugs do have an independent arbitrator available in the Prices Justification Tribunal. But there is no consistency in the Opposition on this matter. The honourable member who has just interjected said that the Prices Justification Tribunal should be abolished, it is a waste and it has caused a lot of misery. The honourable member who preceded him in the debate is asking for an independent arbitrator. Which does the Opposition want? It cannot have it both ways.",79
132,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,We want one the same as the Medical Fees Tribunal.,79
133,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,The Prices Justification Tribunal is as independent as the Medical Fees Tribunal.,79
134,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,You have already said that the Prices Justification Tribunal is not used in prescription drug areas.,79
135,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"No, I am saying that it is used in other areas for drugs that are not listed.",79
136,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,You have just admitted that you are illogical because the Prices Justification Tribunal is not at issue in prescription drugs.,79
137,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,It is not at issue if they are listed as pharmaceutical benefits and the price being negotiated is their price as pharmaceutical benefits. It is relevant for all the drugs that are not listed as pharaceutical benefits.,79
138,Mr LLOYD,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,We are not talking about them.,79
139,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,I am talking about those.,79
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,I suggest that the Minister be allowed to make his speech without interruption.,79
141,Dr EVERINGHAM,CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED,"The position is that I believe that the members of the Department entrusted with negotiating these prices are the appropriate people to do it just as the Prices Justification Tribunal is the appropriate body to adjudicate on pharmaceutical substances and preparations which are not listed as pharmaceutical benefits. I cannot see that one can be any more independent, any more reliable, or any more just than the other. If that is really what the honourable gentleman opposite wanted, why did he not move his amendment in terms that would have provided that where there is a dispute the matter be referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal? I submit that he did not do so not because he really wants another avenue of appeal, another arbitrator who is more independent, but because he wants to stop the Bill. I think the last speaker on the Opposition side was the man who honestly gave the intention of it has the Opposition when he said that meddling fingers being put into industry is the first step to nationalising and on that basis the Opposition opposes the Bill. I think that was the most honest comment that any member of the Opposition made. It is not the first step to nationalising; the first step to nationalising was taken with the establishment of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. That was a good step; it was never reversed in 23 years by our opponents.",79

S.",79
143,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"This Bill seeks to amend the United States Naval ComGorton, J.G. Hewson, H. A. munication Station Agreement. It has been hailed in quarters, which I may describe without offence as Australian Labor Party quarters, as representing something in the nature of a coup for the Party and for the Government. I will deal Jarman, A. W. Katter, R.C. with that assertion later. It may be useful to remind ourselves that the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement has a fascinating history. Before I turn to that history and to the amendments as such, may I presume to Lusher, S. A. Lynch, P. R remind the House that the Agreement stems from the obligations which this country has under the ANZUS Treaty. The schedule to the original Agreement states: The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia . . . The Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) will notice that the term 'Commonwealth of Robinson, lan Ruddock, P.M. Australia'is used. The schedule continues: . . . (in this Agreement called 'the Australian Government') and the Government of the United States of America (in this Agreement called 'the United States Government'), Recalling the Security Treaty which was concluded at San Francisco between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America on the first day of September 1951 . . . England, J.A. It goes on to state various objectives, and continues: Noting, in particular Article II of that Treaty which provides that the parties thereto will separately and jointly maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. Before the articles commence the recital concludes 'Have agreed as follows'. Then follows the various articles. We do well to remind ourselves that when that Agreement was introduced it was bitterly opposed by the Labor Party. If the Labor Party had had its way that Agreement would not have been brought into law in this Third Reading country. That was in 1963. We can recall, I suppose with a sense of fascination, spectacular photographs taken outside one of the taverns of Canberra showing the then Leader of the Opposition, whose memory I revere but whose poUtics I found myself in singular conflict with, and the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). The whole attitude of the Labor Party in 1963 was one of unfeigned opposition to the estabUshment of the North West Cape base. That is the starting point. Various asseverations were made by members of the then Opposition-member s of the Labor Party-to the effect that when the Party became the government the base would be shut down. I will deal later with the present policy on that matter. To give some idea of the attitudes of the day-to recall what were the attitudes in 1963-ma y I presume to remind the House that one honourable member of the Australian Labor Party said of the communications station: The radio station to be established will be for war purposes and not for the purposes of peace. That was his view. I found myself, of course, in disagreement with it.",80
144,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,What is the base for?,81
145,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I wiU come to that later. A newspaper which was the official journal of the Soviet Armed Forces-the Red Star-spok e of the base in sinular terms. It stated: The building of the base, which is close to the area in which the national liberation movement of the people is being intensified, is a particular danger for the countries South East Asia. Those who were in the House on that occasion may recaU that I invited honourable members to say which statement appeared in the Red Star and which statement was attributed to the member. There was, in short, bitter opposition to the establishment of the base. Has the attitude of the Party which now forms the Government of the country changed? The simple, short answer is no. The attitude of the Government, of the Australian Labor Party, is a continuing one of opposition to the base. I cite the Australian Labor Party's platform, constitution and rules as approved by the 31st National Conference at Terrigal in 1975. It says: Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controlled or operated bases and facilities in Australian territory, especially if such bases involve a derogation from tralian sovereignty. I should have thought that that, as a statement, remarkably free of ambiguity. I repeat the words 'Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controlled or operated bases and facilities in Australian territory.",81
146,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,That is so.,81
147,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,Is it so?,81
148,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,It is so.,81
149,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,I am dehghted that the Minister for Defence has said that that is the case. If the Minister commands logic and a sense of purpose he wiU agree that far from seeking to amend the Agreement the Government would be seeking to rescind it.,81
150,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,What about the joint control?,81
151,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I will come to the matter of joint control later. I suspect that what I say will be somewhat to the discomfort of my honourable friend because, far from seeking to give joint control, the amendment does absolutely nothing of the sort. There are to be 3 amendments to the agreement. Before I deal with them. I remind the House that as recently as 1973 the Prime Minister described the communications base at the North West Cape as-mar k the description-obnoxious . Indeed, many of his followers have repeated virtuaUy the same sentiment. If something is obnoxious I should have thought that it would have been highly proper, depending upon one's assessment that that is the case, to seek to do something about it. So some time ago the Minister's predecessor was sent to the United States of America to renegotiate the agreement. He went with a great fanfare and with sustained applause from the country. He returned with applause as though he had achieved of something of great moment. His achievement is to be found in the amendments to the agreement. It is the 3 amendments to which I now turn. I will takefirstthe third one, which seems to be quite beyond not dispute as such but contention or argument. That is the amendment to article 14 which provides that costs incurred directly by the Australian Government on behalf of its armed forces shall, in short, be met. The only amendment to article 14 is the insertion of those words. So there can be no argument that that confers any form of control over the base. That provision deals with amendments concerning costs and costs only. The principal amendment is to article 1, which reads as foUows: In accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this AusAgreement, the United States Government may establish, maintain and operate a Naval Communication Stadon (in this Agreement called the 'Station') at North West Cape in is the State of Western Australia. The amendment being made to that article and which this Bill seeks to bring into municipal law is to the following effect: The Station shall be operated by the armed forces of the 2 Governments as a joint facility. Precisely nothing is said there about control of the facility. The amendment simply states that the station shall be operated as a joint facility. The present Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) said in his second reading speech on 26 May: An amendment to article 1 of the Agreement the station at North West Cape shall be operated while amendment to article 2 Umits United States Navy exclusive occupation to a national room and provides for a sinular Australian national room. The simple fact of Ufe is that no extension trol over the base is provided for. The right United States Government to have access to the national room-in short, the right of the United States Government to have access to the highly classified messages which are sent-ha s not been altered one iota. These 3 amendments represent nothing short of a form of poltiical bromide the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. Government is taking the view that the facitity will be jointly controlled when it will be nothing of the sort. The national room of the United States at the base remains one of exclusive occupancy.",81
152,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,Are you opposed to that?,82
153,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"No. Unlike the honourable gentleman from Port Adelaide who interjects, favour vigorously the estabUshment.",82
154,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,Exclusiv e control?,82
155,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,If the honourable gentleman's Party had its way and if it were consistent with policy it would shut the base down entirely. That is what those words mean.,82
156,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,That would not be a bad idea.,82
157,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Not a bad idea, says my attitude honourable friend from Port Adelaide. Mr Kevin Cairns-They do not have the Adelaidecharacter to carry it out.",82
158,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Yes , exactly. As the honourable member for LUley suggests, why does the Government not have the courage to declare its policy? Why does it seek to amend the Agreethe ment? Why not seek to rescind it? Both the eral and the National Country parties take the view that the base is of prime importance to the integrity and to the safety of this country. We have a responsibUity under the ANZUS agreemember ment and that responsibUity wtil be respected immaculately by the Opposition parties, more particularly if we have the opportunity to respect them as parties in government. So I say to Mmister that if he takes the view that he has sedated the more robust and rumbustious that elements of his Party by amending the Agreethe ment in these terms, all I can say is that the pacity of those members to understand is even more Umited than I have hitherto suspected. This does not alter the control of the base at all. The authority for that is not merely a simple reading of the language concerned but the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who acknowledges the existprovides that ence of national occupancy-exclusiv e jointly occupancy-of the national room. I sum up simply by saying this: The base is of vital importance to this country. It was estabof conUshed pursuant to the ANZUS Agreement. The of the ANZUS Agreement is of the utmost importance to this country. Unlike other agreements it is not possible for any nation to get specific performance of an alUance, of a treaty arrangement of this kind. The only thing that one can cash in the ultimate is goodwill. I am bound to say, looking for at the record of the Australian Labor Party in The terms of cultivating goodwUl with the United States of America-no t in terms of civUity but in terms of mutual respect-that it is an appalling record. Insult after insult has been handed out by Ministers in a Labor government. There has been no attempt to be reasonable or to be rational. As far as the Opposition Parties are concerned, we do not make the sUghtest apology in acknowledging the importance of the ANZUS I Agreement to this country and we do not offer the sUghtest apology in acknowledging the fact that pursuant to that Agreement stem responsibilities. If one does not have responsibilities under an agreement, the agreement is worthless. its If one is not prepared to respond to responsibilities there is no point hi entering into an agreement. It is a matter of pubUc record that the Labor Party has committed itself to the policy that all bases in Australia should be shut down. A former President of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Port",82
159,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,Secretary .,82
160,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I am sorry, Secretary. We are aU entitled to a minor degree of error, although honourable gentleman takes the view that of Libcourse he is cloaked with infallibUity.",82
161,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,On e is paid; one is not.,82
162,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I am sure that the honourable was paid handsomely, but judged by our measure probably too extravagantly. Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controUed or operated bases or facilities in the Australia. The amendment put forward by the Labor Party is a simple Ulustration of the fact here is a party that has lost the capacity and courage to follow pubUcly what it declares by caway of poUcy statements. Here was a splendid opportunity, if the Labor Party were consistent and really believed in what it was declaring, to say: 'We will seek to rescind the agreement'. instead of that we have this craven attitude ing to quieten down the more rowdy elements within the Party. Mr Cross-Where are they?",82
163,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Regrettably, I think they are the outside probably indulging in prayer, hoping that that will extricate them from the present itical distress that presses upon the honourable gendeman's Party. The Opposition does not thing raise any objection to the Bill as such but it point to the fact that the amendments do not in any way at all alter the essential character of agreement and any assertion to the contrary not merely false; it is a sheer pretence. Debate (on motion by Mr Cross) adjourned. NA",83

165,Mr CROSS,COMMUNICATION STATION,"It is very interesting to foUow the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen) in the debate on the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement Bill 1975 which we have before us. Last night was dealing with a Bill in which the test of loyalty was the association with the Commonwealth. persuade Today we are dealing with a Bill in which the test of loyalty is the continuation of the defence association with the United States. The honourbrought able member acted in the role of an agent Affairs provocateur. Although he said that the Oppopost-war sition would not oppose the Bill, he was obvioccupied ously intent on provoking difficulties for the Government by trying to persuade some supwas porters of the Government to accept the view that the Bill before the Parliament was not in cordance with Australian Labor Party poticy. Although he was paying Up service to the ANZUS Treaty, he was trying to destroy that treaty. He was acting to provoke bad relations and til-wtil between Australia and the United States. I do not think that any of these roles should commend themselves to the honourable member. He dealt with the Labor Party policy, and he But said that at the time when this agreement was seekfirst negotiated in 1963 members of the Labor Party said that the base would be shut down. I was in the Parliament at that time, and I well recaU the then Leader of the Opposition, the formerrighthonourable member for Melbourne, late Arthur CalweU, making it quite clear that in the event of a Labor Party government being polreturned this agreement would be renegotiated. If there is one thing that stands out above everyelse, it is that this is a responsible Governdoes ment. We do not repudiate agreements made by our predecessors. It would not be in Australia's the interest that we should do so. It would not be in is accordance with the Labor Party platform or with the importance which the Labor Party places on the ANZUS Treaty that we should do so. The then Leader of the Opposition, the late Arthur CalweU, and the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made it quite clear in policy speeches and on other occasions that the agreement would be renegotiated to conform with the Labor Party platform, and ofcourse that is what has happened. Perhaps I should read those parts of the Labor Party platform. It reads: The Labor Party seeks close and continuing co-operation with the people of the United States and New Zealand to make the ANZUS Treaty an instrument forjustice and peace and political, social and economic advancement in the Pacific area. I think one should say that the Labor Party has always been a strong supporter of the ANZUS Treaty. Although we would all pay a tribute to the work of Sir Percy Spender in negotiating the ANZUS Treaty in 1951, it was the former Labor Government through Dr Evatt, the then honourhe able member for Barton and Minister for External Affairs, who tried in the post-war years to the United States to enter into a Pacific pact. The record is quite clear. It was the Labor Party's intention that such a pact should be about. The then Minister for External worked very hard, but in those immediate years when the United States was prewith events in Europe-of course they loomed very seriously in those days-the cUmate not right. In the circumstances of the Japanese peace treaty, pacts were entered into acbetween the United States and the PhiUppinesthe so-called PHILUS Pact-and between the United States, Australia and New Zealand-the ANZUS Pact. So the climate became right. I know that Sir Robert Menzies in his book Afternoon Light said that he took great pride in the fact that he was the Leader of the Government which negotiated the ANZUS Treaty. When that Treaty came before this Parliament it was supported by the Australian Labor Party. I do not recaU, in my time in the Labor Party since 1946 and in this House since 1961, that any responsible leader of the Labor Party has attacked the ANZUS Treaty. It is extremely valuable to us in Australia not only because of the fact that through the due constitutional process the United States would come to our aid or we would go to its aid in the event of an attack on our territory, or on our sea vessels, or on our commercial aircraft, or on our other aircraft for that matter, but also because of the intimate association with the United States which this Treaty factiitates. It is also valuable because of the regular consultations that take place and the frank exchange of views on a basis of confidentiaUty. This indicates what the ANZUS Treaty has meant to Australia in terms of our access to American weapons of war, in terms of American intelligence and the technology that has become avaUable to us through the presence of American installations on our soU, and in terms of the interchange of information which takes place not only between serving defence personnel, but between defence scientists and the Uke. So I would hope that nothing that anybody in this House does tonight does any damage to the continuation of the ANZUS Treaty which is vital as far as the people of Australia are concerned. It is against that background that this Bill comes before the Parliament. I think that all members of this Parliament and certainly members of the Government should express their appreciation for the work of Mr Marshall Green, the former United States Ambassador to Australia. I would not disagree that when he was appointed as Ambassador to Australia, the position between Australia and the United States was a fairly sensitive one as far as foreign affairs were concerned. I think we would aU agree that Mr MarshaU Green worked in the interests of his own country and ours to bring about a better understanding of the position of the then newly elected Australian Government. We owe him a great debt. I think we ought to state pubUcly the good work that he did not only for his country but for ours. So it was that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Mmister for Defence went to the United States to discuss the operation of the United States Naval Communications Station. This agreement was entered into in 1963 and it had 25 years to run. Commensurate with the fact that the United States regarded the station as vital its communications with its naval vessels in Indian Ocean and elsewhere, the agreement on which is enshrined in this Bill takes the situation of that station as far as it could be taken by negotiation to meet the requirements of the Labor Party platform. I think it is fair to say that the presence of any instaUation on our soU to some extent impairs our sovereignty. Some people could take an extreme point of view and say: 'WeU, away with all these installations'. We would Uve in a fairly lonely world if that were done. It is probably true to say that the agreement will not meet the wishes of all the people. Certainly it will not meet the wishes of those who might wish to see these installations removed. But there is one thing that is certainly true: This Bill provides that there will be no alteration until 1988 in the terms of the agreement relating to the United States Naval Communications Station at North West Cape which is absolutely vital to the continued association of Australia and the United States within the ANZUS Treaty. I , together with other members and the former member for Bass and former Minister for Defence, Mr Barnard, was a member of the Labor Party's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence when these matters were reported to the Party. There was unanimous agreement that the arrangement which increased Australia's control over that radio station was a very satisfactory one. Honourable members will recall the second reading speech of the then Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) when he introduced this Bill. It referred to the fact that increased numbers of personnel had taken up duty at the station. The Minister said: An Australian Deputy Commander took up duty at North West Cape on 19 July 1974 while a Royal Australian Navy contingent of 47 officers and men will be posted to the station before the end of next month. Fourteen of these will man the Australian communications centre. The new agreement makes this centre a joint naval communications centre in a way which did not apply in the past. I think it is a very sound piece of legislation. It certainly is very much in the interests of Australia. I hope fervently that in this debate honourable members do not try to exacerbate differences about this station in the Australian community. There are divergences on matters Uke this just as there are divergences on matters without a defence significance. There are divergences about the proposal to set up an Omega station in Australia for navigational purposes. It is important that these matters be disto cussed intelligently and without rancour in this the Parliament and in the community. Discussions differences that may have existed in the Labor Party have taken place and members, probably almost without exception, are satisfied with the arrangement that has been brought down. I commend this Bill to the House. I beheve that the naval communications station, overtaken in some ways as it has been by more recent developments in communications, still has a useful role to play in the future. It is a vehicle of communication not only with the vessels of the United States of America but also with vessels of the Royal Australian Navy. The presence of Australian Service personnel at North West Cape in addition to the presence of Australian civilians working in the station make it a joint effort in a way which did not apply under the agreement of the previous Government. I think I should say about the agreement entered into by the previous Government that it paid scant regard for Australian sovereignty. The debate that took place back in 1963 greatly neglected some of those issues. I thought that the previous Government sold out too cheaply at that time in the sense that it was not prepared to take into account Australian sovereignty. I think that the Bill before us now does that as well as it may be done at the presenttime.All of us on the Government side of the chamber look forward to a continued happy association with the United States within the framework of the defence treaty, particularly the ANZUS Treaty which is such an important part of the Labor Party platform.  remarks of supporters of the Government participating in this debate in both the Senate and apparently in this House make interesting reading. There are few honourable members on this side of the House who do not hold the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) in deep respect and high regard. I think it fair to say, if I might use ideological banter, that he is a member of the moderate section of the Labor Party, if not a shade to the right of that. In the Senate little was heard about this Bill from the left of the Labor Party. From looking at the Ust of speakers in this House there is not one other member of the Labor Party listed to speak. The honourable member for Brisbane has filled in and has put the viewpoint of the respectable right. The wayward left are not to be heard. However, with the greatest respect to the honourable member for Brisbane I want, by way of introduction, to take up certain points. There are only a few minutes left before the sitting will be suspended so I will go into the detaU of my speech on resumption. The honourable member for Brisbane said, first of all, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would not have repudiated this agreement. Nevertheless the reaUty is that in March 1973 the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) specifically described the earlier agreement that we are debating today as obnoxious. In March 1973 this headline appeared in the Melbourne Sun-Pictorial: Base pact obnoxious-Whitlam . The article beneath it stated: The North-West Cape Base agreement with the United States was obnoxious, the Prime Minister, Mr Whidam, said yesterday. He said the Defence Minister, Mr Barnard, would renegotiate the agreement with the US. in a few months. No self-respecting government would have entered into the agreement in the first place, Mr Whidam told a Melbourne Press Club luncheon. That is a fine way to continue buUding up that reservoir of goodwUl that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) so aptly referred to when discussing what was necessary for an alliance to be properly effective. Secondly, the honourable member for Brisbane said that ANZUS is extremely valuable. He said that no leader, or respectable leader-responsibl e leader is what I think he said-of the Australian Labor Party has ever suggested to the contrary. If we hold to the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, I do not know how we can describe the position of Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party lately removed from the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS). The reality is that the honourable member for Lalor is chairman of a body that is actively seeking nonaUgnment for this country. The reaUty is that those who foUow the foreign poUcies espoused by the honourable member for Lalor are those who wish to see the alhance between the United States of America and Australia torn asunder. Mr Kilien-He got 33 votes too.  assume that under normal circumstances that would be a respectable taUy even in the ranks of the oft-changing Labor Party. Those who follow that cause work assiduously for non-alignment as the prime aspect of Australia's foreign policy. Yet those members of the Left will not be heard on the air waves of Australia today. Thirdly, the honourable member for Brisbane said that in reaUty the ANZUS Treaty is vital to Australia. Of course, we agree. If it is so vital, therefore, why did the Prime Minister say what he did on 3 April 1974 in reply to the former Leader of the Opposition? He said: The Australian Government takes the atdtude that there should not be foreign military bases, stations, installations in Australia. It is true that he went on to say: We honour agreements covering existing stations. But then he went on to say: We do not favour the extension or prolongation of those existing ones. The agreements stand, but there be extensions or proliferations. What sort of attitude is it, if security is any form of concept to be taken into account in defence policy or foreign policy, to determine in early 1974 that no matter what the circumstances in 1985, when the agreement supposedly comes to and end, the agreement will not be extended?",83
166,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Is expires in 1988.  pose one would have to be among the ranks of the most optimistic in Australia to assume that honourable gentlemen opposite will be in government at that time, but they are speaking on behalf of the Australian people at this moment and the assumption is made that an agreement already existing can be curtailed. I would have thought the prudent course of action by any person, irrespective of ideology, would have been to assume that the agreement should run to its date of destination, 1988, and to assess the circumstances then-the requirement for security, the requirements for communication. That is the very least. I have already referred in passing to the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Moreton in opening the debate for the Opposition when he referred to the question of goodwill and at the same time to the reaUty that there have been frequent occasions upon which the goodwill existent between the United States and Australia has been either jeopardised or exacerbated. The fact is that it does not matter how many agreements one may have with another country. The ANZUS agreement is only one of over 100 agreements existing between Australian and the United States. It is unquestionably the most important, but it is only one of more than 100 agreements. What the honourable gentleman said was quite correct. The value of any alliance is ultimately dependent on the reservoir of goodwUl that exists between the member states to that alUance. The insults, the denigration, the constant calling into question of the value of that aluance, must have jeopardised that reservoir of goodwUl to a substantial extent. Sitting suspendedfrom 6 to 8p.m.  United States Naval Communications Station Agreement Bill, it wiU be recaUed that I was mentioning the matters raised by the honourable member for Brisbane prior to the suspension of the sitting and in particular those matters that the honourable member for Moreton as our Shadow Minister for Defence concluded on, namely, that any of what reaUy counts in relations between nations is will not the reservoir of goodwUl that exists, not the formal documents alone. I said that there are more than 100 agreements between the United States and ourselves and that of paramount importance amongst those is the ANZUS Agreement. I mentioned that what the honourable member for Moreton had said was quite correct. If that reservoir of goodwUl is jeopardised or depleted, those formal words are not of the same impact and are not of the same importance. They cannot be called upon with the same degree of surety at a given moment of time. That reservoir has to be great and continuing. May I say here on a question of foreign poUcy. that this points to an essence of foreign policy that is often overlooked. It is not necessarily relations between governments that is important, but the relationship between the peoples of the countries concerned is of the utmost importance. How would we have felt if we were reading day after day of attacks being made on our government by a neighbouring country such as were made on the Government of the United States time and again by this Government? I just mention as an aside my pleasure in seeing the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) at the table. I remarked earlier that the left had been deliberately quiet on this matter. Mr Cross-Shame .  the Minister for the Capital Territory, a man for whom I have the greatest respect in his dealings with Aborigines. So great was his success that he was moved to the Capital Territory portfolio and is now going to speak on a foreign affairs matter. He is a distinguished mUitarist, a distinguished soldier of the Second World War and we wdl be interested to know what he has to say on our United States Naval Communications Station Agreement. He is the first representative of the genuine left in the Parliament who has been permitted to speak on this matter. We look forward to it with great interest. In retrospect there is another matter that ought to be mentioned before I get on with the 3 amendments to the Agreement. It will be recalled that in 1961 the Liberal-Country Party Government was returned, and properly so, but with a very narrow majority. Also as an aside I mention that on that occasion as a student I stood against the now honourable member for Lalor who was then the member for Yarra. I remember carving into his vote to a substantial extent. Mr Cross-In 1961? ",86
167,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Wit h your wife Susan campaigning.  butchers shops and in the street, so much so that I will produce the Press cuttings which reveal that the present honourable member for Lalor went to the Melbourne Herald and complained about her campaigning. That was reported and was publicised. Mr Kilien- I remember 1961 too.  Moreton and I were on a campaign together. However, in 1963, our majority on that previous occasion having been narrowed to an effective majority of one, we went to the polls. But shortly before going to the polls, an historic photograph was taken. That photograph revealed the then Leader of the Oppostion, the late Rt. Hon. Arthur CalweU, and the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), waiting outside the Kingston Hotel for their instructions from the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party on what their reaction ought to be to the establishment of the North West Cape. We know what the reaction was. We know what the decision was. They were told by the then faceless men to question the estabUshment of the base-the base to which the present Prime Minister only 2 years ago referred as being obnoxious. That throws back to the vote of the Federal Conference in 1963, when he was waiting for his instructions. How much has this obnoxious Agreement been changed? How much has the so-called independent and influential foreign poUcy of the Labor Government changed this allegedly obnoxious Agreement? This Bill provides for 3 amendments to the Agreement. Are they gigantic or simple? The conclusion can only be the latter. Thefirstamendment is to Article 1 of the Agreement. It provides that the base wtil be operated jointly. Secondly, the amendment to Article 2 Umits United States control to the exclusive occupation of a national room. Those who have visited North West Cape have known for years that the only area that even the general pubUc could not visit was that particular room, yet this is designated in the so-caUed amendments. The third amendment to this obnoxious Agreement, in the words of another, is to Article 14. It the AustraUanfinancialcommitment to the cost associated with the location of elements of the Royal Australian Navy at the station. The substance of this Agreement is hardly altered at all. The honourable member for Moreton made that point. We made that pointtimeandtimeagain when the Agreement was renegotiated by the former Minister for Defence and Ambassadordesignate. The reaUty is that when the North West Cape Agreement was first formulated we welcomed it. The North West Cape base relays messages to submarines, surface ships and other bases. It initiates no commands, but it does relay commands. The station is a vital component of the United States' defence communications and also of Australia's communications. After aU, Australia uses the North West Cape base for communication with its own submarines. At present, as I understand it, 25 per cent of the station's time is devoted to Australian naval needs. Mr Barnard, the then Minister for Defence, and the United States Secretary of Defence, Mr Schlesinger, saw the status of the station as a bUateral arrangement in the framework of the ANZUS Treatywords that must have been written for Mr Barnard by members of the Opposition Partiesfundamental to the ANZUS alliance, fundamental to the ANZUS Treaty and a part of the bUateral arrangement between 2 countries which share a common approach to the world's problems today as stronger members of the Western industriaUsed democracies. The United States has been assured, evidently, by the Labor Government and by the Prime Minister that the Labor Government will honour this Agreement. I referred earlier, and I must do so again more than 2 hours later, to what the Prime Minister had said at one stage about that Agreement-no t just the reference to it as being obnoxious in former terms, but the fact that he had said: We do not favour the extension or prolongation of any of the existing agreements. The Agreement stands but there will not be any extensions or proliferations. I will not develop the point any further than I did earUer, other than to say that to say in 1975 that irrespective of the circumstances a Labor Government wtil not renegotiate an agreement or that it wtil not extend it irrespective of the circumstances existent in 1988 is crass stupidity, to put it at its mtidest. Irrespective of the security situation, irrespective of the arrangements into which we have entered, irrespective of the threats that may exist at that time, irrespective of the global problems facing the world, the Labor Umits Party says 13 years before the curtaUment or cessation of an agreement that under no circumstances wiU it extend it. What sort of deUnquent action is that? It is a response to ideological motivation rather than a realistic assessment of foreign poticy. The importance of the North West Cape for Australia is that it is-w e wiU state it frankly and we wiU not run away from it- a cornerstone of Australia's security. It rests on the ANZUS alUance, as has been recognised by the Prime Minister. On occasions we have even had rhetoric from the Prime Minister. For example, in January 1973 he said that Labor had a mandate and a duty to maintain the American alUance. The man must be a human hiccup or some other form of arrangement who goes to and fro from time to time, if he can say that on the one hand and yet on the other hand describe it as obnoxious. Maybe he is simply a humanised form of the well known yo-yo.",87
168,Mr COHEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I love you when you are angry.  pohcy of love as the fundamental principle of foreign affairs. It befits him well. The Agreement serves to keep a super power, that to which we are alUed, in the area until suchtimeas detente is achieved. I stress now the importance of Diego Garcia in this context. Let us look at the Labor Party's platform and poUcies. We know that certain segments of the Labor Party are opposed to aUgnment. They are led particularly by the honourable member for Lalor, and I think maybe even the Minister for the Captal Territory may proffer a viewpoint that a non-ahgned foreign poUcy is in Australia's interests. Certainly the honourable member for Lalor does. Secondly the Australian Labor Party says that we should have a nuclear free zone in the Indian Ocean.",88
169,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"We are not alone in that.  allowing establishments to take place very slowly but surely-the critical words are 'very slowly'south of Perth? Is not the Government permitting the naval base to develop there? Is that not inconsistence? If the Government alleges that it beUeves in an American alliance-it says it does but it does little to prove it-and if it then opposes the expansion of a logistic support base at Diego Garcia, it is, in racing parlance, trying toride2 horses in different directions at the one time, and it cannot be done. Why does the Government face its hypocrisy? We have supported the estabUshment and the expansion of Diego Garcia, and now the United States Senate and Congress have supported the same viewpoint. That estabUshment wtil be not merely as a balance to Soviet expansion in the Indian Ocean; but reaUty dictates that if the Azores are closed it will also provide the necessnations ary backdoor entrance to the Middle East. If the Government does not overlook that latter factor, it would prefer to do so because its specious doctrine of even-handedness as a poUcy in the Middle East is no pohcy at aU. The amendments leave the Agreement on the North West Cape substantiaUy the same. They are in reaUty an endorsement of the poUcies of the Liberal and Country Parties when in government. It is another example of the hypocrisy and the deceit of the Labor Party in government and its lack of purpose in stating the principles of foreign poUcy honestly to the Australian people. We support the Bill because it mirrors our intent.",88
170,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The transportation of the  from a place on the right of the Speaker to the left of the Speaker does not seem to have moved him any closer to 1975. He talks in the cUches of the past 15 or 20 years. He talks about a reservoir of good wtil to our friends in the world, but for some mysterious reason according to him our friends of the world include a small proportion only of the countries of the world. We hold a totally different view of Australia's relationships with the other countries on this globe. We believe that we have to establish good working relationships with all governments and aU peoples, regardless of their politics. We do not like the politics of many of them. However, we recognise the fact that the world is made up of a large number of independent units and nations and that every one of them has its place in the new world of the 1970s. But it is not the world of the past in which the ANZUS Treaty was written. Some of its principles still appertain, of course, because there are nations with whom we have such a close affinity that it is absolutely essential that we retain that affinity. We can always expect them to be friendly towards us in times of peril or need, althoughtimesof peril and need seem to be occurring less often in this decade than they did in the past. Unfortunately our friends opposite always Uke to Uve as though the peril were just around the corner. Honourable members will remember the leaflets that the Liberal Party put out during the not 1966 election asking where we were going to stop the downward thrust of communism. The honourable member for Kooyong is still thinking in those old cUches here tonight. The Australian Government does not attack the United States there Government. It reserves its right to have opinions about the poUcies of other nations. It reserves its right to express opinions about other which abut our own. Opposition members talk as though they might act as a partner with the United States of America, and ofcourse they can not. They prefer not to be just the junior partner, but more often a satellite. The North West Cape communications station is a direct product of the previous Government's acting a satellite in foreign affairs-no t acting as innovacould tors or being self-reliant on independent. The Australian Labor Party has always held a very strong view about foreign bases and facUities. The party's platform says: Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign-owned, trolled or - operated bases and tory, especially if such bases involve a derogation traUan sovereignty. Labor is not opposed to the use of Australian bases cUities by AlUes in war-time, tension involving a threat to Australia, provided tralian authority and sovereignty are unimpaired, and vided that Australia is not involved in hostilities Australia's consent. The tenure of these bases and facUities by other should not be of such a character as to exclude properly accredited access by authorised Australians charged with duty of evaluating Australian defence poUcy, whether members of the Australian Parliament, defence departments armed services. Tonight we are discussing a retic of the previous of Government, one of its worse aberrations, one of placed us its most mischievous operations, one of the more affairs. Weinmade malevolent aberrations of its foreign pohcy, one then and we makeno of the inflictions upon Australia which could well now. The history oftheapology have involved us in war and destruction without attitude in foreign affairsAustraUan any possibUity of intervention on our behalf. It was the final product of the previous Governing ment's total deficiency in foreign pohcy in the the 1950s and 1960s. My friend from Kooyong asks: on 'Why is it obnoxious?' It is obnoxious because if century, offends the very principles on which the Labor years, it it Party has always approached its duties to the America. Wesupposed nation and its relationships with the rest of the dence and we always will reject world. Australian sovereignty and authority over to be self reUant and dependent and any part of our territory must not be impaired. This agreement as originaUy written our responsibUities and our sovereignty. I must address myself to one or two other points made by the honourable member for position Kooyong. Thefirstis in relation to Diego Garcia. This is another reUc of the past. It is a flow-on from previous relationships that developed beoverseas tween the United States of America and Russia and their attitude to China. I believe, as most of the nations around the Indian Ocean believe, that this base is irrelevant today. It adds nothing to the security of the area to estabUsh bases throughout the Indian Ocean. We ought to attempt to persuade the leaders of both nations involved-the Americans and the Russians-t retire gracefully to nearer their own homelands. The honourable member asked whether the that Government is in favour of aUgnment. The Government is not neutral but is chooses its own friends and it chooses thetimeand place for its commitments. In the modern world there is no as possibUity of establishing a commitment which still be vahd in 13 yearstime.The Government reserves its right to make commitments as thetimeand place warrant. So to that extent we are unaUgned. We are unaUgned with other people's errors. We are aUgned with other people's needs, other people'srightsand other - conpeople's duties. We reserve ourrightto be selffacilities in Australian terrifrom Ausreliant and independent in foreign policies. But we also honour the obUgations imposed and faupon us by the past. We sttil accept the agreeor in periods of international that Ausment which was written by our predecessors. We prorecognise that it is necessary for this Government without to continue the agreements of the past. We have no intention to dishonour our obUgations that powers flow from them, no matter how much we may disagree with them. I think that that is probably the the message of tonight for the Australian people. or At the time when this agreement was written, the Australian Labor Party was opposed to it. Many us in the Labor Party regarded it as a fundamental abdication of ourrightsand our duties. It an impossible position in foreign apology for our attitude no for our attitude is a Labor Party's history of attempt to escape from the shackles of the past and obsessions and inhibitions of the Opposition. In the past we were always seen to be dependent somebody. In thefirst40 or 50 years of this was the British. In the last 20 or 30 was always to be the United States of rejected this role of depenit. Our attitude is to be ready abdicated wherever we are involved.",88
171,Mr LUSHER,COMMUNICATION STATION,That is unreahstic.,89
172,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Of course, members of the Opare indicating their role and attitude by their interjections. They say that this is unrealistic. Of course, they find it easier to buy goods and get their foreign poUcies from other countries. They are totally dependent on others for their foreign poticy. During the 20 years that I have been a member of this House I do not recall one sensible, independent, constructive contribution on foreign poUcy from any of the honourable members opposite. They were always continuing the cliches of the past. If they could get o them from some text book written in America or from the speech of some American President, is what they would do. They have had a total misunderstanding of the world situation. Of course, they say in 1975 that the threats that appeared to exist in 1945 and 1955 are still with us. When will they look at the world as it stands in 1975? This is a totally different world and they know it. They find it much more useful and much easier to try to stir the threats of fear and hysteria of the past and try to capitalise on them politically. This communications base is a product of American pohcy. That would be well enough were we so totally involved in America's mitment that we should accept not only the comthat mitment to America but also the punishment that may flow from any strategic errors which that country perpetrated. The Americans set out to establish a global weapons system. They saw the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the threat of the 1950s and the early 1960s. Of course, subthe sequently they chose to see the People's RepubUc of China also as a threat. I believe that history shows and with hindsightMr MCLeay-Why do you not throw them out?",89
173,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,Honourable members would think that with hindsight even member for Boothby could understand the position. He does not need to think these things out; he can even read them for himself. I believe that with hindsight from honourable members opfor posite and a proper appreciation from members on this side of the House it can be seen that most of those threats which created the tensions of the 1950s and 1960s were non-existent. I turn to the position that existed at the end of or the Second World War in 1945 and the subgovernment sequent events and relationships between for nations involved in the world scene. It is now pretty firmly held view in many quarters-no t the right or of the left but of independent obmaking servers around the world-that the United States of America over-reacted to the Russian situation. So it ringed the world with bases. It ringed world with submarines ready to fire upon both continental Russia and continental China. We alvolved lowed ourselves,90
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION STATION," embark Order! The honourable member is attempting to interject, is out of order on 2 counts and I suggest that he cease interjecting.",90
175,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The honourable member for the Hume knows Utde of the matter. He may well ten and be educated on the subject. The facts are that once we aUowed this base to be estabUshed on Australian shores we became the target for any counter-action by the Russians against anything the Americans could do. We placed ourselves in a situation where we could have been involved in a war or a war-like action without any possibUity of intervention on our part and without any possibUity of our preventing that happening to us. Perhaps we could even be held as hostage because we would be much more expendable than the cities of America. I make no apology tonight for repeating the spirit of the words which we uttered 10 or 12 comyears ago. I and the Labor movement believe the abdication of the sovereignty over our own territory in situations such as this gets pretty close to treachery. I hold a very strong view about this. I can have no respect for the people who initiated it, or who sponsored it, or who still support it. I believe they did a great disservice to Australian people and to Australia's role in the world. The original agreement which was signed meant that we accepted a total involvement in any conflict between, in all probability, either Russia and America or America and China. I do not see how honourable members opposite can justify that in any way at aU.  the honourable close the base down? Mr MCLeay-Answe r that question.",90
176,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I said earUer, and I repeat it the slow learners opposite, that this Government is prepared to honour those agreements, even those the contents of which they abhor. We have no intention whatsoever of departing from our duty as the representatives of Australia in this regard. When the agreement was written 12 13 years ago many of us held the view that no was entitled to allow its writ to run so much longer than the charter which comes a with an election. We are all elected for 3 years. of That is a reasonable charter. Beyond that we are hostages for the future. Of course it is unreasonable to impose a strict Umit of 3 years on any agreement which the Government may the make. But I think the 25 years which was inin this agreement was quite conscienceless on the part of the Opposition. I stUl believe it was quite conscienceless. No government should on such a proposition. So we carry the for Hume, who agreement forward. My friend the former honourable member for Bass negotiated with the best of goodwUl and to best of his abUity with the American Governlisment. The American Government made some concessions in relation to the position which it had originaUy taken. America has gone as far as it is prepared to go. Because of the terms of the agreement we are unable to alter it in any way without a breach of faith. That is the last thing we will do. Therefore tonight this Government is asserting that it will undertake to accept the agreements of the past, whether or not we agree with them. We undertake to continue them while they run. But we still reserve our right, at portunity, to negotiate with the other party to the agreement for a change towards a greater Australian involvement and sovereignty. So the issue here tonight is the further protection of Australia's sovereignty and its right to control its own destiny. I hope that never again will we have to be launched upon such a debate as this. I hope that when this agreement has run its course we wiU not any more embark upon such a commitment. The honourable member for Kooyong made Ught of or sneered at the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has said that we would neither extend it nor rewrite it. ",90
177,Mr BRYANT,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I have the words here. In 1988 the world may well be a different one. We can rest confident that no matter how much the world may change, no matter how different it may be, the honourable members opposite will still continue to Uve in the past.",91
178,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The rather incredible opposition to the Bill that we have just heard from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) leads me to suspect that he will vote against the measure. Let me explain to the people of Australia who are listening, and even to the Minister, that the product of what he said, the innuendo-the treachery assertion which is despicable for the man and the Minister and indicative of the low minded attitude of so many of those who currently and temporarily hold sway as Ministers of the Government-in dicates that incompetently they have gone out and preached their phUosophy and have returned to this House and denied a product of this ministerial negotiation. Make no mistake, the ministerial negotiation is a faUure if the Ministers believe what the Labor Party asserts. The Labor Party asserts, if one turns to its phUosophy as promulgated by the 31 st National Conference at Terrigal",91
179,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,Rea d out the Country Party's policy on bases.,91
180,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I would be very happy to do so. It would be a joUy sight more profitable than anything one would get out of the Labor Party. I am glad that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has come into the House because I think South Australia is probably almost as dereUct as Tasmania. I am not too sure whether the Labor Party in Tasmania remains as one with the Federal cause. Mind you, the Labor Party is about to lose aU Federal seats so one any opmust sympathise with its present stance. Federally the Labor Party's left wing in Tasmania is trying to control and stamp into the ground those few within the right whig of the party who survive. It was a formerrightwing Labor Minister from Tasmania, who thank goodness has lost his seat, who brought forward the measure we are debating tonight. Let me come back to the phUosophy of the Labor Party. It can be stated in these words: 'Labor is opposed to the existence of foreign owned, controlled or operated bases and facilities on Australian territory especially if such bases involve a derogation from Australian sovereignty'. They are brave words, but what utter nonsense it is when we look at what the Labor Party is doing tonight. Mr Innes-What is wrong with that?",91
181,Mr SINCLATR,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I am glad to hear the honourable member contribute his two penn'orth, but I suspect that we will have within the ranks of the Government many who, if they agree with what they have asserted, will vote against this measure tonight because they have not been able to implement in any way the product of their policy. Where does this agreement in any way contravene Australian sovereignty? I will go back and show the honourable member in a moment for I think it is necessary that we do so. Where does this agreement in any way achieve what the left seeks, that is, the complete withdrawal of the United States presence in our part of the world? This particular negotiation, as honourable members will recall, came immediately after three of the senior Ministers of the Government-min d you, some of them have since had their day-denigrate d the man and the administration of the United States. There was the honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) who shortly afterwards became the Deputy Prime Minister; the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) the former Minister for Labor and Immigration- I am not too sure where he is now-wh o at that stage also made certain remarks, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). Those 3 Ministers and the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made very brave assertions against the United States. This agreement was the grand achievement. This was how the Labor Party demonstrated that no longer was it prepared to have the Americans on our shore. It is interesting to note that in March 1973 the present Prime Minister said that the base pact was obnoxious. He went on to say that the North West Cape base agreement with the United States was obnoxious and that the then Defence Minister (Mr Barnard) would renegotiate the agreement with the United States within a few months. Renegotiate, mind you; not just add a few words here and there. It would be a fundamental renegotiation. No self-respecting government would have entered into the agreement in the first place, Mr Whitlam told a Melbourne Press Club lunch. The Prime Minister went on to say that the Agreement gives the United States sole control over the secret radio base fbr 25 years. What do we have in this respect? We have a wet squib. Let us look at the additions that we have before us. There are to be 3 amendments to the Agreement. The Bill is a Bill of 2 pages. The whole totality of the additions is 3 minimal extensions to 3 Articles of the Agreement none of which affects the continuity of Australian sovereignty. The preservation of Australian sovereignty was written into the Agreement in the first place, not by the Labor puppets of the socialist extremists from outside but during a speech which Sir Garfield Barwick deUvered in this place on 9 May 1963. In it Sir Garfield asserted, in the first instance, that the first of the broad principles that each Government recognised in the course of negotiations was that the Agreement and the obligation it creates respect the sovereignty of each. So there has been no change in respect of sovereignty. That was written into the Agreement by a government of our persuasion. The present Government-the persons opposite who are so prepared to denigrate the American presence-di d not achieve the preservation of Australian sovereignty. It did not in any way change the Articles which were written into the Agreement way back in 1963. That is not to be the change to Article 1 of the Bill. The only change to Article 1 is of such significance that - o h dear me-the left wing must have been really delighted. It provides that the station shah be operated by the armed forces of the 2 governments as a joint faciUty. What happens? Do honourable members know where the 47 officers and men of the Royal Australian Navy are allowed to go? They are aUowed access to exactly the same facUities at the North West Cape base as is any Australian or overseas tourist who goes there by a Pioneer bus. My word it was a remarkable achievement! It was really quite extraordinary! We heard brave assertions of treachery from the buffoon who preceded me in the debate. We heard the claim that the particular obligation entered into by Australia and the United States was going to be changed so fundamentally that the joint forces of the 2 countries were going to operate in a way which was in some way going to add to Australia's preservation of sovereignty and maintenance of the base. That is not true. The assertion and preservation of the Australian sovereignty came from the negotiations concluded by the Liberal-Country Party Government back in 1963. I think it is quite important that we remember that. Lest those of the left wing on the other side of the chamber have any doubts about the matter let me refer to page 1223 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 9 May 1963. There they will find that the then Minister for External Affairs and Attorney-General laid down in quite clear and demonstrative form the fact that we were quite determined that Australian sovereignty in no way would be prejudiced. The second thing that he asserted was that the control of the station should rest with the United States. Of course, the left wing has said: 'That is diabolical. That does not agree with our Party platform'. But what changes have there been to the control exercised by the United States? Proposed article 2 has not been changed. It will remain as it is at present. It provides that 'exclusive use and occupancy thereof will be vested in the United States Government. It talks about granting to the United States Government all necessary tights of access to such land. There is reference to exclusive use, exclusive occupancy and all necessary rights of access. What change has the former Minister for Defence secured? Absolutely none. The third principle which each government recognised in the course of the negotiations was that when desired by either the United States or Australia there should be consultation between the 2 governments as to matters connected with the station and its use. That is a very proper provision. It is the provision by which the former honourable member for Bass was able to enter into this extension of the old agreement. There is talk of proper consultation and of the proper way in which changes might be entered into. What change has there been to that provision? Absolutely none. That provision was written into the agreement in case it was thought for some reason by a responsible government to be necessary to enter into some changes. The fourth principle which each government recognised in the course of the negotiations was that the Australian armed forces should have the use of the communication services of the station. That always has been the position. Has there been any extension of it? Of course not. That position remains. In other words, within the framework of this agreement-no t changed by any discussions in this House tonight or by anything the former member for Bass has achieved, obtained simply because of that past negotiation back in 1963-ther e is a continuation of the situation that the Australian armed forces may have the use of the communications service of the station. That is a very worthwhUe and necessary reason for the station being there. The next principle reads: Fifthly, that the Australian to make a revenue profit out of the American establishment, maintenance or operation of the station and that, where possible, it should assist to minimize the cost of the station the American Government. Of course that is the reason that we have the ond change, that in clause 3 article 14 should amended by the addition of the words 'other than costs incurred directly by the Australian personnel, Government on behalf of its What has this great renegotiation achieved? It Australian law andshould has achieved the bearing of the responsibUity the costs of those Australian servicemen curpreserve rently in the North West Cape in accordance with the origial agreement. The Australian did Government will pay for the Australian naval any personnel who are there. What a remarkable achievement! Goodness me. Mr Kilien-That is the only thing that has minor happened.",91
182,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMUNICATION STATION,"As my colleague said, the present only product of the demonstrably anti-American attitudes of this Government, particularly Left, are that the Australian Government wtil pay for the 47 naval officers and men who are stationed there as part of the joint service ment. What a remarkable achievement! There wtil be 3 minimal extensions to the agreement. Those 3 extensions are where the left wing has either been done in the eye or the Australian people are being completely hoodwinked by the assertions that the Government has been able achieve some remarkable extension of Auswhich traUan sovereignty. Of course this is part and product of what the Government normally does. We become used to it. I shall continue to quote from Sir Garfield Barwick's address back in 1963. He stated: Sixthly, that in the establishment, ance of the station, the maximum practicable use tralian resources should be made. What afitand proper assertion that is. There is no extension by the Labor Party. Australian resources? Indeed the present Minister for Defence-w e have heard Uttle of him-and his predecessor, have been trying to deny the use of Australian resources and materials and manufacturing capacity in the re-equipment and extension of the Australian armed forces. Indeed in their manufacturing policy and economic policy they are denying the abUity of the Australian people to produce the goods and the equipment which might be needed in the event of a future conflict. Pity help us if it should ever occur. The provision I just quoted was written into that original agreement. There is no change by the Labor Party. It remains as it was. The next principle Government should not seek reads: Seventhly, that, without submitting to the jurisdiction of to Australian courts, or compromising its sovereignty, the United States would conform to Australian law and its personnel would observe it. sec-There we are. We not only wrote in the preserbe vation of Australia sovereignty, we also wrote in specifically that those who, being United States for the time being are within Ausarmed forces'. traUan sovereignty be properly subject to Australian courts. How in for any way did we renege on our responsibUities to Australian sovereignty? Of course we not. The Labor Government could not find reason to fault us. It has not changed that clause for that clause was fit and properly included in the original agreement. Indeed, the changes to the agreement, even down to the very amendments that have been written in by the re-negotiation of which the former Minister for Defence was so proud and of which the Minister for the Capital Territory is so critical, are so minimal that it is laughable that of its the Bill comes before us at all. Mr Kilien-He caUed it treachery. detach Mr SINCLAIR-The Minister for the Capital Territory caUed it treachery. He used hard and harsh words. I suspect he wtil vote against the Bill. We on this side of the House see no reason to do other than support it. The extensions that have been written into this measure are no more to than an extension of the fundamental principles we asserted in that original agreement. Having looked specifically at those few minimal extensions and having contrasted the position of the left wing of the Labor Party and the reaUty of what it has achieved I turn now to look at the reaUty of where we are and our relations with the United States and the reaUty of what operation and maintenof Austhis agreement means. The Australian Labor Party has said a great deal that has tended to cause concern amongst the people of Australia because it is prepared to deny any threat, any fear and any circumstances within which there might be any armed attack on this continent for the next 15 years. The Government has told us of strategic assessments. It has told us that it wants a nuclear free zone. It has told us that it does want the Americans in Diego Garcia. It has told us that it disagrees with much of American policy. In fact, what the Government has done is to put Australia in a position where, to a greater degree than ever before, we are subject to the wiU and direction of countries which obviously must be a threat to the future stabUity of the world. Surely nobody in the Parliament will suggest that between China and the Union of Soviet SociaUst Republics there is anything but rather unfriendly and arm's length relations. Surely the Government recognises that one of the greatest threats to stabUity in the world today Ues in the uncertain relationship between those 2 communist powers. Surely even the Government accepts that the product of the reopening of the Suez Canal and the equipment of the Russian bases around the Indian Ocean is that Australia stands very vulnerable and a long way from those with whom she has been associated in the past. Surely even the present Government recognises that the cUmate which it has created following the Guam Doctrine-for a whtie it was known as the Nixon Doctrine, but I suspect that today it is known again as the Guam Doctrine-is that the United. States would expect us to be capable of playing and wtiling and prepared to play our part in this area of the world. On the one hand the Government says that it supports ANZUS; yet on the other hand we hear a speech such as that made a moment ago by the Minister for the Capital Territory- a man who for the time being is a Minister in the Government. He atieges treachery. That is one of the most serious allegations that one can make against an individual or a government. He aUeges treachery simply because the present Opposition had the foresight and the responsibUity to take out an insurance to bring the greatest power in the world into a position where it would be aUgned with us. I cannot express too highly my concern that the product of the Labor regime in this country that there is no longer the certainty of that tinued close and friendly relationship between the United States and Australia. Indeed, the very product of what the speaker who preceded me said is that Labor is not content to have so mented Australia's relationships or so severed those relationships by aU its past assertions. He seeks to go much further. In the assertions that has made tonight, surely he has demonstrated that there is stiLL unhappiness among the members of his Party about those agreements that still exist. He demonstrated, in what he said, that the security that Ues within the context of agreements such as this is not for him. The only securnot ity he seeks is some type of continued dialogue with the people of the communist countries to our north, communist countries whose future relationship with each other, even if not with us, is uncertain, communist countries in our region whose threat each and everv member of the Labor Party denies. It is interesting to conjecture on the form that the present expression of the phUosophy and policy of the Labor Party will take-disengagemen t and disarmament, and the complete denigration of defence arrangements which provide some type of cover against the run-down for which they have been responsible. On this side of the Parliament we support Agreement, but beyond that we support the principle behind it. We do not believe in warmongering, but we do believe in security and defence. We believe that the attitudes and principles that lie behind this Agreement are fundamental to the survival of this country, and it is despicable that the Minister or any other member of the Government of this country should perform as he did in this House tonight.",93
183,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,"It was not the intention of several honourable members on this side of the House to speak to this Bill tonight. Sitting here Ustening to the views put forward by spokesmen from the Opposition, it became crystal clear that this Bill was being used as a vehicle to turn Australia back to the debates that we have had since 1949-debate s on the Petrov affair, Vietnam and foreign bases. As there is no longer reason for debates on Vietnam, South-East Asia or lndo-China we are now getting back to the bases. We have gone the full cycle. We have to take seriously the views of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who has just concluded his remarks, and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) because they happen to be the two very is distinguished visitors from Australia who were conthe last people to shake hands with President Thieu and Lon Nol when they were still in office. Those poor fellows, representing democracy in their own countries, got away with only $100m fragworth of gold between them. They were fine defenders of what the Liberal Party and the Australian National Country Party stand for. It is sighe nificant that so much attention has been paid to this debate by spokesmen opposite. Since the Uberation of China they no longer can proceed with the 'fear of Asia' debate which had been with us since 1949. They now seek a return to the debate on bases. It becomes a test of where every individual stands, where every party stands, where every group stands. Everybody receives a tag for what they say about American bases. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), who has been quoted here quite a lot, was perfectly correct: The Agreement will not be signed in future. No government, in its right mind, would again sign an agreement such as the one which was signed in 1963. The Opposition would not sign such an agreement; we would not. It is about time that members of the Opposition stood up and said so. Honourable members opposite talk about what will happen in 1988 but I point out that very few of us, traveUing economy class, wtil be here to put up with it. Many of us will not be here to determine what decisions wtil be reached. Members of the Opposition still refuse to recognise what is happening in the world, especiaUy in our part of the world. At a time when the super powers-the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs and the United States of America-hav e nuclear arsenals that can destroy the world one hundred times over, a Uttle rational debate about what part a country plays in its own poUcies about what influence it may have in its own region and about how it may be able to persuade in some small way the actions of the super powers, is extremely important. There can be no doubt from any unbiased observer's point of view that the attitudes and the poUcies of the conservative parties in Australia over our relations with Asia were totaUy wrong. The sacrifice of 490 Australian Uves in Vietnam stands condemned as a pinnacle of Liberal Party pohcy. The Agreement on the North West Cape was signed in 1963 when, by stealth, we were sending military advisers into Vietnam. As it turns out, it was not the Americans who asked us to go into Vietnam; we asked the Americans to let us go into Vietnam. It is this sort of feeling and this of environment that existed in the mid-1960s under a Liberal-Country Party Government. It was aU for home consumption. There was no world diplomacy about it. No standing up for Australia's own rights was involved. It was merely for home consumption for poltiical purposes each 3 years because the then Goverrynent was domg very well out of it. The attitude of the then Government was: 'It is better to fight them up there than down here. Let us drop napalm on the Vietnamese, on the Cambodians and anybody at all as long as we are convincing the people of Australia that unless we do it they wtil be down here to take over this country'. Those countries happen to be liberated and the policies of those countries and the countries nearby happen to be changing very radicaUy. One could go back over the attitudes. It is interesting that members of the Country Party-the steerage of the coalition-ge t up tonight to speak. For many years members of the Country Party said: 'Do not recognise China. Do not go near China. Just let China buy our wheat'. I go to China as frequently as I am able to do so. One trips over Australian farmers in China; one cannot move without running into bus loads of Australian farmers. They are all probably deducting their expenses from their tax. People must look at the role that we can play. We are not near Washington and we are not near London. We are part of Asia and we can have some influence on it. For years the Liberal and Country parties said that the Labor Party was wrong on Vietnam. No one has said seriously tonight that we were wrong. From now until 1988 the basis of the Opposition argument will be 'Labor Party, you are wrong'. In 1988 the present Opposition wiU run away from the issue. The Opposition wtil not say-n o spokesman has said itthat it would sign another agreement such as this or that it would propose to sign further agreements.  we would not.",94
184,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The honourable member for Kooyong, who took his fuU 20 minutes",95
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The Chair has been very patient and tolerant tonight. It realises that tempers might flare in the debate, but I would ask the honourable member for Kooyong td contain himself.",95
186,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,"Much has been made of the Labor Party poUcy. When one asks spokesmen from the other side to elucidate their own policies nothing comes forward. No member of the sort National Country Party or the Liberal Party can stand up as I , a member of the Australian Labor Party, am doing now and hold up a copy of the poUcy of his poltiical party. The Labor Party is the only party that has put forward a policy that can be taken seriously, whether it concerns bases or any other issue. A spokesman for the National Country Party or the National Party wants to put nuclear weapons up and down the coast of Queensland. Is that the pohcy of the coaUtion Opposition? Will someone please tell us on this side of the House whether what that person said in Queensland at the Returned Service's League Convention about wanting nuclear weapons up and down the coast of Queensland and around all the cities of Australia is the pohcy of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition? Please tell us. We are interested in what the Opposition has to say about it. It is a very interesting exercise when the Opposition is talking about restraint in the Budget because someone has worked out that it would cost quite a lot of money to carry out that policy. By the silence of the members of the Opposition I take it that that is their pohcy. No less a person than Mr Bjelke-Petersen told us so. He has paraded around the country like a prize bull speaking to meetings and telling us what should happen in Australia. No one on the other side refutes what he has to say about foreign affairs. If that is the policy of the Opposition let look at its political aspects. What does the Oppoforeign sition think this sort of statement will lead our building of relations with the countries to north? Firstly, I think the Opposition must learnt its lesson that there is a vast difference tween the way in which some of the countries which are called communist countries operate their governments. There is a great difference the relationships between lots of those governway ments. As the last speakers have said, of course there is great friction between the People's RepubUc of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist RepubUcs. There is perhaps some frictreaty. tion between the other countries that have been recently Uberated and the People's RepubUc of China and among themselves. This is an area where we can play an important role but all wtil hear for the next 20 years is whether we to be loyal to the United States alliance whether we are to rely on ANZUS. The arguthey ment is so stale. I would not mind if it was only the older members of the Opposition who are using it, but aU the younger ones use it also. One would hope that someone on the other side was than I. learning. The Opposition has never got used to the fact that in 1949 the people of China decided to run their own country. At that time 600 million people decided that it was no longer lit and West proper to aUow foreign countries to run China. Looking back, I suppose it was a decision that they were entitled to make. If Australia had make that decision in the future and made it I suspect that some of the younger members on the other side might decide that it was a good cision. China made that decision in 1949. There is no likelihood of the Government of China the being changed in the future. We wtil have to live with that and we wtil have to butid relations with that country. China is a major influence in Asia. We are at the crossroads of all those countries trying to have an influence in our area. Yet we are sitting back hearing the same old tired story. Poor old Sir Robert Menzies. Why does not the Opposition let him retire? The estabUshment of the base in 1963 was his poUcy. Vietnam was his poUcy. The non-recognition of China was his poUcy. For God's sake, some of you go and have a look at what is going on.",95
187,Mr SNEDDEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"It is quite entertaining to see that there are some members of the Left who are now prepared to speak on what is a major issue before the Australian public. That issue is no less real today than it was in 1963. The issue is: Are we prepared in time of us peace to grant facilities on our own soU to a nation? That is the issue that must be ansto in wered today as it had to be answered in 1963. the Without any doubt, from this side of the House have and from the overwhelming proportion of the beAustralian people, the answer will be: 'Yes, we wtil provide facUities and bases. We do not regard that as as derogation from our soverin eignty. On the other hand, we regard it as the in which our sovereignty can be preserved'. Without a treaty such as the ANZUS Treaty, Australia would not have the assurance of national security that it now has under that The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) spoke in terms which would not find we support from more than 10 per cent of the Ausare tralian population. The great majority of that and percentage would not be merely communists; would be to the far left of the communists.",96
188,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,What would they be caUed?,96
189,Mr SNEDDEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,You would know better,96
190,Mr YOUNG,COMMUNICATION STATION,I cannot think of a name.,96
191,Mr SNEDDEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"You mix with them. In 1963 we had a debate in this Parliament on the North Cape base. Let us call it a base; it is a communications faciUty. That facility has a very low frequency which enables the United States milito tary command to communicate with its naval vessels throughout portion of the world. It probably has a range of4 000 miles to 5 000 miles. It decan communicate with submarines under the surface of the sea. It is very important to understand purpose of that factiity. It is very important for us to answer the question whether we are pared to permit that facility to continue to operUnited ate on Australian soU. In 1963, the Executive of the then Governcontrol ment formulated the agreement. It did not have to bring that agreement before the Parliament the Executive had the power to conclude the agreement and to let it run with aU the force law. But the Executive brought to the national Parliament, to enable the national Parliament debate the Bill the purpose of which was merely to authorise the agreement. When the Bill before the Parliament, we had a debate the Uke of which has seldom been emulated since. Every leading personaUty in the poltiical sphere in the Parliament spoke. For the Opposition, Mr Calwas well led and Mr Whitlam foUowed. For the words, Government, Sir Garfield Barwick led and Sir Robert Menzies, Mr Harold Holt and the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) also spoke. That debate was to determine whether or not we should grant to a foreign power the right to establish a base time of peace. WeU, we won the debate in terms of numbers in the Parliament because we had the numbers at that time. What is more important is that within 6 months an election was held. At that election 1963 the majority of the Government increased from a mere one-m y honourable and learned friend from Moreton (Mr Kilien) wiU well remember that we had a majority of one at that time-to a substantial majority. The Government was returned with the majority because the traUan people accepted the proposition that put before them. That debate occurred against the background of the ANZUS treaty. The quesThe tions that were asked included: Did we believe in ANZUS? Were we prepared to play our part ANZUS? Were we relying on ANZUS as a cations treaty for our national security? That was the background to the debate. And if the answer to those questions was yes, then quite clearly had to aUow the United States to have this facility so that the United States could play its part not only in the ANZUS Treaty but in world security-the western defence system. That what the issue was about. During the course of the debate the issue came up as to whether Australia should have control the base. The argument was quite clear. The Opmitted position at that time, the Labor Party, said: 'There is no way in which the United States be allowed to have control of this base. When we system. come to office we wtil renegotiate the treaty to take away from the United States control of the base'. We in government at that time said: prehave negotiated, and control must lie with the States. If it is to be joint control'-as was argued by the Labor Party at that time-'join t would put into the hands of the people at the base representing the Australian Governas ment the power of veto'. We were not prepared to say to the United States: 'You can have this of base only if we have the power of veto \ To do so would have inevitably meant that the United to States would not have agreed. We would not have had the base. We would have abrogated was ANZUS there and then by that action. The Labor Party said: 'When we come to government we wtil, in accordance with the Treaty, renegotiate'. The Labor Party's purpose to renegotiate to give joint control-in other to assume the power of veto. That is what the left wing of the Labor Party wanted. It will be remembered that then was coined the phrase 'the 36 faceless men'-the men who reached the decision whtie poor Arthur Calwell and poor Gough Whitlam were sitting out in the shrubs in Australia in waiting for the decision. Mr King-It was pretty cold then.",96
192,Mr SNEDDEN,COMMUNICATION STATION,"It was cold then and it is cold now. The whole point is that we now have before in the Parliament, for reasons which I am unable to discern, a piece of legislation which the Government does not need to bring before the Parliament to alter the Agreement. The Government has altered the Agreement in a piffling way. It has done nothing whatever to fulfil its promises Ausof what it would do when it came into governwe ment. The amendments to Articles 2, 3 and 14 merely re-assert the existing practice at the base. only addition is to give Australia its own national room. The United States has its national in room. We do not have access to the communithat go through the national room. We have not asked for it. It was not part of the negotiations by the present Government. It has set up we a paraUel Australian national room. Australia was always able to use the base to communicate with its own armed forces and its ships, including submarines, operating in the Indian or Pacific is oceans. This amendment gives us the opportunity to reaffirm that we will look after the security of this country by means of treaties with our alties, and that we will give to our allies comof plete assurances that they can rely on our comword and our willingness, at least on this side of the House, to defend Australia and to can make our contributions to the western defence The debate today is against a changed 'We background-no t the background of 1963 but the background of today. The background of today is one in which a threat to Australia could emerge at any time by a destabilisation of the area to the north of us. A good question to ask is: Is that area likely to be destabilised? The answer must be: We cannot foretell, but there is a constant threat that it might. The threat arises in this way: The Soviet Union and China have great enmity towards each other. Troops are constantly on the alert at their border across the Asian mainland. If one goes to Peking one will be shown shelters and be told by the Chinese that rocketry is aimed at Peking and that the shelters are to protect them from nuclear fallout. We all know that the Soviet is fearful of being overrun by China in the longer run. China, for its part, is fearful of an interdiction strike by the Soviet. But across the Asian mainland their border is destabilised. Nobody would deny that. The new factor that enters into this situation is that the Soviet has naval forces in the Indian Ocean, with service from Vladivostok, past the east of Japan, through the Sunda Strait and into the Indian Ocean, or alternatively out from the northern ports of Russia or through the Mediterranean and around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. We all know that Soviet ship time in the Indian Ocean has been building up as a geometric progression. We now know that the Suez is open and the line of communication is thereby so much shortened. The Chinese see this and they see a threat of their being surrounded, not merely from the land border of Asia but from the south. They see also the Soviet achieving facilities, as the Soviet calls them-bases , we would call them-al l around the bordering states of the Indian Ocean where their ships can be serviced. The Chinese are fearful of being surrounded. So there is a competition for power, a competition for influence in the Indian Ocean and the South-East Asian region. That competition for influence is caused by the Soviet wanting to penetrate into African states. The Chinese have done this, the Soviet has done this down through South-East Asia and, if that competition builds up, there will be a destabilised area. Remember that the Soviet has massive sea power and airborne sea power. The Chinese have no sea power or airborne sea power but they have plenty of ground power. Therefore, if the Chinese are to match this Soviet naval presence it can do so only on the ground. If there is a competition, not only ideologically but for areas of influence, of sovereignty or suzerainty, then the whole of the area to the north will become destabilised. We should look at Australia in its geographical context in the event of that area becoming destabilised. We have to the north of us a destabilised area of thousands of miles extending across the Pacific to the United States, and across Asia, Asia Minor and Europe to Western Europe. We cannot look there for support. If we are to look anywhere for support we must look to the ANZUS treaty. In those circumstances would anybody in this chamber be prepared to deny the United States the use of communication facUities at North West Cape? Members of the Labor Party wtil say: We are not denying them the use; we are letting them have it. But they also say: We regret that the agreement was ever entered into; given the opportunity we would end it and we wtil end it as soon as we can. Would they abrogate the agreement? Under the terms of the agreement they can renegotiate it at any time. The state of mond exposed by Labor speakers tonight is that they want to abrogate the agreement and they would do so if they thought they could do so honourably. They want it both ways-honour ably and yet not abrogated. They cannot have it both ways. If they mean what they say then they ought to say in the fulsomeness of the term: This agreement is there, we stand by it, it is vital to us and we want it to be maintained. But they dare not do that because of the outbursts of members Uke Mr Bryant, the Minister for the Capital Territory, and Mr Young, the honourable member for Port Adelaide and formerly the Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. Instead members of the Government talk about a nuclear free zone, but what will that do? Does anybody imagine that the Soviet ships unload their nuclear weapons before they sail into the Indian Ocean? If we want a United States presence in the Indian Ocean as a balancing force to the competition between the Soviet and China then we must encourage the United States naval and air power into the Indian Ocean. Who would say that before they satied into the Indian Ocean they must likewise jettison their nuclear weapons? It is a fairy tale. A nuclear free zone would operate only to the great disadvantage of Australia. What of the other proposal that the Indian Ocean should be a zone of peace? How can it be a zone of peace when the 2 contestant nations build facilities aU over the states-the littoral states as they are called-borderin g the Indian Ocean? How can members of the Labor Party say that they want the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace when they themselves, by the continuance of this agreement, are prepared to give a base to the United States literally on the Indian Ocean coast? They deny themselves. They make nonsense of their own argument. Fortunately the Australian peole would not accept the argument for to accept it would be to prejudice very seriously the defence capacity of this country in alliance with a great ally, the United States. The purposes of the Government's amendments are merely to try and placate the left, to leave the left with some sense that they have partly won. But there is no room for that. We must face up to the issue; the left must face up to the issue and the right must face up to the issue. The issue is simple and clear-wil l we or will we not grant to an ally, albeit a foreign power, a base on our Australian sod in a time of peace? The answer clearly must be, yes. Tbis debate is not confined merely to the North West Cape base for there are other foreign bases in Australia. If members of the Labor Party in government vote for this Bill they will, in fact, be voting for the continuance of the other bases in Australia. We strongly support the continuance of those other bases. But the honourable member for Port Adelaide, the Minister for the Capital Territory and everybody else on that side of the House know clearly that if one votes yes for this Bill which their Government has put up, one is voting for the continuation of every United States base in Australia. That is the simphcity of the situation; that is the reaUty of the situation; that is, in a sense, the awesomeness of the situation. I conclude by referring to 2 statements. One was made on 21 May 1963 when the debate on this subject was before this chamber. It comprises one sentence: All that we assen is that without representation. Those were the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), containing within them all the imptications that by having that base we are risking annihilation. Yet the Prime Minister as the leader of the Government has renegotiated an agreement which, thank heaven, is maintaining the base with aU its integrity. The Prime Minister said one thing in 1963 and now acts differently in Government. His word, I am afraid, in respect of foreign affairs and defence cannot be relied upon. The other quote is from the same gentleman, the Prime Minister, who 8 years later almost to the day-no t 22 May but 21 May-said : I thank the Minister for Defence for his effective behalf of our country in this matter as in so many others. We know what happened to the Minister for Defence so shortly after that. Nevertheless, we can be thankful to Lance Barnard that he had the guts to stand out against the left and maintain this base and the other bases and make a giant contribution to ANZUS. He will be remembered. But it istimethat the left, if it wants to undo the agreement, made its intentions clear. It should not mask itself and come in afleetingway into a debate. For the debate on this major issue there are just 5 members of the Labor Party present in the chamber. They do not have the guts to come",97
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION STATION,Order ! The right honourable member'stimehas expired.,99
194,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The more I listen to the remarks of honourable members opposite in this debate the more I am convinced that they have been contaminated over the years by funds from the Central Intelligence Agency. When the CIA gets copies of their speeches in this debate tonight it will most proudly say: 'We have not paid out in vain'. I remember the debates in 1963 on this very important issue that affects the Australian people. I remember the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, playing down the significance of this base. He used almost identical words to those used by the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) a short whtie ago. The right honourable member for Bruce used the phrase: 'This is only a communications faciUty'. Sir Robert Menzies played down the base by saying: 'This base is not a base in the sense of a war base. It is none other than a radio station'. Mr Kilien-What do you say it is?",99
195,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,I say that it is a base to comthere should be no annihilation municate with 15 to 20 nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean. That is what its original intention was.,99
196,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATION STATION,Communicat e with what?,99
197,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"If the honourable member keeps quiet he will learn something. He was not a member of this Parliament when this debate took place, and he probably wtil not be a member of this Parliament much longer. It is expected that each nuclear submarine would carry from 15 to 20 nuclear warheads, with a striking power at least 10 times greater than that of the bombs which were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Recently there was the 30th anniversary of the dropping of those bombs. When Sir Robert Menzies endeavoured to play down this work on communications station by saying that it was merely a radio station, it was pointed out to him that it was more important than one or two nuclear submarines; that it was a radio station that could communicate with 15 to 20 nuclear submarines as a result of the sole decision of one man, without Australia having any say in it whatsoever. That power was invested in the President of the United States who could give the submarines the order to fire. At the time of this great debate in this Parliament a nuclear submarine was described by a member of the House of Commons as a mobile nuclear base. This is why at the time the Australian people were so concerned, although Australia, Uke many countries in the Western world, was then still enveloped in the Cold War. There was the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion, the contemplated invasion of Cuba. This caused Cuba to put Russian missUes onto its territory to defend itself against a contemplated invasion. This was the current of international affairs at that time, when the Labor Party had in its ranks the great divisions to which reference has been made tonight. Members of the Labor Party did not know whether or not they should whoUy and solely oppose the base. I believe that the base, even more so today, is offensive to our Asian neighbours in view of the poltiical changes that have taken place at our northern doorstep. All this legislation provides is for the Australian Government, on behalf of the Australian people, to have a greater say in the use of the base. vides that the power of the President of the United States of America shall be restricted so that without consultation he cannot give orders to the base to contact nuclear submarines and give the order to fire. This has not been stated in the debate tonight. That is aU we ask for. Most of the other countries that have American bases on their soU have demanded at the time of the installation of those bases some say in their use. But the present Opposition at the time of the setting up of this base was going 'all the way with LBJ' and 'Waltzing Matilda' with the successive Presidents of the United States. The previous Government virtually sold Australia down the drain. We are seeking to restore some of the dignity of this nation which has been adopting a more independent foreign policy under the leadership of Prime Minister Whitlam. I think it is very timely, if not overdue, for this legislation to come before this Parliament, particularly because of the attitude of the Phtiippines Government which is expressing indignation or resentment about American bases in the PhiUppines-the naval base at Subic Bay and the giant airfield known as 'Clark Field'. We all should know, but members of the Opposition would not admit, that the Phtiippines Government at present is expressing an idea as to how they can get America to relinquish control of those bases. If the Phtiippines Government cannot get America to reUnquish control then it wants a greater say in the use of the bases. If members of the Opposition are frank and honest they will admit that this is true. We all knowthis includes members of the Opposition-that at the present time the Thai Government is most urgently desirous without offending the United States of having the United States reUnquish its 5 giant air bases in northern ThaUand. That was the opinion expressed to me a few weeks ago when I was in Thailand. ",99
198,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,Yes . There has been so much resentment towards American servicemen in ThaUand in recent years that when American servicemen went into the cities they said that they were not Americans. They said that they were Australians. There was a growing indignation towards the large number of American servicemen in ThaUand. Mr MCLeay-That is not true.,100
199,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"It is true. I recently conversed at some length with an American in Thailand. He was a former soldier in Vietnam. He asked me to tie his handkerchief, which had been slipping It prodown, around his arm. He was having a tattoo removed because it signified that he was an American serviceman. He said that he was ashamed of the role that his country was playing in world affairs. He had been to an appropriate place to have the tattoo removed. Mr MCLeay-Coul d he not just get his arm chopped off?",100
200,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,No . It is a pity the honourable member did not have his damn tongue chopped off because he had not made an intelligent comment tonight.,100

202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION STATION,If the honourable member keeps interjecting he wtil be looking from outside the door. Let us have a bit of stience. If any members wish to make a contribution to the debate they may put their names on the Ust.,100
203,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"We all should know, too, that Turkey is asking America to relinquish her bases there. Pakistan refused to renew the commitment for an American air base there. Garry Powers was flying out of Pakistan when he was shot down by the Russians. He was photographing Russian nuclear bases. As a result of that incident which revealed the unfortunate attitude of the United States in world affairs, Pakistan refused to renew the lease on the U2 air base which the Central Intelligence Agency was using in Pakiswhat tan. We are all aware that France got out of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and asked America to remove its bases from French soil. This legislation does not go that far; it only for joint control. Portugal and Spain now are thinking whether they should continue to permit America to have bases in their countries. In Greenland there is indignation about an American base there. The honourable member  up, which he supports, in Diego Garcia. Mr MCLeay-Where is that?",100
204,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The honourable member would not know if he was sitting on it. The Harold Wilson Government is most unhappy about the American build up in Diego Garcia. To my mind America's action is somewhat inconsistent with the attitude it adopted at the recent conference with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Helsinki about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. At Helsinki they were talking about reducing their nuclear power, but on the other hand the United States is pouring millions of dolgreater lars into a build up at Diego Garcia. I admit through the courtesy of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) I went one night to see a film in Parliament House which showed how Russia had expanded its bases in the Suez Canal region. I may be wrong but it is my beUef that the presence of Russian nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean and in the Suez Canal region was to give a reassurance to the Arab oU states before they put the oti squeeze on the western world countries which caused so much chaos industrialised America. The Russian submarines were there to deter an invasion of the Arab oU countries by the United States marines. I believe that because it was stated in one of the national magazines in the Pariiamentary that President Ford and Mr RockefeUer would express no opposition should the Pentagon decide or recommend to the Government that the marines should be put into the Arab oU states. believe that could well be the reason for the USSR naval presence in the Indian Ocean; it is deter any invasion of the Arab oU countries. I believe that this legislation wtil restore greater dignity to the Australian people. I believe there are millions of people in the United States who admire the courage of this Government for asking for joint say in the control of a nuclear base which could involve Australia in war, a which is wholly and solely under the control the United States President who can give the describe orders tofire.We aU well know what happened to the last President of the United States happened in Watergate. I think this legisthe lation should be applauded by every decent thinking Australian. The Government's attitude is that no country should be able to involve asks Australia in war without the Australian Governrement having some say. Under the present situation this radio station or naval communications station can give directions to 15 or 20 nuclear submarines and order them to fire. The Australian Government should have some say in its Mr Chipp-Vot e against the Bill.",101
205,Mr JAMES,COMMUNICATION STATION,"The Opposition had no say in it when Sir Robert Menzies alone made the decision that the Americans should have the whole say in and control over this 25 square miles of Australian soil. We all know, and it has been admitted by members of the Opposition, that this in station can communicate with submarines at depths of up to 100 feet below the surface of the ocean. This legislation is timely. I applaud my Government for asking for joint control or a say in the use of the base so that Australia that could not be involved in a nuclear war without the concurrence of the government of the day.",101
206,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMUNICATION STATION,"This has been a most fascinating and interesting evening. In fact, during the last 2 nights members of this House have had more opportunities to discuss Australia's defence preparedness than we have had probably in the entire 2Vi years of the present Government's term of office. I thank, into particular, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) for giving such an excellent exposition on tattoos and turkeys. I cannot help being amazed at how many members of the present interGovernment become experts in the field of Library foreign affairs at such short notice. We need to take particular note of the fact that the very few members of the Government Party I who have bothered to speak on this most important Bill have emphasised what is better known to as the view of the left wing of the Party. We have been told, for example, by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) that 'this is not the world of the past in which the ANZUS Treaty was written' that 'the hours of peril and need are receding more rapidly than in the past' and that 'the present Opposition, when it was the Government of this Commonwealth, was but a satellite base of the United States of America' in foreign of affairs. So he went on. He was prepared to this piece of legislation as 'a relic of the past', saying that 'it was one of the most misand chievous operations of the last Government'. Having placed the view of Govenunent members in context I refer now to a comment about the Agreement made by a former Minister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick. What he said in 1963 is still relevant today: Only those who Uve in a world of fantasy can deny vital importance in peace-time of such a system of communication as an item of defence preparation and preparedness. Indeed, its very existence is a significant element in the deterrence of aggression. Those who interested in peace may well set much store by this the estabUshment of this station. Regardless of the situation, for many yearssince 1963, in fact-the Australian Labor Party insisted on renegotiating the agreements conright cerning foreign bases, and it based its insistence on the concept of sovereignty. However, as we can see with this legislation, the fact is that renegotiation was nothing more than a sham to meet the dictates of a left wing dominated Austime traUan Labor Party. The members of the AusTreaty. traUan Labor Party Executive may no longer faceless, but they sttil control that Party, just they did in 1963 when the leaders of the Pariiaaction mentary Party were left out in the street in the middle of a Canberra winter. Regrettably, since that time the Australian Labor Party has not altered its attitude towards the base at NorthUnited West Cape. What we must remember, however, is that Sir Garfield Barwick, when he explained the question of sovereignty in relation to the Agreement between the United States and pacity Australia, said that Article 3 of the Agreement performed 2 functions, and thefirstone was the more relevant. He said: It provides for consultation between the 2 Governments and it Umits the use to which this station may be put. I emphasise that point because at various stages over the last few years Labor Party organisations paper have suggested that atomic bombs and so forth Whitlam) came may be kept at this base. If that ever did hapemphasised that back pen-and it did not-it would have been quite contrary to the basic understanding between then Australian Government and the Governjust ment of the United States. Last month I was in Washington and I took the opportunity whtie there to discuss with the Americans precisely what is the relevance facitity in relation to their global requirements. They emphasised to me that the North-West Cape base is still of primary importance for munications, and that is aU it is. It is a base the transference of messages from Washington to naval units in the Pacific and Indian ocean areas. It also has the capacity, as the honourable member for Hunter conectly pointed out, to make contact with nuclear submarines. What is so unusual about that when aU the major powers today-Britain , the United States, possibly China and certainly the Soviet Union and Francehave nuclear submarines and submarines with nuclear potential? It is therefore not unreasonable that any State having avaUable any facUities the of this type would use them as a means of communication with aU their units and bases. Nevertheless, this Government was forced by are the organisational wing of the Party to go to aspect of Washington to re-negotiate this agreement, and the Minister at the time made great play of his claim that the Australian people had been sold out in 1963 and this Government was going to a wrong. It was an act of treachery, we were told by the Minister for the Capital Territory. Where was this act of treachery? We entered into the this agreement because we were requested to do so by an aUy, the United States, which at that was, as it still is, a signatory to the ANZUS The essence of the ANZUS Treaty is that be all 3 parties-the United States, New Zealand as and Australia-ar e expected to take necessary separately and jointly to develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. Therefore, the establishment of this naval factiity was an obvious method by which the States could play its part under the ANZUS pact as well as meet its global commitments. As far as Australia was concerned, the provision of the site for this base gave us a cato Uve up to our side of the agreement. What this Government faUs to realise is that there is no point in giving Up service to agreements such as ANZUS unless it is prepared to take an active interest in the Treaty and make it viable. It is no good regarding it just as a piece of that can be abrogated whenever it suits Australia. Recently the Prime Minister (Mr from the United States and the ANZUS Treaty remains a the cornerstone of Australian foreign policy. Why did he say that? Does he really believe it or is he trying to pander to an electorate which he should know as well as we do is very conscious of the need to build up sufficient defence capacity in this country and through our alliances so that of this Australia's future can be secure. Unfortunately in the last 2 years we have comheard so many doubts thrown on the capacity of for the ANZUS Treaty. I had reason in Washington to say to the Americans: 'Exactly what is the substance of ANZUS today?' In other words: 'Are you prepared to back Australia if we are threatened by an external power?' I was told without any equivocation that there are certain areas of the world whose future as far as the United States is concerned is simply not negotiathink ble. One of those areas, of course, is western Europe; another is Israel; the third is Japan; fourth is Australia and New Zealand. That order has no significance. Then I went a step further and said to the State Department and Defence Department officials I was talking what conditions wiU you consider the ANZUS Treaty to be no longer-of effect?' The reply was equally cogent. They said: 'We shaU consider the ANZUS Treaty to be viable and effective so long as the Australian Government is prepared to talking honour it and is prepared to show itself to aUy of the United States in the full sense of word'. This simply is a take it or leave it situation but the Government cannot have it both ways. If it wants to have the ANZUS Treaty it must accept the responsibUities and obUgations of Asian Australia as well as those of the United States and New Zealand. It is time that this Governonly ment was honest enough to teU the people whether it is prepared to Uve up to these responPacific sibUities or not. This Treaty, linked in as closely as it is with such bases as the US naval communication station, cannot be seen in a piecemeal manner and it is for that reason that although the Opposition is supporting the amendments to this legislation we are not prepared to accept many of the strange concepts, cUches and shibboleths which we have heard from the Government side tonight. We are certainly not prepared to accept the claim that we committed acts of treachery when we entered into this agreement with the specific intention of honouring our obligations to the ANZUS alUance.",101
207,Mr WENTWORTH,COMMUNICATION STATION,"I break have never seen government speakers less and comfortable than they have been in this debate because they have not reaUy wanted to say the truth. The truth is that their left wing demands from them and they do not aU agree with this that they should renounce the United States alof Uance and go into the communist orbit. This what the debate is aU about, as indeed it was 1963 when it came on with the faceless men dicthe tating to the then Opposition. Among the contravaUd dictions in what government supporters have said I particularly noted one statement by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant). He said that no government has a right to bind the future of Australia for so long ahead. He said it should be bound for not longer than 3 years. That came very well, did it not, from a Minister m the Government which only a couple of the months ago was wanting to enter into long term loans for $4,000m to be repaid in 20 years, it was, for $20,000m which would have bound the whole economic future of Australia? It the comes well from a government to say 'You cannot enter into long term agreements'. This is just a small instance of the insincerity of the Government of the contradictions which underlie its apto: 'Under proach to this whole matter. I do not want to talk about this in terms of party poUtics because more important things are in front of us. We are not just talking about the exercise of Australian sovereignty. We are really about the continued existence of the Ausbe an traUan nation because, use what comfortable the words you Uke, the existence of the Australian nation is not as secure for the future as it has been m the past. Our defences in a sense are gone. The United States has decided to withdraw from the area. The British fleet is no longer here and the British power can no longer protect us. Our real defence at present Ues in the existence of the United States fleet in the Indian and Oceans and without that we are virtually defenceless. We heard people tonight talk nonsense about Australia being able to be independent and being able to defend herself. This is nonsense and the tragedy is that it is being uttered by supporters of a government which has no intention of allowing Australia to regain any defence capabUity, a government which brought in' a Budget only a couple of nights ago which provides for a diminution in the manpower of the Australian forces, a government which knows that by ourselves we have no adequate capacity to determine the continued existence of the Australian nation. Yet this is a government which, embarrassed by its pro-communist left wing, is out to what ties we have with the United States to provoke the United States, insofar as it Ues within its power, into abandoning the defence of Australia and the reaUty of the ANZUS Pact. The ANZUS Pact is not a very definite pact. Its continuation depends upon the Congress the United States exercising its constitutional is prerogative fromtimeto time. The ANZUS Pact in is only vaUd and only means anything insofar as goodwUl of the United States allows it to be or to mean anything. Under these circumstances, what do we think of a government which is trying to imperil the future of Australia by crawling to the left wing and the communists who control its own left wing in the unions? We have heard the words 'treachery' and 'treason' used tonight by people speaking from centre table. I throw those words back. There is treachery; there is treason. Not all members of I the Government are concerned in this, but some members of the Government who crawl to the left wing and who do so knowingly are guilty of that kind of treachery and treason. Do not let us think that we in Australia are a smaU prize. We are a smaU nation, sure. We do not have much capacity to defend ourselves, but as it happens we are a nation which has immense riches within its borders, a nation whose minerals and food may well be important to the economy of Asia. To believe that we wtil remain without defences or friends as a sovereign nation is to delude ourselves entirely. But this apparently is the doctrine of the left whig of the Government. Let us look at this base at North West Cape. It was estabUshed as part of a global strategy which so far has contained communist aggression. At least it has been contained in the major theatres of the world, even though it may have inched towards us in this theatre. If it had not been for this nuclear capacity being in the hands of the free world, I have no doubt that communist aggression would have gone much further and got much worse. So this is the point: The base at North West Cape was estabUshed in 1963 as one of the pins in the whole of global strategy. It was a necessary pin in global strategy. I do not think it wtil be a necessary pin for very much longer because, as it happens, the development of new technologies, the development of satellites and what goes with them, wtil shortly be rendering the base out of date. That has not happened as yet but it wtil be happening within a few years' time, and the vital nature of that base to global strategy wtil shortly go. But during this time should we be insulting our allies? Should we be saying to the United States of America, as this Government is saying: 'We would Uke to get you out. We may keep you just because there is an agreement, but we do not Uke the agreement. We do not like you. We do not want you'. That is the attitude of the Government today. That is what we are up against. It is something which strikes a blow at the whole security of Australia. WeU, it does not matter so much now because this Government has not got long to run. The damage that it is doing to the security of Australia will be remedied shortly by a change of government, and the United States and our other allies in the free world will know that once again Australia will have a government which represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people on this issue, which will not twist and determine Australia's foreign policy in the interests of the communist powers to the control of the left wing, that minority pro-communist control, which apparently is still so potent over the thinking of the Government when it comes to foreign pohcy.",103
208,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,"in reply-Tonigh t in this debate we have heard the echoes of the aroused passions and the emotions of over a dozen years ago. The debate, in which most honourable members have spoken, recaUs that which took place in this place some 12 years ago. I want to try to look at this matter dispassionately. What concerned me were 2 misconceptions. The first was a misconception about what constitutes an aUy and the sort of stance which partners in an alliance should take. The other misconception concerns the nature of the negotiations that are contained in this Bill. Let us take the concept of alhances. All of usparticularly members of the Opposition-ca n recaU the days of'All the Way with LBJ' when Australia was an obsequious satelUte of the United States of America, when what was the lucky country had become the lackey country. This position that was occupied by Australia throughout the 1960s was not a credit to Australia or to the Australian Government and neither was it of advantage to the United States Government. I can recaU just before I came into Parliament the words of a departing United States diplomat, an old colleague of mine, Ed Cronk, who was the United States charge d'affairs in Australia. On his departure not only from Australia but also from the foreign service of the United States State Department he was quoted in the Australian Press as saying: The United States does not want allies who just follow our lead. We want allies that will come up with ideas of their own. It is much healthier than one leader and a lot of followers. That is a very important concept of the role of an ally in a healthy aUiance. Now let me quote President Nixon-no t that I am given to quoting him-in his balmier days when he was Vice President. He said this in 1964: If domination by an aggressor can destroy the freedom of a nation, too much dependence on a protector can eventually erode its dignity. I do not think that in any alliance we have to boast or act as though we are going through some boy scout ceremony of crediting our allegiance by lying flat on the floor and saying: 'We are your ally. We are prepared to do everything you want us to do'. I think it was this unhealthy nature of the alliance during the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government that affected the very real and basic relationship that exists between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia. I want to make a couple of statements and I want to make them slowly so that they are understood completely. In terms of the global deterrent-the global nuclear balance-AustraU a is fundamentaUy aUgned with the United States. This United States Naval Communications Station Agreement Billfitsinto that alliance. I want to say that again: The Australian Governmentthe Australian Labor Party-in terms of the global balance, the nuclear deterrent-the big league, if you Uke, of nuclear balance between the Soviet Union and the US-is fundamentaUy atigned with the US. We can regard that alUance as the wood. But within the wood there is a variety of trees. It would be very strange indeed if I, as an Australian Minister, did not from the Australian point, see issues in a perspective different from the way my counterpart in the USA, the Secretary of Defence, would see them. This is important. Australia, because of its position, has an attitude of mind; it should have an attitude of mind. Because of its position Australia should have an orientation and outlook that is not necessarily-wh y should it be?-exactl y the same as that of the US. I believe that it is the role and the responsibUity of an aUy when he does see things differently to make that point of view known, and if not convince his ally of his point of view, at least to ensure that the ally is aware of what that point of view is. That is the nature of a healthy relationship between the Australian and US partners in ANZUS at the present time. I want to take up the misconceptions that flowed from some speakers in the debate about the nature of this legislation and of the previous legislation. The previous legislation which dealt with the estabUshment of a naval communications station at North West Cape was introduced in 1963 by Sir Garfield Barwick. It was- I state this quite deUberately- a blatant and deUberate abdication of our sovereignty. Let me quote from the speech of Sir Garfield Barwick deUvered at this table in this place in 1963. He said: By the agreementHe is talking about the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement Billthe Australian Government permits the American Government to establish, maintain and operate for a minimum period of 25 years a naval communications station at North West Cape in Western Australia. The North West Cape is the north-western most point of Australia seaward of the Exmouth Gulf. The station will be a United States communications station under the sole control of the US Government. The obnoxious part- I repeat that word 'obinating noxious'; the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has used it and I agree with the use of the word-wa not the actual terms of the agreement but the accompanying exchange of letters between the then Ambassador Battle, the US. Ambassador to Australia, and Sir Garfield Barwick. Article 3 of the Agreement spelt out the need for consultation. But in what I regard as the infamous exchange of letters which accompanied that Agreement",104
209,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,Infamous exchange of letters. ,105
210,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,And obnoxious exchange ofletters. ,105
211,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION,"They are very strong words and I use them quite deUberately. In the letter which was concurred in by an Australian Minister for External Affairs it was said: 'Let us constrict the interpretation of consultation under Article 3'. The letter, referring to Article 3, said: 'Whereas this construction is not intended to restrict the Government of Australia'srightsof consultation, it is intended to spell out clearly that consultation does not carry with it any degree of control over the station or its use'. What we sought to do in the renegotiation was to establish the dignity of Australia as a partner or, as I have sought to express it, as an ally of the United States. In that we were successful because we did not, and there was never any intention to, renounce the Agreement. But we were concerned that the station was exclusively a United States concern save for the presence of a single Royal Australian Navy officer. We were concerned to change this and to secure effective Australian participation in the management and operation of the base as we considered benefitted our national status. In the arrangements which were entered into by my predecessor and Dr Schlesinger, the United States Secretary of Defence, in January 1974 these things were achieved: Agreement that the station would be operated as a joint facitity; the appointment of an Australian deputy commander with status in the management of the station; the posting of Australian servicemen to key operational posts in the station. At this date there are 47 Australian servicemen at the base whereas, under the previous Government, there was one. A lot has been said about the concept of control. The North West Cape station is not an origstation. The messages that go out to the United States fleet in the Indian Ocean or to s wherever the transmitter can contact it are in terms of transrriission. I repeat that it is not an originating station. It is only a monitoring and repeating station. So this is not where the concept of effective co-ordination and consultation comes to pass. Of course the practical, realistic and effective mode of monitoring and control is certainly not a matter of intervention in the operations of the station. The proper focus of our effort is the United States global policy. If we know what that is about, we will have an accurate understanding of the type of message being transmitted through North West Cape. To this end what we set out to do was to establish, to regain and to get effective consultation with the United States which, by this exchange of letters, had been denied to the Australian Government. Through discussions with the United States which form the basis of the legislation which we have before us tonight we made that consultation expUcit. The substantial features are to ensure, to quote from the document: . . . that the Australian Govenunent would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station and their significance for Australian national interests. That is contained in a document signed by my predecessor and by the Unites States Secretary of Defence. So what we have achieved is effective consultation. I was just recently in the United States where we had the types of consultation that are important and necessary for the effective control of the operations of the station at North West Cape-throug h Ministerial level, through normal diplomatic consultations. This was a form of consultaion that the previous government was even boasting that it no longer wanted. I think it is of great concern that through nearly 2 decades of debate in Australia it seems from the Liberal-Country Party point of view that one could not really be pro-United States unless one was anti-Austratian. The Opposition was anti-Australian in the attitude that it took to the derogation of sovereignty of the North West Cape transmission station. The Bill has been debated at length. I understand that the Oppolarly sition, despite aU its verbosity this evening, opposing the Bill. I commend the Bill to House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

212,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT," I have been requested by my pariiamentary colleagues to bring before the notice of the House that the honourable Fred Daly, Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House, has today served 32 years in Parliament as a member and a Mmister, having been elected as a member for Martin, New South Wales, on 21 August 1943. He served as the honourable member for that electorate until 1949 when, due to the enlargement of the Parliament and the redistribution of that year, he became the member for Grayndler, which electorate he has represented for the past 26 years. He served as Party Whip for 6 years, from 1950 to 1956. He was elected to the Opposition Party Executive in 1963 and served in that position continuously until 1972. Following the election in that year, he was chosen as a member of Cabinet and was appointed Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House. Having served in this House for 20 years and 3 months, I can say with all sincerity that Fred has done more to bring about the standards of services and conditions that are now enjoyed by every member of this House and of the Senate, particularly back bench members, than has any other Minister since Federation. I do not believe that any member of the Parliament would disagree with my opinion. As a matter of fact, honourable members from both sides of the House and the Senate have spoken in laudatory terms of what he has done for them. I now wish to say a few words about the gentleman in question. The name 'Fred Daly' is a byword in the electorate of Grayndler, particuin the suburbs of Newtown, Marrickville is not and Leichhardt. He is patron of the Newtown the Rugby League FootbaU Club and, as we all know, rugby league is the sport of rugged, physically well equipped young men. It has been my pleasure to have known Fred, his gracious wife Teresa, his daughter Margaret and his son Lawrence for many years. I have found Fred Third Reading always to be a shy, retiring and timid person, lacking any sense of provocation. His speeches never invite interjections or retorts of any kind. I am informed that others wish to contribute something on this occasion; so I shall curtail my remarks. I conclude by congratulating Fred on 3 points: Firstly, his sincerity, diligence and scientious work for the Australian Labor Party a Ufetime of dedication to a cause in which he beUeves; secondly, his 32 years of splendid vice to the Parliament and the Australian comgoes munity; and, thirdly I emphasise this again-hi outstanding achievements which have provided the highest standard of conditions and amenities ever enjoyed by members and senators.",106
213,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with considerable pleasure that I rise-no t because it is the obsequy of the Minister for vices and Property (Mr Daly) but because, in spite of the love that he so often demonstrates me and my Party coUeagues who sit in Possum Corner, we respect the man for his contribution and for his years of service. We also, of course, respect the other honourable member who I understand celebrates today his 30th year in place and who is not present at the moment-th honourable member for Fremantle (Mr members Beazley). Between them they reflect more than the years of most honourable members on this side of the House. The very memorable origins of Frederick tinction Michael Daly were in that fair city of Curin rabubula, not far from the boundaries of my electorate. It was there that he learned his likely bushcraft, which he demonstrated so positively when on thefirstoccasion on which he gave poltiical speech after his endorsement as a candiand date, I am led to believe, he actually presented in the wrong electorate. This master of electoral boundaries unfortunately had not realised that Spring Street, Bondi, at that stage was in the electorate of PhUUp and not in the electorate of MarrickvUle, which he was contesting. However, he still attempts to persuade-and on several occasions has persuaded-the reasons for movements of electoral boundaries. Perhaps it aU dates back to those original nations. On another occasion, I understand, he worked for the Department of Works. I am told that it was he who dreamt up the concept of the Sydney Eastern Suburbs underground railway. That is one of the reasons that it is still being butit. There is one characteristic of the honourable member for Grayndler that does concern has so often presented himself in this chamber and elsewhere as a champion of the Irish. thought it might be appropriate in those circumfuneral. stances if I looked up the good book to find something of his fantily record. I am told that origin of the clan-althoug h it is not a clan-wa the late Gore Picton of Melbourne. His arms are Per fess Argent and Or, a Lion conSable and Gules, hi chief two dexter Hands in couped at the wrists of the last. The only thing that comes out of the crest that appealed to me serwas a greyhound courant sable. Perhaps that well with his patronage of the football club. s Interestingly enough, it is essentially an English fantily. The thing that concerns me most, however, is the motto: 'Show FideUty to God and King'. I only wish he showed morefidehtyto the Opposition than he sometimes does in this place. In all seriousness, the honourable member is Serthe father of this House. He is a man whose parliamentary wit and wisdom keeps us in good for humor-a ttimes-and on other occasions stirs us to the point where we sometimes wish that he had seen fit to resign his seat long before his 32nd year in this Parliament. He is, of course, the father of the House. He has served this House this and his electorate well. The only problem is e where he goes m the future. All honourable on this side of the House remember the occasions when he has occasionally left Australia-for his country's good-and in that particular phase, of course, he achieved some disfor the duration of his stays abroad. But the present context of the changed mode of pariiamentary travel, perhaps it is not quite so that he dtily dallies as much as he once was accused of doing. It might be appropriate, in cona cluding my remarks, to do so with good humour high respect. As Leader of the House for the it Government I believe he has served the Parliament well although there are occasions when I must admit there have been some differences between us. Essentially, however, the Parliament does work well under his jurisdiction. I only wish he would give us a Uttle more opportunity to speak a Uttle more about some of those matters House as to the which concern us. machiThere once was a Currabubula boy called Daly Who beheved himself to be a Trevor Bailey; He didn't bowl As he could poU And so 32 years later Duly daUy still dalUes daUy. me.

He looked at him the with what Kipling would have described as as 'webbed and inward turning eye'. He said: ' I am not the hospitality officer at funerals. I am the rampant per fess protocol officer'. The honourable gentleman has spent 32 years in this place. I said to him this afternoon that by his looks and by his guile I am left the impression that he has spent exactly twice that number of years in this place. I am bound to use the House as something of a pubhc confessional to say that the honourable gentleman represents the complete and utter exasperation of my Ufe. I have, for some 20 years, been trying to insult him. It is impossible. I once accused him of suffering from the Munchausen syndrome. He said he thought it was a horse running at Randwick but he would check on it. I said: 'WeU, we will meet at Phtitipi'. He said: 'Don't you put such an indecent proposal to me but I will find out where it is.' Many years ago- I hope it is not a breach of personal confidence but something was going on in this place-h e said: 'Come and have a drink'. I asked: 'Where?' He said: 'In my room'. He shared, in those days, an office with a very distinguished member of this Parliament, the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) who has spent 30 years here. We went there. I said: 'Where is the drink? In the filing cabinet?' He pulled out the filing cabinet. Do honourable members know what came out? It was a bottle of Scotch whisky. Do honourable members know what it was filed under? It was' unity tickets'. I am a card carrying member of the Irish Association and it is a matter of some anguish to me to find out that the progenitors of Frederick Michael Daly are not as Irish as he would occasionaUy make out. I have looked at a different fantily tree from the one which my friend the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has looked at. I found a Daly crest which bespeaks to this: 'On a wreath of the colours a cat's head erased at the neck and a fronte of a tabby colour holding in the mouth a rat sable'. After having heard that cats were associated with the honourable gentleman I found myself immediately a victim of atiurophobia which, shortly, means a morbid fear of cats. I looked at the honourable gentleman's maiden speech, which was deUvered in October 1943. What a powerful and forward looking nunciation that was. Let me recapture something of the spirit of it. He said: An essential of the new orderThat felicitous term would have tumbled out of yearNorthern the his mouthmust be full time employment for all those willing There it is. My honourable friend is beyond insult. I have not the sUghtest doubt that that go out in the next Australian Assistance Plan as the thoughts of Fred Daly. It is not as though my friend the honourable member for New England has turned his Uterary talent in the singular to the honourable member for Grayndler. He fell over some time ago, the House wtil recall, and broke his arm. I found out that he was out walking his dog- a dog which rejoices in the name of Grayndler. I sent him a telegram saying that his behaviour should be reported to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but he was not taken aback by that. Australia's poet laureate has turned to the honourable gentleman this evening to mark his 32 years here and this is what has been produced: 'The time has come', Fred Daly said, 'To talk of many things: Of parliamentary privilege, And how to pull the strings. Of why we travel 2nd class Though Gough still has his wings. 'As Leader of the House', said Fred, 'My works have been sublime I've guillotined Bills out of sight, To meet the stress of time. For 32 long years I've slaved And still just in my prime. ' Yet I must tell you all', said Fred, 'That I have had a ball. My Opposition friends may say I've had a lot of gall. But when I go they 11 doubtless say: ""Our Fred was loved by all''.'",107
214,Mr WHITLAM,ADJOURNMENT,"The House has certainly never heard to better advantage the 2 speakers who have spoken first in the adjournment debate. They did so with splendid preparation. They had a splendid case and their good humour and their wit were enjoyed by all. Their verses, I have no doubt, wtil been anthologised for many years to come. It is not often reaUsed how well read is the Leader of the House, Mr Daly, and how often he goes back to the basis of his faith, political and otherwise. When he first stood for Parliament in a seat which was later abolished, his slogan was: 'Give us this day our Daly Fred'. I would not deny that he has come out with some better slogans in the succeeding 32 years. The Deputy Leader of the National Country proParty, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), referred to Fred Daly's birth place, Currabubula. Of course, I then thought of my own filing system. I went back to a copy of Daily Leader of ANZAC Day, this or last year-it does not give the year. But there on the front page, not only in black and to work. white but with coloured headings and footnotes is: 'Currabubula's most famous son returns'. will This is the first issue of the Northern Daily Leader where a Labor man has dominated the members front page. Not only that, I happen to have preserved the fifth page on which there are 5 photographs of Currabubula's most famous son. ing The Northern Daily Leader is a journal of record. I can spare only a couple of quotations from the series of events which accompanied the return Currabubula's most famous son on ANZAC evewas last year or this year? Mr Daly-This year.",108
215,Mr WHITLAM,ADJOURNMENT,"This is generally a Country Party electorate. It quotes him as saying: ' I once jokingly told a Country Party M.P. that knew Thunderbolt'. He quipped: ' I thought he was Thunderbolt'. That is the only time that I have ever known Country Party member to score off Fred Daly. The Northern Daily Leader goes on to report, viously correctly: He is proud of his birthplace, much to the irritation Country Party opponents. 'They thought I had invented the place until them a map'. He pays proper tribute to his parents and to his school teachers. There is a quotation from one the last 'My old school teacher, Miss Nell Campbell, once said to me: ""You haven't any brains at all. You are sure to end politics"".' Fred Daly did end up in poUtics. He got in extracolleagues ordinarily young. Not only is he the father of the best way towith House, as the Deputy Leader of the National prowess in the Parliament, Country Party has said. He is also the father of give it and to take it in the Parliament, the Parliament, as the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) has pointed out. He has certainly come a long way. He is in charge of bers' transport. He came into the Parliament with an interest in this matter and some expertUament ise. I believe that his last job before becoming member of Parliament was in the bicycle area Bennett and Wood. But he certainly has much improved the quaUty of members* transport. Contrary to some newspaper reports, he did not speak in Caucus on this subject at aU and voted ih favour of economy travel for members of Parliament and pubUc servants. Nevertheless, last weekend I was out in back blocks, because I love the country and loved in the country. I was at a place twice as away as Currabubula. It was Eulo. The nearest large town, 42 kilometres away, is CunnamuUa. was at the lizard derby. The local member, good friend the honourable member for we can Maranoa (Mr Corbett), said to me that Fred Daly had certainly made it easier for members with large electorates to discharge their electoral responsibUities. It is now possible for private with large electorates to have access, to a degree that was not previously possible even for Ministers, to every form of transport, includcharter aircraft. Again for the first time since . he became a member 32 years ago, Fred Daly has made it possible for members to receive adof ditional electoral assistance. Again this reform very gravely misrepresented, and he was traduced for it. There can be no question that members who have the responsibUity of looking after the numbers of people that we do in this House and the range of matters on which we have to advise as we do in this House certainly my father needed that additional assistance. Members of Parliament, irrespective of their poUtics, can be indebted to this great parliamentarian for the faa cUities that he has made avaUable to them. obHe has been a great parliamentarian. I think I can say that nothing has given him more satisfacof his tion than being able to demonstrate that the 4 latest members of the ministry, Senators I showed Wheeldon and James MCClelland and Messrs Riordan and Berinson, got there because they had distinguished themselves as parliamenof tarians. Fred Daly loves this place. He loves the colour, the confrontation of it. He constantly advocates that members of Parliament should up in devote themselves to the processes of the Parliament and follow the proceedings of the Parliament. He has pointed out to so many of our get legitimate aspirations that the further is to demonstrate their their willingness to to follow its proceedings and to contribute to them. memHe has a capacious memory. Certainly nobody could have profited more from 32 years in Parthen he. He knows precedents. He has a mulled them over. He is creative in his adapof tation of those precedents. I cannot say how I am indebted to him for his conduct of the affairs of the House. There is no doubt that our affairs, in atimeof extraordinary stress, potitihe caUy and economically, have been conducted with the greatest dexterity by the Leader of the House. Also, he has done so with a degree of the good humour which I never thought would have I am been possible. Since he became Leader of the farHouse there have been only 2 occasions when it has sat after 11 p.m. On those 2 occasions the I honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr my Lionel Bowen, was in charge. That means that always be sure of having a full day, an entertaining day and a wholesome night'srest.As we go to sleep peacefully and chastely in our beds at the Kurrajong or what-have-you, we can all bear in mind the fact that our day has been entertaining and our night will be restful because of the long experience and the dedication to this institution of our colleague the honourable member for Grayndler.",109
216,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, rarely have heard tonight's speakers to better advantage. thank particularly my colleague member for Sydney (Mr Cope) for his sincere and complimentary remarks. In return, may I say that he also is a very distinguished member of this House and his cheerful acceptance of giving and taking and suffering the disappointments that go with parliamentary life should be an example to all members of Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said that my slogan was: 'Give this day our Daly Fred'. But the Liberals on occasion, as usual, were very dirty in their camweight paign and they put out a slogan that I thought very nasty. It was: Be healthy, be liberal, be clean, change Daly. It was a good sign but they put it up in too many places near the gas works and it not last long. I am happy to say that very few of girls changed Daly. I sincerely thank honourable members for their compliments. I thank my colleague, the honourdifficult able member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I have a soft spot for the Country Party although may not always be apparent. I look with great connever cern at Ralph Hunt and worry about how he will go in the electorate. When I lived in Currabubula the only culture was agriculture. Now, under Libgreats eral and National Country Party representation, they have really turned the corner. Currabubula to attend an art show even I bought a few products in the company of my distinguished friend from New England. I thank him sincerely for his complimentary remarks tonight. In other circumstances and at other times and if I had misguided-yo u never know- I might have been National Country Party member. Fortunately I saw the light in time and shifted to the city. I was interested also to hear my colleague honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) did speak tonight. I am always worried about Philippi because I understand that when I get to Philippi will know my hour has come. I am always embarknow rassed by the honourable member for Moreton cause he is so intelligent that it takes me days know whether I have been insulted or praised by him. Whenever he says anything about me the Lilation. brary goes mad. Its officers say: 'Do you want know what Mr Kilien said again?' I say: They say to me: 'It is all right'. So I go and rest happily. The honourable member might recollect also that with one of those gags I sometimes shoot down 58 galahs. Little did we know the talent of the honourable members opposite for poetry. Tonight we heard it even from the National Country Party. That is really notable. The honourable member for Moreton is a well known poet in this place. I thank honourable members sincerely for their very generous remarks. I thank the Prime 1 Minister (Mr Whitlam), who made possible my I occupation of my present position, for his very the honourable complimentary remarks. When I came to this place I made Paul Keating look like a heavyweight. I weighed 8 stone 6 pounds and thought I knew everything; but when I looked across the table and saw Billy Hughes, the late John Curtin, the late Ben Chifley, not to mention the late Artie Fadden, Sir John MCEwen, us Harold Holt and Larry Anthony, the father of that Doug Anthony, I knew that I was not the top that I thought I was. Politics has given to was me the opportunity to Uve with some of the really great men on both sides of the Parliament. I came into this Parliament at the time of the war in 1943 did and was here when Douglas MACArthur walked my into the dining room, where we sat tonight, and it was a case of salvation through him, America and others. They are great memories of grim and times. They are memories that I cherish and for which I have a great regard. I was privileged to enter the Parliament when I was young. it They were formative years and years that I have forgotten. I had the opportunity, thanks to my membership of the Labor Party and the support of the people in my district, to mingle with the of Australian politics and to have not only experiences but also memories that probably come When I went to to few people. It is interesting to note that at this stage there is nobody on the staff or in the Parliament who was here when I came here. There is a certain sadness been about that, but a great deal of experience and a many memories are associated with thetimethat has elapsed since I first came to the Parliament. The National Country Party wtil well remember the late Joe Abbott, a famous Country Party memthe ber. In those days there were great debates. We seefitto nationalise the banks on one occasion. That not only frightened the banks but also, I I think, frightened hell out of us. Few people would what an exciting experience it is for an behonourable member who has a majority of about to 150 in an electorate of 70 000 to have to listen to thousands and thousands of protests about legisSome of our fellows had 2 people helping to them-on e opening the protests and the other des'Yes'. troying them, they were so frightened. People tell me today that we have problems but they just do not know what was around in those days. Not many people realise that during the war years, when we were looking for a vote, it was difficult even to get a sheep's liver. First of all a woman who wanted one had to go and get a medical prescription. Then she had to send it to the rationing commission, and then the rationing commission rang up the local member to see whether she was entitled to the liver, and if she was entitled to it she sent the prescription to the butcher. Then the butcher sent it to the rationing commission and in the end I sent her a letter and said: 'The liver is all right, madam; you can live a while longer'. It sounds funny now but it kept a lot of people alive. The Indian people in Australia wanted rice. WeU, one was forever racing around looking for rice packets. Those kinds of things all happened in those years of conflict, and I have great memories of them. I found when I looked up the record tonight I have served with 8 Prime Ministers, the vast mawill jority of them, unfortunately, Liberals. I also found that I have been here in the time of 9 Goverture nors-General. In addition to that, of course,-1 served with other ex-Prime Ministers in Jim Scullin and the late Sir Earle Page and others. AU in they are memories worth recalling. A night Uke this in the Parliament is to me a tremendous thing and I thank sincerely those on both House who have made it possible. When I was elected to Parliament I was told that I was a oncer. I ask those honourable bers opposite who hold slim seats to remember that. Then I won the second time and I was twicer. Then the electors made me a lifer, which made me happier still. The point about the thrust of poUtics is that it is a dangerous thing to permanent enemies on either side or even in one's own Party because the feUow who is against you today may be with you tomorrow. Consequently, whtie we fight bitterly here, I always think that Uke a football match. You want to be able to forget what has happened if you can. But emotions run deep, issues are great and, ofcourse, inevitably get into conflict sometimes in a way that involves us much more deeply than we would wish. In the Parliament we represent all sections. No matter who we might be, we are privileged and tremendously fortunate to be members of ParUacause ment when we realise that there are only 127 of out of a population of 13 million. When we think things are bad, we should remember that we have been chosen to act in the interests of the people whom we want to see enjoy a good way of Ufe, and secure economically and in every way. GeneraUy speaking I have had great friendships on both sides of the Parliament. I wiU never forget how magnificent my friend the honourable memthat ber for Moreton was on one occasion. It was a point. magnificent occasion. Even the then Prime Minister said so. I value his friendship although I would not Uke him to represent me in court. But he is all right to listen to here. Having said so much, I would like to thank again sincerely members of this House. I have spoken tonight in a somewhat congenial and frivolous way but I would like honourable members to know that the way in which I have spoken does not hide the sincerity I feel tonight for the comradeship displayed in this gathering and for the sentiments expressed by all who have spoken. In every way this wtil be a golden day in my poltiical career. It will be something to remember; something to record. I never thought on that long day.32 years ago today that I would see such a day. To you all I express my sincere thanks for a really that great compliment which is deeply appreciated. I seek to restorefirstclass air travel and also cut out the use of the gag and the guillotine as a gesof my appreciation and goodwUl to you all.",110
217,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I should mention to the House aU that it has been drawn to my attention that the honourable member's famUy slogan is, Virtue is the path of Ufe. We will remember to remind him sides of the of what he has just said.",111
218,Mr HEWSON,ADJOURNMENT," I do not wish to appear to be discourteous after what has membeen said but perhaps honourable members may have thought that the Minister for Services and a Property (Mr Daly) was going to retire undefeated. In this Parliament on 27 September 1973 I proposed by way of a private member's motion, make which was carried, that the Australian Government and the Victorian Government get together to plan the use of our natural resources of brown coal. This objective could be achieved by way of a it is carefuUy planned program and feasibUity studies into the estabUshment of a national project for the production of oti from coal. My request was for the we Australian Government to co-operate and to assist the Victorian Government to bring this about. That move was made 2 years ago during which time the only activity of any consequence has been in Victoria. But let that not be a criticism to any great degree of the Australian Government be there are some real reservations on the part us of the Victorian Government about the possibility of a Connor takeover. With the great earnestness that our Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) may have to carry out such an exercise- I free am pleased that he is sitting in the chamber tonight-ther e would be no possibUity of his doing so because of the proprietaryrightswhich are Victoria's over the La Trobe Valley coal, and I think the Minister might agree with me on that In my earnestness to have this national project and national necessity become a reaUty I asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy a number of questions about this matter. Because of the information that I had acquired about the process of getting oil from coal, I made a private trip overseas to West Germany and to the German Democratic RepubUc. My trip has widened my vision and confirmed the points of view that I held. Obtaining oU from coal is part of a total energy concept in the German Democratic RepubUc. There are great opportunities for Australia to become self sufficient or independent producers of the oU which we badly need if our Federal and State governments co-operate and come together in a genuine and mutual arrangement. They could quickly put together all the available technical knowledge that is known to Germany and to Australia and the financial resources could be coopted to finance the project. Without authority I proposed to the Minister Science and Technology and to the Foreign Minisnational ter in the German Democratic RepubUc that it might be possible to form a consortium. This is being considered by the German Democratic RepubUc. Its contribution could be the provision of machinery and know-how. I advise this course as a matter of urgency because apart from the that a properly financed oU from coal project be a viable proposition in itself, it opens up opportunities for trade. The German Democratic that RepubUc is anxious to be a successful tenderer the provision of the equipment and technical know-how. It made this quite plain and quite clear to me in my discussions with several of its Ministhe ters during my visit there. I want this House and this Government that as a private member of this Parliament I was welcomed into serious discussions on the oU from coal requirement's, and I promised to tell this ParVictoria Uament of the discussions and of the goodwUl which was generated because of the frankness of the discussions. As I was eager to encourage trade on a reciprocal basis I had with me the Australian Trade Commissioner in East Berlin, Dr John Morey. I want to say here that Australia is fortudifferent nate in having a man of the quaUty and high integrity of this officer negotiating in every availtance able avenue of trade. The purpose of my address to this Parliament is to alert the Government of the fact that there are great opportunities for developtive ing potential trade. Obtaining oil from presents one very real avenue. The keenness of the Ministers of the German Democratic Republic trade was kindled, but it was equaUy matched by John Morey and myself to make it reciprocal trade. I pressed the German Democratic RepubUc to consider taking some of the great quantities of beef which are available in Australia, as well as our minerals. If by any chance this Government were objective enough to offer financial assistance to Victoria to get the oU project off the ground, these are some of the trading opportunities which could be successfuUy negotiated. Whilst I was in the German Democratic RepubUc I was hosted as an official representative of this Parliament. I was given every courtesy and every opportunity to see for myself the process of a total energy concept. I believe that as a private member and as a back bench member of the Opposition I have done my part in continuing to foster interest in the production of oU from coal. I believe that it is the responsibiUty of the Australian Government and of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) to offer to assist the Victorian Government either by way of a direct financial of grant or as a partner in a consortium to get this project to a stage where the Victorian Government can negotiate with the suppUers for the necessary machinery and technical know-how. If the Minister for Minerals and Energy wants to see Australia independent of imported otis and fact totally capable of producing the heavy oU now can required for refinery processes he should heed great what I am saying. I have told the House before Australia wtil be in a precarious position in the for event of any aggression. If we were realistic we would see that this proposition as part of our defence effort. I appeal to the Government to realise importance of trading opportunities which should be fostered between countries. We cannot afford to close our eyes to the opportunities which to know are avaUable to us. I can do no more than genuinely and seriously request that as a Federal Government, we assist to launch this oU from coal project so that our trade commissioners throughout the world can seize the opportunity to use that in trade nego- tiations. If anyone doubts my ability to present the facts to prove my argument, then let me say this. I have seen oU produced from coal. I have seen the methods by which it can be produced. I have seen the residual by-products and the imporof them. Australia would be a very independent and self-sufficient country if she embarked upon the project. I hope that I shall see some posimoves before our opportunities are lost to us coal and our trade potential with it. to Question resolved in the affirmative.
