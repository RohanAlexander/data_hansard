1,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. PARLIAMENT HOUSE: NA",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,DEMONSTRATION,"The disgraceful and totally unjustifiable episode that occurred yesterday afternoon in this Parliament House is one of the most shameful in this nation's history. I am sure I speak for members on both sides of this House when I say that the opportunity for law-abiding citizens to express by peaceful protest, by orderly and nonviolent demonstration or by other acceptable means their dissent from decisions made by governments is acknowledged as one of the fundamental privileges in a free and democratic society. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure it is a privilege that is not abused. What happened in this place yesterday should never have happened. Those responsible for transforming what was meant to be a well-organised demonstration into the ugly and violent display that ultimately eventuated deserve the strongest condemnation. Members should be aware that every endeavour had been made to ensure that this pre-budget NA Hansard 1996 (SECOND PERIOD) 1996, pursuant to resolution, adjourned to to that resolution the House of Representatives protest activity would proceed in an acceptable and reasonable manner. There were a number of meetings between Parliament House security authorities, the police and representatives of the demonstrators prior to yesterday's rally and it had been hoped that these discussions would assist in promoting peaceful protest action. Briefly, by way of background, on 4 July the ACT Trades and Labour Council wrote to the President and me about a rally to be staged at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the building. We responded to that request on 24 July. We approved the protest and the march around the building subject to the following conditions: that the march not start earlier than 1.35 p.m. and be completed by 2.25 p.m.; that marshals be appointed and clearly identified to cooperate with the police in managing the march to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flows and access to the building for emergency and other vehicles; that all efforts be made by participants in cooperation with marshals and the police to ensure that roadways leading from Parliament Drive to the building and entrances to the underground car parks remain unobstructed so as not to prevent the free movement of vehicles and people in and out of Parliament House; and that the march be contained to Parliament Drive. There were subsequent discussions with representatives of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Aboriginal community. All concerned were advised of the approved march and agreed to contain their activities to the authorised event. Most regrettably, this agreement was broken and the conditions were not adhered to. The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20 p.m. when a separate group of marchers entered the parliamentary precincts. This group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in the police lines and ran towards the main entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous behaviour by a speaker from the official platform. Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah, which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and then redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors. Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons including a large hammer, wheel brace, steel trolley and stanchion tom from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, dispersed. In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal Police on duty at the start of the demonstration in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans. The outrageous events which took place yesterday resulted in not only financial but, more importantly and lamentably, human costs. So far about 90 personnel have reported injuries including lacerations, sprains and head and eye injuries and I understand one person remains in hospital. An initial indicative estimate of the damage to the forecourt and the foyer is upwards of $75,000. Emergency repairs have already been completed. The full extent of the looting and criminal damage which resulted from the occupation of the Parliament House shop has yet to be determined. Nine persons were arrested and have been charged with a variety of offences. I would like to commend the Parliament House security staff, Australian Protective Service officers and Australian Federal Police officers for ensuring that the building essentially remained secure. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of several other members of staff who were called upon unexpectedly to provide assistance in the initial stages of the disturbance. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the Parliament House nurses. They performed in a most commendable and professional manner, treating approximately 40 injured personnel on the floor of the foyer. I also want to mention that the nurses were assisted in their efforts by our colleague Trish Worth and by an anonymous woman, presumably with nursing experience, who had been showing some American visitors around the Great Hall when the violence erupted. The President and I have asked parliamentary security officials to undertake an urgent and detailed review of the management of similar demonstrations in the future. We expect to receive this report shortly. I am aware that there has been some comment about reductions in parliamentary security staffing. These reductions essentially involved the closure of security points, and I do not believe that they affected in any way the si tuation yesterday. On a more positive note, I want to advise members that the Parliament House shop will reopen on Wednesday, 21 August as originally planned. I hope Bill Podmore and his staff will receive the support they deserve. They were stoic under enormous pressure yesterday, but they are already up and running with plans in hand for what will hopefully be a once only and never to be repeated giant sale of damaged stock. I would also like to take this opportunity remind members of their obligations in regard to visitors. Members are responsible for the conduct of any visitors they sign into Parliament House and this responsibility is not one that should be taken lightly. Finally, I want to apologise most sincerely to the Australian people and those from overseas who were visiting Parliament House and were unfortunately involved, inconvenienced, frightened or shocked in any way by this deplorable incident. To them. I say: what you witnessed here yesterday is not typical of Australia or Australians, and I believe I speak for all my colleagues when I say we hope and pray it never will be.",13
3,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, may I have your indulgence to address the matter that you have just spoken to. On behalf of the government, I want to endorse everything you have said about what happened yesterday. It was very unpleasant, very unhappy and, for the people involved-the Australian Federal Police and Parliament House staff whose responsibility it was to deal with this incident-a very frightening experience and not an experience I would want any of them to go through again. I have already personally thanked on behalf of the government-and I now do so on behalf of the people of Australia-all of the police officers and Parliament House staff. I had the opportunity of speaking to an assembly of them with you yesterday. It is appropriate on an occasion like this to remark again, and very forcefully, that although the police services of this country come in for a lot of criticism, and although in some areas that criticism on occasions may be justified, they do have, on occasions when they are needed, an unenviable job. Nobody should ever diminish in any way the unpleasant character of police work. On occasions like this, when we all owe them something, we ought to remark on how much in debt the Australian community is to its police services. Government members-Hear, hear!",15
4,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"I would also like to inform the House that just before lunch I went to Woden hospital and visited Constable to Allison Castles who was injured in yesterday's demonstration. She was kicked in the head and in the abdomen by some of these 'courageous' demonstrators. I am pleased to say that she is recovering well and she will be out of hospital, I hope, this afternoon. I also saw in hospital Ray Ramsay, a very well known member of the staff, who is having an operation on his finger about now. He was in cheerful spirits, and I am sure he will be out of hospital and well on the road to a full recovery very shortly. I said yesterday, and I want to take the opportunity of saying it again, that this government will never be intimidated by violence or threats of violence. Government members-Hear, hear!",15
5,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Anybody who thinks for a moment that any purpose was served by the violent demonstration that took place yesterday and that that will intimidate this government into changing its policies on anything is 100 per cent wrong. Government members-Hear, hear!",15
6,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The policies that we were elected to implement will be implemented. I will never argue against the lawful right of Australian citizens to assemble and to voice their views in a strong and lawful manner against anything that is done by any Australian government. A peaceful demonstration against the policies of this government is perfectly acceptable; it is totally part of the democratic fabric of this country. But those who organise demonstrations have a responsibility to stop them getting out of hand. It is utterly disingenuous of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pretend that it can accept no responsibility at all for what happened yesterday. It must accept some of the responsibility for what occurred yesterday. The pathetic attempts by the President and the Secretary of that movement to evade that responsibility do not wash with the Australian people. I hope in the course of the discussion of this issue that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) will take the opportunity of repudiating, in language equally as strong as mine, what occurred yesterday and the total disassociation of the party that he leads from what occurred. I do not think anybody can for a moment pretend that those who organised yesterday's rally, those who used inflammatory language, those who exceeded reasonable political criticism, can completely escape responsibility for what occurred. Mrs Crosio interjecting",15
7,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"If I were you, I would keep very quiet. Robust political exchange is part and parcel of Australian life and I hope it will always remain part of Australian life, but thuggery and behaviour which allows thuggery to occur is not part of the Australian political scene. The attempt of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to disassociate themselves from what occurred and to evade responsibility for what occurred is disingenuous in the extreme and, I am sure, will not be accepted by the Australian people. I hope an incident like yesterday's never occurs again. On behalf of the government I say that our resolve to continue to implement the program which we were elected on 2 March to implement remains utterly and completely undiminished.",16
8,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I am very happy indeed to speak in disassociation as suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because I did it yesterday. I did it repeatedly yesterday. There is absolutely no way any member of parliament or anybody of any decency or goodwill in the community can, under any circumstances at any time, condone, support or give comfort to violence in relation to any form of political activity in a democracy-none. We made that point absolutely clear yesterday when invited to do so-indeed, prior to being invited to do so. I also appreciate the Prime Minister's remarks supporting a robust democracy which invites the public to express themselves not simply at the ballot box but also in an appropriate, peaceful, lawful political fashion in public discussion; minimising, via that process, disruption to the activities of this parliament and, of course, ensuring by that process that nobody suffers from any act of violence and ensuring the obligation to contain any act of violence. I join with you, Mr Speaker, in your words of praise to the Federal Police, the attendants and the nurses. I was not aware that we also owe a debt to Trish Worth, but I join you in praising the efforts that she obviously made to assist people who had been injured in the melee. . I, too, rang the deputy police commissioner yesterday to inquire as to the fate of the police officer who was lamentably placed in hospital as a result of ruthless acts. I was comforted to hear that she is doing well, as the Prime Minister noted today from his visit to her. I am afraid, however, that, whilst this action was unique in its violence, it was not unique in its disruption. I have been in this parliament for 15 years now and I am afraid I have seen too frequent occasions such as this. When I was first elected to parliament we had the situation where demonstrators broke in as far as Kings Hall in Old Parliament House. We were sitting in question time, I recollect, and could hear the chanting from there. We have had more recent examples of that. Last year we had, of course, a blockade of the parliament which prevented services coming into the place. That affected the capacity of the parliament to perform its tasks. I recollect that at that time additional guidelines were delivered, based on that particular experience. Those guidelines, I understand, went towards creating exclusive arrangements to prevent people getting at the front doors of parliament. I would ask you to review those guidelines to see whether, in your judgment, in circumstances where a very large demonstration was likely to occur, all had been done to prevent people getting into a position where they could run at that front door. I would ask you to review those guidelines. If those guidelines are inadequate, then I would ask you to seek changes to them on the basis of consultation with others in the parliament-and, of course, the President-to ensure that this situation could not occur again. I would also ask you to review the security arrangements associated with parliament to see whether or not there is an adequate security staff in the parliament. We have to understand that, and we ought to have understood it for many years now because our experience has been such that these things do occur basically once every two or three years, and demonstrations out the front now are frequent. I do believe there is a requirement for a review of the security arrangements, including the strength of particular doors and approaches to the parliament. Other parliaments are, I believe, more realistic than we are as far as these matters are concerned. I refer to the security arrangements for the protection of the building, the adequacy of the forces to protect it and the guidelines that apply when any demonstrations occur. I think the tragedy caused by the lunatics who attacked the parliament, apart from the absolutely unacceptable consequences in terms of personal damage and damage to property, is that they drew attention away from what was, around the country, a peaceful and lawful demonstration by decent citizens asserting their rights democratically to express their concerns about the direction of government policy, about broken undertakings in relation to the budget and about broken undertakings in relation to industrial relations. Those are precisely the concerns of a large number of mainstream Australians. There were effectively two demonstrations yesterday. One occurred peacefully, which was attended by a very large number of our fellow citizens from decent ordinary mainstream Australian backgrounds-some 20,000 of them. Then there were about 500 to 1,000 louts who went off and attacked the front of parliament. I notice that the ACTU has disassociated itself from their activity.",16
9,Unknown,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,Government members interjecting,17
10,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,Order! There is too much noise on my right.,17
11,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"There is obviously a requirement on the part of the ACTU or anyone else who organises a demonstration in this place that their demonstrations are properly marshalled on all occasions. The failure to do so yesterday is to be deprecated as far as properly marshalling activities are concerned. The parliament of Australia, however, needs to be prepared in case that situation emerges. It is not as though, as I said, this has not happened before. The parliament has been broken into. From time to time people have effectively heckled events in this chamber from the gallery. Mr Speaker, I do believe it is essential at this point of time that this matter does not pass, that this matter is looked into closely by you and any changes that need to be made get made. NA",17
12,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) will be absent from question time today due to budget preparation. The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) will answer questions on his behalf. NA University Grants,17
13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall the coalition's promise before the last election to 'at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants'? The Prime Minister will be aware of the announcement by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs on 9 August 1996 to, among other things, massively cut operating grants to universities. Is the Prime Minister also aware that the Vice Chancellor of Deakin University, Professor Geoff Wilson, described those decisions affecting universities as 'the worse news the university system in this country has ever had'? Will the Prime Minister now admit that his government has betrayed its promise by its decision to cut university funding by some $2 billion?",17
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't admit that my government has betrayed anything in relation to universities. The opposition leader has had a very bad couple of days. He has had a very, very bad presentation and, much to his disappointment, he's going to have a very bad budget tonight because the budget tonight will deliver, in a strong but fair manner, on our overriding commitments to the Australian people. It will deliver on our promise to get the economy right. It will deliver on our promise to mainstream Australia. Can I say how absolutely fascinating it is that the Leader of the Opposition has grabbed hold of this word 'mainstream'. They used to talk about the middle ground. It seems as though his market researchers have said, 'You better start saying mainstream a bit more often, Kim.' He peppered his little indulgence speech with a reference to mainstream Australia. Returning to the university package, I think the balance struck between increases in higher education charges and changes to the operating grants were very much fairer and more balanced than many people in the university sector had expected, and many people in the university sector, if they are publicly candid as they have been privately candid, will acknowledge that overall it is an extremely fair and balanced package and it ought to get the support of the Australian people. Budget 1996-97 Miss JACKIE KELLY-I have children from the Cambridge Gardens Public School with me today. My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In tonight'S budget will the government focus on important matters in my electorate of Lindsay, which are important to those children living there, such as small business, families and youth? What are the economic imperatives driving the government's budget strategy?",18
15,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left! I will not tolerate this continuing level of interjection.,18
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't think the Leader of the Opposition would have impressed any of your constituents with what he had to say a few moments ago. It was a disingenuous attempt to lecture the Speaker about arrangements for the House--talk about a pathetic performance. The member for Lindsay-and long may you continue to represent the electorate of Lindsay-can inform her constituents that tonight's budget will go very much to the needs and concerns of the mainstream families of western Sydney because tonight's budget will deliver in full on the $4 billion family tax package over a period of four years. It will deliver on the private health insurance commitment. It will deliver far more effective and targeted programs to tackle the problem of youth unemployment. Most importantly, through the fiscal restoration that the budget will achieve, it will lay the foundation in the medium term for further reductions in interest rates. You ought to say to the people of Lindsay that since the coalition government has been in office average housing loan interest rates have declined by $80 a month. The opposition may laugh, but the fact is that since we have been in power they have declined by $80 a month. If you want to add up the benefits of the decline in housing interest rates, the benefits of the family tax package and the benefits of the health insurance rebate, you will find that there are enormous family benefits for the people of Lindsay. If it should transpire that the people of Lindsay have the opportunity of again deciding whom their representative will be, those will be four reasons why they will overwhelmingly return their current member, Miss Jackie Kelly. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",18
18,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I must say, in response to his comments on interest rates, that the Treasurer looked like a stunned mullet when the Reserve Bank dropped that one on him. That was supposed to happen after the budget.",18
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,18
20,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Prime Minister recall the promise before the election that The coalition has consistently opposed changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study and we will maintain this position in government'? The Prime Minister will also recall the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs announcing on 9 August 1996 that the recovery of the HECS debt from graduates would be accelerated, including for existing students and graduates, amounting to some $800 million over four years. Will the Prime Minister now admit that his government has betrayed existing university students by breaking its promise on HECS?",19
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the contrary, by keeping HECS charges exactly as they are for existing students, we have not betrayed them at all. Industrial Relations",19
22,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of any deliberate efforts by unions to mislead Australian workers about the changes proposed by the coalition to the industrial relations system?,19
23,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As I watched television last night I was struck by the comments of a number of people who were at the rally, expressing their views about the workplace relations bill. What struck me were some of the comments that related to some of the details of the bill. The reason I respond this way to the honourable member is that, whilst what we saw yesterday was an ACTU sponsored rally that got out of control, what has not been out of control is the way in which the ACTU has run a systematic campaign of misinformation and propaganda about our legislation. For example, I heard a person on television last night say that we would force workers onto individual contracts.",19
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Nonsense!,19
25,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is simply not true. The guarantee that we gave in our policy and which is in the legislation is that, if you are on an award and you want to stay on an award, you can do so. It is there in black and white. I also heard yesterday a political delivery by the Leader of the Opposition who was talking about the government hating workers-or words to that effect.",19
26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you do hate workers.,19
27,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,19
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right!,19
29,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And he has just repeated the line; he has just endorsed that. The fact of the matter is that the government's legislation is not anti-worker and it is not anti-union. As much as they may scoff, if you look at the provisions of our legislation, we support the right of people to be in a union and to be active in their union. Furthermore, we have lifted the penalties on those employers who wish to deny the right of employees to be in a union. Our point of disagreement with the ACTU is not whether people should have the right to be in a union but whether you should have the right not to be in a union. We, of course, back that 100 per cent by what we are doing. As evidence of this campaign of misinformation which has been run by the ACTU and its affiliated unions and labour councils, I have here a document with a misnomer'Fact Sheet One'-put out by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. This, unfortunately, is typical of the propaganda that you are putting out and which you as a political party have been endorsing in the last few days. For example, this one is telling workers in capital in letters 'You lose' and that taken away will be your 'rates of pay'. That is a blatant and absolute lie. It is an absolute lie and our legislation is proof of that. This is extreme stuff, typical again, as I say, of what these people are putting out. For example, it says, 'You lose basic human rights.' That is a basic lie. That is an absolute lie. The fact is that we have legislated to protect people's basic human rights and their entitlements. It goes on to say, 'You're no longer safe at work.' That is an outrageous and irresponsible statement to make. In fact"" under the heading 'Occupational health and safety' - occupation health and safety is basically a state matter anyway-in terms of our federal law, we again support the importtion ance of having workplaces which are safe and where the entitlements and rights of employGiven ees are protected by law; and we do so. As one other example, this document says, 'You just lost control of your savings, unless you can bargain with the boss.' Again, another lie-another blatant lie-which you people have been propagating in the lead-up to this rally. The fact is that, in respect superannuation, people's basic entitlements are protected by federal law, and that will continue to be case. By all means, there is a genuine debate about the government's workplace relations bill-of course there is-and we have prepared-in fact, we have bent over backwards-to speak with the trade union leadership, with the rank and file, with the employers and with any members of the community who wanted to express a point of view. But, ultimately, we have a particular and higher duty, and that is an obligation to fulfil the promises that we made at the last election. the workplace relations bill, we have before the parliament a legislative proposal encapsulates the very promises we made to the Australian people. So, whilst the details of yesterday will the subject of a lot of discussion, the reality is that, in the lead-up to yesterday's rally, Labor Party and the ACTU have been running a systematic campaign of propaganda and misinformation about what we are doing. we are to have a sensible debate in this country, there is plenty enough to argue about without you fabricating the basic elements what we are proposing. Mrs Crosio-So why did you gag our best debate?",19
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect! Contain yourself. Mrs Crosio-You did. You gagged the debate.,20
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for your Prospect. Wage Rates,20
32,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Educathrough and Training. It follows the last answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations. that yesterday's rally arose from concern by working Australians about cuts to their wages, do you recall telling them in this place on 18 June that under your wage plan just 'Employers will pay the same amount for apprentices and trainees as they are paying at the moment'? That is a view that has been of expressed by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the minister: wasn't your statement the month later on Channel 9's Sunday program announcing a wage top-up by the government, where employers can pay employees less, an admission that you were wrong and, accordingly, been didn't you mislead this House?",20
33,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham shows that he still has not grasped even the simple fundamentals of the policy: Mr Crean-Be honest; you have cut them.,20
34,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not listen to the policy. He just goes out there and spreads his In disinformation regardless of the facts. Let me state the facts, Mr Speaker, for the which member for Hotham. He is the man who reduced apprenticeships and traineeships in this community, as a proportion of the work be force, to the lowest number for three decades in 1995. He is the man who put young Austhe tralians on a merry-go-round of short-term training programs which, as the Working Nation evaluation shows, brought them right If back again to the back of the unemployment queues. This is the man who told us all the way through last year that he was going to of put $400 million into the new work opportunities program, which was going to be the thing ever for getting young people into jobs. We have had the evaluation of new work opportunities, and that $400 million program was the most ineffective labour market program of the lot. Eight out of 10 were still unemployed at the end of their experience in short-term training programs. Again and again, you misled people. In the World Today on 8 June last year, you were quoted as saying: for the assertion that we're putting people short-term training programs and then they come off the long-term unemployed list, I totally reject that. What did the evaluation of Working Nation say? It said: The relatively low outcome levels of NWO participants, however, means that the large majority of NWO participants will return to unemployment allowances. This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of 'recycling' clients from long-term to short-term unemployment, rather than substantially improving their labour market prospects. That is the evaluation. Let me just give you a few simple facts which completely show your lack of grasp in this area. The first is that there is no change whatever to the wage payments for existing apprentices and trainees under the government's policy. That was what I said earlier. That was what you quoted to the House. That remains the situation. Mr Crean-Why top-up?",20
35,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no top-up for existing apprentices and trainees. Read this information. Read the bill. You are not even on top of the legislation you are supposed to be responsible for.,21
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is a former minister.,21
37,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is hard to believe, listening to him. He sounds like the biggest amateur in the House. The wage top-up applies-and let everybody be clear about this, because there is going to be a continuing campaign of disinformation from that side of the House on the matter-to apprentices and trainees under the new Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements. Mr Crean-Because they can be paid less.",21
38,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will be paid the full award wage, whether that be the junior rate or whether it be an appropriate adult rate, by the employer for their productive work in the workplace. Mr MCMullan-After it has been topped up!",21
39,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has been misleading you, too, has he? You do not understand either? Mr Crean-Come on. Finish it.",21
40,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Listen to this, because you obviously do not understand it. Mr Crean-No, we understand it; you don't.",21
41,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They will be paid their full award wage for their productive work in their workplace. That is exactly the same principle that you approved for the national training wage. That is exactly the same principle which has been endorsed by the Industrial Relations Commission for the national training wage trainees-that they will be paid for their productive work. What we are doing under the flexibility introduced through the workplace relations legislation is to acknowledge realistically the amount of training that employers provide to trainees. Employers will be able to take this amount of training very properly into account with the trainees. Mr Crean-They will be paid less.,21
42,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the amount of training is substantial-and the amount of training may well be an amount of two days a week or three days a week-at some point that will simply mean that the incentives to enter into these arrangements will diminish for young people. . Mr MCClelland-They will have no choice.,21
43,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will have every choice in the world. No-one has to enter into these arrangements. These arrangements are totally voluntary. Nobody will be required to enter into these arrangements. The wage top-up will ensure that the incentives for these trainees and apprentices under the new arrangements will extend right across the working week for a full-time apprentice or trainee. They will receive, under the top-up, minimum national training wage levels. That is the reality of it. Every young person will receive at least minimum national training wage traineeship levels under the government's legislation. The top-up in no way contradicts what I said earlier to the House. What I said on the Sunday program was a clear explanation of this, which clearly the shadow minister for industrial relations and the Leader of the Opposition have not bothered listening to. In this area, as in higher education, you continue to spread your campaign of disinformation. Young people will know as soon as this legislation is passed that they will have the opportunity which you denied them throughout your time in office. Aboriginal Affairs",21
44,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Has the minister heard recent very public claims by certain political leaders that the government hates Aboriginal people? Are such claims an accurate representation of the government's ongoing commitment to the funding of indigenous programs?,22
45,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I acknowledge his very real record of achievement in helping Aboriginal territorians in his time in the Northern Territory parliament. I have heard the claims. If you look at the overall level of Aboriginal funding, it is certainly very far from the truth. If you look at five key areas of Aboriginal fundinghealth, housing, CDEP, employment related programs and native title assistance-the fact is that over the four years of the forward estiair, mates there will be very real increases in funding over what we have expected in the past. In the area for which I am directly responsible-Aboriginal health-over the next four years the funding will be $97 million more than in the previous four years. In the area of community housing and infrastructure the funding will be $26 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In the CDEP program the funding will be $337 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In the programs being run by DEETYA there will be $147 million more in the next four years than in the last four years and in native title assistance there will be $172 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In fact, over the whole range of indigenous assistance it will be going up $428 million over the next four years compared with what was spent in the last four years. In the next four years total funding be more than in any other year, with the sole exception of 1995-96. Aboriginal affairs is a difficult area. It is an area of intractable problems. We have put some difficult decisions on the ATSIC commissioners-no more difficult than what we had to do sitting around the table looking at the whole of government area. My experience has been that there is a very great desire from honourable members on all sides of this House and in the other place to try to do something to improve the situation of Aboriginal people. There are disagreements about the best way to go about that, but the sorts of flippant comments made yesterday do nothing to add to the debate. Ethanol",22
46,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What is your commitment to encouraging ethanol production in this eountry? Are you aware that the Manildra Flour Group has invested $35 million in Manildra and Nowra for value adding processes, including production of ethanol, a production and that many jobs are now under threat through the likely loss of the ethanol bounty? Where does this leave any government commitment to cleaner alternative energy and rural value adding industry?",22
47,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In essence, in terms of government outlays in relation to this matter, you need to await a few more short hours for the arrival of the budget. In broad terms, the government has a commitment to research in the area of alternative energy sources and, indeed, to such important aspects of energy as exploration, given Australia's quite tight stocks to usage ratios. Beyond that, the member should await tonight's announcements. Sporting Shooters",22
48,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and, most importantly, the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. I ask the minister: in light of the outstanding performwill ance by our athletes-men and women-at the Atlanta Games and, in particular, the fact that we won two gold medals and one bronze medal for shooting, can the minister indicate what level of funding he will be making for those who want to follow Commonwealth and Olympic disciplines in shooting in the years 1996 and 1997?",22
49,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I might point out that the two gold medallists, Michael Diamond and Russell Mark, who got the gold medals, and also Deserie Huddleston, who got a bronze medal in shooting, have certainly brought attention to the great performance at Atlanta that took place in a range of sports. To answer the minister's question specifically, in the last financial period running up to the Atlanta games, the government provided $950,000 to shooting sports. This was split in several different ways. Two-thirds of thatabout $590,OOO-was provided under the Olympic athlete program for the preparation of Australian shooters for the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games. The OAP funding allows Australia's leading shooters to have the opportunity to take part in high level training and also international competition. I might also point out that the proposal for funding for the next period will be dealt with by the Australian Sports Commission. What generally happens after each Olympic Games is that the Australian Sports Commission will review all of the performances of all the different teams and individuals, including Michael Diamond, Russell Mark and Deserie Huddleston. We will then make a judgment about which sports we believe will be in the best position to perform well in the 2000 Olympics. This is what happened after Barcelona. The actual amount that may well be provided to shooting as we prepare for the 2000 games has not yet been determined but will be shortly. The board meets again in early September. Given the performance that they achieved in Atlanta, I would imagine that the level of support would be equivalent at least to the $950,000-odd that was provided for the preparation up to the Atlanta games. I might also take the opportunity, in case there are no other questions, to make a comment about the Atlanta games. Can I point out that the first medal awards in the Olympic Games went to our shooters, but the total number of medals won was 41-nine gold, nine silver and 23 bronze-which saw Australia finish fifth in the overall medal tally. If we were to calculate it on a per capita basis against the United States, for example, they would have needed to win 589 medals when compared with the performance that Australia put in. They only won 101 medals. China would have had to have won some 2,263 medals. So Australia did very well indeed. The other point that needs to be made is that we finished well in advance of the medal tally we achieved in the Barcelona Olympics. We also saw 14 sports achieve medal wins compared with only nine in Barcelona. The very fundamental point that members should note is that there was a 33 per cent increase in the number of athletes who made it through to the finals or semi-finals. As we prepare for the 2000 Olympics, we can go forward with some confidence. Details of the budget announcements will be made tonight, but I was certainly pleased when the team returned home to Sydney to be welcomed by the Prime Minister by his indication of ongoing strong government support for the preparation of the Olympic team for the 2000 games. I am sure, like the Prime Minister and me, all members of the government-and indeed I hope all members on the other side of the House-would want us to extend on behalf of the parliament congratulations for a job well done and for the great pride that they brought to Australia. I might also indicate that during the time that I spent in Atlanta the Australian athletes were great ambassadors for Australia. The year 2000 looks very good, but it will require a cooperative and positive effort from everyone certainly in this chamber. Wage Rates",23
50,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Now that your colleague has confirmed that all new apprentices may be able to be paid less under Australian workplace agreements even after the top-up and that trainees wages can also be cut, will you amend the workplace relations bill to guarantee the protection of wages of all future trainees and apprentices?",23
51,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I will guarantee to the member is that I will set aside perhaps half hour or an hour and a half to give him a briefing of what actually is in our bill. Perhaps then he might finally understand it. These people are absolutely amazing. They just had the complete answer from the minister but it went right over their heads, they passed it to the bloke next door to he would do any better. I will explain for the member in plain, simple language how Australia's industrial relations system operates in respect of people who are trainees, juniors and apprentices. The Industrial Relations Commission has established award rates of pay for juniors, trainees and apprentices and it is those rates that are incorporated in our system. Mr MCMullan-Well, why do they have to be topped up?",24
52,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could the member possibly listen just for a moment? Where there is an award rate of pay established for the particular traineeship, including a national training wage traineeship or an apprenticeship, then that rate will continue to apply whether they are employed under an award or a workplace agreement. As the minister said so comprehensively and completely, that is no change. Do you understand that? There is no change. Mr MCMullan-So why are they to be topped up?",24
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The next question is: why are we doing what we are doing in the bill? I will try to answer it very simply for you. The only area of change is for new traineeships and apprenticeships where currently there is no relevant training award rate of pay. That will generally occur because a new trainees hip or apprenticeship with a different work training mix has been developed under the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. In other words, if the new arrangement you enter into has the same mix as the existing arrangements under the award, you get the same money. Mr Crean-Why top up if there is no drop?",24
54,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know it is hard for you, but all we are doing is introducing some greater flexibility where people want to vary these an arrangements. Where they do vary the arrangements, the principle upon which the calculation is made for what people are paid is exactly the same principle which you have publicly endorsed, which the ACTU has endorsed and which the Industrial Relations so Commission has ticked off. In fact, the memsee if ber who asked the question acknowledged himself that this is the right principle in a debate that we had a couple of months ago. I repeat my offer. We are prepared to brief you; we are prepared to spend a reasonable amount of time so that even you can understand the simple proposition that we advance. Let me complete with this point. The only reason we are doing this-if members opposite can understand this-is to actually try to give young people the chance of a traineeship which they were denied under your scheme. That is the reason we are doing it. I finish by complimenting the minister because, in the additional income support arrangements that he has made, he has provided real incentives and support. It gives a set of arrangements to support these industrial relations changes to the training arrangements which will see this as a very successful scheme. There are a lot of young Australians who will look forward to the passage of our legislation so that these benefits can also be available to them. Pacific Highway",24
55,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. With your announcement last week on road funding for the Pacific Highway, could you detail the benefits for the people of Paterson, and indeed all motorists, who travel the Pacific Highway? In addition, could you outline the progress of funding for the Raymond Terrace bypass, a road system ignored totally by the previous Labor government?",24
56,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. He quite rightly points out in the concluding remarks in his question that 13 years of a Labor government saw no improvement to the Pacific Highway under a Labor government initiative to upgrade that road, one of Australia's busiest and most dangerous, to a proper standard. Within the first few months of a coalition government being elected we have been pleased to be able to announce, in concert with the Queensland and New South Wales governments, a major upgrading of that road which will see $3.1 billion being spent over the next 10 years. Indeed, that allocation funds will bring the Pacific Highway up reasonable standard and lead to a significant reduction in the loss of lives and in injuries such as have occurred over the last 10 years. way. I remind the House that in the past 10 years some 600 people have lost their Pacific Highway, in many cases due to the poor standard of that road. As the honourable member for Paterson points out, a detailed program was announced jointly by me and the New South Wales Minister for Roads last week. It includes number of key projects, one of which is in honourable member for Paterson's own brought electorate. He said to me as we campaigned prior to the last election, 'If there is one we must do, it is to upgrade the Raymond Terrace road to bring it up to dual carriagein way standard.' Because of that initiative that he brought forward and because of his persistheir tent lobbying, I was pleased to be able announce that the Raymond Terrace part of the Pacific Highway will be upgraded carriageway. Of course, many other members from this side of the House have been campaigning to upgrade the Pacific Highway. Most of all, draw to the attention of members of this House the efforts of the member for Cowper, who in his 12 years here has relentlessly campaigned to upgrade the Pacific He has been joined in more recent years by the honourable member for Lyne, who has done a lot of work to ensure that this program comes to fruition, and by the recently elected honourable member for Page, who has campaigned also for a long time, both as a state member and as federal member, to upgrade Mr Speaker. the Pacific Highway. It is something that this government promised to do when in opposition. It was launched by the Prime Minister in the honourable member for Richmond's electorate, for a particular reason, during the last election campaign: because the member for Richmond made such an issue of it in his campaigning in the 1993 and 1996 election campaigns. He will be very pleased with the announcement made last week. The Prime Minister made the commitment in the run-up to the last elecof tion-a commitment that we have delivered, to a as we have with so many of them-to the Raymond Terrace section of the Pacific Highway being brought up to dual carriageMr Fitzgibbon-What about the New lives on the England highway?",24
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable members on my left!,25
58,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going to see work on the worse section where most accidents occur, on the Coolongolook-Bulahdelah section, a being brought forward to early next year. You the will see the Brunswick Heads bypass being forWard and turned into dual carriageway. You are also going to see work started thing on the Chinderah-Billinudgel section in the honourable member for Richmond's electorate the course of this parliament so that the electors in the seat of Richmond can say that member-and those other members. I to have mentioned-has done a fantastic job to improve the most important road infrastructo dual ture in their electorate. NA",25
59,Mr SPEAKER,PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE,"Order! Before calling the next questioner, I have just been advised that I Senator Margaret Reid has been elected President of the Senate. I have been further advised that Senator Colston has resigned from the ALP and is standing for the seat of Highway. Deputy President. NA Labour Market Programs",25
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't know why that second piece of advice needed to be given,",25
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You don't like it, do you?",25
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is another breach on your part. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to his draft communications strategy 'Reforms to labour market assistance and service delivery arrangements' and to the portions which describe this government of great integrity and that a softening process has begun across the portfolio with information released on redundancies, cuts to labour market programs, office closures, DSSC, CES, DIST and possible changes to Austudy and HECS? So we know where the leaks came from; it was part of a softening process. Has his attention also been drawn-and does he agree-to the portion which states that the weakness that will be there in the labour market program tonight includes 'potential for unemployment to rise'? Does he agree with that analysis by his communications people on these labour market programs? And was that analysis taken into account when the government framed its budget and agreed to break its promise not to cut labour market assistance?",26
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, can I say no, my attention has not been drawn to that document. I would warn the opposition leader that not every document that gets dumped into the lap of him or his shadow",26
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So this is not correct?,26
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't know. You asked me the question whether my attention has been drawn to it. No, it has not. I would warn the opposition leader that, just as that superannuation stuff blew up in his face, some other stuff might also. Radiotherapy Units Mr mCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. St Vincent's Radiation Oncology Unit wishes to establish radiotherapy units for the treatment of cancer, both at Wagga Wagga and at Albury. Presently, however, there is some pressure from other interested parties to put both units in the one city. As Wagga Wagga is the major health centre for people living in the northern and western Riverina and both Wagga Wagga and Albury are in the Greater Murray health region, in order to achieve an equitable distribution of services will the minister give an undertaking to thoroughly investigate this situation before approving the location of those radiotherapy units?",26
66,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of this. Radiotherapy is important. It is an adjunct to cancer treatment. One-third of the population will get cancer at some stage of their lives and half of those will need radiotherapy.,26
67,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a state issue.,26
68,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member opposite says it is a state issue. That is largely true, but not wholly true. I understand the New South Wales government is looking to locate radiotherapy services in regional New South Wales. This is important because currently radiotherapy services do not exist anywhere outside capital cities in Australia. I am informed that there have been three tenders put into the New South Wales government-one from St Vincents, as the honourable member mentioned, and two from private operators, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. Mr Lee-What about Townsville? Remember Townsville.",26
69,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Peanut gallery. What I am told is that, with regard to the Commonwealth's involvement in radiotherapy servicesMr Lee-Townsville is a peanut gallery.",26
70,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you are. The Commonwealth's involvement is that we provide hospital program grants for the infrastructure, and that is because the cost is very substantial. But I have no direct authority or involvement regarding the location. That is something that Andrew Refshauge will do. At a personal level, I would say it would seem incredibly sensible to try to locate the facilities where the people are. But beyond the money I will provide for the infrastructure, I have no influence on where they are actually located. Labour Market Programs",26
71,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall his promise before the election that 'We are going to maintain the expenditure on labour market programs in real terms'? Is the Prime Minister aware that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs-Senator Vanstone, in case he has forgotten",26
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Address the question.,27
73,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Announced on 28 May 1996 that skillshare would be cut by 33 per cent and on 28 June 1996 that other labour market programs would be cut-the landcare environment and action program, jobskills and new work opportunities by 80 per cent, jobtrain and the special intervention program by 50 per cent, and that well-known small business program, the new enterprise incentive scheme, by 33 per cent? Will the Prime Minister now admit that the Howard government has betrayed the Australian people by breaking its election promise to the unemployed to maintain expenditure on labour market programs in real terms?",27
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last person on the other side who has got any moral authority to ask questions about unemployment is the member for Batman. As the leader of the ACTU, you did more with your opposition to freeing the labour market to destroy the job prospects of young Australians than any other person in Australia. The last man or woman on that side of the House who has got any moral authority to lecture me or any member of the Liberal and National parties about youth unemployment is Martin 'Anti-job' Ferguson. Higher Education",27
75,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given that objectives of this government is to redress the lack of equity in higher education access and outcomes that has occurred in the past, what measures is the government taking to ensure that regional Australian students in particular will have a fairer go and better access to higher education from now on?",27
76,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very deep concernMr Crean-They are going to close them down.,27
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham.,27
78,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the educational opportunities for young people in regional Australia. It has been very well known, of course, that, under the higher education policies of the previous government, regional and rural students remained, throughout the entire 13 years, one of the most disadvantaged groups of young Australians. It is the determination of the present government to ensure that educational opportunity is reaffirmed and strengthened for young people in regional Australia. In reviewing the higher education spending programs and in responding to a range of information, including the Hoare review initiated by the previous government, which identified significant management and efficiency issues which had to be addressed in higher education, the government imposed efficiency dividends. But what we are going to do for regional Australia is ensure that regional universities will benefit from the maintenance of the capital development pool for new campuses, which will especially benefit universities in Queensland and Western Australia. Mr Bevis-You are cutting their numbers and closing them down.",27
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane should settle down.,27
80,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are suggestions from the other side that there will be fewer places under the government's higher education policies. The government in no way admits or concedes that there will be fewer places; on one of the stated the contrary,27
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes! You have another look at what you have said.",27
82,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why don't you read it? Why don't you have a look to see what we said? On the contrary, the government fully expects that under the funding arrangements and the new flexibilities that have been introduced the number of student places will rise and overall funding-and this will undoubtedly come as a surprise to you because of your disinformation campaign-available to universities will also increase very substantially. The higher education moneys provided from Commonwealth funding next year for operating grants and research moneys will actually increase by some $51 million.",27
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Compared with what?,28
84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Compared with this year. It should also be noted that the efficiency reductions applied by the government in the higher education statement were reductions against the forward estimates. What this means is that institutions receiving growthmany are in regional Australia-will continue to receive growth under the government's decisions. In 1998 the University of Central Queensland, for example, will be receiving some 9.8 per cent more funding than it is at present. Mr Bevis-Yes, but it is down some 300-",28
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Brisbane!,28
86,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"James Cook University will be receiving some six per cent-5.5 per centmore funding than it is at present. Southern Cross University will be up some three per cent. So we have universities growing in regional Australia, and they will continue to grow and be able to admit more students under the government's decisions. The government is correcting a significant inequity in the previous government's funding arrangements because, throughout the tenure of the previous government, there was a huge unmet demand and there was no incentive given to universities to increase the number of HECS funded places. If a university failed to meet its target quota, it was penalised. If it created additional places through efficiencies, through meeting the demands of niche markets, there was no additional reward. Under the new decisions of this government, universities will be able to create additional HECS funded places over and above the agreed targets. If regional universities have staff, facilities and places which can be occupied, the government will provide additional HECS payments to the universities to enable funding for those places. The government has allowed for funding for those additional places in the budget. One of the major strategic aims of the government's higher education statement was to give the universities the flexibility to plan for the future, which they did not have under the previous government. Amongst the advantages of this flexibility will be the fact that they will not only be able to offer additional HECS places but also, when they have filled their HECS quota, be able to offer additional fee-paying places to Australian students. That government had a concept of equity under which it was fair that Australian students should not have equal rights with overseas students to access Australian universities. This government will provide Australian students with that right. The consequence of that-this is something that the other side should listen to very carefully, and I want them all to hear this-is that, if universities offer just one per cent of their undergraduate load at the medium HECS rate as a fee, they will gain some additional $17 million in income next year. As a consequence of that, if they were to offer places next year at the rate being offered to overseas students at the average rate of about $11,000, Australian universities would gain an additional income of over $40 million next year with one per cent of fee paying students. They are allowed up to 25 per cent of fee-paying students once they have filled their Commonwealth funded quota.",28
87,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They will have finished the marathon by the time you finish your answer.,28
88,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The consequence of this decision,28
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I would encourage the minister to wind up his answer.,28
90,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The consequence of this decision is that Australian universities will be better funded over the coming years than they have been in the past, and the strategic flexibility",28
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And they're against it.,28
92,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And they're against that. They do not want these universities to be better funded and to have more student places and to have regional universities with all the freedom they need to be able to respond to their niche markets with full Commonwealth support. Commonwealth Properties,28
93,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister confirm that 11 Commonwealth properties worth more than $1 billion are to be sold over the next five years as a result of tonight's budget? Do these properties include the Taxation Office in Belconnen and the current residence of the Australian cabinet, the Commonwealth Offices in Phillip Street, Sydney? Will the government be counting these as asset sales or measures to improve the budget bottom line? Can the minister also confirm that 12 DAS commercial businesses will be sold, corporatised or restructured, resulting in a of 3,200 Public Service jobs-learly breaking another coalition election commitment?",29
94,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All will be revealed in the budget tonight at half past seven. Fraser, Mr Justin",29
95,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the arrest of the young Australian pilot, Justin Fraser, in Somalia on 29 May this year. Can the minister inform the House, and indeed his family, of progress in negotiating for his release?",29
96,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question and his concern for the welfare of Justin Fraser. I share his concern about the detention of Justin, an Australian pilot who was detained in Somalia in May. The government is doing all it can to secure the release of Justin Fraser. Discussions are continuing between our High Commission in Nairobi and various authorities-if you could call them that in some cases-in Somalia. These discussions are at a sensitive stage, and I would not want to jeopardise them by going into any details. The Australian government is making a very significant effort. When I was in Cameroon for the Organisation of African Unity summit between 8 and 10 July, I telephoned Justin's mother, Pauline Dickson, who is in Nairobi working for his release, and I discussed with her the direct action being taken by the government. I also wrote to General Aideed on 9 July in support of the appeal for clemency made by Justin's mother. But, as the House would quite rightly be aware, General Aideed was subsequently assassinated.",29
97,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Don't write me any letters!,29
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks might be next in line.,29
99,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will resist the temptation. Despite the assassination of General Aideed, the government is continuing to do all it can through discussions with appropriate people in Somalia. It would be worth my while telling the House that Justin was last seen on 10 July by the representative of an loss international organisation and that he was in good physical and mental health, was being well fed and was being adequately housed. In answer to the member for Groom's question, we are doing all we can. I do not want to say a great deal more about it than I have already because, naturally enough, we do not want to jeopardise negotiations that we are undertaking. The consular response group of my department is fully engaged with the case, and we are keeping Justin's family in close contact.",29
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Answers to Questions on Notice",29
101,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 150 about unanswered questions on the Notice Paper, would you please consider writing to the following ministers: to the Attorney-General about question 30 asked on 1 May; to the Treasurer about questions 191 and 193 asked on 20 May; to the Treasurer about question 392 asked on 17 June; to the Treasurer about question 406 asked on 18 June; to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism about question 212 asked on 21 May and about questions 262 to 266 inclusive asked on 23 May; and to the Minister for Health and Family Services about question 393 asked on 17 June?",29
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the member for Curtin. I will correspond with the appropriate ministers and encourage them to provide very prompt responses to your questions. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs,30
103,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, on 2 May I placed a question to the Attorney-General on the Notice Paper concerning the purported general directions issued by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 10 April 1996, because of concerns that I had with the legality of those directions. On 28 June 1996, when amended directions were tabled in this House to give an extension so that indigenous people were not lacking in funding, I made a speech, which said in part: I have grave reservations as to whether these are genuine general directions within the definition of section 12 of the ATSIC Act. There is a real problem. The Attorney-General should answer that question as quickly as possible. I think it is bent on him to do it ASAP. At that time",30
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,We will not enter into any debate.,30
105,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I appreciate that. It is now 111 days since 2 May. I would think, especially in view of the fact that these directions have now been challenged in the Federal Court, that parliament is entitled to a quick answer.",30
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Your point is well made. I will correspond with the Attorney on your behalf. Parliament House: Demonstration,30
107,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question to you relates to the disgraceful behaviour of certain people yesterday in the attack on the Parliament House building and property and the injury to many people. In the television depiction of part of that I noticed, as many members would have, that someone involved in that mayhem also caused to be erected on the top or near the top of Parliament House another flag. I am not certain whether that other flag replaced the Australian flag which also flies up there and whether those involved in fact took the Australian flag down. Mr Speaker, in the course of making inquiries about the disgraceful incident, would you ascertain whether the Australian flag was also taken down, whether the flag was recovered, what sort of flag was put up--I understand the flag depicted the Young Labor movement of Australia-and also who can be made responsible for the incident to ensure that the protection of the building, its traditions and the Australian flag are enhanced for the future?",30
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The question of a flag being removed does not arise, because I was near the roof at the time and there were two flags run to the masthead. As you rightly said, one was associated with the Young Labor movement-'Thrusting into the 90s' or something along those lines. There was another flag which, I recall, represented the ANL. I think we have recovered both of incumthem. In so far as the Australian flag was used adversely or desecrated in any way, that question does not arise. Parliament House: Demonstration",30
109,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I refer to your statement of today' s proceedings into criminal prosecutions consequent to yesterday's disturbance. I ask, firstly, what charges are to be laid and do they include assault and battery, breaking and entering and theft of Commonwealth and private property, particularly from the Parliament House shop? Secondly, will restitution be sought from the organisers-the ACTU or the ACT Trades and Labour Council? Thirdly, will assistance be given to police and others injured in the disgusting incident yesterday to enable civil actions for damages to be pursued against the unions and the persons involved?",30
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. As you would imagine from the comments I made to the House earlier, a number of quite independent inquiries are proceeding quickly. We will seek very urgent resolution of those. I am not in a position to comment very much on the charges that have been laid but, as I understand it, the number is nine. The investigations continue and that number may increase. I will make a further report to the House as I see fit over the coming days. Answers to Questions on Notice",30
111,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 150, could I request that you write to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs seeking reasons for the delay in answering questions 60 and 61, first placed on the Notice Paper on 1 May? Also, could you write to the Attorney-General seeking an answer to question No. 67, first placed on the Notice Paper on 1 May?",31
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Scullin. I will write on your behalf to the appropriate ministers and seek an early response to your questions. NA Osborne, Hon. Frederick Meares, CMG, DSC and Bar, VRD",31
113,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Tuesday, 23 July 1996, of the Honourable Frederick (Fred) Meares Osborne, CMG, DSC and Bar, VRD, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Evans, New South Wales, from 1949 to 1961; Minister for Customs and Excise in 1956; Minister for Air from 1956 to 1960; and Minister for Repatriation from 1960 to 1961; places on record its appreciation of and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Fred Osborne was elected to the federal parliament in 1949. He served as a minister for 12 years in the Menzies government and lost his seat in the very significant swing against the Menzies government in the election of 1961. After leaving parliament, Fred Osborne resumed his career as a lawyer in Sydney. He became a partner in the firm, first of all, of Ebsworth and Ebsworth; in fact he had remained a dormant partner in that firm dur;.,g the time he was in federal parliament. He subsequently joined the firm of Dudley, Westgarth and Co. He went on to build a very impressive commercial career. He became a director and/or chairman of a large number of public companies and, in every way after his parliamentary career, became a very reputable and respected member of the business community in Sydney and, in a broader sense, throughout Australia. He also continued his commitment to the Liberal Party of Australia after losing his seat. It was in the context of Fred Osborne's involvement in the Liberal Party organisation in New South Wales that I got to know him very well. Until the early 1960s Fred Osborne was just a name to me, but when I joined the New South Wales executive of the Liberal Party in 1963 he was the Treasurer of the New South Wales division. He went on in 1967 to succeed Jock Pagan as the President of the New South Wales Liberal Party, a position he held until 1970. Fred Osborne's best known contribution to politics was the time that he served in the federal parliament and served as a minister between 1949 and 1961. However, a little known but nonetheless very significant contribution that Fred Osborne played in reshaping the non-Labor parties, and in particular the attitude of the Liberal Party, to an important social and political issue of the 1960s was the role he played in the internal debate within the Liberal Party on the very sensitive issue of state aid for independent schools. As honourable members will know, in the his long early 1960s the Labor Party was almost overwhelmingly opposed to state aid for private schools, particularly the dominant forces in the Labor Party at that time, despite the attempts of Gough Whitlam on various occasions to do something about it. It really was not until the 1972 election that the Labor Party finally embraced aid to independent schools. The Menzies government, as you will recall, in 1963 offered direct government assistance to the construction of science blocks in schools irrespective of whether they were government or independent schools. In the 1965 state election, the pro state aid policy of Robert Askin played a significant part in the defeat of the Labor government that had been in charge of affairs in New South Wales from 1941 when Sir William MCKell was elected Premier under the defeat of the Renshaw government in 1965. Fred Osborne, from my own personal knowledge, played a decisive role in bringing about a change of attitude within the Liberal Party towards that aid and, in the process, brought about over time a very significant change in the composition of the Liberal Party. It was in those days an overwhelmingly protestant party, and because of the way in which the debate changed in the 1960s the character and composition and the breadth and the diversity of the Liberal Party changed very significantly. Fred Osborne played an enduring role in that internal debate. He made a very courageous contribution at a time when something we now take for granted and regard almost as a relic of our immediate postwar history sparked a very significant difference of view. It did in the Labor Party and it certainly did in the Liberal Party. It is to the credit of people like Fred Osborne and John Carrick from New South Wales in particular that the Liberal Party managed to embrace the change and to solve the problem a little earlier than our political opponents. I have no doubt that, if you review the politics of the 1960s, the earlier and astute embrace of those changes by Menzies and others in the early 1960s was a very important political event which played a very important role in shaping what happened. Fred Osborne was a courteous man. He served the Crown, his country and the cause of liberty with great courage and distinction in World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1940 for 'bravery and devotion to duty' while assisting the evacuation of British and French forces from the coast of Norway. In 1945, while in command of the destroyer HMS Vanquisher, he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Cross for the sinking of a German Uboat in the Atlantic. He was respected and liked by all in the business community who knew him. He contributed much to charitable causes in the Sydney area. The political tradition of his family has been carried on. His son Michael is a very active member of the executive of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He chaired a committee that led to a major change in the preselection system in New South Wales. I look around me and I see a number of my colleagues from New South Wales who remember those changes with enormous gratitude. I am sure they played no mean part in the election to parliament of Joseph Benedict Hockey, John Joseph Fahey, Anthony Abbott, Joanna Gash, Gary Nairn, and so the list goes on. His daughter Imogen has been a president and very active member of a branch at Longueville, which has been part of my electorate for most of the time that I have been in this place. So the family tradition is carried on. I want, on behalf of his many friends, to record my appreciation and theirs for Fred's contribution to Australian politics and for the fine example of family life and ethical business practices which was his exemplar and to record our sadness at his loss but our thanks for a very long and distinguished life of service to his country in both war and peace.",31
114,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). As the Prime Minister has said, the Hon. Fred Osborne MP had a distinguished parliamentary career representing the New South Wales seat of Evans from 1949 until he lost the seat in the 1961 election-an election in which, I recall, the distinguished former member Sir James Killen benefited from the preferences of the Communist Party, much to the relief of the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies. Mr Osborne held a number of portfolios as a minister in the Menzies government, including Customs and Excise, Air and Navy. Clearly he was well suited to positions in portfolios related to the defence portfolio, given his distinguished service with the Royal Australian Navy and as an officer seconded to the Royal Navy during the Second World War. In fact, he served on three royal naval vessels-HMS Gentian, HMS Peacock and HMS Vanquisher. I note that he said that, under air and Uboat attack, he escorted convoys in the battle of the Atlantic and that he crossed the Atlantic on some 22 occasions without ever landing in either Canada or the United States. That he survived convoy roles in that battle was an amazing feat, given the horrendous losses of shipping to U-boat attack in particular. He was awarded, as the Prime Minister said, two Distinguished Service Crosses. I note from his first speech in parliament on 28 February 1950 that he had very strong views on the need to ensure the well-being of migrants, of whom he said: Humanity compels us to have the greatest regard for their feelings. Undoubtedly, he was, as the Prime Minister describes, a sensitive and honourable man-a man with a very distinguished war record and, subsequently, a distinguished parliamentary career. On behalf of the opposition, I extend to his wife and his family my sincere condolences.",32
115,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in speaking on this condolence motion for the late Frederick Osborne. I add that it is now moving on to a stage where there are fewer and fewer condolences relating to people who served in World War II, as those who were in parliament after World War II have now, in many cases, long since gone.",33
116,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,There are still two here.,33
117,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"There are still two remaining, and I hope they stay a while yet. I add, however, that what prompted me to make that comment was the reference by the Leader of the Opposition to convoy duties. Some of us have been lucky enough to read about the fear and the enormous and horrific conditions that those people who operated those convoys, in whatever position as part of a ship's crew, endured. Those people demonstrated what I think must have been one of the most extraordinary acts of bravery out of all those that took place in World War II. One other person who comes to mind in that regard, whom I travelled to Vietnam with  many of you. He was, for a period, a commercial seaman on convoys to Murmansk and Newfoundland during World War II. I salute Frederick Osborne in respect of his war service. Of course, he went on to be Minister for Customs and Excise, Minister for Air and Minister for Repatriation in that period when there were separate portfolios for the navy, army and air force. I extend to his wife, Elizabeth, and members of the family sympathy on behalf of the National Party. They can be rightly proud of the service that he gave to the parliament and the nation.",33
118,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, I would like to join in this condolence motion and express my deep regret at the death of Fred Osborne. Fred Osborne was a very distinguished Australian. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have pointed out, he served with great valour during the Second World War with the British navy, the Royal Navy. On returning from the war, he became a member of the House of Representatives and served as a minister in the Menzies government from 1949 until 1961. After he left politics, he made a new career for himself both as a lawyer and, in particular, in the business community-a career of very great success. Fred Osborne was very well known to me because he was a close personal friend of my parents. He always showed great concern both for my family in general and for me in particular during the time. I lived in Sydney, especially in the mid-1970s. He was a man of great courtesy, a man of great personal charm and a man with what I think could be described as very steady and sound judgment. It was with great sorrow that I heard of Fred Osborne's death recently. My mother was able to attend his funeral. The loss of Fred Osborne is the loss of a really distinguished Australian, and I wish to extend my condolences to his widow, Elizabeth, and to their children.",33
119,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (3.44 p.m.)-I wish to add a few words to the condolence motion for Fred Osborne, who lived in my constituency. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has already mentioned something of Mr Osborne's war service. I add a story that he told his son, Alick. The Hon. Fred Osborne said: You will. find, if you spend a whole day at sea with your engmes out and the enemy aircraft keeping up the bombing from sunrise to sunset, that by the end of the day e-ery single man on the ship will have developed his own form of religion. Fred Osborne was not just a remarkable man himself but he came from a remarkable family. His brother Alec became the head of the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney. His brother Ronald founded the legal firm Dibbs, Crowther and Osborne. His brother Harry founded the stockbroking firm Flecknoe and Osborne. His sister, Nancy, was the first person to win the Sydney University Medal for English and later became a senior officer in the Women's Royal Naval Service. His brother John became a doctor who practised in London. Fred, of course, we are commemorating today. As the PriI?e - inis.ter has noted, the spirit of servlc- still h-es l.n the Osborne family, most particularly In hIS son Michael, who is the metropolitan vice-president of the New South Wales Liberal Party. In his memoirs, Fred Osborne closed the account by saying: I was 82 years old yesterday. At that time an old man, if he has any sense, looks back and counts his blessings. I've had a happy and a fortunate life wit- .very m-ch love and affection, and the opportumtIes to gIve love and affection. I've also been given: and general!- have grasped, opportunities to exerCIse my capacltIes, such as they are, to the full. And this is one of the constituents of a good life. I have lost a very great constituent. The people of Warringah have lost a great citizen. His .life should be an exemplar of public serVIce for many years to come to his descendants and to the rest of the community. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ",33
120,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Thursday, 8 August 1996, of Philip (Phil) Ernest Lucock CBE, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Lyne from 1952 to 1980; temporary Chainnan of Committees from 1956 to 1961; Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1973 to 1975; Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 1961 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Phil L-cock, a former member for Lyne, was born In Eltham, Kent, in England on 16 January 1916. He studied theology but interrupted his studies to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. After his discharge from the RAAF he resumed his stu.dies and became a minister of the Presbytenan Church. He entered federal politics in 1952 when he won the New South Wales seat of .Lyne. In his maiden speech to parliament PhIl sp,?ke of the economic difficulties facing Austraha at that time-in particular, the need to contain inflation. It is funny how some things do not change a lot. He also reflected on the pressures borne by the government of the day. Phil's long parliamentary career saw him embrace many issues of public concern. In the days before his retirement in 1980, he commented on a wide range of issues, including the Western economic system, the level of state borrowings, the role of the backbencher and the role of the media. I certainly got to know Phil well when I entered parliament in 1974. He was welcoming and friendly to new members. He was instructive to them about the practices of the House. He was one of those people from whom you could always get advice. He would give you a nice, long, interesting story as he gave you the advice, but it was nonetheless very enjoyable. He had a very resonant voice and. he sometimes gave long rulings from the chair, but they were always inordinately courteous and they were usually impeccable so far as their technical accuracy was concerned. He was a very active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He was regarded with affection and respect by so many people. I think the last time. I saw Phil Lucock was at the Sydney Town Hall towards the end of 1994 when he attended an oration delivered by Malcolm Fraser to mark the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Liberal Party in 1944. It was obvious then that he had begun to enjoy rather indifferent health, but it was a great delight to see him. I know that he will be missed very greatly by people who served in the parliament with him. He was, of course, all of his life, a passionate member of the old Country Party, then the National Country Party, now the National Party. I know that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and some other National Party colleagues can speak more directly than I can, but on behalf of the government parties I extend to Phil's family, and most particularly to his children, Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison, our very deep sympathy in the loss of a very fine father and a well loved former member of this House.",34
121,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to pay tribute to Philip Lucock, a former distinguished member of the House of Representatives. He is a person who lives in my own memory. I remember coming into the place as only a very small boy and watching him in the chair. Of course, as he was frequently in the chair you could not miss him, even if you were of relatively junior status in the place. He was obvious and stood out. He represented the electorate of Lyne for the National Party from 1952 to 1980, a period of some 28 years. He was a Presbyterian minister who practised his religious ministry throughout his parliamentary career. Gough Whitlam sent me this note, which I thought I might read in full, related to him. It says: When the parliament meets tomorrow you may be expected to pay a tribute to Phil Lucock, who retired from the House before the elections at which you were elected to it. Remembering the difficulty of saying something fresh on such occasions, I thought you might find it interesting that he was the first person to be elected to the House after the death of George VI and therefore the first MHR to swear allegiance to our present (but last?) monarch. The Queen ascended the throne on 6 February 1952 and Lucock was elected at a by-election on 22 March 1952. Joe Cook, WA, had already been appointed to the Senate on 7 February and sworn in on 26 February. In a subsequent conversation with GoughI thought that having sent me that missive I ought to pry further-he pointed out that Phil Lucock was the first member of parliament to swear allegiance to a Queen since the initial members of parliament. There were then subsequently two Georges and two Edwards. It is something of note, anyway, in the course of these remarks. Gough also had another thing to say about Phil which was very interesting too. He said that his view of him when he was in the chair was that he was by far and a long way the most effective chairman in the processes, and the opposition tended to take his rulings on matters as rulings which had some authority. They were not infrequently at variance with the Speakers of the day. This is not a situation that applies now or that we anticipate applying now. But that was, as far as the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was concerned, the situation that applied when he was in opposition for a substantial period of time. I note that Phil Lucock said that he had no regrets about being in parliament. In fact, he said that the parliament gave him an opportunity to serve many more people than he ever could have served in a parish. Along with my father, Mr Lucock had an abiding concern for the unemployed and believed that workers and management should seek to resolve their problems responsibly through cooperation. I note, too, that Mr Lucock was involved in an interesting ballot for the deputy speakership in 1978. Seventeen government members voted for the then opposition in support of his candidacy. Unfortunately for him, he was unsuccessful. In fact another former distinguished member Clarrie Millar won the ballot by 62 votes to 52. He crossed the floor to vote with the opposition on one occasion, during the vote on the Primary Industry Bank Amendment Bill. That is something no members do very lightly. Apropos what the Prime Minister said a moment or two ago, he saw service in the RAAF as an air craftsman during World War II. We are dealing here with a person who had the characteristic that a number of members have shared over the years, that of a man who was an excellent parliamentarian in all true senses of the word-a person who understood the parliamentary process, ruled on it effectively and gained the respect of all members of the House for his capacity to understand the processes that he was engaged in. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our sympathy to the Lucock family.",35
122,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"Philip Ernest Lucock served in the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament for no less than 28 years and some-from 23 March 1952, the by-election mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), through to the lead-up to the 1980 election on 19 September when you had the situation where members who are not recontesting ended their term in the parliament. A period of 28 years of service to parliament, to state and to the nation deserves our commendation. Phil Lucock was born in 1916 in Kent in the United Kingdom. He was a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia and overseas, most notably in Rhodesia training as part of the Empire Training School, but indifferent health and medical circumstance from the rigours of being in an aircrew were such that he was discharged later on in World War II. He joins that unusual grouping of members of this parliament who were ministers of religion over the years, including people like Gil Duthie from Tasmania for the Labor Party, who was a minister of religion of the Methodist Church. Phil Lucock was a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He was never short in coming forward in that regard and gave a very good sermon, I understand-as did people like Evan Adermann-a former member for Fairfax a few years back, who is still living, and is very well, in southern Queensland. In his maiden speech Phil Lucock did one other thing of particular note. He decided to quote in the context of what was a very robust maiden speech, given the convention relating to maiden speeches from Sir Arthur Fadden, the then Treasurer of Australia, who said: The problem is still with us in a fonnidable degree. The government believes its policy is fundamentally the right one and is determined to follow through with it. We take for ourselves and offer to the community the encouragement of gains that have been made, but with that must go a realisation that a difficult road still lies ahead. Amen to that in the context of all that awaits on this very important day but also amen to the contribution and work of Phil Lucock, who I, as the then state member for Sturt and state member for Murray in the New South Wales parliament throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, had the privilege of knowing. I always found Phil genial, in a sense a genial giant, and committed to his family, to the community, to the state and to the nation. He also had one other particular capacity, which I must say that I borrowed off him over the years-his ability to remember names of people whom he was meeting in a delegation or at a council meeting and so forth. He could go right around the room, having met them all, and nominate their first names in a very accurate way. It is an art form. It is one which Phil Lucock injected a lot of energy into as a matter of the regard and respect he had for fellow human beings. I extend deep sympathy to Robert, Ian, Patricia, Alison and all members of the Lucock family. It was a great privilege to know Phil Lucock. He set a high benchmark in personal standards and character and a high benchmark in terms of the parliamentary service he gave to the electorate of Lyne, in that area of the north coast of New South Wales, and to this great parliament of AustralIa.",36
123,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I wish to add a few remarks to this condolence motion. In so doing, I want also to pay my respects and condolences to the family of the late Fred Osborne. Both Fred and Phil Lucock represented a generation who post World War II developed this country in a way that is too often forgotten. Fred served with very considerable distinction in the Royal Australian Navy and Phil, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has identified, as a member of the Empire flying training scheme trained in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Phil was a very significant parliamentarian. He saw the problem in the development of our society in trying to maintain a balance between the executive and the legislature. On quite a number of occasions he raised concerns about what he saw as the problems as the nature of government expanded and the responsibilities of those who are ministers gradually meant their divorce from the day-today concerns that affect the average member of the legislature. I think he waged a very effective campaign to ensure the recognition by those who are ministers of their membership continually of the House and their responsibilities to this place as well as to the government. Phil Lucock was a very good Deputy Speaker for the duration of his service and there has already been sufficient said about the way in which he performed. In relation to his role as Deputy Speaker there is only one thing I would add to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he referred to the fact that so often it was his rulings that were preferred to those of the Speaker. There was one particular occasion, I recall, when he was apparently finally pestered to the point of feeling that the then honourable member for Bass, Gil Duthie, should be expelled from the services of the House, he named him. On that occasion Arthur Calwell, who was then Leader of the Opposition and, of course, a papal knight, rose to defend Gil Duthie. It seemed rather paradoxical that there should be a papal knight-a distinguished member of the Catholic church-rising to support a Methodist against a Presbyterian. I might add that, in those circumstances, his advocacy actually prevailed. It shows you that there can be unanimity in the ecumenical way in this place--even dispensed from the chair. Phil Lucock was a notable contributor to the parliament and he was a very good member for Lyne. I have a very fond regard for his memory, in part because when I first stood as a candidate I really knew no other members in this place other than casually. I had certainly not met the then leader of my party, Mr John MCEwen, nor of course had I met Mr Robert Menzies. Phil, as the only person I really knew in the area, came to support me when I stood. I remember that we addressed a meeting in the streets of Walcha, which is a small country town in my area. Phil and I stood on the street comer trying hard to win support for my cause and the local bikies had been primed by my opposition to ride up and down just where we were standing. Phil, Presbyterian minister though he was, suggested we adjourn to the local hotel. As soon as we did so and had bought a drink for the bikies we were able to conduct our meeting in peace. Mr Cobb interjecting",36
124,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,I might add that-as my colleague says-I actually won the election in Walcha too. Mr Barry Jones-But that's a breach of the law.,37
125,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I do not know that the drink with the bikies necessarily was-this was in the days of yesteryear. Having said that, I would also say that he, like many others of those who served in World War II, came to this place with a different background from today's generation. I think we do well to remember the contribution that men like the late Fred Osborne made to the formation and structure of the Liberal Party, as did Phil Lucock to the nature and structure of the Country Party-today, of course, in latter-day terminology the National Party. They were both wonderful men. To the family of the late Fred Osborne and particularly to Robert, Ian, Patricia, Alison and their families I would like to extend my own deep personal sympathy and that of my wife as well.",37
126,Mr VAILE,CONDOLENCES,"As the current member for Lyne I feel a duty to participate in this condolence motion and I certainly express my condolences and those of my family to the family of the late Phil Lucock. Phil and I both came from the same small country town of Wingham. As I grew up and conducted a business there Phil Lucock had a profound impact on the way I conducted that business, the way I entered politics and, I suppose, by and large, the side of politics and the section of the conservative side of politics I entered. Phil used to thoroughly enjoy political discussion at a very local level. Whether or not it was in a business or on the street, you could hear Phil discussing the politics of the day from one end of the main street of Wingham to the other. It was interesting to note analogy that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had passed on to him by former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam about Phil Lucock being sworn in: the first member of this place to have sworn allegiance to the Queen. Phil is well remembered around the township of Wingham for the fact that, when he was in the electorate and driving around the town or other towns, he would wave to everybody. He would not miss a soul. It would not matter who it was-as he drove past he always had this royal wave. Phil Lucock was well known for that. He used to conduct a radio program on Sunday nights on 2RE: not just talking about religious matters, but talking about matters that were of great importance in the federal parliament of the day. This was back in the days when television was not quite as prevalent and when people listened to the radio a lot on Sunday nights. Phil Lucock was a civic father in the Manning region. For one who was born in England, educated in New Zealand and a representative of the Australian parliament, I think he carried that off extremely well. I certainly am honoured to follow in his footsteps as the representative for the seat of Lyne, although when he was first elected in 1952 the seat of Lyne I think went almost from the Hunter River up to the Hastings River. I only have an electorate about a third of the size of that. The member for Paterson probably has the other two-thirds in his electorate. Phil Lucock used to travel far and wide throughout that electorate. He used to thoroughly enjoy those old-fashioned street meetings and it would not matter if there was nobody there. In my early days in this party, as a party organisational person, at election time. I would be called upon to introduce the federal member speaking on the street comer. Phil would manage to get through probably a 30or 45-minute speech on all sorts of very important federal issues of the day. As I say, Phil is well remembered in our area. His funeral was held in Brisbane but there was a large and well attended memorial service last Friday in his home town of the Wingham. 1 delivered the eulogy in the Presbyterian church where Phil used to minister. My opening comment was that Phil's 28 years of service to the people of Australia in the House of Representatives were but a small part of the broader service that he gave to Australia in the Air Force, as a Presbyterian minister and as a very dedicated member of Rotary. Right up until his last days he was a dedicated member of Rotary, serving his community and serving his country. I think that it is very important that we do honour all that Phil Lucock achieved. He always used to highlight his background. He loved to tell people, 'I was born in England, educated in New Zealand and you have got me representing you in the federal parliament of Australia.' I, along with previous speakers, pass on my family's condolences to Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison.",37
127,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,Before I introduce the honourable member for Cowper I would like to acknowledge the fact that he represented me at the funeral. 1 thank him very much for that.,38
128,Mr NEHL,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, thank you very much. I would like to acknowledge the courtesy of the member  speak first, because I have a meeting to chair fairly soon. For the record, 1 also have to, unfortunately, correct the statement you just made, Mr Speaker. I intended and wanted to represent you at the funeral of Phil Lucock but, regrettably, my aircraft was two hours late and 1 was not able to get there. We were well represented by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I, like other speakers, offer my condolences to Phil's family: Robert, Ian, Patricia, Alison and their children, and other family members. Phil was one of those wonderful, warm human beings. I did not serve in the parliament with him, but I got to know him very well over those years. I certainly will not take the time of the House to speak at great length, but he was a warm human being. He was very witty; capricious. He had a wry smile and a glint. I well remember one occasion after he had retired from the parliament and he went back into the church. I do not think anybody else has mentioned that he then became Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. He did that job particularly well indeed. I can recall one instance in Bowraville, which is a verandahpost town in the Nambucca Valley in my electorate. We had a special day for the historical museum, and they had moved a small church from somewhere out in the valley. Phil was conducting the service. My wife and I were there, and at one stage in the sermon Phil broke off to say, 'And, Gary Nehl, you can't interject!' I am very much aware of the wonderful job that he did as the Deputy Speaker of this House. But, Mr Speaker, I hasten to assure you that I do not aspire to emulate what has been referred to today; in other words, that his rulings were regarded as being better than the Speaker's at that time. I certainly do aspire to emulate his skill and the way he conducted himself in the Speaker's chair. I would like to conclude, though, by saying that my friend and colleague the present member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) alluded to Phil's capacity for waving to everybody as he went around the electorate. As you all know and have probably all practised, as you are driving around you have your hands on the steering wheel and you raise a little finger here and a little finger there to greet people. Phil had reputation of having waved to every cow and every tree in the electorate. That was merely a description of how well he served that electorate of Lyne. He was assiduous in doing that. He is a loss to Australia. He was a great Australian.  p.m.)-Waving to cows and trees probably had relevance at the time, because there was a time when even sheep used to vote in some of those electorates. They were also counted. I join in this motion of condolence to the late Phil Lucock. When I came here as a new member I was thrown in at the deep end. There were no briefings and those kinds of extravagances for new members, but I always found him a very courteous man, a man who was of great assistance to me. I respected him for that, and I very much appreciated the support and advice that I gained from him. He came from the school of the old Country Party. When I think of him-and I listened to some of the earlier comments-I think also of his successor, Bruce Cowan. They represented the Country Party. They were really the role models of the Country Party in that they had a very close relationship with people in country Australia. They were the characters who preceded the arrival of the economic rationalists in the Country Party, which was to become the National Party. I met with him on a number of occasions. Whilst our electorates were not immediately adjacent, there were often occasions when we came together at functions and various places. He and Bruce Cowan had this remarkable capacity-and I am sure the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is similarly skilled-for making a very impressive dissertation on almost any subject you could wish. But afterwards you had to think: what was it they had told me?",38
129,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"Oh thanks, Peter!  be true. I have admired it and I have tried to do it, but I am not in their class. But there was a closeness and a warmth about them, as Australians and as individuals, that I appreciated very much. I would like to pass on to his the family the sympathy and condolences of my family and to join in this expression from the parliament to him. Mr Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.",39
130,Mr TONY SMITH,CONDOLENCES,"I just wanted to join in this condolence motion as well. I met the honourable Phillip Lucock last year on a couple of occasions during the election campaign. He was at that time, and remained until his death, living in the Keperra Sanctuary Retirement Village in my electorate. I had heard him speak, of course. I was an avid listener to radio broadcasts of the parliament right throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Whenever I heard him-and I know he did retire in the early 1980s-he was always a fair person. That point has been made. When he was in the chair, he was always a fair and honourable person in his rulings. He was always highly respected, I gather, from both sides of the House. On one of the occasions that I met him, I was with Sir James Killen. He was, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, in quite failing health, even at that time. He was delighted to see Sir James Killen again and spoke with him for a while. I had a few quick words to him on both occasions. He said to me-and I thought it was quite indicative of what is apparent about the late Phil Lucock'Respect your opponent.' I thought that was very appropriate. As was said at his funeral, he loved his fellow man and he loved his God. That was made absolutely clear by someone at the funeral. I wish to express my deepest sympathy to his family at this sad time. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. AUDITOR·GENERAL'S REPORTS",39

134,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's betrayal of the aspirations of young Australians for fair access and participation in higher education. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",40
135,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On budget day 1996 Australia is a long way indeed from being relaxed and comfortable. Australia feels distinctly uncomfortable and distinctly insecure. Australians feel misled and betrayed by this Howard-Fischer government. One thing stands alone as to why they have that particular feeling-that is, Australia has a Prime Minister who could not lie straight in bed. Australia has a Prime Minister who conned his way into power. He conned the Australian people into believing that the most conservative politician in Australia's historyhis own words-had become a born-again sensitive new age guy. He had become the sort of political leader where butter would not melt in his mouth. He had become the sort of political leader who helped little old ladies across the road. Throughout the betrayal, throughout the insecurity and throughout the misleading of the Australian people, one broken promise among the scores of broken promises stands out. Among all the people who are feeling betrayed on this budget day 1996, one group stands out. I am talking about higher education in Australia and the students, the parents and the citizens who have as their great Australian dream fair and equal access to a university education. For all the broken promises and for all the betrayal, that is so significant on this budget day 1996. For all those Australians who believed that this government would keep its promises, you have let them down. For all those Australians who believed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he put his hand on his heart throughout the election campaign and said that he was a man of his word, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians who believed the Prime Minister when he said that he would not touch Medicare, and they voted for him on that basis, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians who believed the Treasurer (Mr Costello) when he said that he would not raise taxes, and they voted on that basis, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians who believed that a single public servant would not be sacked, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians in the work force who believed the promise that no worker would be worse off, they have been betrayed by this Howard government. For all those people in the childcare sector who believed the promises about family day care and the promises about benefits, they have been betrayed on this budget day 1996. For all those people in the community who believed that state grants would not be reduced, that ABC funding would not be touched, that labour market and employment programs would not be touched, that immigration would not be reduced, that the research and development tax concessions would remain, that the export market development grants scheme would be boosted instead of abolished, for all those people in regional Australia who believed that regional development programs would not be touched and for all those people in the social services sector who believed that the welfare budget would not be cut, all those Australians have been shamefully betrayed by this Howard government. There is one thing that hurts above all that-one broken promise that cuts to the heart of working families in Australia. That is the promise that the Prime Minister made before the election that he would not touch higher education. This is the same John Howard who will talk day and night about families. The truth is that he really does not understand working families and their aspirations. There is one thing that matters to them above all else. That is the idea that their kids can have fair and equal access to a university education. The truth is that, when the Prime Minister talks about families and one Australia, he is really talking about one Wollstonecraft or one Kirribilli and the traditional white picket fence family which has the money in their household income to access higher education. That is his vision of families in Australiaone Wollstonecraft; one Kirribilli. The reality across Australia is very, very different indeed, because above all else those Australian families believe in fair and equal access for their children to a university education. It is interesting that all this rhetoric about families all comes down to the fact that the Liberal Party only believes in two types of familiesthe traditional family and the royal family. Even these days among the royals if you are a divorcee, you are apparently off the Prime Minister's dance card. These family values are becoming narrower and narrower all the time and for working families in Australia-that is, the lower to middle income families-this higher education budget is an atrocity. It is a betrayal of trust and a betrayal of the confidence that they gave this government on 2 March. It is an absolute disgrace which deserves the condemnation of this House as it has been condemned across the university sector in Australia and throughout the Australian community. Those people in the community had the great Australian dream of fair and equal access to university education for their children. It is the great equaliser in our society, that people from a working-class background can get a university education. Those dreams and beliefs have been dashed on budget day-the budget of betrayal in 1996. We on the Labor side of the House know these things because we have been to graduation ceremonies in working-class electorates. We have seen the tears in the eyes of the parents who watch their children-the first in their family; the first generation-take out a university degree. They did not have to buy it because they were rich; they did not have to purchase that degree because they were wealthy. That degree-the first in their family-was delivered by the policies of Labor governments. I know these things because I am one of the beneficiaries. If Gough Whitlam had not abolished tertiary fees in 1973 I would not have gone to university at the end of 1978. I see it again in my elector- is. ate. In the 1970s in western Sydney you had to travel to Sydney university because the Fraser government would not build a university in our working class region. Now, as a product of the reforms and higher education policy of Labor governments from 1983 to 1996, most of the students participating in tertiary education in my electorate go to the University of Western Sydney. The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) might respond in debate by saying, 'Wasn't it the Labor party that introduced the HECS?' That is true, but we did it for a very sound reason, and that was that every single cent raised out of the HECS would go back into the university sector. They were the dollars that built the University of Western Sydney and gave working-class kids their chance to get a university education. That was the funding mechanism that almost doubled the number of university places in Australia, from 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 in 1996. This is the government and the minister that will take out a large slab of that funding expansion. Earlier today he was here in question time saying, These universities should be quite thankful that they will have a dollar term increase in their budget. All we have done is take away their growth funding.' Of course, on the forward estimates every single cent that was going to universities in Queensland, Western Australia and western Sydney was growth funding to keep up with the population growth and the per capita arrangements that the Labor Party set in place. The member for Goldstein is saying, 'You can have a small dollar increase in your university funding, but we will slash away the growth funding and the per capita funding.' It is like saying to those universities and working-class kids and families, 'You should be thankful that I stole your car but I did not steal your TV.' It is like the member for Goldstein saying, 'You should be thankful we are sucking the blood dry out of the university sector, but we are not driving a stake through your heart.' The truth is that the government cannot have it both ways. It must understand that it is damaging the growth and expansion of the university sector in AustralThis is a government that is raising extra revenue out of fees and a separate system of university funding based not on merit but on wealth. If you have the wealth and the disposable family income to buy a university place, you can have it based on wealth alone. In all those contests for university spots below the HSC cut-off point, if you have the money in your pocket, if you are from Kirribilli or Wollstonecraft or if you have a wealthy family background, you can buy a university place. They are also placing an active disincentive on working-class kids to make the choice for their university future by lowering the HECS threshold from $28,000 to $20,000. That is a difficult choice for those students because they have the problem of forgoing income by undertaking a university education. When you tip the balance, you tip the balance against their active decision and opportunity to undertake a university education. Of course, the irony of this is that every single cent that this government is raising on the revenue side in higher education is being taken away from the universities. The government is taking the money out of the higher education sector to put it into its flawed budget strategy. It has both hands around the throats of Australian universities and working class students. It has one hand collecting more HECS and collecting it earlier and another hand taking away the grants from those universities. It is very interesting indeed to note the response of the minister, Senator Vanstone. She described these particular cuts, the $623 million over four years, as 'just a nick'. Mr Sawford-Just a nick!",40
136,Mr LA THAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, 'just a nick'. The truth is that what she was effectively saying to working class families was 'nick off'. That is what she was really saying to working class families, because this government is in the business of establishing a higher education sector not on the basis of merit, need, regional location or equity, but on the basis of wealth and privilege. She is saying 'nick' all right; 'nick off' to working class kids and their families. She is placing an active disincentive in the way of those students who are worried about the possibility of paying HECS back on a threshold of $20,000 per annum. She is also in the business of demanding higher repayments to be a professional-that is, the best jobs in society go to those who can afford in advance that particular HECS payment. As many academics and university administrators have acknowledged, that is creating a two-tier education system in Australia; one for the rich and one for the poor. Not only that, but in the budget tonight we will see it in health; one health system for the rich and one for the poor. These are the standards of this government with its budget of betrayal. Overall, the greatest betrayal is in higher education. There are many families in the suburbs and regional towns of Australia who are feeling worried about this budget. They are feeling worried about the cutbacks and the loss of the active role of government. I was at a gathering in my electorate recently with a group who had come together to protest about cuts to the family day care arrangements. There was one lady who stood up who I thought typified the impact of the Howard government on what the Prime Minister calls the mainstream. She was a genuine battler. She introduced herself to this protest meeting by saying, 'I am not all that much of a public speaker and I am quite nervous about it.' She did not have to be a public speaker because she spoke from the heart.  and voted Liberal, and will do so again.",43
137,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She was a battler. Maybe she had supported John Howard at the last election. You just listen to what she had to say about it. She said, 'How could it get any worse under this government? I am a public servant. They are about to take away my job. The opportunity I have to participate in the work force is a product of family day care, which is about to lose its operational subsidy.' Not only that but she lives at Holsworthy and they are about to put jumbo jets over her house. She said, 'How can it get any worse?' It can get even worse. The sad reality for that battling family is that when those kids grow up they have to face the prospect of barriers being placed in their way towards a higher education. They have to face the prospect of a two-tier higher education system in Australia, of 30,000 growth places being lost out of the sector. When their children grow up, they face the prospect of not being able to buy a place because they have not got the wealth, of not being able to get a place because the University of Western Sydney and the universities in Queensland and Western Australia are losing their growth funding, and of being scared away from the higher education sector by these radical and unworthy changes to the HECS scheme. This is a government of many contradictions. John Howard's slogan on the economy is 'sack to employ'. That is the economic strategy he has in place. Sacking public servants is somehow going to have a positive impact on the unemployment rate-a stark contradiction. Another contradiction is that they never believe in better government, they believe only in less government-not understanding the active, positive things that government can do to make our society better and more equal. They have a stunning contradiction these days on regional development: the National Party are saying that they have no constitutional or funding role in regional development. What are they doing here? This is a clearance sale on National Party ideology. Of all those contradictions, one stands out: the idea that Australia can become a smarter country by making it harder for people to get into university. That is what they are about. It is a stunning contradiction to say, 'You can make Australia smarter by making it harder for working people, for low income earners, to get into university.' On 20 August 1996, in this budget of betrayal, we are seeing the birth of the not-so-clever country; the birth a two-tier higher education system. The government stands condemned for its scores of broken promises dashing the hopes of battlers and working class families.",43
138,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (4.33 p.m.)-It is no wonder that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) suffered a 13 per cent swing against him on his primary vote in the election campaign. Listening to his colleague, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), it is no wonder that he lost 600,000 members to the trade union movement. The rubbish, the untruths, the misrepresentation and the hypocrisy that we have just heard condemns the Labor Party, and the Australian people are well aware of that. In making these changes to higher education, which Senator Vanstone has announced, the government is demonstrating its very deep commitment to providing young Australiansand more young Australians-with the opportunity to undertake higher education. The effect of the changes to policy that have been announced by the government will be that there will be an increase in places at universities. Mr Sawford-In South Australia?",44
139,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There will be an increase across the board in university places, there will be an improvement overall in the funding of universities and there will be an enormous improvement in the equity of higher education policy. The government responsible for squeezing the higher education system, for shutting tens of thousands of qualified students out of universities, for discriminating against Australian students and for keeping the number of university places down was none other than the previous Labor Party government. I am very happy to detail to this House the nature of the inequities that existed in the previous policy, which this government has now redressed. The concept of equity is one which was highly ideological. It did not reflect the views of mainstream Australia. It disadvantaged young working-class people of who could not get into the Commonwealth funded places under the previous government. The sort of people the member for Werriwa is referring to generally came from schools in disadvantaged areas. They were the ones who tended to have the lowest entry scores and were disproportionately represented amongst the tens of thousands who made up that statistic of unmet demand, against whom the doors of the universities were locked by the ideology of the previous government. The hypocrisy involved in the remarks of the member for Werriwa almost beggars belief. His party, after all, introduced the HECS scheme on existing students and went to election after election promising not to increase HECS and increased it relentlessly year after year. In 1989, the thresholds were one, two and three per cent. In 1990, the Labor Party government increased the thresholds for repayment to two, three and four per cent. In 1993, they increased the thresholds to three, four and five per cent. In 1995, they added four new levels of repayment on top of the existing ones-3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and six per cent-with the support of their colleagues in the National Union of Students. If people are averse to these sorts of charges and fees, if the member for Werriwa's battlers are averse, they would be averse to these sorts of changes. In addition to that, you forbade the universities to provide Australian students with the same opportunities to invest in their future which you were very willing to provide to overseas students. Australian students were denied the rights of entry to universities that overseas students were granted. And why? Purely for ideological reasons. When the universities wanted to increase places above their target quotas, when they wanted to offer more places, what did the previous government say to them? 'No additional funding for those places. You'll be penalised if you offer additional places.' What was the un met demand? How many students were shut out? Last year, the Australian ViceChancellors Committee estimates that between 16,000 and 24,000 qualified students were locked out. Students probably disproportionately from the less advantaged areas of this society were simply locked out of the universities. The government has reviewed this whole issue of equity of access to universities and has taken and announced a number of decisions which will greatly broaden access and the resourcing of Australia's universities. We fully expect that the consequence of these decisions will be that there will be more students in Australia's universities than there are today, that those universities will be better funded, that the research conditions for staff will be greatly improved, that the universities will have the freedom to address the needs of the students in a way that they did not have under the rigid, centralised, bureaucratic profiles processes that the previous government put in place. The decisions that have been announced are ones that this government is proud to stand by and which should have been introduced a long time ago. In relation to the right of Australian students to access universities, we are giving them that right. We are giving them the same right that the previous government was prepared to give overseas students, to invest in their own future and to obtain places in Australian universities. That is fair and equitable. We are adjusting the HECS contributions, not for existing students but for new students, so that they more realistically take into account the costs and the income prospects of students in different courses. The previous government thought it was fair that a student wanting to go into teaching should pay 25 per cent of the cost of their course, whereas a medical student, with a much better prospect of higher income in the future and a much more costly course for the taxpayer to provide, contributed only 13 per cent. What concept of equity was that? I believe that most Australians who reflect on the changes we are making to the structure of HECS to take into account the costs and the income prospects of students will realise the changes we have made are fair and equitable. They are fair and equitable for, and advantageous to, students who, for one reason or another, perhaps unwisely, are avoiding the higher cost courses. One of the things we must recognise is that the previous government, in introducing HECS, did introduce a mechanism which enables everyone who wants to access universities the chance to do so in a way which ought not to deter them, regardless of their present income and present financial situation, because they .ray back nothing until they are in a financial position to make that repayment. We maintain that system. We supported it at the time, it had bipartisan support, and we continue to support it. In addition, we are going a very important step beyond what the previous government was prepared to do. We are getting rid of the ideological restriction imposed on the right of universities to create additional places. Under the policies we have announced, a university which has met its full Commonwealth funded quota of HECS supported places can create additional HECS supported places. We will pay the universities the HECS attributable to those places. That means universities which have unused resources, which have staff available to teach courses, can expand the number of places available and funded through the HECS scheme. The government has fully factored in the cost of that in its calculations for the funding of the system. From 1998, universities will be able to offer additional fee paying places to Austr-lian students, who will be allowed for the first time to invest in their higher education. Those additional places will be particularly advantageous to women, who very often want to reenter the higher education stream to provide themselves with qualifications. The opportunities will be there, if they cannot get into the HECS funded places, to access those additional places. The opposition affects some ideological objection to this. The former Labor government constantly opposed this on ideological grounds. It supported fees at the school level, it supported overseas students being allowed to access these places, but it does not like the thought of Australian students being able to access these places. The fact is that as a result of these decisions the resourcing of the university system will improve significantly over the coming years. Under the decisions announced by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the government, the operational and research funding-the total Commonwealth provided funding for Australia's universities-will increase next year by some $51 million. This gives the lie to the claims made by the opposition that the government is going around slashing funding to universities. The government's efficiency savings are being imposed across the public sector. The opposition, when in government, put in place the Hoare management review of universities, indicating that it had concerns over the efficiency of university management, and now it complains when the government imposes an efficiency dividend on universities-an efficiency dividend which will not prevent the resourcing of universities improving. In addition to the operational funding that the Commonwealth will provide-when you take research funding into account, the total Commonwealth contribution to universities will fall in the following year, in 1998, by about $8 million-they will have access to these additional HECS funded places and the fee paying places that they will be able to create. Under the decisions announced by the government, from 1998-1 may have given the impression in an answer earlier that access to those additional fee paying places will be from next year; they will not be from next year, they will be from 1998-there will be a fall in the total Commonwealth contribution. Because we are properly rebalancing the public and the private contributions to universities there is a very strong private benefit, and we are recognising that. That has been embodied in our decisions, and that is fair. It is fair that the private benefit is recognised by shifting the balance between the Commonwealth supported effort in the universities and the privately supported effort. The benefit of that change will flow to Australian families and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, that will be very evident in the budget tonight. Not only will the universities have for the first time the strategic flexibility that the former government was never prepared to give them; they will also be able to provide additional places over and above those which are currently in the system, and they will have more resources with which to do so. Under the decisions of the previous government, only about 55 per cent of total university income in Australia is now provided by the Commonwealth. We are taking decisions which will allow the universities that further flexibility so that they can design their courses and their places to meet the demand which exists out there in the community. These decisions have been taken to reflect a full commitment by the government to a worldclass university system. The notion that university resources will be slashed is nonsense and the notion that places will be reduced is nonsense. It is time for the opposition to wake up to the fact that it is trying to mislead people. It is trying to distort the situation and create anxiety where there is absolutely no ground for it to exist. (Time expired)",44
140,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is quite offensive. This year is the 50th anniversary of George Orwell's essay 'Politics and the English Language' where he foresaw people like you who can explain that downsizing means more employment and that less funding for a university means more places. He explains it extremely well. What you hope is what Orwell was basically saying-that there is an absence of rational debate. There is no rational debate as far as you go. You have no shame whatsoever. And when you have no shame, as Webber often pointed out in that song Aspects of Love, you have no love either. This government's package for higher education, as this matter of public importance points out, is a crass betrayal of young Australians' aspirations for fair access and participation in higher education. It is a package that involves not only betrayal but deception as well. It is a massive breach of promise to the Australian electorate. It is a package that forgoes equity and access. It rejects inclusiveness and promotes exclusivity. And it is a package that is funded on hypocritical principles. Without doubt, the proposals will do significant harm to Australia's system of higher education. Under Labor, Australia's higher education system was internationally regarded as 'one of the most accessible systems in the world'. The shadow minister has pointed out the growth in enrolments from around 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 this year. That is some achievement. Over the four forward estimates years for the current budget to the year 2000, this government intends to achieve net savings of $1.8 billion through a combination of funding cuts and dramatically increased HECS charges. However, even that $1.8 billion understates the real position as universities will have to absorb the cost of salary increases to the tune of $200 million to $300 million-we are over $2 billion. The government's higher education package, as I said, is a massive breach of promise on the part of the coalition to the Australian electorate. This is the very same coalition which undertook before the election to 'at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. This is when the vice-chancellors said, 'This is a fair thing.' Even many of the students said, 'This is a fair thing.' But the coalition did more than just massively breach of promise: it deceived students, it deceived parents and it abrogated their commitment to HECS. We on this side of the House-some of us have been here for a while-always knew that the coalition's commitment to education would be broken. We have watched their changing front-bench and their attitude and behaviour to education for many years: from a Prime Minister who refused an education portfolio to a front-bench that, almost without exception, responded to any debate on education with derisive yawns and guffaws. Many in the Australian electorate believed their promises at the last election. They will know better next time. This is not a government that will acknowledge the needs of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a government that believes in fairness and equity, and this is not a government that gives Australians in regional Australia a fair go. There is not one member from the National Party in the chamber. Increased HECS charges will mean that those from low income backgrounds will need to contemplate a greatly increased level of financial risk before they consider embarking on a university course. Cutting public funding while allowing universities to charge full fees to some students will mean a progressive substitution of HECS paying students with full fee paying students in the more sought after courses which lead to lucrative careers. That will mean opportunities for the rich and the thick. Given that there are currently 630,000 students in Australia, the so-called equity programs announced by the government are nothing short of farcical. It is interesting that the member for Sturt  to see the other South Australian members here-including the members for Makin (Mrs Draper), Kingston (Ms Jeanes), Mayo (Mr Downer), Barker (Mr MCLachlan), Boothby (Dr Southcott) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew). With the six South Australian senators and the other South Australian members-the whole 16 of them-they lay down and rolled over for this government. The Liberal Party are going to give 1,000 merit based scholarships, but they will do nothing to counter the negative impact of the changes for the disadvantaged. In South Australia-and I mention this for the benefit. of the member for Sturt-we are going to get 100 scholarships and, in return, we are going to lose 1,504 places. That is a good deal for South Australia! The 16 Liberals-including Senator Vanstone-got up and fought for South Australia! They did South Australia in the eye. What about regional institutions? Many of them are new and stand to suffer greatly as funds are cut and fee paying students migrate to more established and prestigious institutions. A number of regional universities, because they are new, are already operating on very tight budgets. They lack the depth of resources of the more established institutions and do not have the wherewithal to survive these cuts. Regional young Australians have been deceived by this government. The coalition argument that regional institutions are protected is very, very different to the reality. No matter how you do the numbers and no matter what double speak you use, what we are talking about is reduction and reduced opportunities for young Australians in regional Australia. The government's funding package for higher education is nothing but blatant hypocrisy. The universities are being told to take increased student numbers, but they are getting less funding. For example, the government fails to take into account the decision to abolish funding for a range of important programs grouped together as discretionary funds. This amounts to $214 million over the forward estimates years. To be fair, the government actually announced that before the election. But the government also fails to take into account that over 90 per cent of Commonwealth funding for universities is provided in the form of operating grants. These will be cut by $623.6 million compared with the levels of the former Labor government. The reality is that funding per student must decline. Staff/student ratios will increase, educational quality must suffer a consequent loss. The government also fails to provide supplementation for staff salary raises. The effect of this will be to put universities under significant financial stress-to the tune of $200 million to $300 million annually. What will be the result of this, Minister Kemp? We will have our most schooled people in universities getting on the first Qantas flight overseas. We will have the brain drain. They will react, and they will simply go overseas. It will mean larger classes, reduced quality of education and diminished course offerings. Dr Kemp-What hypocrisy.",46
141,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are the expert in hypocrisy and double speak. The member for Sturt is going to get up and argue that South Australia is going to benefit by losing. The government argues that the pay increases were funded by productivity agreements, but it hypocritically fails to explain how such productivity improvements might be achieved. But the most blatant and the most ugly hypocrisy is yet to come. Having decided to make the major cuts in higher education, the coalition hypocritically makes students pay for the privilege. Yes, you are raising HECS to $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Students are going to pay another $313 million over four years. Then, out of the talented young Australians, you are simply going to take some of their aspirations away. But it does not stop there. In terms of the threshold, you are going to recover another $817.4 million at the very beginning of young people's careers. A total impost of $1.3 billion will certainly deter many prospective students from filling their aspirations in higher education. Of course, those students will come from working-class and disadvantaged areas-our areas. To sum up, the government's measures are a major blow to quality and equity and will have a devastating effect on the aspirations of young Australians. The government has instituted major changes; yet, extraordinarily, you have announced that you will undertake a major review. How do you like that mindboggling effort? You have announced major and changes, and tonight you are going to announce a major review. That is competence of the highest level, I do not think. But worse is yet to come. We are yet to see what the coalition has in store for student income support arrangements, not to mention what is really likely to happen to the bottom line in further education and the school sector. If you remove from the states $1.5 billion in untied grants and $330 million in tied grants, what impact will that have on schools and further education? (Time expired)  the Australian people gave the tired Labor government a very simple message-'Your time is up and we won't need your services for a very long time.' After listening to the contribution to this debate from the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Sawford, it is little wonder that they gave them that message. His speech was one of the most simplistic assessments of higher education policy in Australia. In fact, it was so bad that I thought his enemies within his own faction had written it for him to embarrass him publicly, knowing the humiliation he would suffer after delivering such a ridiculous assessment. You quoted from Orwell's books but, after listening to your speech, I wonder how they ever came to your attention. I hope that next time you make a contribution it is more erudite than that. The Australian people rejected the Labor Party after 13 years of government because they were sick of recessions, wildly fluctuating interest rates and years of darkness with all too little economic sunshine. The people had quite simply had enough. They no longer believed in a government that had begun to treat unemployment as a statistical problem to be fudged, rather than a human epidemic to be cured. They no longer believed in a government that spouted access and equity and delivered neither, and nowhere was their failure more evident than in higher education. It is not yet six months since the people dropped the not too subtle hint that they preferred our vision to the Labor Party's indifference. Now, however, the opposition are presuming to speak for vice-chancellors, academics, students and parents of future students by saying that we have betrayed young Australians. They are now actually seeking to wear the clothes of the advocates and protectors of students after 13 years of abuse. Let us look at the facts. It was the Labor government which introduced HECS in the first place. It was the Labor government which ended so-called free education by the Whitlam government. They did so for good and simple reasons: the dream had failed, the demographic profiles of the student body had not changed in 10 years and free education and living allowances had not done a thing except burden the higher education system and reduce its effectiveness. Again, it was the Labor government which increased HECS not once, not twice but three times in one parliament. In doing so, they clearly buried the notion that tertiary education is more a right than a privilege. Higher education is, in the main, financed by the taxpayers of this country. There is little complaint even from those who derive no direct benefit from the system because their investment produces qualified people who benefit Australia during their working years. That benefit is dependent on graduates being able to find a job. For every graduate to become productive, they must be qualified and the work force must be capable of absorbing them. On both counts, the Labor Party stand condemned. The ALP's shallow commitment to academic excellence was clearly demonstrated by their introducing full fees for students choosing to do postgraduate studies. Rather than rewarding the ambitious, those who would in the long term contribute more to Australia, they penalised them. They now have the hypocrisy to lament their own actions and try to put the blame on this government. At the same time, while they expanded the tertiary education sector massively, as they pointed out, they reduced per capita funding for students as though the priority were not to truly educate but to reduce the unemployment queues that they were also responsible for. What hypocrisy! The Labor Party are standing here today and trying to wear the new clothes of the advocates for students and academics when in fact on every single count they were responsible for introducing the changes that ended the system-a cacophony of praise for their own system, for the Whitlam government, which they have dismantled over their period of government. Now they seek to pretend to the students and the NUS, who seem only too ready to accept, that they were in fact their advocates for those 13 years. The coalition believes that the term 'the clever country' must mean something very real. The policies announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) signal a much needed changed in attitude and direction, a change that will benefit all Australians in the long run. The old adage that 'we only get what we pay for' holds true in education. This government is asking students to contribute a little more towards their education, but our aim is to improve the system so the benefits will be greater. I am puzzled that the Labor Party, which claims exclusivity on social justice, fails to see the equity in asking those students taking specialised courses to pay a little more than those who are taking more general studies, especially given that the top 20 per cent of households derive more than five times the benefit from education than the bottom 20 per cent of households. I am amazed, given those statistics, that it would oppose changes to this system. If the Labor Party members were supposed to have learnt the lessons from their crushing defeat on 2 March, they very clearly have not. Their collective backs have been turned, obviously, to their base constituency. Why should the taxpayer who has not attended university, or whose children are not attending university, wholly subsidise those students who will go on to a career fast track and ultimately join the ranks of the very high income earners? Among Labor ranks, there used to be many proponents of soaking the rich-perhaps their new tack is to soak the poor. It should be noted well that the changes to HECS will not affect students already undertaking a university course. This is in sharp contrast, yet again, to those opposite whose approach was to retrospectively increase HECS on existing students no fewer than three times in the last parliament. Some in the Labor Party have made the amazing claim that this government's initiative to allow Australians to purchase a university place will lead to thick young people from rich families receiving preference over any other. It was the previous government which introduced fees for students from overseas countries for places over and above the government provided places. They did not, however, allow Australians the same opportunity: 'No,' they said, 'you're an Australian and you shouldn't have to pay but, as there is no room for you, you can't go to university.' It is pure pretzel logic. This new initiative will provide Australians with increased access to university places. Paying students will be able to take their place in a degree course of their choice rather than languish in a less preferred option as long as the university has first filled its HECS places. This will free up a place for someone else who is desirous of the place that they have given up. Certainly they will have to pay their way, but their places will not come at the expense of the HECS paying students. If universities were to attract only a one per cent additional undergraduate student load in 1997 in the form of fee paying undergraduates, this alone would generate an extra $17 million of additional income for an average fee of $4,700. Imagine what the universities would be able to do with that! Of course, noone supposes that it will be as low as one per cent. Our academic institutions must compete with other universities around the world. Excellence is the key. It is not good enough to say we provide higher education for all. There is duplication. There is a degree of waste. There is not enough excellence. Why should an MBA from Harvard University mean more than one from an Australian university? Why should a law degree from Yale mean more than an LLB from Australia? Why, for example, with all of Australia's mining activity, can we not have the best tertiary training for that type of career? Why should Australians have to venture overseas to attain the best qualifications? As we know, some of them will never return. Over the next three years we will be funding an additional 100 postgraduate awards at a cost of $9.3 million. We will be providing another $30 million for collaborative research grants to foster links between our universities and industry. We will provide $90 million for research and for investment in new equipment for facilities. This is no betrayal. Rather, in honouring our commitments, we keep the faith with the people. Around this time of the year, passions are aroused by the widespread rumours of cuts. The university vice-chancellors hit the trail months ago to sell the line that this government would savage the budget for higher education. In fact, Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by $50 million next year. If that is 'savage', I would like to know what 'catastrophic' is for universities. Universities are being asked to find savings of lc in every dollar this year. They will have the time to plan and budget so that they can find another 4c in the dollar by 1999. These are hardly draconian measures, especially at a time when many Australians are being asked to make sacrifices for the greater national good. If those whipping up the hysteria in the community about our higher education policy would study the facts, they would find some interesting initiatives. One such plan is the introduction of 4,000 HECS-free scholarships that will aid people from rural and remote areas, indigenous students and students from low socio-economic backgrounds.

NA IMPLEMENTATION BILL 1996 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",51
143,Mr WILLIAMS,NATIONAL FIREARMS PROGRAM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. As all here in this House are aware, the tragedy in Port Arthur in April prompted historic decisions in relation to firearms in this country. On 10 May and 17 July the Australasian Police Ministers Council agreed on nationwide gun control measures. I have already set out the details of these measures for the House during debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996. All governments in this country are' agreed that possession of firearms is not a right but a conditional privilege. The new measures will include effective nationwide registration of all firearms, the need for applicants firearms licences to establish a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm and purposes. uniform basic licence requirements. Personal protection will not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using firearm. A significant element of the measures is amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Such guns are to be the subject of nationwide restrictions. There will be limited access to certain categowealth ries of self-loading rifles and shotguns pump-action shotguns for primary producers and exemptions for military, police occupational shooters licensed for a specific purpose such as extermination of feral anireally mals. The scheme will require gun owners hand in firearms falling within the restricted categories during the nationwide amnesty period in return for fair and proper compensacomplement tion. The Commonwealth agreed to meet fully the direct cost of the compensation-for the surrender scheme, funds for which have been raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare controls. levy for the income year 1996-97. This increase is already in effect and it remains only to permit the moneys raised to be paid to the states and territories to assist them achieving the full implementation of the new nationwide gun control measures overwhelmto ingly supported by the majority of the Ausbanned tralian people. A very large total cost is involved. It is estimated that the increase in the Medicare levy will raise around $500 million. This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the probof lem of gun control. This bill allows me to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows me to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonprotection wealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registrafor tion schemes. The bill appropriates moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for these Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited a to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 the September next year, or such shorter period as I determine if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock and the Commonwill reimburse the states and territories and for compensation paid in relation to such claims if the claim is lodged during the and national amnesty period. Swift action is essential if we are to have effective nationwide firearms laws. The to Commonwealth has already demonstrated its commitment by acting quickly to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to the resolutions of the Australasian Police Ministers Council and by increasing the Medicare levy. Now it is time to take next step to support the states and territories in their endeavours to achieve effective Simple and short though it is, this bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It provides in support to the states and territories, will enable the compensation-for-surrender scheme go ahead and, I hope, encourage owners of firearms to come forward and surrender them. It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed through the parliament as quickly as possible. The government has acknowledged this by introducing it on the first day of sittings. We have had the support the opposition right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws and it has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. I ask the opposition to continue that support and pass this bill quickly. In this way we will help to encourage the speedy surrender of these firearms and ensure greater from violence for the whole Australian community. Let us all act together to make this country a safer place. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June 1996, on motion by Mrs Bishop: That the bill be read a second time.",51
144,Mr BEVIS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) before the parliament has two primary purposes. One of those could fairly be described as quite routine in that it closes a loophole the Defence Force Discipline Bill, which is consequent upon some changes in legislation in the ACT. The purpose of that bill has been set out in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). Of course, the opposition is happy to support that. The principal purpose of the bill before the parliament, though, goes to improvements in the subsidised loans available to Defence Force personnel through amending the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. The improvements involve an increase in the maximum loans available from $40,000 to $80,000 in the case of personnel where there is only one serving member in the family. Where there are two serving members in the family and a joint entitlement, the maximum level is increased from $80,000 to $160,000. The opposition supports the bill and particuprevious larly welcomes those initiatives to assist Defence Force personnel. Importantly, the bill also provides for a reduction in eligibility for stability. loans from six years to five years and extends the eligibility to include reserves and emergency forces. These measures are welcomed by the opposition. Indeed, those measures were committed to by Labor prior to the last election. I am delighted that the Liberal Party, in the lead-up to the election, endorsed those commitments and extended on them. That is a matter that I will be pursuing when we get to discussion of the bill in detail because I will be giving the government the opportunity to actually implement the full intent of their election promises through the amendment I will be moving at that stage. I tum my attention to the positive aspects of the bill. It is appropriate that people in the defence forces have their conditions of service checked on a regular basis to ensure that they meet the needs of the service and the changing demands the service places upon them and that they also keep pace with wider community variations. Defence personnel are our greatest defence asset. We place a lot of attention and media focus on the various pieces of hardware that go to make up the equipment Defence Force in personnel use, but there can be no doubt that the great advantage Australia has in its defence is the dedication, the training, the commitment and the sheer quality of those people who wear the uniforms. That is an assessment which I am sure all members of the House who have had the pleasure of any experience of defence personnel would gladly endorse. It is appropriate that we do acknowledge that defence personnel are placed under conditions that are not normally to be accepted or confronted by others in the work force. One of those is a very regular requirement to transfer location. Posting rotations of two or three years are not uncommon and requirements to shift not from one town to another but from one comer of the country to another are not uncommon. I am aware that the government is looking at the opportunity to extend the length of postings, as did the government. Indeed, a number of comments were made in the Glenn report about the importance of providing some The fact that people have to endure very significant transfers on a regular basis, from one comer of the nation to another, dislocates a whole range of things. It makes life difficult for those who have a spouse and for those who have children. It makes it difficult for them in relation to their children's education as they move from one system to another. It makes it difficult for their spouse to engage in paid employment. The opportunity for a spouse of a Defence Force person to maintain a career structure is invariably cut short every three years or so as they are moved from one part of the country to another. It also makes life difficult in some of those things that many in what I might describe as normal employment would take for granted: the opportunity to acquire a house, to make it your home, to invest some of your life savings into it and to call one place your family's home. It is partly in recognition of those things that the government has, over time, provided a subsidy to assist defence personnel to acquire accommodation and to purchase their homes. I think it is fair to say that, over time, level of home loan assistance has not kept pace with the rising cost of real estate. It was for that reason that the Labor Party in government committed to an increase identical to the increase that the new Liberal government has now legislated for. We are therefore very happy to support it. I am also very pleased to note that the bill picks up on an extension of eligibility to reserves. Increasingly, the part-time defence forces of Australia are going to play an important role in the defence of our nation. If Army 21 ever does get to see the light of day-as each month goes past there are more and more questions asked about that-and assuming the minister does finally get around to making a decision about Army 21 and it gets endorsed in anything like the form it was submitted in, then we will see a much greater role for reserves and a recognition that Australia's defence relies upon a total force made up not just of the dedicated full-time personnel but also of those dedicated part-time people. Typically, they add to a private job, family responsibilities and normal community activities the burden of very significant Defence Force service contributions. It is appropriate that reserves are able to access defence home loan assistance. I applaud the initiative that allows a full-time equivalent of service for reserves to be counted as eligibility for access to the home loans assistance scheme. The requirement for reserves over time is going to increase, and I would urge the minister and the government to look more broadly at other conditions of service that are currently applied to full-time personnel and to look at their application to part-time reserves. If we are going to have a total force in which reserves play an integral part-and that is certainly the way in which the forces are now structured and I believe the way in which they will be into the 21 st century-then we do need to look at a continuum of not just service but of benefit to those who serve. That means addressing not just questions such as home loans but rates of pay, access to medical benefits, dental benefits, long-service leave, superannuation and a raft of other the benefits that accrue to those in full-time employment in the services. This is a significant step, though, in recognition of the contribution that reserves make. It was a commitment of the Labor government before the election that we would legislate to do these things and we support the initiative now taken by the Liberal government to do that. It is a concern to me that in practical terms some of these measures are not in accord with other activities of the government. Much of Australia's defence forces are distributed in regional Australia. Those difficulties that I mentioned people encounter when they transfer are exacerbated when regional Australia is feeling some economic pain. The fact of life is that this government in its short time has already determined to reduce support for regional development programs. The government has made a series of reductions in government services in a number of areas. I could go through the debates about the cuts in the department for regional planning, the cuts in job creation programs and the cuts in the forward estimates for tertiary places in regional Australia. All of those things impact very much upon defence personnel who are increasingly being placed in regional Australia. So, when we talk about the difficulty that defence spouses are placed in when they move to new locations and have difficulty in getting jobs, those cuts which the government is making now that affect regional Australia impact doubly upon those spouses. They are doubly disadvantaged. They confront the same economic difficulties as everybody else in that community but as new people into the location suffer an additional burden that places them behind the eight ball. When their children move to a school whose funding has been restricted or seek to go to a tertiary institution in regional Australia only to find that there are fewer places next year than were provided for in the forward estimates of the last budget, they suffer along with everybody else. It is passing strange that these initiatives, which I endorse in this bill, unfortunately and regrettably are not supported by other initiatives that the government has taken. I want to tum to the matter of the government's pledge before the last election. During the election campaign, the Liberal Party's policy statement was committed to those things that are contained in this bill, but of course the Liberal Party is committed to other things as well. I will quote the relevant section from the Liberal Party's own document, which states: The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home loan assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor. After the second reading debate, I will move an amendment to give effect to that part of the promise which has either been omitted because people overlooked it or omitted because they no longer have the heart to implement the undertaking. The amendment that I will move will ensure access to these new home loan limits from 1 July, and will afford government members the opportunity to vote for their own policy. During the election campaign the Liberal Party sought to make quite some play out of the fact that it was offering to service personnel a better package, if you like, a better support and incomes package, than the Labor Party was offering. You cannot have it both ways. Mrs Bishop-Yes, you can.",53
145,Mr BEVIS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The minister says that you can have it both ways. I am pleased that you made that interjection. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot go to the people and say, 'We will provide you with a better home loan scheme, and why is it better? It is better because it will have reduced eligibility and it is better because it will be available to you six months before the Labor Party was going to make its scheme available to you.' That was the point you took to the people in uniform during the election campaign. You have honoured a good deal of that in this bill. In fact, you have honoured those parts of it that we were committed to. What you have not honoured in this bill is ensuring that people have access to it from 1 July. You will have your opportunity to maintain your word and keep faith with those people in uniform whom you gave that promise to and that opportunity will present itselfMrs Bishop interjecting",55
146,Mr BEVIS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"It can be done. In fact, my understanding from the briefings that were given to my staff on this matter is that there would be few people affected if it were to be changed to 1 July. Assuming few people would be affected, there would not be much money involved, although I do find it somewhat interesting, in looking at the explanatory memorandum for the bill, that the financial impact of the bill in the current financial year is $5.9 million. It is estimated it will rise to $12 million in the next financial year, 199798, and the year after that it will rise to $16 million. I can only assume by that that the difference of about $6 million between what you anticipate paying out in this financial year and what you anticipate you will pay in the subsequent financial year is the $6 million you promised before the election you would give service personnel and are seeking to deny them now. My amendment will enable you to provide that $6 million to them. Mrs Bishop-But it won't. It will make no difference to the",55
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Mr Hollis)Order! The minister will have the time to sum up.,55

149,Mr BEVIS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"You introduced the bill before 1 July! I am glad you made that point. You introduced this bill at 10 past five on the second last sitting day prior to the recess without notice and without any advice to the parliament, to the opposition or to me as the shadow minister. You introduced this bill at 10 past five of the second last day of sitting before the House rose. Here we are on the first day back and it is listed for debate on the first day back. If you regard that as honouring your commitment, then try to sell that to the service personnel who actually took you at your word. When you said that your scheme was better than the Labor Party scheme because it operated from 1 July some of them actually believed it-not all of them; some of them could see what you were and could see through it. But some of the people in uniform-trusting and loyal people that they are-took you at your word. When you said that it would be available from 1 July they did not think that that meant that the bill would be introduced on the second last sitting day in June, that at some time in August the parliament would get around to dealing with it, that some time in September the Senate would deal with it and that some time in October the Governor-in-Council would sign it so that they would be eligible for it in November. When you said they would be eligible for it on 1 July they actually thought that is what it meant and, of course, it did. All you have done since then is backtrack. You have been caught out by the people in the services and you have been forced to try to defend that in public. Mrs Bishop-I haven't been made to defend it at all. I made it public.",56
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Order! The minister will have time to reply later on.,56
151,Mr BEVIS,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"If it is not 'forced to defend it', I am not sure what your letter to the Canberra Times of 19 May was then. In your letter to the Canberra Times of 19 May you replied to a gentleman whom I assume is in the services because he seems very interested in the issue. You referred to Wayne Pocock's letter concerning the government's commitment to legislate to double the maximum value of the loan available to members of the ADF under the defence home owner scheme from $40,000 to $80,000. You said: I would point out that we also promised to reduce the eligibility period of service from six years as proposed by the Keating regime to five years under this government. You have done that I acknowledge it. You went on to say: We further promised to extend the entitlements to General Reservists after a qualifying period of eight years of effective service. And you have done that. You then say: All these promises will be honoured. That was a very selective letter you decided to send at that time. You 'obviously went through your own policy statements-I assume you are familiar with the detail of your own policy statements; it was only a couple of months ago that we had the election-and in May this year you had already decided that you were not going to honour that 1 July commitment. When you wrote back in May you enunciated every one of the obligations that you had put before the election, bar one. So on 19 May you had already determined you were going to renege on that undertaking. Your comments here in the chamber today just reinforce that view that that is exactly what you were about-you intended to renege on it. I have got to say that you did not convince  Canberra Times on Tuesday, 28 May. I could read that letter to you, but I imagine you recall it. I am sure someone in your department clipped it for you and brought it to your attention. But he did not miss you. He understood that you were fudging, and fudging you are. You will have the opportunity to demonstrate I am wrong when my amendment is moved. You can determine to vote for it or against it, but let us be clear about it: those on the government benches who say that the amendment that I will be moving shortly is of no effect might also like to explain the $6 million difference between the anticipated costs in this financial year and the $12 million in the following year. They might also like to explain why somebody who is applying for a home loan in August should not be able to access the $80,000 limit instead of the $40,000 limit, because you said you would have it in place for them on 1 July. You might also like to consider a range of other initiatives which you seemed somewhat supportive of before the election but have gone very cold on since. This one provision for a home loans subsidy for defence personnel was actually part of a bundle of initiatives that the Labor government was addressing before the last election. They arose from the Glenn review, established by former Minister Punch. During the Glenn review he identified a range of issues that required improvement if-as I said at the outset of my speech-we were to ensure that defence personnel conditions kept pace with their needs and with contemporary employment practices. One of the things that was mentioned then was, in fact, an increase in the maximum amount available under the defence home owner scheme. On 10 December last year the then minister, Minister Punch, issued a statement on behalf of the Labor government undertaking to implement that commitment. But it was not just that one commitment, and it was not in isolation. This is not a bandaid approach that we should be looking at to address the needs of defence personnel issues. This was part of a coordinated approach to ensure that the net of services and benefits and remuneration available to people in defence was the best to attract high quality people and to retain them. So we also gave commitments to child care, to occasional care, to family day care and to an ADF spouse employment program. We gave commitments in relation to exemption for ADF members from changes to the superannuation preservation rules. We also gave commitments in relation to improvements in compassionate leave, the extension of education assistance provisions, the introduction of reunion travel for dependent tertiary students, the introduction of spouse emergency travel, the introduction of pre-posting travel for members with special needs dependants, an extension of the remote locality leave travel provisions and the removal of the anomaly in tax rebates for United Nations deployments. All of these things were part of a coordinated approach Labor was committed to prior to the last election-one of which was the improvement to the home loan subsidy scheme. We support your bill. We support the improvements to the home loan subsidy scheme. We are waiting to hear what you are going to do about the rest of the coordinated approach, because either you are going to do this piecemeal or you are going to place bandaids over situations as you can-or, as I fear, you are going to endeavour to sidestep the entire Glenn review process. In fact, I understand that people in defence these days are not allowed to call it the Glenn review any more. Someone in the ministerial wing feels somewhat offended by that reference. I am not sure whether that is because they do not like the government that it was previously produced for, they do not like its recommendations or they feel uncomfortable with Mr Glenn. They did not feel uncomfortable with the name 'Glenn report' before the election, though. Again, in their election manifesto, in their 'Defence Personnel' section at paragraph 6.4, they said: The recently released Glenn Review identified the need for a long tenn strategic personnel policy which appropriately recognises the importance of manpower as a defence asset. in addition to other measures identified in this policy the Coalition will implement a long tenn strategic personnel plan in accordance with the principles identified in the Glenn Review. Minister, where is it? You have gone AWOL since the election. You do not let people talk about the Glenn review any more. You have not come out with a coherent policy statement in relation to personnel. But I should not be surprised at that. You have not come out with a coherent policy in relation to defence strategic matters either. So I guess it should be little wonder that we do not have one on personnel-and you now take bits and pieces in an ad hoc way and present them to the parliament. Minister, we will certainly look at those bits and pieces and will be happy to support those that make good sense. This bill, as far as it goes, makes good sense and will have our support. It does not go far enough on two counts. It does not go far enough because it does not honour your election undertakings, which you made great play of during the election campaign. You should not deceive those people in uniform whom you gave that promise to, and this afternoon you can rectify that. It does not go far enough because it is ad hoc and piecemeal. It is taken in isolation, and it does not address in any coherent and considered way the problems which Glenn identified in his report. Minister, as there are so few bills on defence matters that come before the chamber, you might like to take this opportunity to set out your views on defence personnel matters as the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. You might like to enlighten the parliament. I am sure many people in uniform are waiting to hear a coherent statement on what the considered and collective view of the government is of the many recommendations in the Glenn review. Do you endorse the undertakings given by the previous government in December of last year when Minister Punch made the response to which I referred? Do you endorse those? If you do not endorse all of them, then which ones do you endorse? If you want to extend beyond those recommendations, we would gladly entertain a discussion on the matter. But let us not deal with defence personnel matters on an ad hoc impromptu basis. Let us not do it by the bandaid method. Let us have a considered, planned approach. If the aim and direction of your approach is to ensure that the defence personnel of the three services are properly remunerated, are properly rewarded and are better placed to do their job as our greatest asset, then you will have my support and you will have the support of the opposition.",56
152,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I welcome the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 and believe that, as in so many other ways, it reflects the total commitment of the coalition to examining the circumstances of those who serve in the Australian Defence Force. It certainly does provide, in the second major component, an opportunity for those who are disadvantaged by the frequent moves, which seem to be part of a service career, to acquire their own home and to maintain it and to act far more in pari passu with those who are in the community than would otherwise be the case-that is, in civil employment. There are two components to the bill, and I want to address each of them briefly. The first, of course, relates to the Defence Force disciplinary legislation and the Defence Force Discipline Act, which is a very important part of trying to ensure that the criminal law provisions that pertain to all members of the community pertain equally to those who are members of the Australian Defence Force. What the change reflects is, in fact, the paradox of our not having federal criminal law. It has always seemed to me to be rather strange that we are in the position where there are differences, be they minor, between the different states. Of course, this legislation began by the application of so much of the New South Wales criminal law as is applicable to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not aware, and I have not gone into the particular detail, but I had always thought the criminal law for Jervis Bay and Canberra was the same. I presumed that, because they chose Jervis Bay-and there is, of course, a very significant naval presence within the Jervis Bay territory-there must be some reason for it. At the time the legislation was last before this House I cannot recall why we decided that it should be the Crimes Act 1900 that applied to the Australian Capital Territory's application to the Jervis Bay territory rather than looking at the Crimes Act 1900 as it applied to the Australian Capital Territory. I do not know what the nuance of that is. The significance of this amendment is to ensure that there are no shortfalls in legislative competence as far as any existing prosecutions are concerned. While it has only briefly been referred to by both the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in her introduction and by the spokesperson for the opposition, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), I think it is important that we try to ensure that there is an understanding across Australia of what criminal law provisions affect those who are in the Defence Force, as much as an understanding by those in the community at large. For the life of me, from reading it I have been a little bemused to know what the significance of this change is, other than picking up those for whom there may be some ongoing prosecution. The nature of the change is obviously one on which there can be little debate. I think it is important that there be a maximum understanding of what criminal law applies to what person and where. I question the extent to which there is some particular difference, other than the fact that the Jervis Bay territory is now part of the ACT and the ACT is now an independent territory and whether that has given it some peculiar significance. The nature of this change in the face of the legislation that is before us is a little hard to comprehend. I think it is probably more hard to comprehend because the ACT is a separate territory. It does seem a little odd that we are now deciding that it will be the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory rather than New South Wales and its application to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not too sure what the practical outcome of that is. I support the change, but I am interested to know what is excluded were the legislation to be just the law of the ACT rather than just the law of the ACT as it is in force in the Jervis Bay territory. Any legislation should be comprehensible and understandable. In this sense we are moving from the application of a state law, although it was particularly applicable to the ACT, to one that brings affairs more up to date. It therefore is one which no doubt is more related to prosecutions under way and, apparently, some shortfall. There is nothing in the explanatory memorandum, the minister's speech or otherwise to explain why we are doing it this way, other than, I presume, that because the ACT is a separate territory it is necessary to pick up the fact that Jervis Bay has changed its territorial status as a result. Why we need to keep the specific reference to Jervis Bay, I am not sure. The second part of the bill is the substance of the legislation, and it is on that that I wanted to make a few remarks. I really have not been able to follow the amendment that was foreshadowed by the honourable member for Brisbane. As I understand the effect of the passage of the legislation, the legislation will apply to any individual applicant from the date of the approval of the loan. The terms are being changed so that the eligibility is reduced in the period of years of service, there is a new category for reservists and the amount which an applicant is entitled to receive is also being increased. There will also be a spouse's joint entitlement. As I understand the effect of the legislation, until it is passed by this place there is no capacity to make an application. If there is no capacity to make an application, it means that until we have passed this legislation both here and in the Senate no application will be made. If you date it back to 1 July, you cannot make an application between 1 July and 20 August because the legislation has not gone through. If the legislation has not gone through, the effect of your amendment is not to enhance the eligibility of an individual in any way. On the form of words that you have used, I do not frankly follow the purport of the change. While I understand that it might be a political point and relate to an election undertaking, it would only have been applicable had the legislation been passed during the last sittings and the date of assent to the bill had in some way been postponed to after 1 July. Once it has been passed by this place, subject to passage through the Senate and the process of approval by the Governor General, you then need to apply and any application will be dealt with according to the terms of eligibility that are now prescribed within the legislation. Those terms will ensure that the individual, subject to meeting the criteria which are set down and which are now changed and are made more generousjustifiably-will have exactly the same entitlement as if you dated it back to 1 July because they cannot apply until after 20 August. I might be wrong, but that seems to be my understanding from reading the legislation. As to the amount, I suspect that that is because in the nature of things, it being 20 August, there will be some delay between now and the time the legislation is put into practice by the Department of Defence. Any applications made will necessarily begin from the time of their approval. Presumably, that will mean that the first application may not be until some time in September. There are inevitable battles of scrutiny, so you have at least missed one-third of the year. Whether that is the reason for the particular sums being given and the cost, I am not sure. I suspect, knowing most of these schemes, that people who might well wish to apply are not all going to be processed immediately. I suspect that next year there will be an ongoing processing, which will commence from 1 July. In the present financial period it is unlikely that all those who may be eligible will have their applications in and will be processed in the normal course once the legislation is enacted. The significant part of the legislation is designed to ensure that there is an additional entitlement for service people to overcome that inevitable move that takes place in their careers every two years. I must say that when the Defence Housing Authority legislation came before this House I was very apprehensive as to whether or not it would provide a change in the quality of residential accommodation available to those who rent. As I understand it, the quality of defence homes today is much better than it was-it needs to be-and so we can say that the Defence Housing Authority has done a remarkable job. Much of the housing was antiquated. Much of it dated from World War II. In particular, single and married quarters on defence facilities were inadequate to meet the parallel standards that one expects in the services, especially with the additional hazards and obligations that service people have compared with their civilian counterparts. It was essential that a great deal of additional funding be provided. It was also necessary to dispose of a lot of those antiquated houses. It is always difficult to measure the effectiveness of defence housing. However, from wandering around the defence bases-as I do from time to time. I know that there are still some that need to be upgraded. One aspect that I would like to comment on is the difficulties with the education of children. Also of concern is the degree to which it is easier for a partner to get a job on some bases than it is on others. While there has been a significant improvement in the quality of housing, there are still difficulties in trying to ensure continuity in education and employment for the families of defence personnel. That really takes me back to my first observation about the degree to which criminal law varies from state to state, even if it is to a minor degree. Basic costs for defence personnel being transferred still need to be addressed. It has always seemed to me, for example, that the qualifications of some professions are too state oriented. It is quite ridiculous that people who are qualified nursing sisters in Victoria have to be readmitted if they are transferred from a naval base in Victoria to one in Cairns. If people take their motor vehicle, it has to be reregistered in the state to which they are posted. If people go from a school in one state to a school in another state, because of the relativity in the level of education, someone in fifth class in a school in New South Wales who transfers from a naval base there to one in Western Australia will find that the courses available and the level of education will not be quite the same. There is inevitable disruption. I have long felt that we need to find a way to accommodate those who are transferred from state to state-and not just those in the defence forces, although it certainly applies to them. Those who are at a state level of administration need to register that while there are differences around Australia they are imposing undue and often harsh penalties on those who, for one reason or another, are transferred interstate. Often people find that their families, because of the circumstances of their employment or the opportunity for their family members' education, are pressured into deciding to linger somewhere else. In many instances that means that there are defence personnel whose families live a long way from them. They do that because they want to try to achieve a normal life. It means that they want to provide continuity of education for their children. A child in Year 11 in New South Wales, whose parents are in the services and who are transferred interstate, will find it difficult to complete the HSC in the time it would normally take. The pressure to complete your education to a certain standard means that there are times when families suffer. Certainly the service person who is moved finds it a wrench to decide whether to accommodate the desires of the family or to meet the obligations of the service. There is another way in which this could be overcome. Where transfers are to be made, the position of families should be taken into account by those who are posting them. So the posting should be made at a time of the year when the education of children would not be prejudiced. That still does not overcome the difficulty of motor vehicle registration, professional qualifications and necessary state registration obligations, nor some of the other facets related to the differences that exist state by state around Australia. Having said that, there is little doubt that the provisions in this legislation, which expand the opportunity for individuals within the services to have a greater opportunity to fund their own homes, reflect a step in the right direction. It is one to which the coalition is committed and one which I welcome, both in the additional funds made available and also to the extent to which it means that there is a more equal chance for defence people to acquire and own their home and to follow their careers without being as disadvantaged as they are at the moment. Many have been able to use their superannuation to buy a house after they leave the Defence Force. Today, the degree to which you can commute your pension and acquire adequate funds to do so are more limited than they once were, and there is a greater tax obligation. For that reason, I think the opportunity of giving them this subsidised loan during a stage of their career when they have a chance to get a title to a home while they are still in productive employment in the services is desirable in a social as well as an economic sense. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon) adjourned.",58
153,Unknown,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1996-97 First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",61
154,Mr COSTELLO,DEFENCE LEGISLATION," I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Tonight I announce a programme for families for small business for older Australians for major improvements in health care and, importantly, a plan to repair the nation's finances and secure our future. This Budget implements the key election commitments of the Coalition and it does so as part of a responsible economic strategy. The focus is savings-savings for investment, sustainable growth and real jobs. This Budget turns around failure and sets us on a winning course. NA The budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. We would still have an underlying deficit of 2 per cent of GDP even though the economy has had five years of growth. Debt would be increasing and Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook or sentiment. In periods of growth we must put away savings for the downturns. But far from saving, the previous Government kept racheting up our debts-spending money it didn't have. Our predecessors had Australia on a path of deficit and debt to the next century. Make no mistake, this path would only make future choices harder, future possibilities bleaker and rob Australians of the future opportunities they deserve. Our Government could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it. The measures I announce tonight will reduce the underlying deficit by around $4 billion this year and $7.2 billion over two years. These measures will balance the budget over the term of this Parliament. These are the net effect on the budget bottom line after the introduction of new policy to meet the Coalition's election commitments. These measures represent a historic turnaround in Commonwealth finances. In 1997-98, outlays will have fallen around 1.8 per cent of GDP, while revenues will have risen only 0.2 per cent of GDP. The budget repair will be achieved principally through expenditure savings with a contribution from reduced tax expenditures and measures to curb tax avoidance. Importantly, Mr Speaker, there is no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rates and no lift in the petrol excise. There are measures to tighten eligibility and clamp down on misuse, but the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme remains. Mr Speaker, you don't tum around a nation's finances, a nation's future without making some hard decisions. But if we avoid the hard decisions now they are only going to get harder in the future. The tightening measures have to be fairly shared. We cannot expect those who rely on pensions and allowances-low income earners-to bear the cost. So we are asking high income earners to make a contribution and business to make its contribution too. The measures are balanced, strong and fair. NA Before its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth was nearly $10 billion to the contrary. Financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. We will ensure it never occurs again. Our Government will enact a Charter of Budget Honesty that will require the government of the day-ours or any other-to publish a budget update signed off by the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each Federal Election campaign. The public will be given updated financial information before the election, not after it. The public will know the state of the books before they vote. The Charter will require any future government to set out its fiscal strategy and report against it-just as this Government is doing. The Charter will entrench this Government's commitment to responsible and accountable fiscal policy. NA Mr Speaker, as I said earlier, the major fiscal turnaround in this year's Budget has been achieved while honouring our election commitments. We have met the cost of those commitments as we said we would during the election campaign. And our central commitment was to look after families. NA From 1 January 1997 the Government's Family Tax Initiative will provide significant tax relief for almost 2 million low and middle income families. An eligible parent will receive a $1,000 increase in the income tax free threshold for each dependent child. A single income family, with at least one child under the age of 5 years, will receive a further $2,500 increase in the tax free threshold. For a one income family with two children, one of whom is under the age of 5, this will deliver an extra $34 a fortnight. Taxpayers will be able to access the Family Tax Initiative through the PA YE and provisional tax systems or make a claim on assessment. Equivalent fortnightly cash assistance, to be called the Family Tax Payment, will be available as an alternative for low income families. NA And our commitment to families doesn't stop there. The Government will implement major improvements to Australia's health care system. Medicare will remain, bulk billing is unchanged. But people will be given greater choice to take out private health insurance. This will stem the declining rate of health insurance and secure the funding of our health system. From 1 July 1997 we will be providing income-tested rebates for the cost of private health insurance. Eligible families will receive up to $450 a year. These incentives, together with the Family Tax Initiative, will make a qualifying single income family with two young children better off by more than $50 a fortnight. For couples the rebate on health insurance will be up to $250 a year. For singles the rebate will be up to $125 a year. Mr Speaker, higher income earners who can afford to take out private health also be encouraged to do so. There will be a 1 per cent Medicare levy surcharge for couples with combined incomes of over $100 000 (individuals with incomes over $50 000) who do not take out health cover. This is the levy which the Government hopes no-one will pay. It is entirely optional. Those who take out health insurance (with the benefits attached) will be exempt. The Commonwealth Government's role in protecting the health of Australian families has been significantly boosted in this Budget which delivers all the public health commitments of the Government. It introduces a range of new measures, including for childhood immunisation and diabetes. It honours commitments in crucial areas such as women's health and the prevention of youth suicide. NA Mr Speaker, I wish to underline the Government's commitment to older Australians. Tonight's Budget demonstrates this by continuing twice yearly indexation of the pension and making financial provision to maintain the age pension at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings across the forward estimates. This will ensure that the living standards of those who receive a full or part rate pension keep pace with community standards. Mr Speaker, there is another group of older Australians who have saved for their own retirement, have low incomes and pay tax at a much lower threshold than those on the pension. The Government will provide this group of self-funded retirees with the same tax rebate as the pensioner rebate, in two stages, commencing with a half rebate for 1996-97. Those low income aged people who qualify for the rebate will receive their full rebate for the 1997-98 income year taking a qualifying single person's tax free threshold from $5 400 insurance will to $11 185. And older Australians who take out private health insurance will receive a $250 rebate for couples under our health reform package. NA Mr Speaker, the Government is committed to helping small business. It has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to 6 per cent so that small business no longer is assessed for provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned. This will deliver $180 million back to provisional taxpayers in 1996-97. The Government also has legislation in the Parliament to remove the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. From 1 July 1997 capital gains tax rollover relief will allow small businesses to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincentives. This relief from CGT is designed to allow small businesses grow bigger. Many small business proprietors plough all their savings into their business which is both their livelihood and their retirement savings plan. Recognising this, the Government will allow individuals to claim an exemption from CGT, up to a maximum capital gain of $500 000 on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement. We will also be meeting our commitment to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes, in order to encourage voluntary saving and a sense of employee participation in Australian business. NA Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget will directly help regional Australia. As promised during the election campaign, the Government will increase assistance to isolated students. From 1 January 1997 the Primary and Secondary Correspondence Allowances under the Assistance to Isolated Children Programme will be increased by $1 000 per annum and $1 500 per annum respectively. At the same time, the non-means tested basic boarding allowance under the Programme will be increased to 55 per cent of average boarding fees. In accordance with our election commitment, budget funding for National Highways and Roads of National Importance will enable us to provide $75 million per annum for the next 10 years on a dollar for dollar basis with New South Wales and Queensland to upgrade the Pacific Highway. The Budget provides $36 million in real terms in each of the years 1996-97 to 19992000 for the Road Safety Black Spots Programme in accordance with our election commitment. This initiative will reduce the number of fatal and serious injury road crashes and so reduce the social and economic costs of road trauma. Consistent with its election commitment, the Government will provide an exemption from fringe benefits tax on remote area housing for employees in the primary production sector. NA The Government also made clear during the election campaign that one of its central priorities is tackling youth unemployment. The budget strategy for sustained growth is about creating real job opportunities in which youth can share. Young people are looking for real training leading to real jobs. Apprenticeships have long been a route for young Australians to get quality jobs, but in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the workforce was at its lowest level in 3 decades. The Government has therefore allocated $207 million over the next four years towards implementing the Modem Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship Scheme (MAATS). This will bring Commonwealth expenditure on apprenticeships and traineeships to over $1. 7 billion over the next 4 years. MAATS will be a business led system. Employers will only pay for the time the trainee or apprentice spends in productive work. The package includes a wage top-up scheme for apprentices and trainees employed under workplace or certified agreements to increase amounts of quality training while receiving a minimum National Training Wage weekly income. NA This Budget provides an additional $158 million over 4 years for environment related initiatives on top of the planned Natural Heritage Trust. When established, the Natural Heritage Trust with over $1 billion will finance the largest environment protection and restoration program in Australia's history. The establishment of this Trust will go ahead when the partial sale of Telstra is completed. More detail on this is contained in the Environment Minister's statement, Investing in Our Natural Heritage. During the election campaign, the Coalition promised to expedite the implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement. This Budget meets this commitment by providing $49 million over 3 years to accelerate Regional Forest Assessments in 13 forest areas. In addition, the Government will provide $42 million over the next 3 years to establish the Green Corps. The Green Corps will be open to young Australians aged 17 to 20 to demonstrate their commitment to the environment by working on projects to preserve and restore Australia's natural environment and cultural heritage. The projects will also contribute to their career and employment prospects through training, skills development, work experience and personal development. I am pleased to confirm tonight that the Government will honour its commitment to restore the CSIRO's baseline funding. The Government will provide an additional $115 million over the next 4 years to the CSIRO. This more than meets our commitment to provide $60 million over the triennium. The Government has also decided to maintain the Commonwealth's commitment to Cooperative Research Centres, funding for which in 1996-97 is expected to be $11 million higher than in 1995-96. We will also meet our commitment to increase funding for higher education research infrastructure and post-graduate scholarships. This will cost $135 million over the next 4 years. NA Revenue is expected to increase by 4 per cent in real terms in the Budget year and to remain at around 25 per cent of GDP in the outyears. In keeping with our stated position during the election campaign, I announce tonight a major effort to improve tax compliance. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will be provided with additional funds in 1996-97 and 1997-98 to establish a special high level task force to improve the compliance of high wealth individuals with our income tax laws. Enhanced investigation activity and analysis will allow a greater understanding of the complex arrangements used by some high wealth individuals to minimise tax, and to progressively develop administrative and legislative proposals to deal with these arrangements and others that may be put in place in the future. The revenue at risk from aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements used by some high wealth individuals has been estimated at $800 million a year. The timing of recovery and the amounts will depend on the outcome of these ATO investigations and it is expected that future budgets will include additional revenue for years beyond 1997-98. However, it is expected that early improvements in compliance, both voluntarily and through enforcement of existing law alone, will generate revenue in the order of $100 million in 1997-98. I am also announcing tonight a series of measures to prevent tax avoidance and safeguard the revenue base. From tonight, the general anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law-Part IV A-will be extended so that they can apply to Australia's withholding tax regime. Other amendments to the withholding tax provisions will further assist in preventing tax avoidance. These measures do not signal any change in the Government's policy regarding withholding taxes. Measures will also be proposed to prevent tax avoidance through the use of distributions by charitable trusts to overseas organisations. The Government will release an exposure draft of the legislation as a priority, and will undertake consultations before introducing the legislation into the Parliament to ensure that bona fide charitable organisations are not detrimentally affected. The Government will limit, with immediate effect, excessive tax benefits obtained through luxury car leases. In order to reduce serious evasion of sales tax, a change in the means of paying tax on computers will be introduced following consultation with industry. In an effort to ensure that all areas of government expenditure deliver intended outcomes, the Government will be examining the effectiveness of concessional taxation treatments. In many cases, the replacement of tax concessions with outlays programs will ensure that the community and the direct beneficiaries of the programs get better value for their tax dollar. Mr Speaker, on 23 July I announced several measures to limit abuse of the R&D tax concession. Tonight I announce that the R&D tax concession will be reduced to a top rate of 125 per cent. At a top rate of 125 per cent, the R&D tax incentive remains among the most concessional in the OECD and compares more than favourably with concessions provided by our regional neighbours, including Singapore and Malaysia. Following consultations with industry and researchers, the Government will establish a new program-the Strategic Assistance for Research and Development program. Under the program, the Government will provide a flexible package of assistance of $340 million over the next 4 years to encourage highly innovative research and development with emphasis on projects that have support for commercialisation from the private sector. This will allow government assistance to be better targeted and assist projects not able to adequately utilise the tax concession. NA Mr Speaker, given the magnitude of its fiscal task, the Government has had to ensure that government expenditure is targeted to those in need and delivered efficiently and effectively. While maintaining a strong and secure safety net, the Government will introduce a range of initiatives to better target income assistance, including strengthening the activity test for Job Search and Newstart Allowances and improving fraud detection and debt recovery. They will produce savings of $2.6 billion over the next 4 years. The Government has also had to look at those expenditure areas that are growing the fastest year on year and keep the rate of growth to manageable proportions. The Government will work with the pathology industry to slow the unsustainable growth in pathology outlays under the Medical Benefits Scheme. With reforms to diagnostic imaging, these will save $586 million over 4 years. The maximum co-payment for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will increase to $20 from 1 January 1997, saving $180 million over 4 years. At the same time the maximum co-payment for concessional patients will increase from $2.70 to $3.20, saving $324 million over 4 years. As waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth Dental program will cease from 1 January 1997, saving $399 million over 4 years. From 1997 the States will again be responsible for these services. This Budget initiates a program of structural reform of residential aged care to address major flaws in the existing system. This will unify the hostel and nursing home systems and save $479 million over 4 years. Tonight's Budget also addresses the imbalance in funding between providers of centre based child care services by removing the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. At the same time, the Government will provide an additional $10 million a year in real terms from 1997-98 for children with additional needs to be accommodated in services. The Government is announcing in this Budget the most significant reorganisation of labour market assistance arrangements since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) in 1946. Labour market programs will be radically refocused on getting the unemployed into lasting jobs. Assistance will now be tailored to the needs of individual jobseekers and the impediments they face in getting a job rather than being program driven. A competitive market will be established to provide employment placement services for eligible jobseekers. Mr Speaker, the Government's fiscal consolidation strategy will improve the business and interest rate environment in Australia. In return, industry must also play its part in fiscal tightening. Industry assistance programmes, like other programmes, need to be evaluated to assess their effectiveness and their priority. In line with the introduction of user charging generally, cost recovery will be introduced for elements of customs processing of import transactions. A number of low priority business service programmes have been abolished including the Australian Manufacturing Council, the Support for Asia Infrastructure Consortia and the Information Technology Development Programme. The Government has also acted to rationalise and focus export assistance. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme (EMDGS) will be retained but capped at $150 million per annum, while its operations will be rationalised and targeted to small and medium size firms. Mr Speaker, in its efforts to reduce spending the Government has not overlooked the cost of delivering its own programmes. As well as cutting departmental running costs, savings of $727 million over 4 years will be made from the application of an Efficiency Dividend to Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and also to Specific Purpose Payments to the States. The Government will also introduce a property strategy which is expected to result in savings of $731 million over the next 4 years. The Government also expects to secure oneoff savings of around $300 million in 1996-97 by reducing the levels of cash and financial investments currently held by some statutory authorities. NA Superannuation is central to encouraging self-provision for retirement. It is central to coping with an ageing population and is an important vehicle for national saving. The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer. A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners. The Government is remedying this situation. From tonight, a surcharge of 15 per cent will apply to future employer superannuation contributions for those whose income (including deductible superannuation contributions) is at or above $85 000. The surcharge will phase in over the income range $70 000 to $85 000. It will apply to defined benefit and unfunded schemes, including members of parliament. For superannuation contributors with such incomes below $70 000 per annum, there will be no change whatsoever. There is no change to any person's accrued benefit. For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners. To further enhance the fairness of superannuation, the Government is introducing a range of reforms designed to improve the access of particular groups to superannuation. The Government will provide an 18 per cent rebate for up to $3 000 of contributions made by a person on behalf of his or her low income spouse. This will be of particular benefit to women outside the paid work force who are currently denied access to their own superannuation plan. The Government will also extend from 65 to 70 years the age limit up to which those in the work force can make superannuation contributions. This will address the current discrimination against older Australians who are still in employment. To enhance competition and choice in superannuation, the Government will introduce Retirement Savings Accounts. These will be a simple, low cost, superannuation product. The Government will maintain the Superannuation Guarantee at the levels and time frame currently legislated. However, the Superannuation Guarantee threshold, at $450 a month, is too low. People on very low incomes are being forced into superannuation which is unlikely to provide a retirement income when their pressing need is to maintain current living standards. The Government will allow employees with incomes between $450 and $900 a month to choose between Superannuation Guarantee contributions or the equivalent as wages and salary. Mr Speaker, in 1992 the previous Government legislated tax cuts into L.A.W which have never been paid. In last year's Budget it was claimed they would be paid into superannuation between 1998 and 2000 for employees paying 1 to 3 per cent of their take home pay into superannuation. Our Government will encourage employees to make these superannuation contributions from their take home pay and has made provision in the forward estimates for the cocontribution. But the Government will review the mechanism for the delivery of the L.A.W tax cuts to ensure they are paid in an equitable and effective way. They will be paid into superannuation or like savings vehicles. Mr Speaker, these changes will provide a much fairer superannuation system and one which more readily meets the differing circumstances of individual Australians. NA Mr Speaker, the Australian economy has been growing for 5 years since the recession of the early 1990s, but there has been little no progress in boosting saving or reducing unemployment. The policies of the former Government have given Australians: continuing high unemployment; it has not been below 8 per cent since late 1990; and a national saving problem where the average current account deficit has doubled as a share of GDP since the beginning of the 1980s. The Government inherited an economy beset with long-standing and deep-rooted problems that must be addressed now if economic growth and improved living standards are to be sustained in the years to come. Fiscal consolidation and labour market reform are critical to achieving lower unemployment and improved living standards. It will take concerted effort to reap the benefits of these reforms. But to do nothing would exacerbate our difficulties. Fortunately the world economy is continuing to move ahead, with Japan, our largest trading partner, on the road to recovery. Our GDP is forecast to grow by 3Y2 per cent in 1996-97 and inflation by less than 3 per cent. Consistent with a positive outlook, business investment is expected to rise by around 14 per cent, boosting demand, which is expected to grow by over 4 per cent. After a long period in the doldrums, investment in housing is expected to begin to recover during 1996-97. Notwithstanding the savings measures announced in the Budget, public sector demand is forecast to strengthen in 1996-97. The farm sector is expected to grow at a solid rate, following the recovery last year from the drought. The continuing strong growth in our major trading partners will result in another year of very strong export growth. Imports will pick up in line with the strengthening in domestic demand and the rapid growth in highly import intensive areas of investment. Because of solid investment the current account deficit is expected to show only a or modest improvement in 1996-97, and at 4 per cent of GDP remains high, reflecting the structural weakness that our fiscal consolidation programme is designed to address over time. Employment should grow by around 2 per cent in the year to June 1997 and the unemployment rate should decline, albeit only slowly. NA Mr Speaker, the Budget. I have brought down tonight is one of reform. It changes the conduct of fiscal policy in this country and delivers imaginative reforms to a wide range of government programmes. The major fiscal turnaround in this year's Budget will enable Australia to sustain higher rates of growth in incomes and employment, without putting pressure on the current account deficit and interest rates. By decisively addressing the Commonwealth budget's drain on national saving it represents an investment in Australia's future. million. A future that offers sustainable growth, more jobs and higher living standards. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. BUDGET PAPERS 1996-97",61

(3) Has the Sri Lankan domestic conflict been an issue for Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings; if not, will Australia raise it at future meetings. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government believes that there is an urgent need for a peaceful resolution of this tragic conflict so as to protect civilians throughout Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnic identity. The conflict is primarily one for the players in Sri Lanka to resolve but we are taking every opportunity in our ongoing contacts with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage progress towards a negotiated resolution. (2) Australia is already providing substantial emergency humanitarian assistance to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict in northern Sri Lanka. This assistance is delivered through the ICRC and other non-governmental organisations. In April 1996. Australia shipped 2 000 tonnes of wheat to Sri Lanka to assist with food shortages caused by conflict and drought and in May. Australia provided A$1 million to UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres to assist victims of the conflict. Given ongoing hostilities and the unpredicBrooks table nature of the conflict the Government does not consider it would be desirable for a delegation to visit the North or East of the country at this time. A parliamentary delegation visited Sri Lanka in October 1995 and held discussions on a range of issues including the ethnic conflict and Australian development assistance. (3) The fact that this issue was not addressed at the most recent CHooM. in Auckland last year. was criticised by me at that time. Australia will look closely at the possibility of a role that an impartial body such as the Commonwealth might play in assisting a peace process in Sri Lanka. The Australian Government would see value in third party mediation in the conflict particularly through the Commonwealth. provided that international mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTIE. and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations on substantive issues. MS Freeway (Question No. 37) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice. on 1 May 1996: (1) What funding priority has his Department given to the (a) proposed on and off ramps south of Brooks Road on the M5 freeway at Ingleburn. NSW. and (b) widening of the M5 to 6 lanes between Brooks Road and Camden Valley Way to ease peak hour congestion and the accident rate. (2) What discussions has his Department held with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority on each project. (3) When will each project commence. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Access ramps south of Brooks Road on the F5 freeway at Ingleburn are being considered for funding under the National Highway program in the context of funding allocations for the next three years. (1) (b) Widening of the F5 to six lanes between Brooks Road and Camden Valley Way is not yet considered warranted. (2) The Department has discussed the issue of additional ramps south of Brooks Road on the F5 freeway with the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (RTA) with a view to a possible joint funding proposal between the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government. relevant councils and private sector developers. Discussions with the RT A have established that the existing 4-lane capacity of the F5 between Road and Camden Valley Way is adequate for traffic movements at present but its widening to 6 lanes needs to be kept under review. Delays during peak periods can be experienced northbound due to a combination of high traffic volumes on the Highway and the weaving movement caused by the large number of trucks entering at Brooks Road which has then to cross the traffic exiting at the Camden Valley Way interchange. Some improvement in these conditions is anticipated in 1996/97 when the State Government funds construction of an eastbound off load ramp from the M5 to the Hume Highway at Casula as an alternative to the exit at Camden Valley Way. The weaving movement will be reduced by northbound traffic continuing on to the proposed new ramp in lieu of exiting at the Camden Valley Way. (3) These projects will commence when the issues detailed above have been resolved. Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Question No. 72) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) Did Australia on 19 September 1984 become the 70th party to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague. 1954). (2) Did Australia on 13 November 1995 attend the second meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention. (3) Did the meeting invite all the parties to the convention to submit written proposals for the improvement of the convention by 1 September 1996; if so. (a) which Commonwealth and State departments are preparing written proposals and (b) will he present the proposals to Parliament. (4) Which parties to the 1954 Convention are not parties to the Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 1954). (5) Did Australia in July 1994 assure the USA that it was still considering whether to become a party to the protocol and that the matter was being reviewed by relevant Commonwealth and State departments. (6) Which Commonwealth and State departments have been reviewing the matter and with what outcome. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (a) Relevant government agencies are giving consideration to this request. (b) The normal considerations of the treatymaking process would apply to any formal proposals for the amendment of the Convention, including in relation to Parliamentary involvement and consultation of stakeholders. (4) The following parties to the 1954 Convention are not parties to the Protocol: Argentina, Australia, Cote d'Ivoire, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Tanzania. (5) Yes. (6) The Commonwealth Departments of Communications and the Arts, Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attomey-General's Department are continuing to keep the issue of whether Australia should become a party under review, within the constraints of available resources and other priorities. Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (Question No. 73) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) Was Australia among the 70 states which participated in the Diplomatic Conference in Rome from 7 to 24 June 1995 which adopted the Unidroit Convention on Stolen or lllegally Exported Cultural Objects. (2) Did Dr Rosalie Balkin of Australia chair the committee which drafted the convention. (3) Did Australia vote in favour of adopting the convention. (4) Has Australia signed the convention; if not, what is the timetable for doing so. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Dr Rosalie Balkin chaired the Drafting Committee of the Diplomatic Conference. (3) Yes. (4) Australia has not signed the Convention, nor has it established a timetable for doing so. Before any decision can take place, inter-agency consideration at Commonwealth level will be required, together with consultations with State and Territory Governments, collecting institutions and other stakeholders. Botany Bay Foreshores Reclamation (Question No. 93) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 May 1996: Has the Commonwealth funded reclamation work to the foreshores of Botany Bay at Kyeemagh, Brighton-Le-Sands, Monterey, Ramsgate, Sans Souci and Dolls Point in the electoral division of Barton since the parallel north-south runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was extended into Botany Bay; if so, what (a) works have been, and are being, carried out, (b) has been the cost of the works to the date of answering this question, (c) is the estimated cost of works yet to be undertaken and (d) is the anticipated date of completion of the works. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has agreed to partially fund the reclamation works for stabilisation of the southern part of Lady Robinsons Beach.  represents 21 % of the estimated total project cost for the stabilisation works to be carried out at the southern part of Lady Robinsons Beach. This is the proportion of the damage to that part of the beach which the then Sydney Ports Authority estimated in a 1993 study is attributable to the original north-south runway and the new parallel runway. The Ports Authority study similarly estimated that a further 26% of the potential beach erosion was attributable to dredging and reclamation associated with Port Botany. The study also estimated that the remaining 53% of the erosion would have occurred in the absence of any major works in the Bay. The Office of Marine Safety and Strategy and the State Department of Land and Water Conservation are respectively funding these proportions of the total costs of the stabilisation works. (a) No physical work has been carried out so far. The proposed stabilisation works for the southern part of the beach will include sand nourishment and the construction of 8 groynes.  $45,107.45 to the Sydney Ports Corporation as its share for the design and documentation works relevant to the stabilisation of Lady Robinsons Beach. In addition, the FAC spent approximately $40,000 for the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement for this project. (c) The total estimated cost of the project for the southern portion of Lady Robinsons Beach is $3.3M. The expected cost of stabilisation works on the northern part of the beach will not be known until finalisation of a study currently underway to develop recommendations on stabilisation options. The study is expected to be completed in July  the stabilisation works on this part of the beach. (d) The expected date of completion of the works on the southern part of the beach is November 1996. However, this date of completion is dependent on the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning granting the required approval in the near future. St George Hospital Emergency (Question No. 98) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 May 1996: (1) What emergency procedures have been arranged for the use of St George Hospital at Kogarah, NSW, in the event of an aircraft crash at or near Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) When was a trial emergency procedure last conducted for the eventuality referred to in part (1). (3) Which organisations were involved in the trial. Exercise Uninjured Exercise Eagle NSW Police NSW Police NSW Dept of Health NSW Dept of Health NSW Ambulance Service NSW Ambulance Service St George Hospital NSW Fire Brigade Dept of Community Services St George Hospital (4) Have revised procedures been developed since the re-opening of the east-west runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (5) When will the next trial emergency procedure be conducted. (6) Which organisations will be involved. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has provided the following information: (1) In the event of a major emergency at or in the vicinity of Sydney Airport, the NSW Medical Emergency Plan will be activated: this is a subplan of the NSW Disaster Plan (DISPLAN). Under the plan, the NSW Department of Health will arrange for casualties to be sent to hospitals around Sydney, including the St George Hospital. The decision on which hospital is chosen for individual casualties will be based on bed availability, the nature of the injury and the urgency of treatment. This decision will be made by medical personnel at the emergency site. St George Hospital and other nearby hospitals will also each provide an emergency medical team to attend the airport to triage and treat the injured prior to transportation to hospital. Each hospital only provides a single team so as not to strip the hospital of emergency staff and the number of teams will depend on the number of casualties involved in the emergency. A rough rule of thumb is one team per 40 casualties. (2) The most recent field tests of emergency Procedures procedures at Sydney Airport were: Exercise Uninjured on 20 July 1995 (a test of the subplan on care of uninjured passengers and the care of relatives of those involved in the emergency) Exercise Eagle on 25 September 1995 (a test of the rescue and evacuation of casualties) from a crash on airport. Monthly tabletop exercises are also held: the last tabletop exercise was 17 April 1996 (a test of the response to a crash on airport). There are also two tests of the emergency evacuation procedures for the international terminal each year. The last test was on 23 May 1996. (3) Participants in the last exercises included: Table Top NSW Police NSW Ambulance Service NSW Fire Brigade Airservices Australia Ansett Exercise Uninjured Salvation Army Australian Protective Services Airservices Australia Ansett Qantas State Emergency Services FAC Staff It should be noted that hospital participation is for the medical team despatched to the airport, participation staff. No simulated casualties are sent to the hospital. (4) The Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) is under continual review to ensure that the plan is effective. The east west runway was previously still used when weather conditions required it: therefore the AEP was never altered to eliminate operations on this runway. The change to more frequent use of the runway makes no difference to the AEP. (5) The next emergency exercises planned for Sydney Airport are: Tabletop on 5 June 1996 Field test on the Care of Uninjured Subplan on 19 June 1996 Field test on AEP for a Crash on Airport on 18 September 1996. (6) It is expected that participation will be  currently in the process of finalising details of actual participation by organisations for the field exercise in June. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Safety (Question No. 99) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 May 1996: (1) What air safety incidents have occurred or been reported about air traffic at or over Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport since the east-west runway was re-opened. (2) On how many occasions has the 11 p.m -6 am. curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport been breached since the east-west runway was reopened. (3) At what time and on what date did each incident referred to in part (2) occur. (4) Was permission given for each breach to occur; if so, in each case, what circumstances were involved. (5) Will he present a monthly report to Parliament on air safety incidents and curfew breaches at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Exercise Eagle Table Top Australian Protective Services State Emergency Services Airservices Australia FAC Staff State Emergency Services FAC Staff not extensive due to commitments to patient care: except is usually by trainee nursing and medical Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From the re-opening of the east-west runway on 3 April 1996 until 3 May 1996, 33 safety incident reports have been received involving air traffic at or over Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. According to Airservices Australia, two of these reports relate to operations involving the east-west runway: on 14 April 1995, a Piper Navajo crossed the east-west runway without a clearance. The eastwest runway was not active at the time; on 30 April 1996, a Qantas B737 was sent around while. on approach to the east-west runway because internal procedures for transfer of runway ownership between air traffic controllers in the Tower had not been completed following a runway change during a busy traffic period. (2), (3) and (4) Nil. However, two possible cases Incidents of failure to report the use of reverse thrust are under investigation (the use of reverse thrust is not a curfew violation but failure to report the use of reverse thrust is an offence). (5) A report giving details of curfew movements, including advice on any movements which are under investigation for possible breach of the curfew, is prepared each month by Airservices Australia. These reports are public documents. They have, for a number of years, been distributed to the Airport's consultative body on a regular basis. These reports will be given to the Sydney Airport Community Forum once it is established. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) prepares a weekly summary of air safety occurrences covering all of Australia including operations at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. This information is disseminated to the Department,· the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. This summary is available on request from BASI. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: (Question No. 101) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 May 1996: (1) What was the total number of departures from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on each of the three runways between the re-opening of the east-west runway and the date of answering this question. (2) How many departures referred to in part (1) from each runway have used air space over the electoral division of Barton. (3) How many departures referred to in part (2) would have proceeded over Botany Bay if the eastwest runway had not re-opened. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has provided the following advice: (1) For the period 3 April 1996 to 3 May 1996, the total number of departures and the runways used by those departing aircraft are as follows: Runway 07-381 departures Runway 25-272 departures Runway 16L--2830 departures Runway 16R-6142 departures Runway 34L--1751 departures Runway 34R-O departures (2) It would be reasonable to assume that all aircraft departing to the West from the East-west runway 25 flew over the electorate of Barton. (3) All of the departing aircraft referred to in (2), may have otherwise departed from runway 34L (over the northern suburbs) or runways 16L or 16R (over Botany Bay) depending on headwind and/or tailwind component at the particular time of their departure. World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement (Question No. 110) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 6 May 1996: (1) How many signatories are there to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement. (2) Is he able to say how many states of the USA are covered by the agreement. (3) Have any signatories to the agreement requested exclusions; if so, in each case, what Departures exclusions. (4) Will Australian industry development programs be affected by the operation of the agreement; if so, which programs. (5) What progress has been made in assessing the potential impact of the agreement upon Australia with respect to equal employment opportunity, occupational health and safety and environmental stipulations in purchasing. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were 22 signatories to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement as at February 1996. These were: Canada, the United States, Japan, the 15 member states of the European Union, the Republic of Korea, Israel, Switzerland and Norway. Singapore, Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of the Netherlands with respect to Aruba have applied for membership. Chinese Taipei has applied to accede in the context of its WTO accession negotiations. (2) The agreement covers thirty-seven (37) states of the United States as well as the Federal government. A list of entities in the states which procure in accordance with the provisions of the agreement appears in WTO document, WTILet/57 of 19 January 1996. (3) Yes. No signatory has offered 100 per cent of its government procurement for coverage under the agreement. In most cases, signatories have adopted a positive list approach in nominating the entities and sectors covered. The Annexes to the agreement provide details of the coverage agreed for each signatory in terms of purchasing entities, goods and services. Annex I lists central government entities and sets out any qualifications that have been placed on coverage of goods procurepart ment by those entities. Annex 2 deals with subcentral entities, Annex 3 with government enterprises, Annex 4 lists services covered and Annex 5 lists construction services covered. The General Notes attached to each signatories' offer lists specific derogations and exceptions as well as reciprocity conditions negotiated. The annexes for each signatory and the General Notes are included in and form part of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. Amended Annexes 2 and 3 for the US and Annex I for the European Communities are provided in WTO document WTlLet/57. (4) No. The operation of the agreement does not affect Australian industry development programs as Australia is not a signatory to the agreement and is not required to join it. Should the Government decide to seek accession to the agreement, industry development programs which involve offsets as described in Article XVI and footnote 7 of the agreement could be affected. However, the Article would not have any effect outside the coverage of the agreement, for example in relation to exceptions to the agreement and exclusions or derogations negotiated by the parties. In order for a program to be affected it would need to be applied by entities nominated by Australia, involve sectors nominated for coverage and involve procurement above the stipulated threshold value applicable to the entity. No decision has been made by the Government on membership or non-membership of the agreement and no consideration has been given to the details of potential coverage at this stage. The Commonwealth's discussion paper, Australia and the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (DFATIDAS, May 1995) provides a discussion of the issue in the context of potential implications of membership of the agreement. (5) The issues of equal employment opportunity, occupational health and safety and environmental stipulations in purchasing have been examined by officials in the context of the on-going review of the implications for Australia of possible membership or continuing non-membership of the agreement. While certainty on such matters can only be achieved in a negotiation process, it is DFAT's Text: Australian Treaty Series 1994 No. 31 Participant Argentina France Georgia Jordan Korea, Republic of Monaco Nauru Saudi Arabia Slovakia assessment that accession would not affect Australia's policy flexibility in relation to these matters if their preparation, adoption or application were not with a view to or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. Article VI, and related footnotes, of the agreement are applicable in this instance. UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (Question No. 114) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 May 1996: Will he bring up-to-date the lists attached to the answer to question No. 2663 (Hansard, 20 November 1995, page 3275) concerning the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Countries which have become signatories or parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or to the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, since 20 September 1995 are set out in the tables below: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) (Montego Bay, Jamaica, 10 December 1982) Entry into force: 16 November 1994 Ratification Accession(a) Formal confirmation(c) Signature Succession(s) 1 Dec 1995 11 Apr 1996 21 Mar 1996(a) 27 Nov 1995(a) 29 Jan 1996 20 Mar 1996 23 Jan 1996 24 Apr 1996 8 May 1996 Agreement relating to the implementation of PART Provisional entry into force Text: Australian Treaty Series 1994 No. 32 Participant Signature application Argentina France Georgia Jordan Korea, Republic of Micronesia Monaco Nauru Saudi Arabia Slovakia International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (Question No. 119) Mr Brereton asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 May 1996: (1) How many countries have become parties to the UN 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

The Department of - in.ance, however, produces a quarterly report IIstmg permanent staff, by agency by location. The most recently produced report details staff numbers as at December 1995. As it is unlikely that the figures provided would vary by more than 1.5 per cent between December 1995 and 1 March 1996 (given that the entire change across the APS for the 1995 calendar year was 1.4 per cent) the answer to the honourable member's question is based on the data sourced from the Department of Finance report, with the exception of the Department of Defence. I have also included the total number of temporary staff employed by each agency as at December 1995 although the data for temporary staff is not readily available in a disaggregated form by Statefferritory.

An attempt to provide an overview ahead of the delivery of the Budget would not give a useful representation of reductions. The government's objective is to reduce the cost of government as part of a thorough and necessary overhaul of expenditure. The level of expenditure will be considered as part of our deliberations and there will be some reduction in staffing levels across the public service. The extent to which pulsory retirement. as opposed to voluntary retrenchment. may be necessary is impossible to estied mate at this time.

The actual range varies considerably depending on topography and capacity considerations and can be as low as 100-200 metres. (3)(a)-(b) I am advised that as at 15 May 1996 there were some 3827 base station facilities operating within Australia. It should be noted that as a large number of analogue and digital base station facilities are co-located, the actual number of base station sites is considerably less than 3827. Comprehensive comparable figures are not able to be provided by carriers on the breakdown into metropolitan, regional and remote areas. The Department of Communications and the Arts estimates that approximately 70% of the stations are located in metropolitan areas, 25% are located in regional areas and 5% are located in remote areas. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Report (Question No. 157) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 8 May 1996: (1) Will the Civil Aviation Safety Authority review the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the crash of a RAAF Nomad aircraft in March 1990 for its implications with respect to Nomad aircraft on the civil register. (2) How many Nomad aircraft remain on the Australian civil register in each State and Territory and what roles do they fulfil. (3) Is he able to say how many Nomad aircraft continue to operate outside Australia. (4) Have operational restrictions been imposed on Nomad aircraft with respect to weight, speed and flap settings; if so, have all domestic and international authorities been informed of the restrictions. (5) Have structural modifications of the aircraft been incorporated or planned. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice: (1) There are no known matters from the report affecting the Civil Nomad fleet that have not already been addressed. (2) There are 13 Nomad aircraft remaining on the Australian Register, as listed below. CASA does not maintain information on the role of individual Nomad aircraft. NSW-4; QLD-3; VIC-2; SA--; NT-I; ACT-; WA-3; TAS-. (3) Information provided by AST A Defence indicates that there are currently 81 Nomad aircraft operating outside Australia. (4) Yes, an Airworthiness Directive (reference AD/OAF N22/69 Amendment No.2) issued by the then Civil Aviation Authority imposes flap setting, weight, and speed restrictions. All Australian operators have been advised and are required to comply with the Airworthiness Directive. The regulatory authorities of countries where the Nomad is known to be operated have been informed, as is the usual practice. (5) Various structural modifications have been incorporated into the Nomad aircraft, these being determined necessary by the manufacturer, and mandated by Airworthiness Directives. Review It has not yet been determined if a structural modification is required as terminating action for AD/OAF N22/69 Arndt 2. This will be determined on completion of AST A Defence investigations regarding wind tunnel and flight test programs on (1) loads on ailerons and (2) flutter characteristics of aileron/wings. Pending the outcome of the tests, a strengthening modification may be required of the aileron. This also would entail static structural test/analysis of the new modified aileron and an evaluation of the flutter characteristics of the modified aileron.

A Canadian Challenger and a Piper PA28 aircraft collided at the intersection of both runways during their landing rolls. Both aircraft suffered substantial damage. There were no injuries. The remaining occurrences were categorised by the Bureau into one hundred and six category four occurrences and one hundred and fifty one category five occurrences. Category four occurrences are occurrences where the facts as revealed by the reported circumstances suggested neither a concern for public safety nor a serious safety deficiency. Category five occurrences are occurrences where the facts as revealed by the circumstances clearly indicate no need for safety action by the Bureau. (2) There were four occurrences where pilots mistook Essendon Airport for Tullamarine Airport and two occurrences where pilots mistook Tullamarine Airport for Essendon Airport. (3) According to the Federal Airports Corporation, aircraft movements were as follows: 1990--72103; 1991--65200; 1992--57506; 1993--71101; 1994--60102; 1995--58386 (4) According to the Federal Airports Corporation, operating costs were as follows: 1990---$4.038 million 1991--$5.491 million (over 15 months due to financial year changing from 1 April to 1 July) 1992--$5.444 million 1993--$5.262 million 1994--$5.260 million 1995--$4.974 million Classes on mainland DL BL 500 600 700 800 830 CK DA GM 930 NJ Classes in Tasmania y Z ZA ZB ZC ZR 1300 Australian National Railways Commission: Locomotives (Question No. 224) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: For each type of locomotive owned or leased by Australian National, (a) how many locomotives are (i) owned and (ii) leased, (b) what is the value of the locomotives if sold (i) on the market or (ii) for scrap, (c) how many locomotives are in active use, (d) what activity are they employed. in, (e) where are those not in active use stored, (0 how many locomotives not in active use are stored at each location and (g) what is the intended future use of the inactive locomotives. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)(i) The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has advised that it owns the following locomotives: Number in active use Number not in active use 14 10 6 9 3 5 24 5 6 12 13 1 7 6 Number in active use Number not in active use 2 2 4 6 10 3 12 9 1 4 (a)(ii) AN has advised that it leases the following locomotives: Class Number AN lO EL 14 CLF 7 CLP lO ALF 8 BU 4 (b)(i) Valuers have been engaged to value assets, including locomotives, nominated for transfer from AN and the State rail systems to the National Rail Corporation (NR). The valuers have advised that they could find no evidence of any arm's length transaction of used interstate freight locomotives less than 20 to 25 years old in Australia other than for scrap. Since there is no market for these locomotives, it is not possible to say what their market value might be. (b)(ii) The approximate scrap values for the AN locomotives based on information in the valuers' report are: AN class-$42,OOO; EL class-$40,500; DL class-$40,500; BL class-$40,500 (c) Locomotives in active use are detailed under (a)(i). (d) AN has advised that the locomotives are used for longhaul interstate freight, shorthaul intrastate freight, and shunting. (e) and (f) AN has advised that locomotives not in active use are stored as follows: Islington-lO; Dry Creek-7; Port Augusta-12; Launceston-18; Port Dock-I; Mt Barker-l (g) AN has advised that most of the inactive locomotives have had catastrophic failures or are considered uneconomic to repair. They are being kept for spare parts and will eventually be scrapped. National Rail Corporation: Locomotives (Question No. 225) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: For each type oflocomotive owned or leased by the National Rail Corporation, (a) how many locomotives are (i) owned and (ii) leased, (b) what is the value of the locomotives if sold (i) on the market or (ii) for scrap, (c) how many locomotives are in active use, (d) what activity are they employed in, (e) where are those not in active use stored, (f) how many locomotives not in active use are stored in each location and (g) what is the intended future use of the inactive locomotives. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) The National Rail Corporation (NR) has advised that it owns no locomotives. (a)(ii) NR has advised that the number varies from day to day. Some 200 locomotives are normally in use by NR on hire from the Australian National Railways Commission (AN), the NSW and Victorian rail systems and private firms. For example, on 31 May 1996, locomotives available for long term NR use were: from AN: lOxAN class, lOxBL class, 14xDL class and 14xEL class; from NSW: 13x81 class, 19x422 class, 48x80 class, 16x82 class and 4x48 class; from Victoria: 7xG class, lOxC class, 4xX class and 2xT class; from Silverton Tramway: 4x48 class, and 2x442 class (ex NSW); and from Great Northern Railway: 2xT class (ex Victoria). NR hires additional locomotives to meet peaks in demand. Currently, a further lOx82 class locomotives are on short term hire from NSW and AN provides locomotives equivalent on average to about 25,000hp per day for this purpose. NSW also provides 86 class electric locomotives as required for trains on electrified lines. (b)(i) Valuers have been engaged to value assets, including locomotives, nominated for transfer from AN and the State rail systems to NR. The valuers have advised that they could find no evidence of any arm's length transaction of used interstate freight locomotives less than 20 to 25 years old in Australia other than for scrap. Since neither these locomotives, nor any like them, have been traded, it is not possible to say what their market value might be. (b)(ii) It would not be appropriate for me to provide information on the value of locomotives owned by NSW or Victoria. The approximate scrap values for the AN locomotives based on the valuers' report are: AN class-$42,OOO; EL class$40,500; DL class-$40,500; BL class-$40,500; (c) to (g) NR has advised that all locomotives listed in the answer to question (a)(ii) are in use hauling or shunting interstate freight trains, and that it has no inactive locomotives. Civil Aviation Authority: Emergency Location Transmitters (Question No. 227) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) Has he issued any request or instruction to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regarding hand-held emergency location transmitters (ELTs); if so, what was the content of the request or instruction. (2) Will the Government allow hand-held ELTs to be used as a substitute for fixed ELTs under CAA Regulation 252A. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 22 March 1996, the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CAS A) provided the Minister with options for implementing the Government's policy on ELTs. Following discussions with CASA, the Minister accepted a proposal by CASA that met the requirements of the Coalition's aviation policy statement on ELTs. That policy provided for pilots to be allowed to carry approved portable ELTs as an alternative to fixed automatically activated ELTs. (2) Yes. On 5 June 1996, the Government amended Civil Aviation Regulation 252A to allow portable ELTs and portable emergency position indicating radio beacons which meet specified standards to be carried in aircraft as to fixed automatically activated ELTs. The new Regulation, which will take effect on 31 July 1997, also provides for a range of exemptions and a lengthy lead time which should assist industry in implementing the requirements. Badgerys Creek Airport: Proposed (Question No. 228) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: Will the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek be subject to a curfew; if so, over what periods. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has decided to broaden the environmental assessment process for Sydney's second major airport to include the Holsworthy Military Area as an alternative site to Badgerys Creek and to examine the possibility of reserving a site large enough for future expansion The issue of a curfew at the second airport will be examined as part of the environmental assessment process. Maritime Authorities: Unsafe Vessels Detained (Question No. 230) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) Which vessels have been detained by (a) the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, (b) State maritime agencies and (c) port authorities for safety reasons since 1 July 1993.

Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) The information sought is publicly available through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and this information has been made available to the honourable member. (b) and (c) Details regarding safety detentions of vessels by both State and Port authorities is only an alternative available from those bodies. (2)(a) to (g) The information sought is publicly available through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and this information has been made available to the honourable member. In relation to (c), (e) and (g) of the question, information is provided from March 1994, November 1993 and December 1994 respectively, when collection of the relevant details commenced. Curfew Adelaide Airport: Runway Extensions (Question No. 232) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) When will work commence on the extension of the runway at Adelaide Airport to 3100 metres. (2) What sum will the extension cost. (3) Will homes be affected by increased noise as a result of the extension; if so, (a) how many and (b) by how much. (4) Will homes need to be (a) purchased or (b) insulated; if so, in each case, (i) how many and (ii) at what cost. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable if requi;ed. member's question is as follows: (1)&(2) The runway extension is the subject of a recently completed draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which has been released for public comment. The cost and timing of the runway extension are dependent on decisions related to both the EIS and the Budget process. (3)&(4) The Adelaide International Airport Runway Extension draft Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the South Australian Department of Transport notes that the runway extension is expected to have relatively minimal impact on aircraft noise levels. It suggests that the extension of the runway closer to residences south-west of the airport may result in a relatively small increase in noise from aircraft taking off towards the north-east. It proposes that should the project proceed, further assessments be undertaken of the noise levels caused by taxiing and take-off at the south-western end of the runway and, if the changes are significant, consideration be given to means of mitigating any increases. International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty (Question No. 238) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) What action is being taken in the Minister's portfolio in relation to the goals of the International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty. (2) What programs have been initiated in 1996 to achieve the goals. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) No specific programs have been initiated in response to the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, nor were any planned by the previous Government. This Government is committed to the goals of the UN International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. This commitment was reconfirmed in a speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security at an ACFOAIACOSS seminar on the International Year on 3 June 1996. The Government believes that the single most important anti-poverty strategy is the creation of real jobs. Other priority areas are support and assistance for families with children, (and the introduction of the Family Tax Initiative is a major commitment in this area), sole parent pensioners, women, carers, the aged, homeless youth and indigenous Australians. Australia's aid program is the Government's principal contribution to the direct alleviation of poverty in developing countries. The Government is committed to helping developing countries meet the basic needs of their people and intends to strengthen the focus of the aid program on humanitarian activities with tangible benefits for the poor. All of the Department of Social Security's programs seek to alleviate poverty and disadvantage. Since receiving responsibility for coordinating domestic aspects of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty shortly before the election was called, the Department of Social Security has been active in providing information on the Year and international and local events to organisations, government departments and the public. International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty: Implementation of Goals (Question No. 242) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) What action is being taken in the Minister's portfolio area to implement the goals of the International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty amongst Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

Industrial Democracy: Australian Public (Question No. 270) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 27 May 1996: Will the Government widen the scope of industrial democracy in the Australian Public Service to allow for the participation why not. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Section 22C of the Public Service Act 1922 (PS Act) requires Secretaries of departments to develop Industrial Democracy (ID) plans in consultation with relevant staff organisations and such other persons as the Secretary considers appropriate. The PS Act does not prevent non-unionists from participating in ID committees or being ID representatives. These plans are to be designed to achieve appropriate participation by officers and employers in the decision-making process of each department. Consistent with the freedom of association principles reflected in the Government's Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Government will be reviewing the provisions in the PS Act, including those relating to employee participation, to ensure that they do not discriminate against employees for reasons relating to the exercise of a choice whether to join, or not to join, a union.

Nowergup Airport: Safety (Question No. 288) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 May 1996: Has it been established that the close proximity of RAAF Base Pearce and a general aviation airport proposed by the Western Australian Government at Nowergup, in the electoral division of Moore, will not place the safety of RAAF and civilian pilots and local residents at risk. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Western Australian Department of Transport had proposed Nowergup as a possible site for a general aviation airport in a draft report prepared in 1993. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) expressed concern to the Western Australian Department of Transport at the time concerning several airspace related issues, including potential flight safety implications. The Western Australian Director General of Transport wrote to the RAAF on 4 June 1996 advising that the Western Australian Minister for Transport had accepted his recommendation that the Nowergup site be formally withdrawn from the list of site options.

Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The number of staff positions which (a) existed and (b) were filled as at 1 March, 1996 in each of the relevant offices is indicated below. Please note that (a) relates to full-time funded positions and (b) to numbers of positions ftlled, in some instances by part-time (Pff) staff: (a) Number of Positions (b) Positions Filled (Funded: full time) (Actual staff: including Pff) 23 22 28 26 6 8 5 4 6 6 46 51 22 21 3 3 79 79 150 149 the establishment but 6 are funded for 1995/96.) are provided in answer to questions 3 and 4 below: numbers for each office are as follows: Client Number 35 60 20 15 45 220 llO 25 Office Adelaide Perth (4) The numbers of applications submitted by major are indicated hereunder as are numbers of finalisations: Applications (per day) Citizenship Residence Office Rec Fin Rec Hobart 5 3 Darwin 3 3 2* Newcastle 7 7 3* Townsville 5 4 1 Wollongong 6 5 1 Chatswood 29 25 1 Sunshine 24 28 1 Geelong 1 1 1* Adelaide 24 18 4 Perth 50 42 8 * applications per week; # applications finalised by The Rocks Office; @ applications finalised by the Cairns Office; $ applications processed by the City Office; + applications referred to other NB. Rec = Received, Fin = Finalised (5) Details of outreach services provided by each office are as follows: Hobart: Departmental officers visit ethnic community and other organisations beyond the southern areas of Tasmania on at least a monthly basis. The purposes of such visits range from attending the Launceston Migrant Resource Centre committee meetings to a range of meetings with ethnic community groups, service providers and seminars. The Department also provides a freecall 1800 telephone service. Darwin: officers visit remote and rural areas approximately ten times per year to deliver information, respond to enquiries and build a contact network to assist in service delivery. Individual appointments are arranged where clients wish to discuss personal and/or sensitive issues with staff. The Migrant Resource Centre of Central Australia, based in Alice Springs is also an important outreach service based in the community and funded through DIMA. The Department also provides a freecall 1800 telephone service in the Northern Territory. Newcastle: staff from Newcastle Office conducted outreach visits to regional centres in northern New South Wales every six months.

Townsville: the Department does not have a program of outreach services but provides funding under the Grant-in-Aid Scheme towards community development workers in Townsville, Mackay and Mt Isa. In addition, four of the Townsville Migrant Resource Centre staff are funded by the Department. All these services will remain in place following the closure of the Townsville office. Wollongong: staff from this office have participated in periodic community consultations and liaison activities as well as community activities promoting the Department's services. However, the office does not have a formal outreach service. Its catchment area is small with no client resident more than two hours drive from the office. The Rockdale and ACT regional offices provide services to clients in adjacent areas. Chats wood: the main outreach services from Chats wood have related to Compliance activities. On a quarterly basis staff have been active in employer and general community awareness, liaison with other Federal as well as State agencies and Federal parliamentarians, direct training of NSW and Federal Police and other agency staff and liaison with local media. Settlement services are not provided directly from Chatswood office. Sunshine: staff from this office have provided visiting services to Mildura in relation to migration matters and also provide services at the Maribyrnong and Braybrook on-arrival transit flats. All these services will continue to be provided by staff who will move to the Department's city office. Geelong: no outreach services have been provided from this office. Adelaide: outreach services in South Australia are largely provided not by Adelaide office direct but by community service providers such as the Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) which are funded by this Department. For example, the MRC has a project officer based in Port Augusta who also Office Hobart Darwin Newcastle Townsville Wollongong Chatswood Sunshine Geelong Adelaide Perth (7) In comparison to other DIMA offices, Newcastle office does not experience a high demand for settlement services and apart from acceptance and referral of a small number (0.9% of NSW total) of requests for Translating and Interpreting (TIS) services has no settlement responsibility. The Newcastle office does not have management responsibility for the Migrant Resource Centre in Newcastle nor for any Grants-in-Aid or other community grants. These grants are administered by the Settlement section at DIMA's Parramatta office. (8) It is the Government's objective to encourage new migrants to settle outside capital cities. Closure of smaller area offices is expected to have very little if any impact on this objective. Under the existing specific regional migration scheme, the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, nominations by employers for overseas skilled migrants are processed through the Central Office of my Department and the actual migration application processing is undertaken either at overseas posts for offshore applicants or in the State or Territory offices for onshore applicants. There are similar arrangements for processing associated with regional concessions available under the Business Skills category and with the offshore Concessional Family category. Further initiatives on regional assists communities in the region and other remote areas of the State. Grant-in-Aid services are provided in the Riverland region, Whyalla and Coober Pedy. Perth: departmental officers occasionally visit regional centres and more remote areas of the state but the majority of outreach services provided in WA are in the form of settlement services delivered by workers funded under the Grant-in-Aid program. Such services are provided in the following country areas: Karratha, South Hedland, Geraldton, Bunbury, Carnarvon, Kalgoorlie and Katanning. (6)(a) and (b) Details of annual rental and salary costs for each office are as follows: Rental Salary $ $ 135,000 993,436 209,000 1,566,000 60,000 276,510 47,000 155,000 73,000 245,518 478,000 2,118,948 110,000 840,521 26,000 137,861 347,000 3,420,000 655,000 7,060,000 migration that may arise from a review to be undertaken by a Joint CommonwealthiState!ferritory working party set up by the Ministerial Council of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ministers will similarly be adequately catered for under existing processing arrangements. The closure of small regional offices in nonmetropolitan areas, servicing relatively few clients will free up resources to enable improvements to be made in service provision across Australia. For example, resources will be channelled to support a national immigration telephone inquiry service accessible to clients anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. Most immigration services do not require face-to-face service. Those services which cannot be provided over the telephone can be provided in other more innovative ways which avoid dependence on a costly network of offices. My Department already has in place linkages with other organisations with Australia wide networks to provide a quality service. Australia Post, for example, accepts applications for Australian citizenship. The Department also funds a network of Migrant Resource Centres, a number of which are located in non metropolitan areas. These centres provide a range of information and referral services. Opportunities to extend partnership arrangements with other service providers, both government and community based, continue to be actively pursued. (9) The Department provides assistance to new migrants settling in regional Australia through its funding of an infrastructure of Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) and Grant-in-Aid (GIA) agencies which provides information and referral services to meet migrants' initial settlement needs. In Newcastle, funding provided by the Department under the MRC and GIA programs in 1995/96 will total $424,800; for Townsville the figure will be $253,100; Wollongong, $510,400; and Geelong, $320,800. There are 35.5 Grants-in-Aid and nine MRCs operating to service the needs of migrants in nonmetropolitan areas across Australia. The Department is trialling in New South Wales an innovative model for service delivery in rural areas, whereby town-based GIA workers are employed to work part-time with local mainstream services to provide a basic information/referral service for migrants. The Department's Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) operates a service which provides a national, 24 hour, 7 days a week telephone interpreting service on a national 131 telephone number for the cost of a local call. The Department also provides assistance to nonEnglish speaking migrants by way of its Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP). The AMEP provides face-to-face classes and distance learning in basic English as a Second Language, to assist migrants to progress their goals in employment, education and social interaction. flexible AMEP delivery arrangements include the following: New South Wales-Distance Learning (DL); Home Tutor Scheme (HTS); Individual Learning Centres (ILC); Rural and Remote delivery through the Board of Adult and Community EducationCoffs Harbour, Wagga, Albury-Wodonga, Armidale; Community based delivery-Lakemba Mosque Victoria-HTS, DL and ILC; Rural and Remote delivery through T AFEIother structures; Community based delivery; Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) Queensland-Rural and remote services at Bundaberg, Cairns, Central Highlands, Coolcola, Gladstone, Gold Coast, Johnstone, Mackay, Mt Isa, Rockhampton, Toowoomba, Townsville; HTS, DL and ILC Western Australia-Rural and remote services at Port Hedland and Karratha; HTS, DL and ILC South Australia-Rural and remote services at Riverland, Port Lincoln, Mount Gambier; HTS, DL and ILC Tasmania-classes at Hobart, Launceston, Burnie, Devonport; HTS and DL NT--classes in Darwin and Alice Springs; HTS and DL ACT-HTS and ILC. (10) Under the National Integrated Settlement Strategy, the three tiers of government are engaged in a process to plan the integrated and equitable provision of services at Commonwealth, State and local levels. All State and Territories have settlement plans which take account of the needs for settlement to be addressed in regional and remote areas. In some States and Territories, this has extended to the development of specific regional plans. SBS Television Programming (Question No. 321) Miss Jackie Kelly asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) What percentage of SBS TV programming is specifically Croatian in nature. (2) On what basis does SBS TV allocate its programming. (3) What avenues are available for ethnic communities claiming to be under-represented on SBS TV. (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the concerns of the Croatian community at the level of programming of Croatian material on SBS TV. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In 1994-95 SBS showed 13.42 hours of Croatian programming. This represented 0.23% of total programming time and 0.47% of programming time in languages other than English. SBS advises that there has never been a high level of production of suitable program material in Croatia, or in any other region of the world which has a sizeable Croatian population. SBS has investigated-and in most cases viewed--every program identified as Croatian, and made every effort to acquire any program considered suitable for transmission. The lack of programs is due primarily to the recent war and the resultant lack of funding for film making. SBS has recently made an offer to buy a Croatian television drama called The Great God. (2) SBS aims to provide 50% of the television schedule in the common language (English) and 50% in a wide range of community languages reflecting the changing composition of society having regard to: the quality of available programs; the number of speakers of a language resident in Australia; and the obligation of SBS Television to be relevant to all Australians. (3) SBS advises that its Board and Management listen and respond to all criticisms and suggestions. However, it may not be possible to meet all needs expressed given the limited availability of quality material in some languages, and the need to cover as wide a range as possible of language groups. (4) I have not received any correspondence relating to concerns of the Croatian community about SBS TV. In any case, the SBS is a statutory body independent in programming and editorial policy from the Government of the day, and I have no power of direction over the SBS in programming or management matters.

Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) On 28 June 1996, Mr Hollway, Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs announced the closure of twenty six CES offices and the amalgamation of four of the Department's nineteen Area Offices as part of a program to rationalise services and respond to funding reductions. The decision to rationalise the number of CES outlets and Area offices was taken against the backdrop of a sizeable reduction in the 1996-97 forward estimates funding available to the Department and the likely departure in late August of some 2,500 staff who have elected to take voluntary redundancy packages. No decision has been taken to close or downgrade the Lithgow CES. (2)(a) During 1994-95 the services provided by Lithgow CES included: registration and access to CES services for approximately 2009 clients (using 30 June 1995 figures); the servicing of l00L, vacancies notified by employers; case management assistance for 466 clients; and labour market program assistance for 478 clients, including wage subsidy places for 93 clients and training program assistance for 282 clients.

(3) What savings for his portfolio have resulted from the abolished and transferred divisions compared to the sums listed in the financial impact section of the Coalition's 'Meeting our commitments' document of 15 February 1996 (a) in total and (b) for each out year listed at page in the document. (4) Which programs and subprograms listed in the 1995-96 portfolio budget statement for his Department have been (a) abolished and (b) transferred and to which portfolios were they transferred.",113
168,Mr HOWARD,ATSIC RUNNING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(4) Meeting our commitments stated clearly the government's intention to reduce unnecessary duplication by the department. All Divisions of the department will have significant reductions in resources and the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Office of Multicultural Affairs have been moved to other portfolios, with sub-program 6.2 being absorbed within the Treasury portfolio as of the Productivity Commission. The final extent of the actual savings will be announced in the budget. Musicians Union of Australia: Temporary Residential Sponsorships (Question No. 462) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 1996: (1) Did the former Government require approval from the Musicians' Union of Australia before approving certain temporary residential sponsorships; if so, (a) on what basis and (b) did the requirement give the union the power of veto over some applications. (2) Is approval by the Musicians' Union of Australia still required before certain temporary residential sponsorships are approved; if so, will the Government continue to maintain the requirement. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is a requirement in the Migration Regulations (which has been in place since 1989) relating to the Entertainment visa that, for some entertainment visa applications, the visa applicant be sponsored by a person or body in Australia who, or which, 'has consulted with relevant Australian unions in relation to the employment or engagement of the applicant in Australia'. (Regulation 420.223(1)(d». The views of the sponsor and relevant union, following consultation, assist the Department's decision-maker to ascertain whether other regulatory requirements for the sponsorship are met. If the union raises concerns about these requirements not being met, the Departmental decisionmaker may make any further enquiries as considered necessary. If the decision-maker considers 34 that all the requirements are met, the sponsorship will be approved, notwithstanding any concerns expressed by the relevant union. Accordingly, the procedures do not provide a veto power, as such, for a union. (2) There has been no change to the relevant legislation and procedural arrangements since the Government took office. The role of unions in the decision-making process for Entertainment visa sponsorships is however, under review. Australasian Performing Right Association (Question No. 481) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Small part Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1996: Is it a fact that the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) is attempting to impose fees on businesses which play recorded music or radio broadcasts on their premises: if so, (a) does APRA already impose fees on radio stations to broadcast music, (b) has the Government examined the justification for APRA's attempt to impose fees on businesses and (c) will the Government amend the Copyright Act 1968 to prevent this additional impost on small business.  member's question is as follows: Yes, the Australasian Performing Right Association, or APRA, is conducting a campaign at the moment to collect fees from businesses which play recorded music or radio broadcasts on their premises. (a) APRA does collect fees from radio stations for the right to broadcast music. (b) APRA has been collecting licence fees on behalf of songwriters and composers since 1926. Under section 31 of the Copyright Act 1968, the copyright in a literary, dramatic or musical work includes the exclusive right to perform the work in public (which includes the performance of the work in premises open to the public) and the right to broadcast the work. (c) The Government is not, at this point in time, considering amending the Copyright Act 1968 to remove the long standing controls copyright owners have over their works. Like other small business people, copyright owners have the right to receive remuneration for the use of their work by others. Musicians Union of Australia: Temporary Residential Sponsorships (Question No. 486) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 26 June 1996: Did the former Government require approval from the Musicians' Union of Australia before approving certain temporary residential sponsorships; if so, is the requirement consistent with the Government's industrial relations processes and will the Government permit other unions to exercise the same power of veto over Government decision making. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Migration Regulations administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs currently require that persons or organisations seeking to sponsor the temporary entry of persons under Entertainment Visas must consult with the relevant union(s) unless the entry is for cultural and non-commercial purposes. The consultations are primarily to determine whether the activity for which the entertainer is being brought to Australia will result in a net employment benefit to the Australian entertainment industry and the entertainer will be employed in accordance with Australian award wages and working conditions. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is currently reviewing the role of unions in the decision making process for Entertainment Visas. The Government will ensure that the new processes for dealing with temporary sponsorships are consistent with the Government's economic and industrial relations policies. Electorate offices: Craigieburn and Healesville, Victoria (Question No. 490) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (l) Did his Department enter into a lease for premises at 3 Hamilton Street, Craigieburn, Victoria, for the use of the former Member for MCEwen as an electorate office; if so, (a) on what date, (b) what was the term of the lease, (c) what was the rental cost, (d) when does the lease expire, (e) what was the cost of fitting out the office, (f) what was the cost of transferring the electorate office from its previous location and (g) what costs have been incurred in fittings and furnishings including electrical and computer fittings since the lease commenced.

(3) Is the closure of the existing office and establishment of a new office consistent with the guidelines for the provision of electorate offices. (4) Is the new electorate office being established in a remote location relative to population density where there is a lack of public transport; if so, why. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (a) November 1993 (b) Three years with two three year options to extend (c) $21,600 per annum (d) 25 November 1996 (e) $75,480 (f) $4,325 (g) $28,570 (2) Yes (a) 161m2 (b) Yarra Ranges Shire Council (c) $22,500 p.a. Three years with two three year options to extend (d) No (e) $96,511 (0 $3,900 (3) Yes-the needs of the electorate, the wishes of the Member and the relative costs of alternative accommodation solutions have been carefully considered. The agreement to relocate the office is seen as achieving the best balance of those considerations in the longer term. (4) No Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Question No. 496) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 June 1996: (1) What strategies is the Minister's Department implementing to respond to the increased pressure related to the growth in use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. (2) How many tourists visited the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in each year between 1986 and 1996. (3) What .funding did the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority receive from (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Queensland Government and (c) other sources in each year since 1986. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Tourism has become the main commercial use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park over the past decade in terms of the number of vessels, people and structures it employs. Use of the Marine Park by tourists has grown from about 150,000 visitors in the early 1980' s to about 1.5 million 1995/96. This growth in use of the Marine Park has resulted in the management agency, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, implementing a number of strategies in order to keep pace with the predicted 10 pc per annum growth in tourism-whilst balancing the need for protection of the unique environment of the Great Barrier Reef. The Authority has responded to this increased use in a number of ways. In 1993/94 a visionary 25 Year Strategic Plan for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area was developed and is now being implemented by stakeholder groups. The Strategic Plan set 25 year and 5 year objectives for the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the World Heritage area. The Plan is supported by more than 70 government and non-government agencies, interest and user groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Strategic Plan is acknowledged as a world first in participative regional planning. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is divided into four sections each of which is subject to a detailed zoning plan. Zoning plans are one of the Authority's prime tools for managing multiple use of the Marine Park. A major review of the Zoning Plan for the Far Northern Section of the Marine Park is currently being undertaken and a number of minor reviews of the other sections of the Marine Park are also underway. In addition the Authority has also developed management plans for high use areas such as offshore Cairns and the Whitsundays. Other measures such as delineating 'no anchoring' zones, designating 'no structures' subzones and declaring moratoriums on the issue of new tourism permits in the high use areas, are providing the Authority with a broader range of planning and management instruments and with breathing space to properly consider longer term management strategies with which to control the effects of increasing use of the Marine Park. Another of the strengths of the Authority's management of the Great Barrier Reef is the close working relationship it has with the Queensland Government and Queensland management agencies that extends to the adoption of complimentary management plans for areas under the jurisdiction of each government and a jointly funded arrangement for the day to day management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park that enables Queensland officials (generally Department of Environment officers who are Marine Parks rangers) to act on behalf of the Authority within the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. A review of tourism use of the Marine Park is also about to commence. This review will be conducted in partnership with the tourism industry and will, among other things, aim to develop a in strategic tourism use policy and management mechanisms. The Authority will continue to sustainably manage tourism use of the Marine Park in accordance with its legislative responsibility. (2) The estimated* number of tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park between 1986 and 1996 are as follows: Year No. of Tourists 'm 1987 1.3 1988 1.4 1989 1.3 1990 1.6 1991 1.5 1992 1.5 1993 1.4 1994 1.5 1995 1.5 * based on extrapolations of data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on international visitors to north Queensland, total visitor nights, the domestic tourism monitor and Great Barrier Reef Environmental Management Charge returns.
