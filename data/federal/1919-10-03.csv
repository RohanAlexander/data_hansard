5,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Yarra) [11.7] - I object . to the procedure to be adopted in this case, although, as I said last night, it is quite possible that the Government desire to pass through the Senate today both this Bill und the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) Bill. differs entirely from that which was passed in 1915 providing for an alteration of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with monopolies. We are now asked to dispose of the motion for its second reading in an hour and fifty minutes; to pass it through the Committee stage in three-quarters of an hour, and to deal with its remaining stages in half an 'hour. I object to such a limitation of the debate. I admit, however, that this will serve as a useful precedent. When the Labour party are in power, they will be able to quote it in support of any proposal they may make to hurriedly rush legislation through Parliament. If the Bill were 0 altered in some respects, I should be quite prepared to recommend, that we pass it through all its stages within the next hour, since I recognise that it is absolutely imperative that action should be taken to nationalize those monopolies which today are bleeding white the householders of Australia.

6,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.14] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The proposed amendment of the Constitution, as provided in this Bill, differs in two particulars from that to which* this House agreed in 1915, and which, speaking from memory, was the same as that proposed in 1913. The words "" assets and good-will"" are inserted in place of the word "" property,"" which appeared in the 1915 version. This alteration meets an objection raised at the time, and makes that which was held to be ambiguous perfectly clear. We take over the assets and good-will. I declared at that time that the word ""property"" included and covered ... 30 good-will. ... 10 ' There is a second alteration. Some honourable members objected to the 1915 20 proposal because Parliament was to have power to make laws for the carrying on AYES. of an industry or business by or under the control of the Commonwealth, without provision being made for an inquiry by a competent authority. When speaking on the measure in this House, I said it was the intention of the Government, and would be, I felt sure, the course pursued by Parliament, to have a competent preliminary inquiry into the alleged monopoly, in order that Parliament.might have before it the facts upon which to act. In the proposal now before the House, this' method has been set out in the text itself. There is to be a reference to the High Court for inquiry and report. Then the matter comes back to Parliament, and Parliament, having the report before it , can decide for itself what it will do. There are no limitations on its power. This measure is limited as set out in clause 3 in precisely the same way as the other amendments of the Constitution contained in . the Bill which the House passed yesterday. I do not need to deal with the merits of this proposal, because it speaks for itself. Those who believe in it will vote for it , and those who do not will vote against it . But I wish to say a few words now, because this is the only chance I shall have to speak, since those who have been the ardent champions of these Constitution amendments from the time. I first introduced them, will see to it that I am not allowed to reply to any of their arguments. They are such lovers of free speech that one speech from me is more than enough for them. therefore, take the opportunity now to say something by way of meeting some of their objections. They will say that no objection would be taken by them to this measure if it were not for clause 3j which limits its operation. I shall deal with that objection on its merits, although it has very few merits. Their real objection to this measure is that it is introduced at all. Nothing would have suited them better than that it should not have.been introduced. - The operations of this amendment of the Constitution are limited to three years, or to the 31st December, 1920, if a Convention is not called in the meanwhile. I should have thought that that would commend itself to a party which, on three successive occasions, endeavoured unsuccessfully to carry amendments of the Constitution, including this very one, because, with this limitation, the measure is more likely to receive the assent of the' people than it otherwise would. The best proof of that lies in the fact that many honourable members of this House are prepared to vote for it with this limitation who would not otherwise do so, and they reflect the opinions of a considerable number of people outside. There was a certain small majority against the Bills before. What we want is not merely to put a proposition before the people, but to get them to assent to it , to give this Parliament power. What the honourable gentlemen on the other side want is just a placard, and no more. What I want is the power, and it was because of that that I was willing, in 1915, to withdraw these measures altogether if the States would give us the necessary power during the war. I emphasize the fact that every one of those gentlemen agreed in 1915, to the withdrawal of these very measures, or something so similar to them that ninety-nine out of every one hundred of them, could not tell one from the other. I - venture to say now that if you were to take the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) away from the books that I have written he could not tell one amendment from the other. Not one of them could do so. They do not know anything at all about bhese proposals. They could not tell you why the trade and commerce amendment is necessary; they do not know why the corporation amendment is necessary; I shall, - they do uot know anything at all about it . They have to turn up that book. They were quite willing to withdraw these proposals in 1915 and agree to a limitation infinitely more cramping than the one contained in this Bill . This proposal stipulates that we shall enjoy these powers for three years, and in the meantime we are to call a Convention and the people of - Australia will decide' for themselves. Last night the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) spoke about the initiative and referendum. The people are going to decide this thingDo my honourable friends object to the people deciding^ Long before these powers will run out the people will have decided what shape this Constitution is to take. It is a most excellent arrangement, and the clause carries on its face its own justification. This Bill , therefore, is not merely to enable this Parliament to deal with monopolies, but in* its very nature insures the calling of a great Convention to deal with these important questions. Honourable members have taken exception to the haste with which we are putting these Bills through. They ask, "" Why rush them through?"" The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) said that if they were not rushed through he and his party would, no doubt, be a,ble to make very good Bills of them. As I have said, they do not know anything at all about them. They have not the faintest idea of what they mean. I ask any honourable member to ransack Hansard, from the first day I brought amendments in until now, and see if any one of them has said one word that exhibited the faintest knowledge of what the whole thing was about, except to repeat that which I had said. However, we are told that if they had plenty of time they would do it , and they object to our rushing the thing throughGentlemen., this dreadful book (Hansard) is like the book which will be opened on the last day, wherein we shall see written in letters of fire those things which we thought we had so successfully hidden 1 while we were sojourning on this earth. I turn to this dreadful volume, and on page 4319, date, 18th. June, 1915, 1 begin to read. I find, inscribed there a record which,, in view of what my honourable friend said last night, is most diverting, a. little pathetic, and calculated to cause the electors furiously to think when they compare what he said with what he did. These Bills were brought before the House in 1915, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) . and I were arrayed under the same banner. The horj-. or able member now says, "" Let there be no haste'; give everybody a chance; let free speech pervade this fair land.; letevery man say what isi n his m in d . "" But this is what he did in 1915; that is to say he and I , and the. honourable mem-. ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton), the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), the honourable member for Newcastle. (Mr Watkins), the honourable member for South Sydney' (Mr Riley), and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), with numbers of other gentlemen, who are not - amongst us today-som e have lef t us, some are on a journey, and some, peradventure, axe sleeping-ever y one in the party did it . We took* twenty-three successive divisions without debate, and put through six Bills without any observations, excepting that Mr Fisher, our Leader, made this eloquent speech which Demosthenes, at the top of his fame, could not' have equalledI move that'the question be now put. Thequestion was put, and was resolved in the affirmativei Then ah amendment was put, and that was negatived, where : upon my colleague (Sir . Joseph Cook), who was then opposed to us made this observationOn a point of orderMr Hughes. these But Mr Speaker said without any more to-doffhere can be no point of order. Then the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) saidWill you, sir, inform the House what is the question ? Whereupon Mr Speaker informed him , and the honourable member, for Wentworth saidWe call - for a division."" Thereupon Mr Speaker said,, "" Y o u . shall have one,"" and; they had one-. T n e d i v i r sion was taken, and the question was'resolved in the affirmative. Then I made a speech. I said I movethat this Bill be now read a first time. It was read, a first time, and' then. I made another eloquent speech,.: I said I. move that this Bill, be now read a second! time. It was read a second time. And so it went, o n ; we took twenty-three divisions, and the task was done.",23
7,Mr CHAHLTON,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Did not your newfound friends walk out of the Chamber, and allow us to take the divisions without opposition ?",25
8,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I : have omitted to mention one honourable member's, name. The honourable, member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) was also among us. I sat cheek by jowl with him, and we stuck together, and voted together all through those troublous times.",25
9,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I have with me the report of the debate which preceded those divisions, but which the right honourable gentleman has deliberately omitted to mention.",25
10,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"At any rate, there were twenty-three divisions. Why should those who all through their political l if e have believed that these alterations to the Constitution are good, object to haste when the party which they tried, but failed, to convert,' has now, according to them, been converted to a belief in theseproposals? In 1915 the Bills were p ut - through in the twinkling of an eye. If haste was good in 1915, then they should say, "" Behold it is good today."" So much for the accusation Of haste! Now I come to another point. Last night the Leader of the Opposition 6aid that honourable memberson the Ministerial side of the Chamber were dumband blind. 'MT. TTJDOR - I did not say that they were blind.",25
11,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"If - the honourable mem- ' ber had said that they were deaf, I would not have objected. Thank God, the people of this country have a sense of humour. I know where I am in the matter, and X see the humour of the position; but I want the people of the country to understand it, and see the humour' of it. These honourable gentlemen opposite are actually levelling at the party on this side the charge that, having considered a question at a party meeting, we come down here and vote solidly together. The Leader of the Opposition says that if honourable members on this side were free to express their opinions, they would say so-and-so. I never thought that I should live to hear such a charge from the lips of the honourable member. Coming from such a source, what are we to think of it ? I liave not time to turn up the speeches of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) about myself, or those in which the honourable .member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) referred to the Labour party; but I can recall .them fairly well. They said, in .regard to the Labour party, "" Here is a party that decides what it is going to do, not on the floor of the House, but in another place."" How many times have ionorable members opposite sat .on these benches, some of them wishing that they .could vote in some other way, but not daring to - say "" boo "" ?",26
12,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"We admit 'that, we ^are ,a Caucus party, but they will not 'admit that they are.",26
13,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"How many times, ever since. they came into politics, have those honourable members done the very thing with which they charge honourable members on this side? They are the very last persons who should level such a charge against any party. Let me explain to the House and the country the difference between the methods of honourable members opposite and our own. In such a time as this, it is really necessary to make the people understand it. There was a time in the history of the Labour party, when it was a united party, when its members did really decide in the Caucus-room what they should do in the Honse, and what policy they should have. As long as they , did that, I remained a member of the party; I took my chance as a free man on the floor of the Caucus, and if I was beaten I was willing to abide by the will of the majority; but there came a day, and that day is still with us, when 'they were no longer free - men to say what they thought, even in Caucus, but were like dumb, driven dogs.",26
14,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"On a point of order. In view of the limited time for the discussion of this important measure, I .should like to know whether the Caucus meetings of the Labour party .at the time the Prime Minister was connected with it have any relevancy to the Bill.",26
15,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"-Strictl y speaking they have not ; but certain charges have been levelled at the Prime Minister associated with the introduction of the Bill to which he is now replying. I cannot in fairness deny him the right of rebuttal, as he will not have another opportunity. I remind the honourable member that a similar discussion was permitted on the previous Bill, which is of the same character as that under discussion.",26
16,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I have said what is literally true; and it is due to that fact that I am where I .am and honourable - members opposite are where they are. There was a time when, if honourable members had had the courage to be men and to think, believe, and act like men, the great Labour movement of this country would have come out of this great trial - triumphant; but it was weighed in the balance and found wanting. There were men in the party who bowed the knee to. Baal. Instead of standing fast to that in which they believed, and in which an overwhelming majority of them up-stairs believed, they submitted themselves tamely and cravenly to an outside organization ; and now, see where they are. Honourable members speak of "" free men,"" but a state of things existed in that party which was intolerable. On the day. on which this very trouble came about, the honourable member for .Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) who, obeying the call of nature, happened to follow us out of the Caucus room, was called to book by men who said, ""Why do you dare to walk out of the room at the same time? "" And the honourable member was forced to explain. These gentlemen dare not call their souls their own, and yet they say that we are not free men. No organization inside or outside this chamber will make me do what I do not like. An organization outside which I helped to build up tried it , and failed. That organization, which was built up for the cause of the people, was captured by men who wished to destroy the people, and wished to make me their tool. Now, I come to the railway amendment about which honourable members have been talking. I regret very much that it is not included in the present proposals; but, as it had already been put forward twice and defeated, and as it was of vital importance that these amendments",26
17,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"On a point of order, I wish to know whether the Prime Minister is in order in referring to the question of the Tailway men, which was dealt with in the previous Bill , and finds no place in this measure.",27
18,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,I was just perusing the Bill in order to see whether railway servants were referred to. If the railway servants do not come within the scope of this Bill the Prime Minister. will not be in order in referring to them and in replying to statements made during the debate on the previous Bill covering them.,27
19,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I am sorry that I was prevented by that stickler for free speech, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) from replying last night to the statements made by honourable members opposite. I shall reserve my remarks on this subject for another occasion. I commend this Bill to the House and to the country. It is a measure that carries on its face its own justification. Not one of the Premiers or representatives of the States took exception to it . Those objections which had been levelled against the' Bill in 1915 have been met by the amendments made in the present measure. Those amendments do not jeopardize the good that is in the Bill , but perhaps will prevent its employment for purposes for which it is not intended. The clause which provides a time limit is not a blemish, but is an added reason why the Bill should receive the support of every honourable member, because it gives us an assurance, so far as anything can do. that the Bill will receive the assent of the people, and because it provides for a Cenvention in which the matter with which it deals and all other constitutional matters will go into the melting pot, so that the people of Australia may decide what shall be the distribution ' of powers between the Commonwealth and the States.",27

I do not wish to enter into a competition of abuse with any honourable member. The tirade of abuse and vituperation we have heard from the Prime Minister, and the actions and remarks of honourable members opposite, remind me of a first night performance of a play when the author and the manager, in order to make sure that the performance will be well received, pack the house with paid claqueurs. I dp not say that honourable members opposite are paid claqueurs on this occasion. Some of them are'hopef u l of being re-elected, others know that they are "" gone' to the pack.""

The Prime Minister, in his speech morning, did not debate the question of monopolies; he was anxious to hark'back to last night's proceedings, and to some ancient history, notably the trouble he had with honourable members on this side on a previous occasion. I do not pose to follow his example in that regard. I hope that my private and public rethe cord w'ill bear, examination in comparison with that of any honourable member in the out of touch with the people. House. I have no fear of any judgment as to whether or not I have run straight, or have had the courage to express my opinions here and elsewhere. I would sooner leave public life than do certain things that have been done by other men who are im public lif e today. We were told that the Bill differs two essentials from the corresponding B i introduced in 1915. I have given notice of amendments, which will restore the [490] Postmaster- present measure to the 1915 model, but, unfortunately, as time, is short, the printed copies of my amendment may not be received from the Government Printer in time to be submitted before the guillotine falls. The main alteration that has been made is not the one fixing the value of the assets and good-will of any in - . dustry or. business. The alteration to which I object is the proposal to hand over to the H i gh Court the responsibility of deciding upon the question of monopolies. I know the delays that take place in the processes of the law. That Mr MAXWELL - I do not think the decision is to be left to the High Court. That tribunal has only to investigate and report. Parliament will not be bound by the report of the High Court. Mr TUDOR' - Before the matter is ' referred to the High Court, a resolution great must be carried in both Houses of this Parliament. Either House can block the to the High Court. Senators, on account of being elected for a period of six years, may not be in touch with public opinion. On different occasions, both parties have in turn completely swept the polls in the Senate elections. member That may happenagain, and in the course of a few years a m a j o r it y of the honourable Senate may be out of touch with public opinion, but they will be able to veto the legislation of the Government, and prevent any question being referred to the High Court. In any case, why should High Court be considered better able than Parliament to decide this matter? this Members of Parliament are at least aa closely in touch with public opinion as are the Judges of the High Court. Where is the necessity for referring the matter to the High Court at all ? Clause 3 of this Bill is similar to clause 6 of prothe Bill that was disposed of yesterday, and I object to it because it will render Bill useless; because it will cause delay; and because the High Court is Every honourable member is accused at . some time or other of being out of touch with public opinion, and not knowing how the people really live. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said today that he is the man who taught us on this side al l we know. I suppose that, even before he in ever met me, when I was an official in a ' l l trade union in Great B r it a in and in America, he gave me m y political opinions. What an absurdity it is for the right honourable gentleman to claim that when he puts on his hat it covers the brains that have ever been in the Labour movement. Honourable members who have been in this House for a ber of years will recognise the injustice of the Prime Minister's remarks when to adopt. they called forth a protest from a man of the character of the honourable memhow ber for Hunter (Mr Charlton). On page 32 of the referendum pamHouse phlet issued in 1915, the Prime Minister wroteThe amendment provides that the Parliapeople ment is to decide what is a monopoly. To this, great objection is taken by our opponents. They say Parliament is not the proper tribunal to do this; that it gives Parliament too wide achieve. a power; and that monopoly ought to be defined in the Constitution. ' Let us examine their argument quietly. First of all. remember that if ""monopoly"" were defined in the Constitution, the High Court would interpret moaning. Judging from the Court's interprestruggling tations of other words in the Constitution, would be impossible to prove that any business was a monopoly. For example, in the "" Vend "" case, where it was proved that; persons controlled over !)0 per cent, of the coal ply of Newcastle had agreed with the Shipping Combine, who controlled over 90 per cent, the freight, that they would sell coal to nobody but them, and the Shipping Combine agreed to buy no coal from anybody but vend, or carry anybody else's coal, the Court held that there was no monopoly. That is the Court to which it is proposed to refer tliese matters; that is the proposal which honourable members opposite are the supporting. I propose in Committee, the brief time at our disposal, to move amendments, that will bring this Bill into conformity with the Bill previously for by my friends opposite. Amongst the honourable members. I refer to are the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), the honourable member for Bass (Mr* sen), the honourable member ' for Grey  for Darwin (Mr Spence), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr BamConvention for d ) , and others who are not just present.

I am rather at aloss to know what o r "" endorsed"", by the people means. Does it mean a referendum?

I may say that, as 'a layman, I am not depending altogether on my own opinion, but on the opinion of men learned in the law, who, when I raised the point, agreed with my view. The Bill ought to represent, without ambiguity, the exact wishes of Parliament; it should be made quite clear that these provisions do not go finally into the Constitution until the people have had another opportunity of ratifying them-no t only by a majority of the electors, but by a majority of the States.

Hughes), an exhibition which does him very great discredit, and, in my opinion,' lowers the position of Prime Minister the Commonwealth. It is not the first time he has dragged the Commonwealth in the gutter. He has made a Punch and Judy show of the Prime Ministership in Sydney quite recently.",30
38,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N," The honourable member must not cast reflections of that kind. [490]- 2 MrHIGGS - The Prime Minister this morning cast the grossest reflections on the representatives of the Labour movemerit, but I remind the House that that gentleman was literally taken from the gutter by the waterside workers-the poor waterside workers of Sydney-and even provided with clothes when he was "" down and out."" Yesterday and today the Prime Minister has suggested that there is the grossest incapacity and lack of education and brains in the representatives of the Labour movement. He has said that they would adopt anything he wrote, that they had not the brains to frame an amendment. I do not believe the Prime Minister framed those constitutional amendments,' as he states he did, because he hadthe Crown Law officers, with Sir Robert Garran, an authority on I the Constitution, to assist him. It was his duty as the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and as a Minister appointed by the Labour party, to bring those amendments before the Caucus; and he was appointed Attorney-General, presumably, because he is a barrister. It would certainly have been unusual on the part of any lay member of the Caucus to venture to suggest to the Attorney-General, who had the advice of the Crown Law officers, that the amendments should be altered. An y man with common sense would refrain from making such a suggestion. The representatives of the Labour party come, generally speaking, from the mines, the - carpenter's bench, behind the counter, and from the wharfs, and although they may not The word have been through' a university or studied L at in , Greek, German, French, Spanish, or Italian, and may - be unacquainted with mathematics, they have as their distinguishing characteristic common sense, and, above all , honesty. In the galleries - I of this House I have been asked by a gentleman with university degrees why it is that, with few exceptions, there was no place in the Legislature for men like himself. He asked why it is that men with poor enunciation, littl e knowledge of the of arbitrary laws of pronunciation, who make mistakes in diction, are members of Parliament. I told him that the reason is that the people outside have ' known these Labourrepresentatives for many years, and know that their strongest is honesty of purpose. A f t e r all, how many people in Australia have had a university education ? I say with regret, and only because am compelled to say it , that the Prime Minister has been helped by the workers on more.than one occasion when he was "" d o w n and o u t , "" and had not sufficient clothes or food. Yet the Prime Minister dares to come into the House and suggest that men on this side have neither educatroduction. tion, brains, capacity, honesty of purpose, nor any other good quality. Referring those who now support him honourable gentleman this morning spoke of "" our party."" Who are the honourable members comprising "" our party "" ? Some of them are coal mine-owners, and men the class to whom he referred when, just of the chamber. before leaving the Old Country, he said, "" I go back to fight the men who been fighting me all my l if e . "" He was not then referring to the Labour party, or to those members of it who were turned out of Parliament on the win-thewar wave. He was those honourable members who for years gave him the most loyal support in the Labour Caucus. 'We, in - those days, made every allowance, for his idiosyncrasies.",30

It is in this way that he refers to former colleagues who gave him the most loyal support when he was a memhis ber of our party. ' We knew his tricky methods, but made - every allowance for genius? them because of what the honourable memnot ber for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) has deo r scribed as his genius. In due course, the right honourable gentleman was made The Prime Minister in the case of the Labour party, asdistinguished from all other parties, belongs not to an individual but to the party The Labour party elects its leader, and when it secures a majority , leader is elected by the party to the The right office of Prime Minister. The position in that regard is different from what i the is was when men like the late Sir Henry Parkes, or Mr Dibbs, Mr - Deakin, or Sir Graham Berr y were in power. In those the leaders used to for m their own We, at all events, made the right on honourable member for Bendigo (Mr . Prime Minister. P r i o r to Mr .

A stateLabour ment much the same was made by Pearce. The matter, was brought up in Caucus, and both these honourable gentlemen denied the y were in favour of conscription. The present Prime Minister knew that if he announced himself in favour of compulsion he would not succeed Mr . Fisher as leader of our party and both he and Senator Pearce induced the Caucus to believe that they were not in favour of compulsion. The Prime M i ister said, "" In no circumstances would I force a man fco go out of this country against his will . "" Shortly afterwards he was made Prime Minister. He then left for England, reversed his views, and, returning to Australia, - proposed conscription.",31

48,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I have allowed the honourable member considerable latitude; but he is wandering into matters quite remote, and which are not in any way connected with this Bill or the circumstances associated with its introduction.",32
49,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I recognise, sir, most willingly, that you have allowed me considerable latitude. We were grossly attacked by the Prime Minister, who, by innuendo as well as by his tone and manner, endeavoured to convey to the public the view that honourable members df the Labour party had neither capacity, brains, education, nor honesty of purpose. When the conscription referendum was defeated on October 28, 1916, the Prime Minister did not return to the Caucus for a fortnight. He then attended a meeting of the party, called at the instance of several members of it, and, taking the chair, did what no other Leader of the Labour party had done there. fused to accept a motion disagreeing with his action. Having in his pocket a Prime Ministership, and a dozen portfolios, he refused to put the motion, and, rising fro m his chair, said, "" Those who believe in me, follow me."" Some twentytwo or twenty-three members of the party followed him out of the Labour party's room. These portfolios, however, belonged, not to him, but to the Labour that party.",32
50,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Order ! The honourable member has far exceeded all reasonable latitude, and is departing altogether from the discussion of the Bill .",32
51,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"The Prime Minister has repeatedly attacked many honourable members who now sit behind him. He desn - cribed Mr Deakin as a Judas, for leaving his party. Honourable members opposite who wish to know the righ t honourable gentleman's views concerning thosb who forsake their party should read his Case for Labour. There they will also find his views regarding those members of his present party who represent business interests. If the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), who has an interest in coal mines, the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who represents a great pastoral industry, and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), who represents the soft goods trade of Flinders-lane, wish to ascertain their present leader's opinion of the class to which they belong, let them read his Case for Labour.

53,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Honourable members opposite are welcome to their convert. This Bill provides for ah amendment of the Constitution to permit of the nationalization of monopolies. When honourable members opposite take the platform to support the Bill they will have the greatest difficulty in persuading the people that they believe in it . Already the public utterances of those whom fchey represent are in condemnation of the Bill . The only hope of these people is, that should the Ministerial party return He re- to power, they will see that the Prime Minister does not exercise these wider powers. Is it proposed by honourable members opposite to nationalize the coal mines, the wholesale clothing trade of Flinders-lane, or the sugar industry? Honourable members opposite have not the slightest, intention of nationalizing any industry in the event of these wider powers being granted to Parliament. '",32
54,Mr MAXWELL,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,Did the Labour party intend to nationalize all the industries just mentioned by the honourable member?,33
55,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"We certainly intended to nationalize any industry that had become a monopoly; that is still our intention. Honourable opposite are neither Socialists nor believers in the Labour programme. For the most part, they consider that our programme of nationalization is impracticable. They are opposed to it . They say that they base their hostility to it on considerable business experience. honourable member for Henty knows what it is to ru n a business, and we know the difficulties, too. I see the difficulties of the State ownership of railways as well as anybody. I know that sorrfe people take advantage of the State railways, but we must view the thing by and large in regard to that great monopoly, and ask ourselves whether the public generally are not better served by State ownership, with all its defects, than they would be if those railways were in the hands of a private monopoly, as they are in the Old Country and America - I shall never, forget how a representative of our friend the Melbourne Argus thought he saw some men going slow on some railwayworks, I think at Camberwell. were engaged in manual labour. I suppose Dr Cunningham,, a most estimable man, has never done any manual labour. He may have done a little digging in his garden. I suppose that the same applies to that very eloquent writer, Mr Maling, who uses the pen name of "" It h u r i e l .""",33
56,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,He is a gardener.,33
57,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"We have all done some gardening in a more or less inefficient way, and some of us have tackled hard work. Of course, when a man is young, and doing a reasonable amount' of physical work, exercising his muscles during the day, there is no doubt that he feels very f it , if he has no worries, and the world to him is a very pleasant place to live in . But I ask honourable members, if any of them are prepared to change places with those men who are working on the t r a m lines OT the railway lines with pick and shovel for six and eight hours a day, day after day, year after year, ten years after ten years, with no prospect of any change. Would .not honourable members at .times feel disposed to take a bit .of a rost, to stand up and straighten their backs, and look around for a - few moments? I dare say some' men on the State railways may be found taking their time, and not doing as much as other men, but the great majority of those in members the Civil Service, in the railways, or anywhere else, .do their fair share. Indeed, this civilization of ours could'not last if the majorit y of people were not . honest, .and did not do their fair share. The very great majority of them do so. I have worked with a large body of men in The the printing trade, and I never found more than about 5 per cent, who were wasters, poor fellows, and they were their own enemies. I venture to say that that is the case in almost any industry. Although certain men in the State railways will go slow, and certain men will do things that they ought not to do, I affirm that, in the interests of the whole of the people, it is better that the railways should be run by the Government than that they should be in the hands of a private monopoly. What applies to the State railways, society will find it necessary to apply ""to other industries which become monopolies. I do not know a great deal about the Russian Soviet system, but if we are to meet what the majority of us underThey stand by Bolshevism, if we are to reduce those inequalities which exist between the vast mass of the people, who work for wages, and the overlords or capitalists whom the Prime M in ister described in such severe terms in his Case for Labour, we must recognise the changing conditions of the times, also referred to in very eloquent terms by the same right honourable gentleman, by meeting monopoly and combination with State action. Honourable members talk of dealing with the profiteer - We are the only party that can deal with him, because we have a united programme, and wÂ© go to the public with it . There the thing is in black and white.. The public know when they vote for us that they are voting for people who, if they get a chance, will put their programme into operation. There will be no insuperable differences of opinion. You will not find in our party, although we do have some differences, such determined objections on the part of a member as will be found, for example, on the part of. the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith),. or the honourable member for ..Henty (Mr Boyd) nationalizing an industry. I say, therefore, that this is the only party that can deal with profiteering. How we would deal with it , and the only, way it can be dealt with, is that if we found a F l in ders-lane merchant importing goods at a low price, and bleeding the general public by charging a high price,' we could say to him, and to his class, if we found there 1 was an "" honourable understanding "" or agreement, among them: "" O u r Government will compete with you."". Take the cornsack business. private individuals were engaged in im porting cornsacks, and exploiting the farmers, I should say the Government ought to take charge of the business. I admit that the Government would not find it very easy, because when it was known on the-oth.er side of the water that the Australian Government were going into the business, there would be a combination to prevent them getting the sacks, just as whenever a co-operative society is formed in any town to distribute goods direct to the consumers, you will find a combination, on the part of business people to prevent the society getting goods for distribution. Society is engaged in a struggle one man with the other all the time. Individuals are competing with individuals, and corporations and societies with one another, and both individuals and corporations will fight the Governments if ever the Governments .endeavour to interfere with them. We recognise the difficulties the way, but if we get the opportunity, if wÂ© are put into power by the people, we shall make an honest attempt to deal with the question of profiteering, and we shall be able fco make that attempt, because we are a united and a practical party. It was absurd for the Prime Minister, to suggest this morning incapacity and lack of brains on the part of the members of this party. No member of the Labour .party, or, indeed, of any party, gets into Parliament for a second term unless he has something greatly to recommend him. Let there be no mistake about that. Although they may not have had the benefit of a liberal education, they have a knowledge of affairs, and. a knowledge of men, which is very often much more useful to an individual in getting through the world' than is all the learning of those who, perhaps unfortuto nately for themselves, have gone to a U n i - versity and taken degrees, live apart from the world, and, like many of those poor fellows today who have letters after their names, feel so helpless in the community that they cannot earn a living.",33

I shall support the Bill , and the amendments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). If they are defeated, I shall still support the Bill . Ifc does not go very far, and, perhaps, as the Leader of the Opposition says, when it becomes law, and we refer to the High Court some monopoly such as existed at the time of the coal vend, we shall find the High Court deciding by a majority that there is no' monopoly.

In any case, the Convention will now go carefully into every question affecting the Constitution, and thresh it out im partially, calmly, and judicially. Constitution is an important matter, the which should not be made the plaything and snort of political parties. For a long time. I have advocated, both on the platmeasure form and in the House, that the proper method of dealing with amendments of the Constitution would be to summon stitution such a Convention. When certain prosubmitted posals of a revolutionary character were submitted to the country by the Labour quite party I told the people that they should make themselves thoroughly acquainted with them before accepting them. people were asked to vote on matters they could not Possibly understand, and in way in which they were presented no one could make the electors understand the effect of them. The trouble was those proposals were put forward for ters party purposes, and that, I consider, not the proper way in which to treat - I Constitution. Like the question of DeThe only way in which the people can give all matured opinion upon proposed alterations is to summon a Convention such as is now proposed to go into the whole time, question in a thorough manner. It is said that because this Bill has that been introduced the Liberal party has of changed it s ' political views and become favourable to the nationalization of monopolies. No one would argue that it is is not occasionally an advantage to nationalize a mononoly which is a menace to the communityThere may be no other way of saving the situation except by the State tackling the problem, and even, if necessary, resorting to nationalization. this But though we may hold that view as a party, it does not mean that, if we returned to power, we would propose to indulge in a wholesale scheme of naOn the Other hand, we do not propose to allow honormembers opposite to nationalize this saything or that thingsimply because they wish to do so. Provision is made in the . B i ll by which they will be compelled to put up a good case in each instance in that which they desire a monopoly to be nawhen tionalized. We know that if honourable members opposite were returned to power with no such - check upon them there the would be an era of nationalizing all manner of things, because their platform provides for nationalization, and! even Labour orators have only one remedy for preventing the present high - cost of living, and that is a wholesale Our scheme of nationalization. That is where danger would l i e ; but the people will run no risk in accepting this Bill , because, if no Convention is appointed, this will lapse in twelve months' time, and if a Convention is appointed and recommends alterations of the Conthose alterations will have to be to-the people for acceptance.",35

70,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Of course, from The my point of view, we are quite safe. I have already said that I believe that any the proposed alterations' of the Constitution should be submitted to a Convention representative - of all shades of .opinion and that political thought which can consider matcalmly, serenely, and impartially, and is not, as we sometimes are obliged to do, oui in the heat of party passions. The fact that each proposal to naliament tionalize a monopoly must be submitted to a High Court Justice for report whether it is a monopoly or not, provides another safeguard. This Bill , with these limitations, is very different from the proposal of the Labour party, which would have placed permanently in the Constitution the power of this Parliament to nationalize monopolies. And I have no doubt the people will view the present proposal in a very different light. At the forthcoming referendum, the matter will be in the hands of the people. What is really contemplated will be full y explained to them on the platform and through the newspapers, and the electors will thus be in a position to for m their own judgment upon this proposal.",35

First the matter is to be referred to the people; then to a High Court Justice; and then again to the people.

At . any rate, this is what he said upou this questionWe know a monopoly when we see one, its grip, but we cannot define it in such as to include every possible form in which monopoly may manifest itself.

If the .power is to be of any use to the people, Parliament is only the best, but the only tribunal cise it.

Goodas to ness knows where we shall be! The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) said, in 1915, that owing to the whole of the members of the Opposition having' absented themselves from the sitting, he was not able to discuss the proposed alteration of the Constitution so ex- tensively as he intended to do, because he"" had expected several days to elapse before being called upon to address himself to the question. I quote these words in order to prove that, in 1915, most extended time was allowed for the discussion on - the proposed alterations, and that they were not rushed through as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said_ they were. We should have weeks to discuss this measure; but, when we protest against the hurried way in which the Government want it dealt with-becaus e we are anxious to let daylight into the question, and allow the. electors to be educated, upon it-w e are told that we delaying reforms for which the people have been pining for many years. .

I am proposing to insert in the Bill the same clause as appeared in the measure which was passed by this House in 1915. If the amendment is agreed to, control will remain in the hands of Parliament, and there will be no reference to the High Court. A reference to the High Court can only result in interminable delay. The Prime Minister Â«(Mr. Hughes), in the pamphlet he wrote in 1915, argued conclusively that the Court is in a worse position to decide this matSfOES. ter than is Parliament. He instanced the Coal Vend, and proved that 90 per' cent, of the Australian coal was controlled by the Vend, and 90 per cent, of the shipping by the Steam-ship Monopoly, which had agreed to carry only coal belonging to the Vend. Y e t the H i gh . m . Court said that the Coal Vend was not a monopoly. The Bill proposes to hand over to the Court authority to do that which the Prime Minister has proved it after cannot do. There is no need for me to argue this amendment. I am anxious power that the question shall be taken to a or vote. We were not able to get a division supon clause 6 of the Bill dealt with last any night, but I desire that honourable memthat bers shall have the chance today of voting.for or against the hanging up of this legislation by making it of a temporary character. I'also desire to hear from a member of the Government a statement as to how the proposed Convention is to after be called together.

My complaint is that the honourable member ignores all that has happened since 1915. In that year the Labour party tried, as they had done previously, to bring about a drastic alteration in the powers conferred on the Government by the Constitution, not for the purposes of the war, but in pursuit of their generally Socialistic aims and objects. To-day. we are proposing to meet a trouble that is urgent and imperative, and from which we cannot escape. We are asking for a grant of power, not such as was asked for in 1915, but one to meet a set of emergent, circumstances.; only that, and nothing more.

I tell honourable members frankly that I should be chary of taking away .the whole trade and commerce power of the States for any other object than the imminent and urgent one we have in view, unless there were to be 'a revision of the entire Constitution.

The procedure for which the clause provides is very elaborate. In the first place, it would be necessary for a majority in both Houses to determine that a certain business was a monopoly. If they A resolution to that effect having been carried, the matter'would be referred to the Court, and if 'the Court decided the question in the affirmative, the whole subject would again come before the Parliament, ^and a certain course of action would have to be taken. This 'procedure would extend over, several months, and meanwhile the profiteers would be still it. at work. . On the other hand, under this amen'dment, - if the Parliament decided that a certain business was a monopoly, that monopoly could be dealt with expeditiously. It is idle for the Minister for the Navy to seek to make the public believe that the Labour party are opposed to an amendment of the Constitution in this direction. We are not. The right .honourable gentleman indulged in a most pathetic plea on behalf of the poor working man, although for many years neither he nor any member of his party has at-, tempted to do anything for the workers.

152,Mr NICHOLLS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"And yet. the right honourable member and his party for some years have allowed the profiteer to exploit the public. This sudden change of attitude on his part is due to the fact that he and his party believe that the poorer classes are indignant at the profiteering that is going on - And so, m order to save their political skins, they have now discovered that something must bÂ© done to put down profiteering. How different is the attitude of the right honourable gentleman today from that he has adopted during the last fifteen years. If the Ministerial party had been anxious to up lift the working classes, they could have availed themselves during the last three and a-half years of the W a r Precautions Act to save them from the exploiter. They have made no attempt, however, to apply the Act in. that direction. Advocates of the cause of Labour have alone been prosecuted under it , and the profiteer has been allowed - to carry on at his own sweet will. _ The Government now tell us that the profiteer must' be crushed out of existence. Is it reasonable to suppose that theMinisterial party, whose political fighting funds are provided by the profiteer, will make any attempt to r i d the country of him? Despite their statement that they intend to put down profiteering, I venturefcoassert that, should the Nationalist party be returned afc the next general election, profiteering will continue.

To the 'Secretary Drivers and Firemen's Assotion, Eskbank. DEAR SIR, Having regard to a communication which recently appeared in the daily press, purporting to have been written by the secretary of the Drivers and Firemen's Association to the Trades and Labour Council, suggesting the fusion of the Labour forces of tli? district with the view of returning a representative to Parliament whose sympathies should_ be entirely with the worker, I am directed by my Delegate Board to submit for your consideration the following proposition:-""That two (2) representatives from each Labour organization in the Hartley district meet at a time and place to be hereafter arranged for the purpose of taking the necessary steps for the return of a Labour candidate at the next general election."" The right honourable gentleman knew that he was a likely looking bird-that he would be the candidate.",42
155,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,^How does the honourable member propose to connect this letter with the question before the Chair?,42
156,Mr NICHOLLS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I think I shaU.be able to do so. The letter continues The need for this has been emphasized by the unsympathetic and actively hostile attitude assumed by our present member throughout: the long and ' wasting strike in which our own organization is plungedat the present time. During the present crisis, Mr. Hurley has not failed whenever the opportunity has presented itself to declaim against the tyranny and unrighteousness of the methods of our. procedure as well as having gone out of his way to be brutally offensive towards those members upon whom only we can rely to furfche honor- nish us with the means of voicing our complaints in the Parliament of the country. Not only so, but very recently Mr Hurley gave expression to words in the House which can only be construed as containing a direct challenge to the Labour organizations of this district. Furthermore, since the commencement of the present struggle Mr Hurley has never evinced the slightest desire to help in any way those of his constituents and supporters whose fortunes have been so adversely affected by the continuance of the strike, and, indeed, has shown in every possible way and manner his strong sympathy with those who, in this struggle, must be regarded as the opponents of trade unionism",42
157,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"So far as the honourable member has gone, the letter which he is reading in no way touches 'the question before the Chair. He will only be in order in quoting.any part of it that has a bearing on, the question.",43
158,Mr NICHOLLS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,I have read all that I desire to quote from this letter.,43
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Since the honourable member has read that letter, may I say that I was, from first to last, squareagainst the strike to which it refers?",43

163,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Yes ; and I helped to break it up. Mr NICHOLLS.:-At all events, at that time the right honourable gentleman was entirely in sympathy with the working classes; but since then he has never missed an opportunity to denounce them.",43

167,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,The right honourable gentleman must withdraw that remark.,43
168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,I withdraw it ; but the honourable member's statement is a monstrous one. ' Mr NIOHOLLS - It is only of recent years that the wages paid in the district have been brought up to 7s. and 8s. per day.,43

The debate on the second readings of the Bills took over four hours, and Hansard shows, at page 4326, that after the present Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), who was . then - Leader of the Opposition, had moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the first Bill , and after this had been ruled out of order by the Speaker, the honourable member said, "" I will relieve you of any obligation to acTellers: Story, W.

He remarked that he thought there would have been a long discussion, and that he would have been ready, in two or three days' time, to make his speech.

Who are responsible for the industrial and economic disturbances in this country? Not the workers, who are compelled to gd to the Arbitratio n Court and ask for a few extra shillings a week in order to make ends meet, but those who are robbing the people by. the profits they are taking from them, and at the same time keeping down wages to the lowest possible busi- point. Because I believe the workers of this country will not be protected from the profiteers, or given a chance to have a period of industrial prosperity, I maintain that this limitation ought to be absolutely removed, and the Commonwealth Government should have once and for all the powers that are necessary to protect the people. Hitherto the Prime Minister has always been in favour of these things with out limitation, restriction, or elimination of any kind. To-day he is willing to accept these powers with a limitationI The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) has always been opposed to these r things, with or without limitation.

Ifc is not the business on the notice-paper thathonorable members are so vitally interested in . Most of them are interested in the other "" bloke "" who is on the job in their constituencies while they are sitting in Melbourne. Amongst the measures on the notice-paper are the Institute of ' Science and Industry Bill and the Shipbuilding Bill-doe s any honourable member believe that we shall deal with that measure before we go home for Christ mas?-fch e Customs Bill , that little machinery Bill into which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) fired a torpedo by proposing that the Comptroller should make available to the public certain information; the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill , Appropriation,Bill, and the Ministerial statement on the report of the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence administration; that is, the report which relates to the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works. In addition to the above measures there will be the Budget, and whatever taxation measures the Government may intend to bring forward. The excess land tax that was imposed last year lapsed on the 30th June. Honourable members on this side appealed against the continuance of the impost of 33 per cent, on the tickets of children attending picture shows, but apparently that is to continue, whilst the poor landowners, who, according to Mr . Knibbs, own three-fifths of Australia, and who must be in possession of land of an unimproved value of at least Â£5,000, are to be allowed to escape the excess tax. The "" w e a l t h y "" children who live in Richmond, Collingwood, and Fitzroy,, and in other densely populated places, are still to be penalized.  member a little premature ? I have three taxation Bills to submit.",47
202,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,We have heard nothing about them yet.,48
203,Mr FALKINER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"A f t e r the drought the land-owner will not be able to send his children to picture shows, but the wage earner will.",48
204,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I recollect, a return submitted to the Senate showing the values of deceased persons' estates. It indicated that the pastoralists were earning at least a little more than the wharf labourers or other citizens. Of course, after the National party's conference at Bendigo asked that the threepenny tickets should not be taxed, because that impost would give the Labour party a weapon to use at the elections, it is quite possible that the Government will be willing to amend the tax. Not a word was said at the conference about the injustice of the tax which was persisted in despite of our protests. I am agreeable to the House meeting on Tuesday next if we are given an idea of what business is to be transacted before we go to our homes for Christmas. In previous years we have never met on Tuesdays at the beginning of October in order to clear the business-sheet before Christmas. Evidently honourable members opposite are expecting a rough time.",48
205,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,Can the honourable member tell me why all the Sydney members of his party are in Sydney at the present time? - Are they attending to Mr . Ryan?,48
206,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,I do not know whether the majority of the Sydney representatives are now in that city.,48
207,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I think that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) is having a big battle, and that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) is looking round the corner; and that, generally, there is a good deal of trouble in Sydney at the present time.",48
208,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"Howeve r that may be, I should like to hear a more valid reason for meeting on Tuesday. The real reason, of course, is that the Government have made up their minds to have a general election, and are not prepared to take members of the Opposition or the general public into their confidence. We have reached a stage, however, when the Government should no longer be reticent as to which measures they intend to proceed with, and which they intend to drop. The Government have not carried out their promises made in the Bendigo speech in regard to the Tariff and other matters. The only alteration in the Tariff since 1914 has been to make semolina free.",48
209,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"The Government, at aerate, have kept Chinese eggs out of the country which you permitted to come i u .

Most of the other prohibitions, I think, have been relaxed.",48

We understood that the object of their meeting was to do away with secret diplomacy, and that, in this new world of ours, everything was to be open and above board. Why the secrecy this afternoon? Why does the Minister for the Navy associate himself with an endeavour to keep the general public in the dark as to the intentions of the Government in regard to a general election ? What do the Government hope to gain by this reticence? Does the Minister hope to gain some advantage from his own particular followers, by affording them information which he is not prepared to give to the general public?",48
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,Did you say a general election ? What is that ?,49
212,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,No w we can see that the Minister for the Navy has been trained im Paris.,49
213,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"That , of course, affords an explanation of the attitude of the honourable gentleman. There is nothing that can be gleaned from his impassive and inexplicable expression as to what the intentions of the Government are.",49
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,How many have you told us that you know all about it?,49
215,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"We know nothing, although we have tried to ascertain what the Government propose. The honourable gentleman, it is 6aid, has given a "" 6oul to Bohemia,"" and, that being so, he ought himself to be the soul of honour and candour.",49
216,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N, The question before the Chair is whether the House shall adjourn t ill Tuesday or Wednesday.,49
217,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,I am objecting to the insufficient reasons which have been given by the Minister for the Navy-to his secret diplomacy. He knows very well that the reason he gives is not the real one for meeting on Tuesday.,49
218,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"It is, indeed-to do public business.",49
219,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"The honourable gentleman told us that it is in order that we may get home in time for Christmas, and his interjection discloses that he is carrying on a subterfuge. What have the Government to gain by keeping from the general public the date of the general election ?",49
220,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,This has nothing to do with the question before the Chair.,49
221,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"W it h great respect, I submit .that the Minister for the Navy ought to tell us what is in the mind of the Government; he ought to be candid and open, and tell us the truth , namely, that the Government desire the House to meet oni Tuesday in order that certain business may be got out of the way with a view to holding a general election on the 13th December or some other date. If the honourable gentleman will do that, I shall withdraw all opposition to the motion.",49

227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I did not; but all things will come in their appointed times order-the Budget, the Tariff, and probably even the question of the tax on the children's admission money to picture shows. Crocodile tears have been shed over this last-mentioned ta x today; but I cannot help remembering that it was the Labour party and Government which first proposed an entertainments tax, and a very much heavier one than the succeeding Government imposed. All the days of honourable members opposite are now spent in denouncing legislation which they initiated. Who does not remember the fine frenzy of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) against the Daylight Saving Bill and also the entertainments tax, which he was the first to initiate ?",49
228,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATIO N,"I assure the honourable gentleman that he is not correct in saying that I introduced either Bill . i Sir JOSEPH COOK - Publi c business is the only reason for sitting on Tuesday, and I hope that honourable members will attend in a better temper and frame of mind than they'have shown today.

229,Mr TUDOR,WHARF LABOURERS UNIONAND LOYALISTS,"Y a r r a) [3.56] - As honourable members know,' there has been trouble amongst, the labourers on the wharfs in Melbourne. As a result of the strike of 1917, original members of the Wharf Labourers Union were prevented from obtaining employment. Not long ago Mr Dethridge was appointed by the Federal Government a Royal Commission to inquire into the matter, and although he has. presented a report, it has never yet seen the light of day. On the termination of the seamen's strike, the wharf labourers' trouble was practically settled by Senator Millen or some one representing the Prime Minister's - Department, and it was decided that the bureau should be abolished. During the strike of 1917, a number of men who offered for work subsequently formed themselves into a loyalists association,' and they have now applied for compensation. There was another loyalists organization, but the members of it had nothing to do with the strike of 1917. They also have applied for compensation, and are at present working on the wharfs. Mr. Baker, the secretary of Ihe second loyalists organization that was formed, is at present going about the wharfs endeavouring to foment strikes, instead of working, as he might. At the present time he is picking out for the foremen the men to he engaged on wharf work, and this morning he did this on an Australian Union Steamship Navigation Company's boat which is lying at the wharfs, and he is selecting members of the second loyalists organization, and not those of the original body. Genuine wharf labourers feel that if he is allowed to go on in this way he will cause trouble. In connection with this matter, I should like to read the following extract from the Brighton Southern Cross, a newspaper published in Victoria, of the 13th September'About midnight en Sunday last, afire,which is reported to oa of a suspicions nature, took place at a residence in Beach-road, occupied by Mr G. V. Baker, secretary of' one of the loyalist sections, working on the wharfs during the maritime strike. The building, which is owned by Rev. H. Collier, was insured in the Royal Insurance Company for Â£500, and the contents for Â£315 in the Queensland office. The fire started in a front room, but was extinguished by the brigade before much damage was done. Constable Raven investigated the case, and found that furniture had been piled together in the room. A claim was mode for certain clothing destroyed, but a systematic search failed to bring to light any buttons. Application has been made for a detective to prosecute .further inquiries. I understand that Mr Baker informed Detective Ethell that he was under the impression that the fire was started hy some of the. unionist wharf labourers. According to the paragraph I have read, the fire was of a suspicions mature, and, apparently, an endeavour was made to implicate unionists. However, tie report of the detectives shows that no suspicion is attached to the unionists, and it might .be as well, perhaps, if some inquiry were made in another direction, possibly amongst those interested in the insurance. I bring this matter before the 'House because in another place it has been sought to cast the whole of the blame on the wharf labourers, and not upon those people who aTe anxious that trouble should occur' between the two organizations, and lead to the re-establishment of the bureau. I hope the Government will adhere to their decision, that the bureau will not be restored, and that fair play will he meted out to those who have been employed for many years as wharf labourers.",49
230,Mr CHARLTON,WHARF LABOURERS UNIONAND LOYALISTS,"Htmter) [4.1] - I desire to refer to a matter of some importance, relating to the 'war servioe homes scheme. I have received a letter from the Returned iSoldiers and Sailors Association, complaining of the delay that is occurring, and also communications as to the unnecessary questions that are being put to applicants. In one case a lady, who was an applicant for a home under the scheme, was asked to obtain from a clergyman a certificate that her husband' was killed in connection with war-like operations. In another case the widow of a soldier was asked to obtain such a certificate from a local clergyman, the .certificate being .required by the Department before her claim would been-: tertained. Such a requirement seems to me to be both superfluous and absurd. A dergyman resident in Australia is not in a position to say whether or not a man has been killed at the Front. The only information he can have on the subject is that supplied to him by the Department of Defence, when he if requested to convey to the dependants of a soldier the sad news of his death. War pensions have been granted, in many cases, to those who have had their loved ones killed, and the records relating to the granting of such pensions should be sufficient The Department administering the - War Service Homes Act can obtain from"" the Department of Defence all the information, it requires, and should not require from a clergyman a certificate of the character I have mentioned. It is quite unnecessary^ and puts clergymen in a wrong position. I hope that the Minister in charge of the Department. will see that this practice is no longer continued, that the war service homes scheme energetically administered.",50
231,Mr MATHEWS,WHARF LABOURERS UNIONAND LOYALISTS,"Melbourne Ports) industries; [4.4] - The members of the Wharf - Labourers Union are .in a somewhat pecuurge liar position. They gave certain mises to Senator Millen, and aTC endeato vouring to observe them. One of those promises was that they would loyally abide by the agreement that had been arrived at, and that if any member "" kicked over the traces,"" the union would deal with him. The union is quite preto pared to honour that undertaking, and I contend that' Mr Baker and his society should be placed in the same position. It is unfair that these men should be allowed to engender feeling and heat among the waterside workers and escape the consequences. Members of the Wharf vernment. Labourers Union, as a result of taunts and jeers, might be induced to resort' acts or statements calculated to cause .much trouble. I hope that the GovernHunter ment will see that this man Baker is not allowed any advantage over and above that enjoyed by the members of the Wharf Labourers Union. If there proof that Baker is trying to foment trouble, he should be required to give undertaking, just as the members of the Wharf Labourers Union have done, in dependants: order that disorder may not occur.",51
232,Mr FENTON,WHARF LABOURERS UNIONAND LOYALISTS,"Maribyrnong) [4.6] It is 'stated in the press that, while the Government, unfortunately, do not intend to introduce this session a general Tariff Bill, they propose, by regulation, OT other means, to give a certain measure, of Protection to industries ' established during the period of the war. This Parliament will not be able to touch the Tariff, although industries are languishing. I have learned this morning, on the. very best authority, that 75 per cent, of the' hands in a very big industry have been discharged, because it is impossible to compete against importations from.
