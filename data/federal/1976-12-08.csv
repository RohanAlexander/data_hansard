3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RAILWAY COMPANY,"I have had no response from the company to this point. I am somewhat disappointed with that, especially in view of the unanimity and strength of the Senate committee's report on this matter which made it House quite plain that as a result of devaluation the The petcompany would be able to continue in full production at no greater cost disadvantage to itself than if it dismissed 400 people and reduced proPetrol duction. Obviously, of course, if world copper prices improved further as a result of the increasing higher production, the company's position would improve much more markedly than it would if it reduced production. I have not yet had a response and I only hope that the company will be able to respond adequately to the Senate committee's report. CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS: SECURITY NA",18
4,Mr BONNETT,LEAKS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Defence. I refer to funher allegations made in the Bulletin this week regarding security leaks.

The tense which is used is the past tense. It is the present tense; indeed, could say it is the continuing tense. I want to states: repudiate as explicitly as I can the allegations as they may apply to any time after November wonder 1975. The only evidence-th deserves to be in quotation marks-whic author of the article produces in support of contention is: Drafts of the recent so-called White Paper on were leaked many weeks before the final governmentpanic authorised version was tabled in parliament. I ignore the pejorative and tendentious guage which the author uses, but if any draft the White Paper was leaked I expect that would have been published. Where was published? Possibly the author may be peremphasised suaded to inform the House where it was published. If there had been a leak I would regard it as passing strange that the draft would not have been pubhshed somewhere. There has not been to my knowledge, nor to the knowledge of my advisers, any publication of any draft the White Paper. Further andfinally,I refer this allegation in the article: It just does not do to run a little publicity campaign favour of security for the nation's defence secrets. defamed under parliamentary privilege . . . I am not aware of having said anything about the author that represents defamation, but if any misgiving on the point I will gladly say it side the Parhament. As further earnest of attitude on this I understood that the proprietor of this newspaper was a person with a strong entrepreneurial sense. I conveyed to him a sage that I wouldfindit immensely agreeable for the author of the article to appear on television, to stand in a witness box and to be crossor examined by me for half an hour. I laid down one condition-that the television program of should be Uve. I hope that possibly they may reflect on the invitation and take it up.

5,Mr STEWART,OVERSEAS CAPITAL INFLOW,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Was the panic decision announced yesterday, to revalue the Australian dollar again, caused by the alarming rate of capital inflow? What was the amount of capital inflow since the announcement of the 17VS per cent devaluation? Are our present methods of control defective? Is a new system of control under conIf so, is it to be other than the variable ratio scheme?

Mr LYNCH-The decision that was taken his yesterday on the advice of the Government's technical committee on movements in defence Australia's exchange rate was certainly not a decision. The movement in the exchange rate should not have come as a shock in any lansense. People who perceive that decision as a of shock faU to digest the impUcations of the stateit ment that was put down on 28 November. As it honourable members should recall, I then-I emphasise it again-that the exchange rate system would be administered moreflexiblyso as to avoid major shifts in the exchange rate. In this sense there necessarily will be a period of adjustment in which to learn to Uve with the revised basis. Obviously that proof cess will taketime.Most industrialised countries to have Uved with comparable systems over a period of many years.

As is well known, therisksof my exchange rate changes can be minimised by using forward cover facUities that are avaUable through the banking system. In that sense I emmesphasise to the honourable gentleman that the flexibiUty of the system ought to be understood and comprehended, even if that understanding comprehension will take a Uttle time, throughbut out the general community. There was no sense alarm about capital moving into the country. I do not disclose thefigureshere, for the reasons I now mentioned yesterday in response to a question asked by, I think, the Deputy Leader of the OpI position. In responding to that question, as hurt honourable members wdl recall, I made it perfectly clear that the Government's arms of poUcy are avaUable to monitor and control the situation as appropriate.

6,Mr LLO YD,DAIRY INDUSTRY,"The Minister for Primary Industry will be aware of the concern in the dairy industry that the Government has not announced the continuation of underwriting of skim nulk powder, butter, cheese and casein for the final 6 months of the current production from 1 January to 30 June 1977. decision be made? When it is being considered will the Minister put to Cabinet that be an increased level of underwriting to allow a payment of approximately 65c per lb for fat in milk? Does the Minister agree that, as the firmer trend for exports plus devaluation will mean the actual governmentfinancialcontribution the underwriting will be minimal or non-existent and as the present return of approximately 60c inadequate, 65c is the more correct level underwriting?",19
7,Mr SINCLAIR,DAIRY INDUSTRY,"I think every member of the destabilising House knows the assiduous way in which the honourable member for Murray represents his other industries, particularly those which vantaged as the dairy industry has been. justification for examination of the future of underwriting, following the devaluation of the Australian currency. The assessment made by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics is that there is expected to be an increase of about $9m in receipts for the industry as a result of change in currency values. In addition, there quite significant improving demand for dairy products in various world markets. At the recent Australian Agricultural meeting discussion was undertaken between the the Commonwealth and the States regarding the cided to move to a managed future of underwriting. If there is to be an extenas to be able to avoid large sion it would, of course, be a matter of between the Commonwealth and the States. I disruptive impacts on the Australiansevere trust that in that Ught, and as a result of the have devaluation of the Australian currency, there would be a possibUity of providing some extensystemadjust sion of the scheme for thefirst6 months of next year. Nonetheless, the Government not conluded its consideration of the matter. I take on board the honourable gentleman's suggestion that there might be an increase in amount. However, I think it might be said that even at present price expectations unfortunately the returns on export markets will nificantly less than the cost of providing that 65c per lb underwriting. Part of the difficulty in the industry is the need to estabUsh future production levels that might more reasonably meet the expected world demand. It has certainly a product of State decisions that there is a sigtrial nificant reduction in production this year. But an undue level of assistance were to be given to the industry I wonder to what degree that might encourage production above that which can reasonably sold. I take on board the honourable gentleman's suggestion and I will ensure that year, considered by the Government when this matter When will the is before it. there should CHANGES IN AUSTRALIA'S EXCHANGE NA",20
8,Mr ARMITAGE,RATE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Does the revaluation of yesterday that suggest that under the new currency arrangeto ments very frequent changes will occur in Australia's exchange rate? WUl this unsettle is business confidence and create surges of specuof lative hot money flowing in and out of our reserves? Would it not be better to manage the such as the capital flows through regulations vanable deposit ratio scheme and banking controls rather than by such conare as disadfusing exchange rate changes? There is Mr LYNCH-The honourable gentleman completely misunderstands the nature of the new regime. One of the reasons for the new system is to obviate speculation which, as the honourable gentleman ought well to understand, can buUd up where there are long periods in which there is the no movement of the exchange rate, as has been is a the case in recent years since September 1974 and as was the case specifically during the course of recent months when there was major specuCouncU lationhonourable as to the nature of the move itself.

10,Mr MCLEAN,NATIONAL WAGES POLICY,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. Is the right honourable gentlebeen man aware that the Western Australian IndusCommission is to pass on the full consumer if price indexrisesfor the next 3 quarters to all workers under its State awards? Is not wages policy an important part of any national economic be management program? What can this Government do to rectify the ridiculous situation where it is a major weapon of national economic policy is determined by 6 State wage-fixing bodies movqueried. ing in their own separate ways, the Commonter wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission possibly moving in another direction, and government pohcy possibly moving in none of these directions? Is this not further justification for the introduction of a national incomes policy?",20
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATIONAL WAGES POLICY,"The early reports mately of the Perth decision may not be completely curate, because I have advice that the decision the Western Australian Industrial Commission to apply the Perth consumer price index to the State minimum wage, not right through the whole wage structure. If that is so, it is something very much less than full indexation and may what the shadow Minister had in mind when he said on television a day or two ago that the position's pohcy was not full indexation. He left that in a rather vague sort of framework. ously there are problems when a Commonthe wealth jurisdiction and State jurisdictions can compete and can leapfrog. On our present possible. advice, the decision of the Perth Commission not irresponsible but I would like to see full detaUs of the judgment to know exactly what the Commission intends. There are States which ing claim that their wages boards and wage fixing criteria follow very closely those of the ConcUiaware ation and Arbitration Commission. Therefore, that makes it all the more important that the bitration Commission set a lead in its determinafull tions and realises that it will be having a great influence not only on its immediate awards but also on awards determined by State authorities. had discussions with Sir Charles Court about activities in Western Australia because in prenot vious times, and during national wage case very hearings, the Western Australian Industrial Commission had gone much further than this last decision. It would appear to me that this is a much more responsible decision than was reported earlier this morning and a much more responsible position than that adopted earUer this year. NA",21
12,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEVALUATION,"Did the Treasurer, in tions his devaluation statement, cite wage increases, especially the 2.2 per cent September quarter increase, as a major reason for devaluation? Does he recall that his Budget Paper No. 1 tax estimated that average earnings would increase by 12 per cent this financial year? How does reconcUe the 2 matters?",21
13,Mr LYNCH,DEVALUATION,"I am not sure that I picked up the point which the honourable gentleman Ifi did not, I invite him to raise the matagain with me during questiontime.As I recall what he was querying, it was the basis upon which there were references to the question of wage and salary increases in the context of the decision to devalue. As senior Ministers have made perfectly clear, both in this House and outside, one of the underlying reasons which ultiled to devaluation was the very heavy lift acin wage and salary movements over a considerof able period. I refer particularly to the honourable is gentleman's period in government. As I have repeated on other occasions, during the last 6 years wages in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130 per cent, compared with 53 be r cent in the United States and 70 per cent in w est Germany. Clearly, on any reasonable readOping of the basis of the movement in wage and salary levels in recent years, that was a position Obviwhich was not sustainable. The Government at same time, because of anti-inflationary strategy, had determined to hold the rate as long as The more recent decision, whUe in that is general context, paid very heavy heed to the inevitabUity of a movement in the rate which arose from the very significant speculation durthe course of the past 3 months. As to the 2.2 per cent, the honourable gentleman ought to be that the Budget assumptions bore in mind a continuation of plateau indexation. The 2.2 per Arcent increase, which was the passing on of the consumer price index increase in that quarter, would therefore have been inconsistent with the Budget assumptions. For that reason, it I was one of the factors which was pointed to the statement concerning devaluation, but it ought to be seen by the honourable gentleman as a significant factor against the other areas of consideration that I have mentioned. NA",21
14,Mr CORBETT,AUXILIARY FIREMEN,Is the Treasurer aware of the difficulty of some fire brigade boards in finding suitable persons wUUng to act as auxUiary firemen? Is he aware also that the deduction of 35 per cent of the aUowances now necessary under the provisions of the Income Tax Act has caused dissatisfaction and may cause resignaof people who wiU be difficult to replace? Will the Government examine the position to see whether some way can be provided for payments to auxUiary firemen to be exempted from income so as to assist fire brigades in engaging auxUiaryfiremenand so obtain the necessary manhe power in case offireor other disaster where the fire brigade is called for help?,21
15,Mr LYNCH,AUXILIARY FIREMEN,"I thank the honourable gentleman for raising this question. I am very much aware, as indeed are all members of the Government, of the service contributed by voluntary firemen in the honourable gentleman's electorpanies, ate and elsewhere in Austraha. I know that they, together with other members of the community, are concerned about the levels of taxation which now prevail. The Government is very much cerned about those high levels of taxation. As Prime Minister and I have consistently to emphasised, the Government is committed to fore reducing the level of personal taxation as soon we responsibly can. The deduction of taxation at the rate of 35c in prices the dollar from the earnings of auxiliary firemen reflects the fact that under current tax scales that rate, or even a higher rate, is usually the rate that applies when the additional income is included in the person's end of the year tax assessment Deductions at the rate of 35c in the dollar help avoid the situation in which people have to very large tax bill at the end of the year. earnings of auxUiaryfiremen,Uke the pay and additional earnings of other people giving vice to the community, have long been taxable. So in that sense this is not a new principle. question raised by the honourable gentleman will certainly be given careful consideration. am grateful that he has mentioned it in the House! That consideration will be given to the Government in the general context of the review of the personal income tax system. NA",21
16,Mr UREN,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I ask the Treasurer: that, as he stated in reply to the honourable have been forthwith beheaded and member for Perth last Monday, devaluation not inflationary if there is surplus industrial pacity? Is this true of other expansionary poUcommunist cies? Why has the Treasurer never seen this Cambodia and simple fact before?",22
17,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"That was rather a hodge-podge series of questions. What I said in the House that devaluation added to the increase in the price mechanism. That is on the record. No ister of this Government has denied devaluation does have an inflationary consequence. But what we have gone on to say unlike the action of the Labor Government in devaluation in September 1974, this Governber ment, concerned about the inflationary consedetaUed quence of the devaluation, moved to take offsethas ting action in relation to the fiscal side, the etary side and in relation to wages policy. Those matters were referred to in the original statewho ment, which has been followed by statements other Ministers relating to matters which fall within their own jurisdiction. As to the under-capacity and under-utUisation of resources in particular industries and comI said to the honourable member for Perth at the time that, in looking at the inflationary consequence of devaluation, one should not ignore the fact that a large number of manuconfacturers are working under capacity at the the present time and that they would have an abUity raise output and to lower unit costs and thereto hold prices in their particular industries in as the devaluation context. The Government has been advised of some significant areas where will be held, but that is a matter of confidence panies concerned.between the Government and the comNA",22
18,Mr WENTWORTH,CAMBODIA,"I direct my question to to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the face a wholesale murder of men, women and cluldren The which has been perpetrated and which is still being perpetrated by the Cambodian communist serregime for the purpose of terrorising the Cambodian people. I ask: What information is The avaUable to the Government about detaUs of these shocking occurrences in Cambodia? Can I the Minister confirm that, for the purpose of increasing the impact of their terror campaign, it by the Cambodian communists forbid exit from Cambodia and, as a matter of routine, execute any Cambodian refugees whom they can apprehend? Has the Government any detaUs of the recent incident when 26 Cambodian refugees, Is it a fact border by chUdren, including were returned across the the Thai authorities by are said to the Khmer is Rouge, that is, the Cambodian communists? caFinally, will the Minister see that detaUs of such atrocities which customarily occur in elsewhere receive adequate publicity in Australia so that such publicity may nave some deterrent effect upon those who perpetrate was these atrocities and so that Australian communists who are associated with this foul movement Minmay receive the detestation and execration that which is their proper due?  its series of questions which the honourable memfor Mackellar has asked. We do not have information on all the matters which he put to me. I take the point made at the end of monhis question about selective commentaries which are made not only in the media but also by those take an interest in international relations by about the restrictions on human rights and a prejudice even to the right to life in certain countries. It is quite apparent that many countries are selected and commented upon because of the nature of their regime. Others are left aside for that very same reason. The reality, from our point of view, is that we have difficulty in getting accurate confirmation of the charges-som e evidently well founded-as to what has been transpiring in Cambodia. It is a fact that the previous Australian Government recognised the present Government of Cambodia, I think on 17 April 1975. It has been the view of this Government that it would not be in the interest of the peaceful development of Cambodia and of the South East Asian region to withdraw that recognition. I have already indicated in the House that Australia is not represented in Phnom Penh that formal diplomatic relations have not been estabUshed with Cambodia. I have, of course, previously given to the House detaUs regarding this matter and there is probably Uttle to add the comments I made about it back in April. pointed out then, as I have today, that Australia had no direct diplomatic representation in the country but that we had received various reports, some of them apparently well sourced. I have wealth said that if the reports were true-in certain instances we believe them to be true-n o governgovernment ment, no matter what its political complexion, own. One Legal could condone them. I repeat that we deplore Australian atrocities and breaches of humanrightswherever they occur but particularly in regard to the charges which are made about Cambodia. While recognising that there has, in fact, been some delegal cline in reports of atrocities in recent months, nevertheless I shall see whether I can check the Grayndler would matters about exit and entry from ThaUand to which the honourable member referred and provide authoritative opinion to honourable aid members. I repeat that if the reports are true no officers government could condone the actions. NA",22
19,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I direct my question to the Attorney-General. I refer him to resolutions carried at meetings of the Australian Legal Aid Office Staff Association which mend that Association members not accept transfers to State organisations in the light of arrangements countenanced by himself. Does the honourable gentleman intend to reconsider week? his hastily conceived plans to transfer full responsibUity for the functions of the Australian Legal Aid Office to the States? Further, wiU continue to induce transfers of staff from Australian Legal Aid Office to the commissions established by the States?",23
20,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"As I have indicated before in this House, the discussions with the States are continuing. Those discussions are designed to preserve the position of the staff involved. No final arrangements have been reached with the State of Western Australia in relation to either the form of the legislation or the conditions and terms upon which staff would be taken over by the State of Western Australia. Discussions are going on with that State and with the State of South Australia. I understand that some discussions will be held later this week with the State of Queensland in relation to this matter. I am going along steadUy, pursuing the objective which I indicated the Government had adopted earUer this year-that is, to set up an independent commission in each State. During the discussions and officers of my Department wiU continue to attempt to obtain conditions which will preserve the situation of staff. The staff are being consulted in the course of those discussions and I to hope that anyfinalarrangements that are arrived I at will succeed in preserving their position. officers Some people seem to believe that when the go across they will remain CommonpubUc servants. It has always been clear that these commissions will be independent of and that they will have staff of their of the basic problems with the Aid Office at the moment is that the officers are officers of my Department and on occasions I am in the difficult situation where I am the prosecutor in relation to an applicant for aid and at the same time my officers are appearing ition. I hopefor him. That is a most undesirable posthat the honourable member for agree with me that it is undesirable and that therefore the officers of the legal commissions should be independent of government. It was never my view that the would or could remain Commonwealth public servants. However, their terms and conditions of work and their salary structure should be no less favourable than they are at present. NA recom Mr HODGES-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How did the Government arrive the at thefigureof 17Vi per cent for the devaluation of the Australian dollar announced last Sunday",23
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"In the debate that has gone on over the last few days I think he people have tended to forget the options that the were given to the Government in the week before the decision was made. Those options were, on the one hand, to borrow $ 1,000m in an effort to stave off a change in the rate or, on the other hand, to devalue. In those circumstances the Government took the course of devaluing, for reasons which I think are now clearly understood. The other course, of borrowing $l,000m, would have left a situation in which there would have been continuing doubt as to whether the moves would be successful, especially in the light of statements by former Treasurers that devaluation would be inevitable at some stage. I am well advised that those statements had been noted overseas. Therefore it was quite plain that the Government had to take a decision of a kind that would end speculation. The decision to devalue by 17& per cent was taken after full consultation with official advisers. It was designed to stop the drift that had continued and the views that had been expressed about the value of the Australian dollar. I think that it was infinitely preferable to take a decision of that kind rather than one that would leave continuing doubt, continuing drift and continuing speculation as to whether the rate could be held. NA",23
22,Mr UREN,CURRENCY REVALUATION,I ask the Prime Minister how the Government reached its decision to revalue the dollar by 2 per cent.,24
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY REVALUATION,"The honourable gendeman should be thanked for that question; and so I do. The Treasurer made it quite plain in his original statement that there would be an administered, controlled management of the value of the Australian dollar. Quite plainly, in a situation in which a government is looking at the method of controlling or managing the external value of its own currency a number of options are open to it. It can move to a furtherfixedpoint which leads to a situation in which at some time in the future there is likely to be perhaps a significant move either upwards or downwards. This is always accompanied by a massive debate of one kind or another. Or it is possible to have a float as many of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries have as well as the United States, West Germany and Japan, which can be clean or dirty depending on the extent to which the country intervenes in its own markets. But that results in daUy movements in the actual value of currencies. Nobody seems to find it particularly surprising that there are daUy movements in those rates. A lot of humbug has gone on about the move that was announced a short while ago by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It would have been just as relevant to say that a country managing a floating rate would not be allowed to move that rate for one day, for one week or for a certain fixed period of time. It would have been just as much humbug to say in those circumstances that if a currency was floating, as the United States' is, it ought not to move and that people ought to be surprised if it moved. For people to be surprised at the movement that occurred on the initiative of the Governor and precisely as officials recommended is sheer and absolute humbug. I believe that under these circumstances and having regard to the totality of the situation honourable gentlemen ought to be satisfied and content that on technical grounds it was possible to make the move that was in fact made. It would have been an odd circumstance, having announced an administered and controlled float, if honourable members then felt that there would be no move for 12 months or 2 years. Just what did people expect under the circumstances? There were two or three options. We could move to afixedpoint; we could have a fully market-determinedfloatvirtually on a daUy basis; or we could have an administered and controlled float, as we determined. The changes in that will be taken on technical grounds. For a country in Australia's circumstance I have no doubt at all that it is the best choice that could have been made.",24

Can the Minister indicate when the quota entitlement arrangewere reading it. ments for the 1977 meat export season will be finalised?,25
34,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT QUOTAS,"Unfortunately at this stage, I understand, the consortium of compames involved in the latest sale of meat to Russia does not include a Tasmanian company. Nonetheless there is every reason to expect that if the trends that are emerging are fulfilled the Tasmanian industry, which I know has just commenced a new killing season, can expect significantly improved returns on those that were available during 1976. A very profound and extensive examination of the circumstances of the Meat Board proposal for diversification entitlements to the United States market, as it would affect the entitlement of Tasmanian exporters, has undertaken by the Meat Board over the last weeks. The Meat Board has put a proposal me, and there is no doubt that as a result of what-stated ever changes are implemented, the Tasmanian exporting position will be protected. However, discussions are continuing and as a result it has been suggested that it might be preferable to what is happening with respect to the United States negotiations and with a number of other negotiations before the changed arrangements are concluded. It would be regrettable if, changes having been made, further changes were found to be necessary within the course of few days or a week. Therefore, it is not possible this morning in reply to the honourable gentleand man to tell him definitively the degree to which changes may be applied to diversification entitlement proposals. However, I can assure him that there is a recogmuon of the disabilities of Tasmania. Whatever the new entitlements, they will be directed so that Tasmanian meat works and exporters will not be disadvantaged their entitlements for entrance to the United States market in 1977. question MOTOR SPIRIT: LEAD PHASE-DOWN be Mr E.

In that context the Government made it very clear in the election campaign that it would move to make significant amendments in this area. Those amendments were included in the Budget Speech. They were very significant in reducing the considerable degree of hardship faced by in people as a consequence of the imposition of Commonwealth estate duty.

Chris Hurford: I am certainly in favour of an icy of which wage indexation is certainly a very important part. All I suggested in the quotation selectively chosen by the Prime Minister was that no sponsible economic policy maker would suggest that any policy is sacrosanct for ever in this Policy depends on the state of the economy at time.

55,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,MCPhersonof Blue Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer)-For the inforfactory mation of honourable members. I present a disexample cussion paper entitled A Natural Disaster and Insurance Scheme for Australia. I seek leave make a short statement relating to that matter.,27
56,Mr SPEAKER,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",27
57,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"In March 1976 the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced that the Government had decided in principle to introduce a natural disaster insurance scheme and had approved the establishment of a ing pany of officials to formulate a detailed scheme in consultation with the insurance industry. An assessment of the working party's report has recently been completed and the discussion paper now tabled is based on that report. The does not attempt to discuss the question of natural disaster crop insurance which is under consideration in conjunction with representatives of the insurance industry. I should emphasise that, while the discussion outlines proposals for a scheme, the that I am not in as it believes is that Government not committed to these proposals, final decisions on the detailed selectively nature of the scheme not be taken until all interested business and have which been given every opportunity to make their views known. With this in mind the Government the Comis seeking comments on the proposal and issues discussed in the paper so that it can proceed and so further with the detailed development of a scheme. In line with recommendations of the working party, the Government has agreed that technical full wage aspects of the scheme should be worked out by a incomes polcommittee with the relevant expertise. The insurance industry will be represented on that committee. It should be noted that the studies already undertaken indicate that much planning reand testing remain to be carried out before a scheme can be devised that will effectively meet area. the community's need for adequate protection the against losses resulting from natural hazards. Although time-consuming, the Government sees this work as essential to the achievement of its aim to introduce a sound and effective scheme in wage Australia as soon as possible.",27
58,Mr HURFORD,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"by leave-The subject of natural disaster insurance has been before this House now for more than 10 years. This SCHEME is just one more episode in the saga. It can be compared to Blue Hills. I hope that, as in the case Hills, one day we will have an episode which means that the matter has reached a satisconclusion. I suggest that this is another of lack of action by the Liberal Party the National Country Party. I draw attention to to the fact that as long ago as 18 April 1967 a member of the present Cabinet, the Minister for Defence (Mr KiUen), as the honourable member for Moreton asked a question of the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon), on this very subject. The subject has been taken up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). He asked questions on notice on this matter and workreceived answers on 4 October 1967, 26 November 1968, 26 September 1969, 12 June 1970 and 9 December 1971.I am indebted to the honourable gentleman's prodigious memory for drawing to my attention the way in which this important subject of insuring and providing proper compensation for the victims of natural disasters has gone on and on in this House. There is no excuse for lack of action on the part of the present conservatives who rule us. They were responsible when we were in office between 1972 and 1975 for stopping legislation relating to the Australian Government Insurance Corporation which contained specific proposals to cover the victims of natural disasters. So we can lay at the feet of the Liberal and National Country parties the fact that inadequate cover is still given to many victims of natural disasters in this country who suffer losses as a result of these terrible events. I want to commend the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) in particular who has worked persistently since he arrived in this House on the same day as I did at the end of 1969 to bring to the attention of the House the lack of insurance cover in this area. I hope that instead of the establishment of more working parties, more committees and more investigations, which is all that we heard of in the statement made by the Minister, some decisions will be made and some action will be taken so that the victims are properly covered. Every year we get a new example of the need for such cover. I ask that the next time the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) rises to speak on this subject-and I hope it will be very soon-it will be to announce action and not just the estabUshment of another committee.",27
59,Mr JACOBI,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE, I seek leave to make a short statement.,28
60,Mr SPEAKER,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",28
61,Mr JACOBI,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"I would Uke to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). Subsequent to the setting up of the initial working party I found regrettably that State government insurance offices were not represented on that body. I think that was a deplorable omission on the part of the then Government and Treasurer. I make the plea that the State government insurance commissions have a large slice of the insurance market. There is no doubt at all that because of their contribution, responsibUities and knowledge in this area it is important that they ought to be listened to and that they ought to be heard. I am asking the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to ensure that representatives from the State government insurance commissions are included in the technical working party. In my view there is no question at all that the area of natural disaster insurance is a very technical one. So too is the question of crop insurance. But I agree that the latter area ought to be kept separate from the issue before the Parliament at the moment. NA",28

63,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I bring up the Committee's report entitled Canberra city wastes- A long-term strategyfor collection and disposal Due to the limited number avaUable copies of the report have been placed in the Parliamentary Library and the BUls and Papers Office of the House of Representatives. Ordered that the report be printed.,28
64,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,I seek leave of the House to make a statement in connection with the report.,28
65,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",28
66,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"This report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory examines and makes recommendations concerning the system of waste collection, disposal and management in Canberra. The Committee has placed particular emphasis on the need to find some alternative to the traditional landfill method of disposal which makes little provision for the recovery and re-use of important resources. The report stresses the need to preserve many resources such as metal, glass and paper which are often indiscriminately disposed of in the existing system of waste coUection and disposal. The Committee has therefore examined alternative waste collection methods, both for domestic and other waste materials, and has examined new technology avaUable to separate resources before final disposal or for recycUng. It is essential that these matters are constantly reviewed by planning and management authorities so that proposals for the introduction of new arrangements or disposal techniques in the Capital Territory should be most effective available given the size of the ritory and the related region, which may be associated in this respect, and the need to re-use important materials. This is a responsibility should be ready to accept and on which we should begin to take action now to preserve vital resources. There are a number of recommendations conbegin cerning recycling and the need for increased public awareness of the benefits of measures to inevitable conserve valuable materials which are currently recommendations disposed of simply as 'waste'. This need to recycle resources led the Committee to question some aspects of the National Capital Developassumptions ment Commission's and the Department of the materialsand Capital Territory's approach to the landfill method of waste disposal. This is not to suggest that any existing method for disposal should ennumber tirely replace the landfill method. The need for landfill will remain for the foreseeable future. But a number of measures could be taken to overcome some apparent problems with this means of disposal. For example, 'tips' should be sited so as to cause the least inconvenience to public. Access roads and approaches should ate the least possible nuisance to residents either as a result of heavy traffic at because of litter falling from trailers and trucks on their way to disposal sites. We refer to problems that have arisen, for example, in Belconnen. deal These sites should also be managed can be converted to community use in the that the Committee might shortest possible time after the landfill process has been completed. It was also felt that if the authorities encouraged separation of recyclable items collection and re-use, the impact of landfill could be reduced. This led the Committee to question the 'total collection' system suggested by NCDC and the Department of the Capital Territory. This method does not in the Committee's view do enough to facilitate recovery of resources might, in effect, discourage separation and reference recycling, The Committee has therefore suggested a scheme whereby separate containers would be that suppUed to householders for the collection of issue particular classes of waste such as paper, glass and metal. An intensive and concerted advertising and information campaign would be the required to ensure the pubUc co-operation essenreport. tial for the success of the scheme. The Committee has recommended that a pilot study be ducted to test the scheme's feasibility. We do claim to have found an answer to the waste disposal problem. But the Committee was the impressed by the necessity for communities to Terbegin examining and, where possible, introducing systems for the collection and disposal of waste whereby resource conservation, recovery we and recycling are seen as essential goals. The Committee is not as concerned that its proposed scheme be implemented in every particular as to be assured that the authorities in the A.C.T. will to move in the directions indicated by the plulosophy behind the proposals. We consider moves in these directions to be essential and for aU communities. We hope the of the Committee will be seen as contributing to this process of reassessing and testing new means of collecting disposing of the vast quantities of'waste' generated by our society. The Committee was also concerned tofinda of deficiencies in legislation in the A.C.T. relating to the issues before it. These arise in such areas as the enforcement of regulations which deal with littering, pollution of the air and disposal of radioactive waste. The Committee has directed the attention of the Minister for the the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) and his departcrement and the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly to these matters which should be dealt with as soon particular times or as practicable. In this brief statement. I have not attempted to with all the main issues considered by the so that they dations. Theorsubject Committee on which it has made recommenis one of such complexity well have extended its inquiry. Although this reference has been with the Committee for 2 years, the present Committee had only one of the former Committee for among its members. The Committee has also undertaken a considerable work load during the current period of sittings. Members will recall that 2 substantial reports on proposals to vary the plan of Canberra have been presented in the past 2 months. Thus, whUe the Committee could and well hive dealt with some aspects of the before it in greater detail, for example thefinancialimplications of various schemes of collection and waste disposal, it was considered the report should be presented at this stage as a contribution to the growing debate on the with which it deals. I would also draw the attention of members to bibliography which will be printed with the This was prepared by the staff of the Parliamentary Library. The Committee was conimpressed with the range and comprehennot siveness of this bibUography and felt that it should be made avaUable to the Parliament and the public through this report. Unfortunately printed copies of the report will not be available for distribution today. It was not possible printing to be completed. Copies of the report will, however, become available within the next 2 weeks. I would like to conclude by thanking all members of the Committee for the time and effort called on. they have put into producing this report at a time when the Parliament has been particularly busy. I would also like to thank, on behalf members of the Committee, the staff retariat who have put in an enormous amount of effort to ensure that this report could be presented before the Parhamentrises.I know that all members are aware of the contribution which staff of the parliamentary departments fremight quently make in such circumstances but I would like to pay special tribute on this occasion work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee I commend the report to the House.",28
67,Mr HASLEM,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"by leave-I support the remarks of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) on the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. The difficulty with waste disposal in a modern something which will come before Canberra grows. Waste disposal is a very expensive part of the municipal account. In a city such as Canberra, where there seems to be plenty of land, it would be very tempting who are responsible for the administration of the city and for those who will be responsible for the stituting adrninistration of the city as it is passed over to the local government area to take the cheap way out. This report will be very important people in local government as autonomy grows debate closer, as it indicates the options that are before them so that they can approach the matter in responsible way.

Upon which Mr Keating had moved by way of for those of us amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'while not opposing the provisions of the Bill the House is concerned that the proposed agreement is restricted to land-based primary industries'. to those Mr SIMON (MCMillan) (11.44)-When the on this significant Bill was interrupted last evening, honourable members will recall, I was a speaking on that part of the Bill dealing with household support. I was referring to an article for written by Mr Ronald Anderson and published last Friday's Age. He analysed a report prepared for the Australian National Cattlemens' Council on the state of the beef farmer in Austraha. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics to in the ANCC report forecast for 1976-77 that 13 490 producers with 2.83 million head of cattle, with an average herd size of 210 beasts, are in the category of recording net loss ranging from 0 to $5,000. The statistics to which I have referred reflect considerable human suffering in the rural sectorsuffering which will to some extent at least be alleviated by the household support scheme referred to in part 7 of the Agreement set out in this Bill. I have referred only to beef and milk producers who will have no income in the current year. That will have personal consequences to the farmer and his family and will flow through to the whole rural community-the shopkeeper, poses. the supplier of rural machinery, the rate collector ployment. from the local municipality, the bank manager Employment giving consideration to realisation of security or considering deferment of payment interest on the farmer's loan. The whole comdesperate munity will benefit from the introduction household support scheme. Honourable members will recall the variation of conditions of eligibility for unemployment benefits introduced in May this year.

Household support must not replace necessity to present a rural adjustment the farmer's entitlement to unemployment Parliament. No doubt it would be a matter benefit. I refer briefly to the nature of the assistgreat ance. I quote from clause (3) of Part 7 of Agreement: (a) An advance provided for one year sufficient the applicant's estimated future income from all sources the level of payment which were eUgible for unemployment benefits. two years may be allowed at in those cases where a demonstrable effort has been move out of farming. Paragraph (e) states: If the Authority determines that an appUcant does not have a viable enterprise he will be eUgible for household suppon assistance, and any interim assistance he received will beregardedas household suppon assistance. Paragraph (i) states: At the end of the first farmer receives household suppon assistance the made to him may be convened by the Authority to a grant. Paragraph (j) of the same clause states: If the farmer adjusts out of farming within thetimehefirstreceivedhousehold suppon, any advances made to him and not already converted to a grant may be so converted by the Authority. The benefits contained in this Bill will prove considerable advantage to the rural community. It is socially desirable that farmers be assured income when either markets collapse, natural disasters occur, or other matters beyond their control intervene to provide them with a basic income to sustain a lifestyle in rural Australia. I trust that the Government and the respective State governments will closely monitor the pracbasis, tical apphcation of the terms of the ensure that the intent of this Bill is honoured that the impoverished farmer receives the benefits thereby granted. It is pleasing to note that the Agreement provides for a review in the terms of clause 24, which states: The operation of the Scheme in relation to all of will be reviewed fromtimetotimeas appropriate by Commonwealth and the States in the Ught of experience its administration. The following clause states: The Authorities of the States and appropriate wealth officers associated with the Schemes for Rural Adjustment will meet together as appropriate and at once in each year and exchange informauon on any matters pertinent to the Schemes. commend the terms of the Bill to the House and if reject the amendment moved by the Opposition. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darting) (11.52)- I supStates Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill with the sensible amendment the honourable member would for Blaxland (Mr Keating). think I can say that regret the Bill to this of satisfaction to any government if its Ministhe ter for Primary Industry could report to the House that there was no need for rural adjust to raise ment schemes and if resources moved in and out to of an industry according to the demands of the would be appUcable to him if he An extension to prevailing market situation. the discretion of the Authority made to Although it is admitted that a decUne in advancement in market demands does play a big part in the viabitity of our rural industries, I think it can be said that if resources were put into and taken out of the industry to meet only a current may have and what could be short term situation, many valuable resources would be wasted and, additionally, the full potential of our national resources would never be properly developed. period of six months for which a advances Because governments recognise this fact, nationally organised and supervised reconstruction and adjustment schemes have been adopted, not only in Australia but also in most three years of other developed countries. I believe that an examination of the situation in the beef industry indicates the value of a propof erly organised national adjustment scheme. We had over-production of thousands of heads of of cattle and thousands were destroyed so that the healthier cattle could survive and produce the next generation of cattle. There is no doubt that government measures did provide some assistance in this area, but probably if our rural adjustment schemes were conducted on a continuing as is intended with this scheme, greater asAgreement to sistance could be given. and Unfortunately, many people seem to think that primary producers are businessmen, the same as any other businessmen; that they make a business decision to go into extra production and if they misjudge the market situation they should the States suffer the consequences. This argument does the carry a lot of validity. To a large degree, it is in exactly what does happen in our primary industries. When I entered this Parliament many farmers in my electorate had properties worth Common- $160,000. Within a couple of years they were heavily in debt and could not sell their properties least for $60,000.1 think this is a good indication that primary producers do take a businessrisk,the same as any other section of our society. Indeed, they suffer the penalties not only of a bad business decision but also of variations in weather conditions and a lot of other things. It is not intended that this Bill should beimplemented to change that situation. What it will allow will be some adjustment and reconstruction to take place once farmers find themselves in difficulty as a result of those adverse conditions. It will prevent valuable resources being lost and will permit those farmers to remain in the industry, thereby producing further wealth for this country. The second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) includes a statement similar to the following, which appears at page 3 of the Industries Assistance Commission report: Much of the adjustment which is necessary and appropriate to the long term economic situation in the rural occuned, and will continue to occur, autonomously. I have no argument with that. But the IAC report goes on to state: . . . not all resources manner which would achieve their more efficient Further on the report points out: Timely government intervention can provide welfare assistance to seriously affected farmers as well as providing the financial means to ensure that resources continue in those industries where their earning power is greatest. No doubt the Bill was drawn up with these things in mind. Unfortunately, when worthwhile legiswho lation such as this Bill comes before the House is not always readily accepted. I believe this because so many of our rural assistance Bills have provided assistance to the wrong people. Much of the assistance has gone to people who are not in need of assistance. Often Uttle assistthe ance goes to those most in need. Honourable vision members no doubt remember the situation with the superphosphate bounty, which was a good example of this. Seventy per cent ance provided by that bounty went to 20 per cent of the farmers. The National Times of 23 February 1976 repersonal ported that 472 users benefited by more $5,000. If we want to go a Uttle further, other papers reported that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) received $50,000 in 10 applicant's years. I do not know whether that isright;he level may have received only $49,000. But it is nice know that this Bill is not intended for that purI pose. I merely mention that to point out that one part of the Bill this superphosphate menin taUty shows its ugly head again. But I do not think it is the intention of the Bill to provide sort of assistance. It is meant to provide ance to appUcants whose prospects are sound who are unable to obtain finance to carry on and are in danger of losing their property or other assets. Part 3 of the Bill provides for farm buUd-up, which provides for the amalgamation of properties, whereby someone on an uneconomic property can buy an adjoining property if he can prove that by doing so he will become viable. I think that this is a praiseworthy measure. Unfortunately, I have some doubt about other paragraphs of that Part which allow an economic property owner to buy an uneconomic property to help him to become more viable or profitable and the other chap on the uneconomic property to get out of the industry. The section about which I have some doubt is that which allows the economic owner to borrow money through the rural reconstruction scheme. The Bill in another sector has Part sets out that if one can borrow money through normal borrowing sources one should do so. It appears to me that if someone is on a farm which is already economic and he wants to respond to economic change in a make it more profitable, then he should borrow utilisation. through the normal resources and not take money which is badly needed by people who are struggling to remain on the land. It seems to me that most of the complaints I to be usedget in my electorate are from people who have suffered because of this situation. They point out to me that people who did not need the money, could borrow money from other sources, it have taken the money from this scheme and is people in need have been denied assistance. I am not too clear from the Bill whether opportunity has been provided for people in uneconomic circumstances to appeal against the decision. I ask Minister whether he can explain where prois made for that. I think the worse section of the Bill is found in Part 7, Household Support. I have no argument about the intention of this of the assistPart, which reads: To provide assistance for up to one year to non-viable farmers having insufficient resources to meet living expenses and who are in need of assistance to alleviate conditions of and family hardship while the farmer considers than whether to adjust out of farming. I think Another paragraph goes on to provide: An advance provided for one year sufficient to raise the estimated future income from all sources to the of payment which would be appUcable to him if he to were eligible for unemployment benefits. have no complaint about that proposal, either. in But I think we see this superphospate mentaUty paragraphs (1) and (m). These provide for severance pay of $3,000 if the farmer desires to that move out of the industry and if the Authority assistconsiders the payment warranted. but Unfortunately, the amount of money which the farmer has already received in what might termed social service benefits to bring the amount he would receive social service benefits is deducted from the $3,000. I think this is an insult to any primary producer. It shows the thinking of the Liberalthat National Country Party Government. More than devaluation. 20 years ago members of trade unions were requestion ceiving severance pay. They started and it was all plus on top of that. It is an insult that an amount of $3,000 is provided could appreciate to what it was the under this scheme. It could be that a man is the land and is battling hard to stay there. At hefindsthat it is hopeless. Paragraph (m) vides that a farmer has adjusted out of farming when 'he has effectively disposed of his proParty ductive resources'. Probably the money he gets ing forwas after disposing of his resources has his debts. Any money he has received in the days but we are still waitingwithin build up to equal the amount of the social benefits is then deducted from the $3,000. It is maU easy to understand that not a great deal would be left. I think that is an insult. The Government should have another look at this Part-$3,00 0 is enough-and at least make the amount a straight out payment without any deductions. I am sorry good to note that all these things are happening at a time when the primary producers' income is deabout clining. According to the statement which I for received from the ParUamentary Library, in the Blaxland, 1970-71 the average farm income was $4,713. 1971-72 it was $5,982. In 1972-73, thefirstyear of the Australian Labor Party Government, the amount rose to $9,342. In 1973-74 the next of the Labor Government, the amount increased to $15,902. Mr Ian Robinson-Where did you get those figures?",31
75,Mr FITZPATRICK,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"I got them from the Parfor Uamentary Library. If the honourable member wants to verify them. I ask him to have a look the statement of the Minister for Primary Industhe try. He made a statement just recently on this matter and hisfigurescorrespond with the figures I have here, which I obtained from ParUamentary Library. I shall incorporate them in Hansard it the honourable member wishes. The amount dropped to $9,672 and then to individual $9,194. According to Mr Sinclair's statement 23 November, which he sent around to every honourable member, the amount is projected drop to $6,545 in 1976-77. I do not blame the honourable member for singing out because it a bad record after 12 months of Liberalinflation National Country Party government that such a situation has arisen. Surely we can say after 12 months of Liberal-Country Party Government be that things have never been so bad. Much hope him up to has been pinned on the ITA per cent if he were receiving devaluation. Just as the primary producers begin to think has there is some hope we see that 2.5 per cent already been taken off the percentage Not only that, but in answer to a off at $5,000 Malcolm Fraser) he the I asked would Prime Minister (Mr not give any guaranseems to me ittee that in a few months'time a exchange rate couple of weeks on ago.

I could goinonthealso criticise this Government hi lots of ways. But it is to not my intention to do that because I believe that this continuing rural adjustment legislation is a the idea. We certainly want to iron out some of anomaUes in it. I think that if we are sensible the matter and adopt the worthwhile amendments moved by the honourable member and if we have a look at some of matters I have pointed out, maybe we will be Inable to assist some of the primary producers who are badly in need of assistance. year Mr LLOYD (Murray) (12.9)-The States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill enshrines the Government's new rural adjustment scheme. As such it is one of the most important developments in the implementation of a comprehensive rural poUcy. The Government has been criticised having no grand strategy for rural industry and for not immediately implementing such a at strategy. This is an ignorant and naive view of complex interaction of local and international economic poUcies and poUtics, not to mention the weather and pests which would the almost immediately negate any such policy. Further, a generalised pohcy does not aUow for the detailed and particular problems of industries, particularly with stabUisof ation. The Australian Labor Party through its shadow Minister has an equaUy simphstic view. to The shadow Minister implied that the returns which farmers should receive are going to the is middle men. He forgets that it is the wages and in this country which are sending up the rates of pay of the employees in the various sectors of the processing industry. There is also the suggestion of virtual nationalisation of rural industry. One can also throw in the attitude Victorian Australian Labor Party of doing with freehold land titles in that State. Rural industry policy cannot be isolated general economic policy. In fact, it is due to the faUure of the Labor Government's economic pohcy, with its consequent inflation, which to certain extent makes necessary the present adjustment scheme. I shall give 2 examples to highlight this suggestion. The Bureau of Agricuon tural Economics net farm incomefigure,to which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) referred, indicates that for thisfinancialyear farm income will be about half what it was 3 years ago. Even with devaluation, it will be $40 a week less than avernificant age weekly earnings. Taken over the full 12 months, it probably will work out at about 25 cent less-and that has to take into account return on capital, managerial skUl and the long hours required in farming. The second example is that provided by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs Howard) in his tariff statement said: . . . in the last 6 years wages in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130 per cent compared with cent in the United States and 70 per cent in West If wages have increased in the manufacturing industry, they certainly have increased at least equally in tertiary industry in this country. So can see the cost-price problem which agriculture in Australia faces. Because of this, adjustment has been forced on the rural industry to a greater degree than that required by change, which is always talcing place in agriculture, and also by the special circumstances following Britain's entry into the Common Market. The industry deserving of government assistance because it government action, or lack of action, in its econfor omic pohcy that has forced this adjustment upon rural industry. In the past, agriculture has not been assisted with its adjustment and cyclical problems to the same extent as secondary induspolicy. try has been assisted. Employers in secondary industry can always reduce the number of emby ployees, knowing that the Government vide for those employees automatically through unemployment benefits and knowing that those people will be avaUable in the labour pool when those same employers or other employers once again can take on labour. Tariff assistance measures also are of greater value to manufacnot turing industry in controlling process. So, adjustment pohcy is an essential part of agricultural policy. However, for a complete of the adjustment poUcy more emphasis has to be put away on retirement from agriculture, which the Government is now beginning to accept through from its household support arrangements, and entry into agriculture. I will refer to this matter again later. The second aspect of a complete package a of agricultural policies is welfare policy. In the past, Liberal and National Country Party governments have not placed sufficient emphasis welfare policy, and I acknowledge the criticism that has come from Labor spokesmen in this regard. But, even though the Labor Party said that it would do more in regard to welfare pohcy in agriculture, it did not do it. In our 12 months in government we have introduced 2 sigpohcy proposals for welfare in agriculture. Thefirsthas been the extension of unemper ployment benefits to farmers and the second has been the abolition of the property test for pensions, leaving only an income test, which will be of tremendous assistance to farming people. This was recognised by Professor Henderson in his report on poverty as one of the major social (Mr injustices in our present social security last night. He arrangements. The third aspect of an agricultural pohcy must S3 per be a credit orfinancepolicy. Already we have Germany. term loans arrangements, farm development loans, the Commonwealth Development Bank and rural credits advances to marketing boards. one The carry-on loans, which will be broadened by this new adjustment scheme from just the beef and dairy industries to a general carry-on situation, will overcome the short term liquidity problems for which there has been a gap in our credit poUcy in this country. It is hoped that it will provide a similar service to that which the is Production Credit Associations have provided is for agriculture in the United States of America many years. It is hoped that the introduction of the rural bank and the young farmer estabUshment scheme wiU fill other very large and important gaps and provide a better credit and finance The young farmer estabUshment scheme will provide a more complete adjustment poUcy assisting entry into agriculture as well as will proretirement from agriculture. The fourth aspect of an agricultural poUcy must be industry stabUisation. For this to occur, the co-operation of both industry and government is required. Government cannot and should force a scheme on an industry. An industrythe adjustment differences approach by-industry among is required, because of the agricultural industries. At the present time we see further developments taking an place in the wool industry. The wheat industry for many years has been the best example of stabilisation, but the wheat stabUisation plans suffer from the great weakness of section 92 trad-selves ing. It is hoped that the levy mechanism in new dairy plan which is under discussion at present time wiU overcome one of the weakperson, nesses of past agricultural stabUisation schemes. There is a great need for further industry stabilis-poUcy ation arrangements for both the canned fruit industry and the beef industry at the present time. An important aspect of industry stabUiscommunications, ation is personal income stabUisation or income stabilisation. The Government's introduction income equalisation deposits will play an imporservices. tant part m the farmer's stabUisation of his own income. I hope that in the next Budget there be some overdue improvements to the income tax averaging arrangements for primary proreconstruction ducers. This will further assist the farmer himself through personal income stabUisation measures. Another aspect of an industry stabUisation policy is the need for disaster insurance arrangements-this was referred to earlier today-for crop faUure, flood,fireand so on. Weunder are told that this matter is being investigated at than $50m the present time. I emphasise that what we haveing in this country at the present time-w e have virand tuaUy nothing-is certainly much less than the wheat growers in New Zealand have had for to about 30 years and is less than what is generallymoney avaUable in the United States under its crop ure scheme. I hope that this Government come up with better disaster arrangements for agriculture for the future. Thefifthaspect of an agricultural pohcy is international arrangements. We must have access to overseas markets and then stabUity of and continuing access to those markets at reasonable prices. Thefinaland most important part of any cultural pohcy is general economic pohcy itself. This is of overriding importance to agriculture. is more important than any of the other carry-on individual aspects I have mentioned, particularly with an agricultural industry which is largely export industry. For the last 10 years farmers have been complaining about the cost-price squeeze. In the last 2 years, with Australia's runaway inflation, the cost-price squeeze crunch really hit agriculture in this country. An agriculexisting tural policy as a total policy package is essential so that more than the marginally viable farmers can be assisted. Generally, reconstruction measures such as our new adjustment proposals assist only the marginally viable farmers. An agricultural pohcy is important so that as many farmers as possible can be helped to help themand so that the special poUcies of adjustthe ment are not as necessary as they are at the the presenttime.From the point of view of a rural much more is needed than just an agricultural poUcy. There has to be a general rural as well as an agricultural policy. Those who live in rural communities, whether they live on farms or in countiy towns, need such things as telephones, transport, fuel prices equalisation, reasonable educational of opportunities and special health and welfare will The new scheme follows on and consoUdates several other reconstruction schemes. The first scheme of recenttimeswas the to helpmarginal dairy farm scheme which commenced in mid-1970. It was followed by the rural reconstruction scheme in mid-1971 and the fruit growing reconstruction scheme in 1972. Britain's entry into the Common Market was one of the major reasons for the introduction of those earlier schemes. Up to the end of September 1976 approximately $224m had been advanced the rural reconstruction scheme, more for the various dairy schemes includdairy carry-on loans, $4m to $5m for fruit $26m for beef carry-on loans, malting a total of about $305m. I want to make 2 quaUfications thatfigure:Firstly, some of that money is State for the States' 50 per cent of the carry-on faU-loan arrangements and, secondly it is mainly will loan money, not grant money. In roundfigures18 000 farmers have been assisted under these schemes-840 0 with rural reconstruction, 2700 with beef carry-on loans, 1300 with fruit industry reconstruction or the tree-pull scheme and almost 6000 with the dairy schemes. The Government's commitment for the agriremaining 6 months of thisfinancialyear when the scheme will be operative could go as high as It $40m. This will depend on the degree of loans provided and also the degree of household support which comes from general an revenue and is not specifically appropriated under this scheme. That, of course, is additional to what is appropriated for this scheme. has This scheme consoUdates four separate and schemes if we include the carry-on loan arrangements. It provides greaterflexibUityin administration. Here I completely differ from the Labor Party's approach and amendment of providing more control in Canberra for criterion assessment, etc. I have been closely associated with the previous schemes for some years. To me one of the greatest problems has been the buckpassing that has gone on between State administrations and Canberra. They say that really the decisions were made somewhere else. I believe that we should give as much power as possible to the State administering authoriues because they have the framework closer to the farming people than has Canberra. They are also more flexible. I hope that better decisions will follow. The experience of this scheme I believe supports that contention. There is also greater flexibility with interest rates. I make the point that the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) made, that with a more general and consolidated scheme as problems develop we will not have to wait for something else to be introduced before assistance can be provided. These matters will be picked up under the umbrella of the existing scheme. This new scheme continues the basic features of the existing schemes. It introduces several new important provisions such as farm improvements, that is, within the existing farm, and household support. It broadens the carry-on loans ehgibility to industries other than beef and dairying. I would like to comment on some of these aspects. With farm build-up in particular the importance of inter-family transfers of ownership and their eligibility within the scheme are quite critical. We have to take account of the necessity for continuing the family farm by transferring it from one generation to the other and the shortage of capital which requires the older generation to obtam cash for the farm when the younger generation does not have the cash to purchase it. In some cases the necessary eligibility has not been given to inter-family purchases of farm land within farm build-up or debt adjustment. Other industries certainly will want to be included in the carry-on loan arrangements. I give notice that at least the canning fruit industry will be on the doorstep of the Minister with a request for its inclusion in these provisions as soon as it is possible to do so. I alert the Government to the fact that 1 think more finance will be required for carry-on loans than was previously allocated. Household support is one of the major welfare innovations-it does not matter whether it is cultural or non-agricultural-of this country. It the closest thing that this country has to a minimum income scheme. As such it is an innovation of major importance to general social welfare policy not only in this country but also in the Western world generally. It complements the availability of unemployment benefits to farmers. I believe it does not contradict or confuse. There is a clear distinction between the 2 schemes. The same income test is used in both cases, but there is no work test for household support. People are eligible for household support only after failure to pass the viability criteria for other forms of adjustment. After 6 months it is available only as a grant to those leaving the industry. Household support is living assistance to someone with no future in agriculture. The unemployment benefit is subject to a work test. This assistance is for those with a short-term cash problem who still have a future in agriculture but who, because of seasonal work requirements or a critical lack offinance,make themselves available for work. We are looking at distinctly different groups of people. I beheve it is essential that the unemployment benefit continues to be available for agricultural people. I believe the need for the unemployment benefit will be just as great this winter for the dairy industry and the fruit industry as it was last year. I believe the income test is unsatisfactory and unfair, but with a greater understanding by both farmers and officers from the Department of Social Security of how the system works, hopefully the scheme will be more successful next winter than last. At the same time. I want to compliment the way in which senior social security officers worked to obtain a viable arrangement for the introduction of this assistance. In conclusion I would like to say that I believe further consideration should be given for a more comprehensive adjustment policy which includes more specific provisions for entry into agriculture and retirement from agriculture as is the case in a number of Western nations. The particular problems of immobUity associated with agriculture have side effects such as reduced productivity and perhaps the entry into agriculture of a future generation to maintain a dynamic industry. I believe we should be looking at a more deUberate program as part of the adjustment policy. I believe there should be speedy implementation of this scheme so that the benefits are avaUable from 1 January. I would like to know, if anybody is replying for the Government, whetherfinalapproval has been given by the States for the agri- scheme to commence on 1 January. I reinforce is the point that several other speakers have made. We need publicity about the provisions of the scheme so that the rural community is aware of what is avaUable to it. I compliment the Minister and the Government for putting together what I consider to be a great improvement in adjustment measures for the agricultural sector of our society and for some very important innovations and developments in social welfare policy.",34
76,Mr FRY,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO PRIMARY PRODUCERS," I support the category States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill and amendment moved by my colleague the honournecessary able member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). There is no question that bringing these support schemes together under one set of guidelines makes them much easier to administer for the various State authoriues which are charged with the administrative responsibiUty. It is a very difficult task to administer a whole range schemes all of which have different guideUnes. have no doubt that bringing the schemes together wiU make their administrative task, which is a very difficult one, much easier. This should also lead to a much more equitable distri-sustain bution of funds under the various schemes and some co-ordination of pohcy. Of course the task of co-ordination and integration should have been carried out by the producing. estabUshment of a national reconstruction board which is the subject of one of our amendments. Tbis should have been thefirstthing to be done,tial but the Government has put the cart before the horse and has faUed to carry out that very impor-dependency tant recommendation of the Industries Assistis ance Commission. I will come back and say morevery on that later. It is sufficient to say that bringing the schemes together is a good principle. Whether debt reconstruction, consoUdation or buUd-up of farms or farm development is in the volved, the co-ordination should lead to a much easier program to administer. Probably the most commendable aspect of the scheme is the question of household support. applaud this aspect of the legislation. It careful represents, as the honourable member for used Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, an attack on a major area of social injustice which was brought out the Henderson report on farm poverty. There is an inherent difficulty. There is an assumptionbeUeve the honourable member for Murray 'Look, made this assumption-that the support is there for people to make up their minds whether or not they want to get out of agriculture. I just make very pertinent point that that is not always an option. It may have been an option in the past. know that in this region people were able to move into a rapidly expanding area Uke Canwant berra and get a job in private enterprise or the PubUc Service. In country towns the people in this volved couldfindemployment or move and get a job in industry. But the ball game has changed. That is not an option for many people now. I suggest that because an assessment has been made that somebody should get off a farm when he does not wish to do so does not mean that the person involved can get off the farm. No in this legislation has been provided to the handle that sort of situation. It may not be at the moment; I just do not know. But I suggest that if the country sinks into a deeper recession or if the world economic position gets worse-man y people think that it will next yearthis aspect should be monitored very closely and consideration should be given to looking at this particular category of people who, it has been of assessed, have no future on the land but who I cannot get off the land. Those honourable members who remember the last depression will know that people who were unemployed and Uving on farms were often in a better position to themselves than people who were unemployed and Uving in cities. There is always an element of self-support on a farm. One can always kUl a sheep, milk the cow and Uve on some fruit and vegetables that one may be It may be a proposition to consider some parsupport option for people in that situation rather than to push them off the farm into a total on unemployment reUef. I think that something the Government should monitor closely and if it becomes necessary, this legislation will need to be altered because it does not really provide for that category at the moment. For all of these reconstruction proposals basic criterion, of course, is that funds are not avaUable from private sources. These are usually the private banks. I want to say something about the role of the private banks in these reconstrucWe tion schemes because I think we need to be very that these reconstruction schemes are not by private banks in order to unload some of their weaker clients. I have had some experience in with this in the past and I know that it has happened in the past. A cUent goes along to his bank I and wants some more money. The bank says: we are sorry. We cannot help you but we think you may do better under some rural reconstruction scheme or some debt adjustment ascheme'. The private bank then could be seen in the role of a fair weather friend. It is happy to Ilook after its clients whUe they are making money but if they run into a bad patch, the banks to unload them onto somebody else. I think we need to be very careful that we do not fall into trap so that this scheme is provided just as a to a city support for private banks. Of course, when debt adjustment and reconstruction is undertaken wefindthat this gets people on to their feet and they are then handed back to the private bank. This is a very handy ar-of rangement for the private banks and I have no doubt that they applaud it very much. But I trunkvery it can be fairly said that in a way the private banks, or some of them, have let the rural com-hazards munity down by not providing adequate coundroughts selling and advisory services. If they did provide these services, some of the people come candidates for debt adjustment and rural reconstruction might not have got into that situIt ation. Some banks, of course, do provide these services. The Rural Bank of New South Wales has district valuers who can advise people not only on technical matters but also on financial matters and counsel them on business matters. The Commonwealth Development Bank also has officers in this category. They do not have be attached to every bank; they could cover district which might service 20 or 30 banks. the private banks do not provide this service. semi-government banks-the Rural Bank and the Commonwealth Bank-ca n function and imports, make a profit. They can provide these services and still make a profit and I trunk that the banks should be able to do this, too. I suggest that if they did provide a more adequate technical andfinancialservice they might be able to keep some of their clients out of the rural recon-mittee struction process. Often the loans that a private bank manager makes are made on an ad hoc basis. They are made in the office. Sometimes bank manager does not even look at the propertymisinterpreted and if he did he would not know whether it wasabout good or bad. They make a loan with such a wideover safety margin that they cannot go wrong. They obtain a rule-of-thumb valuation of the assets and then lend SO per cent of the value. So theyand are sitting pretty. I suggest that the private bankshad have a responsibihty, not just to sit in an office and lend money or say: 'We cannot lend it', to give a back-up service to their clients out in field. They make enough profit out of this coun-need try to be able to do that without suffering any great hardship. If some banks can do it, all should be able to do it. I want to refer briefly to the amendment. think that the suggestion that thefishingindustry should be brought into this debt reconstruction program is an excellent idea. No other honourbody able member has commented on this suggestion and said why it cannot be done. The fishing industry is quite an extensive industry. It has approximately 16 000 employees and is worth $100m, yet it does not fit into any of these is categories. It does notfitinto the primary reconsituation struction category and it is certainly not facturing industry. I admit difficulties with the fishing industry. It is not possible to see what the harvest will be and it is difficult to forecast what the harvest will be. On the other hand, it is not subject to many of the of rural industries. It is not affected by or bushfires or grasshoppers or anything of that nature. I think we should look at the who have be-fishing industry. is interesting to note that Australia imports very large quantities offish,although our own industry is worth $100m. Figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for 1973-74 show that Australia imported almost $68m worth of ediblefishand another $3m worth of inediblefishproducts, such asfishmeal. These toimports totaUed $71m. If we add the effect of the a devaluation adjustment to that amount, we are Butimporting approximately $80m worth of fish Theproducts. So there is a great potential for expansion in thefishingindustry to compete with the particularly now that devaluation will increase the price of the imports. It is quite a privatelogical suggestion that thefishingindustry should be included in this adjustment program. The amendment to be moved in the Comstage, which is the most important one, is to the effect that a National Rural Adjustment Board should be estabUshed. I hasten to assure the the honourable member for Murray that he quite what the Opposition has said this amendment. This body would not take the job of the States. I would never suggest that. The States are the appropriate bodies to administer these schemes. They have the expertise they are closest to their clients. They have a lot of experience in this area. I would not suggest for a minute that there should be any butinterference with their administration of the the scheme but I do suggest that there is an urgent for a general co-ordination of policy so that we do not have the crazy situation in which one State is trying to move people out of an industry and, at the same time, another State is trying to buUd up people in the industry. Honourable I members will know that this has happened in the past, particularly in regard to the dairying industry. The Opposition is saying that the national should be established to co-ordinate pohcy and to ensure that there is an equitable distribution and use of resources between the States and that they are broadly using the same sort of g lelines which wiU produce a situation which m(in the national interest so that we do not have a in which we are readjusting people into a manu-producing goods which are already overthat there are all sortssuppUed. A national rural adjustment board would have the task of monitoring the schemes, as they being administered. It would also have the task of conducting research into the effectiveness the various schemes and generally co-ordinating the overall task. As I said before, the State authorities are much closer to the problem and would like to pay a tribute to the various State authorities which administer the rural readjustpastoral ment programs. They have a very difficult task, someumes a very painful task, in debt adjustindustry ment and in trying to reconstruct people's problems. I would not want that funcIn tion to be interfered with in any way. It is tainly not a proposal which the Opposition would put forward. The Opposition says that this should be a very small policy co-ordinating on which some States, at least, are represented on a rotating basis and that it should monitor results, ensure that distribution is equitable conduct research into the effectiveness of the measures being adopted. I think the rural recontion struction adjustment board is a most important recommendation, the most important recomexpected mendation made by the Industries Assistance Commission. If the Government had been honest about trying to do a good job in this area it would have set up this bodyfirstand then amalgamated the various schemes under this legislation which it has now brought forward. should like to know what the attitude of the MinBlaxland ister for Primary Industiy (Mr Sinclair) is on question. Will he continue to ignore one of the main recommendations of the IAC report? I supfree port the Bill. I repeat that the household support scheme should be watched very closely. People who want to get off farms but should be catered for in the Bill. They are not catered for at this stage. I not a need for this provision now, there will be any time andincluding one in the future. Apart from that point, we supthe port the Bill. We commend the progress that has been made in this direction and in particular household support scheme.",38
77,Mr ELLICOTT,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"In the absence of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) and as one who has been a farmer for a period of 1S years, will do my best to reply to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). First of all, it is to be noted that the amendment is an expression of concern and that the honourable member did not move a directly. detailed amendment. Of course, the honourable member well knows that this scheme flowed from the Industries Assistance Commission report on rural reconstruction. No mention was made by the IAC of thefishingindustry to which, are I understand, the honourable member's amendment is directed. It is important also to note that of the amendment refers to rural adjustment and not to primary industry adjustment. The Schedule to the Agreement in paragraph (a) of Part 1, I under the heading 'General Principles', refers to the fact that all agricultural, horticultural and industries are included in the scheme. It is clearly intended to deal not with primary but with rural industry-that is, landand sort out based industry. principle, of course, there is no reason why certhefishingindustry should not have a similar scheme. I think it is conceded that the basic differences, however, between the rural industry body and thefishingindustry are such that separate schemes obviously would be more appropriate. It was an election promise of this Government to and establish a reconstruction scheme for the fishing industry similar to the present rural reconstrucscheme. At the moment a reference on the fishing industry is before the IAC and a report is early in 1977. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the amendment. I think my remarks sufficiently answer what the honourable member for Blaxland has said. Other questions were raised, and I think I should refer them to the Minister so that he can answer them. I directly. I note that the honourable member for raised a question about interest rates. this As he is aware, the Commonwealth Government lends to the States at 7 per cent and the States are to lend on terms and conditions which they set. On the other hand, paragraph 7 (2) of Part C of the Schedule, under the heading 'Introducwho cannot do so tion', states: The Authority shall have the right to review the terms of expect that if there is repayment, interest rates, of individual accounts at shall exercise thisrightat regular intervals with objective of the borrower being encouraged to transfer to commercial credit as soon as circumstances permit. the That is all I can add to help the honourable member for Blaxland at the moment. The honourable member for Darling (Mr referred to the inadequacy of the $3,000 lump sum granted under the household support scheme. I think he may have overlooked Ithe existence of the rehabilitation assistance of $5,000 which is not reduced by other assistance received under the household support scheme. I shall refer to the Minister the other matters that have been raised and ask him to deal with them Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",40
78,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO PRIMARY PRODUCERS,"On behalf of the Opposition, I move: At the end of the Schedule add the following new part: 'Part 8-NATIONA L RURAL ADJUSTMENT the '(1) Establishment That a Nauonal Rural Adjustment Board '(2) Composition of Board (a) an executive Chairman; (b) two part-time members drawn from rural industry, and (c) two members, drawn from the States rural reconstruction authoriues and selected, on a rotational basis for a term of no more than two years.

The Opposition has moved a substantial amendintention ment to this legislation. I was interested to hear the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), acting on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), rationalise away the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I should Uke to see him rationahse away this amendment. I should Uke to say in passing that the Attorney-General more courtesy in this debate on primary industry than does the Minister for Primary Industry. fact rarely do we have the company of the Minisstates ter for Primary Industry in the House during desystem bates on his own legislation. He rarely affords courtesy of debating primary industry matters with us. I think that the Minister should be to deal with an amendment as important as the In Committee one I have just moved on behalf of the Opposition. The amendment moved by the Opposition is an important amendment. It is an amendment which flowsfrom the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in respect of question of a national marketing board. Such NA a board is needed to co-ordinate reconstruction throughout Australia. In his second reading be established. speech the Minister stated: The rural adjustment scheme is essentially a joint Commonwealth-State operation. Broadly the Commonwealth will provide the funds for the scheme while the States will be primarilyresponsiblefor the detailed adnunistration of it in accordance with policies agreed between the Commonwealth and the States. This concept of a national rural adjustment and board does not detract from that arrangement. It annual does not mean that there would be a monopoly Scheme; in terms of Commonwealth management of It would just mean that there conwould be a central co-ordinating body which by a would Uaise with the States. This would overcome the position which the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) raised, namely, that in some States farmers are encouraged to move out of an to industry whUe in other States farmers are movon the ing into that same industry. There is no national co-ordination. If honourable members look at the amendment they will find that under the heading in terms of ' Method of operation' it states: (a) consult with Statereconstructionauthorities and other Federal and State departments on the annual fund requirements . . . There is no intention to run this body from Canother bena. Sub-paragraph (b) says that this body is to consult with the States in respect of emergof banks ency, shon term credit requirements. I thought that that would be in keeping with the general of the present legislation. Subparagraph (c) says that this body is to Uaise with the State reconstruction authorities on monitoring market prospects and the various commodity boards, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Uke. The board is to monitor the progress of chents, evaluate rural adjustment schemes in terms of pohcy objectives, and conduct feasiis extending bUity studies. In The last sub-paragraph is the important one. It that the board is to Uaise with the banking and other sources of farm credit. It is not the the intention of the Opposition that this national rural adjustment board would be a monopoly, here that it alone would hold all the wisdom and would manage reconstruction of rural enterprises in Australia, but just that it would provide ordinating base. I quote the following IAC report: A statutory body could be established, a being the National Rural Adjustment Board. The IAC went on to say: The establishment of such a Board would ensure rent contact with the farming community and State authoriues and set rural adjustment policy in a non-partisan framework. That is an eminently sensible suggestion. honourable member for Fraser said that the Government should have preceded this legisreport lation with legislation to establish such a board. agree that that should have been the first step. Finally, I think that the Labor Party, when government, brought more attention to the need for reconstruction. The various schemes implemented when in government have led now There to a greater understanding and acceptance of the that notion of reconstruction and adjustment rather approaches than the other general trend of pohcy towards stabilisation in commodities which invariably meant overproduction or subsidised overproproach duction so thatfinallyno real assistance was given to industry and no guidance was given to various sectors of agriculture for the long future. We believe that there is a pressing need for a national co-ordinating instrument. If it be national, it has to be a body established by the national Parliament. We suggest a national rural adjustment board, as mentioned by the IAC. Perhaps I should just deal with the proposed membership. The board should have an execuclear tive chairman, 2 part-time members drawn rural industry and 2 members drawn from the State rural reconstruction authorities on a rotatStates. ing basis. Automatically there would be this cross-feed of information with the States and with the industry. There would not be a monrepresentation opoly situation. For the life of me, I cannot on what basis the Government can reject such amendment. I put it to the Attorney-General that he need to explain very cogently, as I am sure he able to do, why the Government would reject their such a reasonable proposition. It is not a crazy notion. It is something which I think is necessary.would It is something which can be defended. I believe that it is something with which the State reconhonourable struction authorities and State Ministers would agree-that is, the establishment of a national rural adjustment board. The Opposition comsaid mends this amendment to the Committee. I thinkrural I can be bold enough to say that if this amendtralian ment is not agreed to the Labor Party, in govern-no ment, certainly would enact legislation which a cowould lead to the establishment of a national from the rural adjustment board.",41
79,Mr ELLICOTT,BOARD, Mr Deputy Chairman Mr Jacobi-You certainly are well represented today! The National Country Party concuris here in force! None of its members are here.,42
80,Mr ELLICOTT,BOARD,"They know their farmers. I rise again to answer the honourable member for The Blaxland (Mr Keating). I am sure that he has read the Industries Assistance Commission on rural reconstruction, because he had to Idraw on it for what is not really an original amendment. He took it out of the IAC report. in That report sets down the matters which appear in sub-paragraphs (a) to (h) in the third parait graph ofhis amendment and it then says: are several types of administrative arrangements could carry out the above-mentioned activities. Two are put forward for consideration. Of these the second is preferred. Of course, the Commission preferred the apwhich the honourable member put forward, namely, a statutory body. We are aware of the desire of the Opposition to set up boards and term commissions. Commissions were established time after time in the years in which it was in is to office. We do not operate automaticaUy in that sense. We look to see whether a commission is necessary. The IAC did not say that this board was necessary. It said that either approach was satisfactory, but it preferred the board. That is enough. The honourable member's amendfromment is in line with the second approach. This second approach was discussed with the It wiU be recaUed that it was suggested in the IAC report that the States would have on this board. Despite the fact that they would have this representation, the fact see is that no State authority was in favour of a anboard. No State authority was in favour of the second approach. That in itself is an indication of will their reaction. Some of those States are Labor isStates, as honourable members wiU recall, and reaction was that they did not want a board. Our analysis of the proposal suggests that it be more costly and would achieve no better results. A very telling point, I suggest to members, is that all die things mentioned in paragraph 3 of the amendment about the method of operation are things that the IAC could be achieved by a commissioner for adjustment appointed within the AusDepartment of Primary Industry. There is need for a board with a large number of members. There is no need for additional administration. There is no need for the additional cost. Therefore, the Government rejects the amendment and indicates once again that it prefers thefirstapproach. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Keating's) be agreed to. The Committee divided.

81,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"This is a piece of amending legislation and it, too, has some sense of urgency about it. The House will recall that the original Bill was introduced as a matter of urgency on the evening of Thursday, 18 November last, because of certain proceedings instituted in the Supreme Court Lloyd, B. Lusher, S. A. of New South Wales by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in respect of uranium contract litigation. I understand that the Attorney General (Mr Ellicott), pursuant to the earUer legislation, was obliged to make an order which MCMahon, William MCVeigh, D.T. would prevent evidence being given, as requested. That evidence would have been used by a foreign tribunal, namely a United States DisMillar, P. C. Moore, J.C. trict Court. Obviously that order was made on the basis that the evidence would perhaps be Newman, K. E O'Keefe, F.L. used to declare that Westinghouse need not comply with contracts which it had already entered into over a period of years for the supply of Richardson, P. A. Robinson, Eric uranium. In the context of what I am saying about urgency, the fact that it is uranium creates Ruddock, P.M. Sainsbury, M. E. a cUmate as to whether the legislation has been effectively drawn. The doubt becomes heightened by the fact that there has to be some amendment to the legislation within a matter of days. No personal criticism is intended here. The Street, A. A. Sullivan,! W. House will recall that in the course of the debate we were doubtful about the vaUdity of certain provisions of the Bill as introduced on the evenWilson, I. B.C Yates, W. ing of 18 November, in particular sub-clause (2) of clause 4 which stated: The validity of any exercise, or refusal of the exercise, of any power of the Attorney-General under this Act is not affected by, and shall not be subject to challenge court . . . At the time we said that that was outside the stitutional power of the Government. Firsdy, could not be maintained. Secondly, and more importandy, if the Government were to adhere to that concept it ran a great risk of the whole being declared invalid. We were relying on the dicta of Fullagar, J., in what is known as the Communist Party dissolution Bill. As a practical example, we were talking about the mere fact that somebody such as an Attorney-General reactors might deem something to be a lighthouse, an in example expressed by Mr Justice Fullagar, does not necessarily mean that it has the judicial characteristics of a lighthouse; therefore it not be deemed to be a lighthouse simply because the Attorney-General thought it ought to be. was in that context that we were while we recognised and supported the legislation there could be many difficulties. I again theIt United refer to this case of the Communist Party Dissoltracts now can ution Bill in which it is eloquently expressed that be anti-trust legislation. the validity of a law or of an admimstrative act against 29 uranium producers, done under a law cannot be made to depend on understand four could be Australian the opinion of the law maker or the person who is It is in that context that we want to make to do the act that the law or the consequence the act is within the constitutional power upon tinghouse which the law itself depends this amending legislation the Attorney-General be penalised do has deleted sub-clause (2) of clause 4. In the course of the previous debate it was properly said that there should be some parliaback. mentary knowledge of orders made under this type of legislation. The honourable member Grayndler (Mr Antony Whidam) raised this matter. He was referring to an English Aa which was passed in similar emergency circumstances but which clearly had a provision that any order made would be subject to disallowance by the Parliament. The Attorney has agreed with that proposition in this amending legislation by viding that any decision made would be the ject of investigation by the Parliament in the sense that it would be laid before Parliament and they would have a chance to aUow it if they objected to the decision. We cur with that amendment. The point that is overriding the position moment is the predicament of Westinghouse market. itself. Because of this I shall be moving amendment in Committee. The Labor Party has considered this matter. The amendment is to amend the principal Act by providing that this Act shall cease to be in operation after 30 1977 and shall thereupon be deemed to have been repealed by an Act other than this Act. in any are saying that this is stiU emergency legislation. The Labor Party is not at all convinced that it is connow properly drawn. We would Uke to see the it efficacy of it tested bytime,even if the time is relatively short, bearing in mind that the matters involved relate to certain difficulties that WesBilltinghouse is experiencing. It is a very high powered company in the United States. Obviously it decided to make a substantial sum by selling nuclear reactors, which it did, with great skiU. In the process it promised the people who bought the a supply of uranium at a price which was the vicinity of $6 to $8 per lb. It did not have enough business acumen to know that the price might rise, as it has now done, to some $40 per canlb. Therefore it is unablefinanciaUyto comply with the terms of the contract. As the AttorneyIt General said, it is facingfinancialruin to the saying that extent of about $7 billion. has adopted the exercise offilingaction in States on the basis that these conbe avoided by what is deemed to It has taken proceedings of which we companies. certain of that justice still prevails. Simply because Weshas done the wrong thing aU the way for its validity. In through, we not want it thought that it must simply because it is an American multi-national. If we look at the history of the matter, it has certainly created a rod for its own In 1972, with the United States Government's blessing obviously, the United States for Atomic Energy Commission authorised the release of SO 000 tons of stockpUed uranium. Westinghouse would be part and parcel of that action. That immediately depressed the market everywhere else. The Government of the United States certainly must be put on notice that Westinghouse must have gained immensely from the profact that a cUmate was created in which this suburanium could be obtained relatively cheaply. That helped to seU aU the reactors which Wesboth Houses oftinghouse wished to sell. disThe United States decided to protect its own conmarket. It prevented anybody else from selling uranium to the United States domestic market. It at the placed an embargo on any penetration of that It still has that embargo. Is it any wonder an that uramum producers such as Canada and others said that something had to be done to give an orderly marketing concept? In that position we are entided to say that that orderly concept June should be maintained. From the Labor Party's point of view it is a question of judgment and Weassessment over a short period as to whether we are mamtaining a fair and reasonable price. Thatdecision is the purpose of the amendment. We want matter reviewed and perhaps the legislation amended again but certainly reintroduced. In the Senate there was discussion on the origAgain, inal Bill. The Government amendment to section 3 flows from that discussion. Personally-I ' personally' because I do not necessarily think others will agree with me- I think the amendam ment to section 3 in which the definition of foreign tribunal is deemed not to include the dicial Committee of the Privy Council is opening up the opportunity for a tribunal in America obtain the evidence. I know that the Attorneyarrange General added this amendment to the legislation because the matter was raised by Senator Steele Hall. Surely the logic of the situation would be shall outline. Although the Attorney-General might feel it important to prevent evidence from being obtained by a foreign tribunal from a Stateweaknesses court, bearing in mind that the Judicial mittee of the Privy Council could only be dealing with the same evidence one would think that Attorney-General would deem it to apply also that particular tribunal. I fail to see how this legislation would be able to prevent such ridiculous situations occurring as would occur if this legislation did apply to a State court and appeal were made from that State court; if a hearing were conducted before the Judicial General Committee of the Privy Council, as could occur; if new evidence were then taken before the dicial Committee of the Privy Council, as can happen; and if that evidence were certified as being the evidence and then introduced into the United States of America. I think that this legislation opens up a problemthe by placing no embargo upon the Privy Council. States protects It is difficult to legislate in thisfield.The constithen have the weakness tutional difficulties are immense. Basically we are relying upon executive power. We have no do specific power to control State courts, nor want it. But one does look a Uttle askance at has been happening in State courts, when they have been insisting all the time that these appeals to the Privy Council and that they should maintain theirrights.We could well now find that in what is deemed to be in the national which states: interest a form of appeal could be made to Privy Council which could well create evidence (a) which would destroy Australian companies operating in the uraniumfield.I say that only in the semantic sense. It clearly follows that if the Attorney-General has been unable to make decisions in State proceedings, by way of this lation he would disbar himself from making any if those proceedings were taken to the this Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I should Uke to think that he will have another look at that. I am not at aU convinced that this legislation will achieve what the Australian Governsay ment has in mind and what the Opposition supports-that is, the concept of orderly marketing. I convinced that Westinghouse may well start a an action in a State Supreme Court on any issue Juwhich could be deemed to be a breach of contract, could subpoena all the people in Australia to from whom it wished to obtain evidence, could for the production of documents, and that could then be deemed to be the evidence that it wants and they could perhaps in some way or other get that evidence over to the United States and use it to negate contracts. We do not as I applaud that action, but it does highlight the problems that Australia faces in the Hard world of international trade. We cannot afford to have in our judicial or constitutional sysComtem. Yet we have that very problem. the We have the stupidity of premiers saying that to they are autonomous in their ownfields,that the Commonwealth is not to interfere, that any interference by the Commonwealth is deemed to be a centraUst bogy. This should not apply when an deaUng with international matters. I think every newState premier will be saying to the Attorneyafter the introduction of this legislation: 'Save our industry and save our compames. If Juthis sort of thing can happen we could be destroyed in the international market'. It leaves one with the clear impression that the sooner we get more constitutional powers in the judicial sense the better. This would be in the best interests of nation and would enable Australia to protect its interests, in the same way that the United its interests. Australia would not of being deemed to be a composite of 6 foreign Uttle States, all trying to their own thing, with an appeal court situated do we some 12 000 mUes away. Without more constiwhattutional powers being vested in the Federal Government, this situation wiU always exist. The other point I wish to make in relation to this legislation relates to clause 4 of the Bill, the Section 4 of the Principal Act is amendedby inserting in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1), after the word 'relate', the words, 'being the only proceedings of a foreign tribunal . . . It has been suggested to me that the word 'only' in that context means one or the singular. legisThe Attorney-General might wish to alter that word. It is suggested it might be far preferable to delete the word 'only'; in other words, the clause relate to any proceedings. It could well be that Westinghouse could have some litigation in progress, as it does now in the Richmond ision of the Courts of Virginia, and that it might start another action and seek to obtain similar evidence, in which event there would be 2 prolation ceedings rather than only one. I question whether it is appropriate for the word 'only' be used or whether it would not be better if were removed. I have canvassed the various aspects of the vaUdity. earlier debate concerning the urgency of the a repugnant legislation. We support the concept. We are conGeneral (Mrsection cerned about whether it has been tively. Because the emotional issue of uranium is general field. I congratulate involved, naturally there are opinions which General on being prepared to have question whether this legislation will affect carsection removed, not only because of the tels or orderly marketing by supporting certain which surrounded it, but also because of companies in thisfield.We are well fact that certain evidence could well have been stolen in Australia and transmitted to the United States. What we are trying to say is that we accept that at times there has to be emergency legislation. This legislation certainly falls within that category because litigation is already ing in the New South Wales court and we do want to see Australian producers and Australian industry affected adversely. We want to see industry maintained on a viable basis. What the industry had to do to protect itself against the United States in earUer years is perfectly underour standable and perfectly entitled to support. difficulty is to decide the methods and words we should adopt in emergency legislation to effective legal support. Obviously, State courts cannot provide this support. We are now put the difficult situation of trying to do it for In summary, we certainly applaud the fact that section 4 (2) has been deleted and that the Attorney General will enable any order to be disallowed by the Parliament. Again, overriding the whole concept of this legislation is the fact that we feel that the Parliament of Australia ought to be entitled at the next parliamentary session to look at developments which might have taken place in the courts between now and then. This would provide a better understanding of the legal issues involved, and the Parliament could then either renew the legislation or pass in an amended form. Basically we support the Bill with the sanctions that I have mentioned. shall be moving an amendment at the Comsideration mittee stage in the terms which I have outlined.",43
82,Mr NEIL,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"The House is that debating the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Amendment Bill 1976. The to have Government has moved amendments today which are designed to deal with objections raised and discussed, to some extent in this House but Divalso in the Senate, on a more comprehensive basis a few weeks ago. It is proper for the House to consider the whole matter of emergency legisbecause we have not had the most satisfactory passing of this Act and amendment through to the parUamentary process. Section 4 (2), which it is to be deleted, has been referred to by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). He said that it had questionable He did not stress the fact that it was also which gave the Attorneydrafted effecthat could have almostanno EUicott) extraordinary power Umits within this the Attorneythat subdoubts its aware of the intrinsic repugnance. The other amendments contained in the Bill are designed to enable principally the ParUapendment to have a greater say in the event of an notorder being made. There may be a disaUowance of an order and it is proper that this Parliament the should be given the opportunity to disallow orders which may be made in the future in circumstances that are totally beyond the range of present vision into the future. We do not The know in what circumstances this type of legisthat lation could be used. We only know that there give was an emergency situation relating to the Westinghouse Utigation. I shall say one thing in about the amendment proposed by the honourthem. able member for Kingsford-Smith. Obviously, if he is concerned about the practicalities of the situation, as he has indicated, 30 June 1977 cannot be a sound date at all. The likeUhood is that the House will not be sitting. If the Act were to expire and if an emergency situation were to arise it obviously would not be possible for legislation to be passed because, as I understand it, the House is due to rise in early June and the Budget session will not start again until August. Even if the amendment were agreed to a potentially dangerous situation could arise, and I am using the word 'dangerous' in the context of the it Act, namely, an unforeseen emergency. I suggest that if the honourable member wants to press on We with this amendment he ought to give some conto that very serious practical problem. Senator Durack in the other place pointed out the Act would only apply where 'jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal is purported to be exercised outside the ambit of international law or comity of nations or where the Australian national found interest is at stake'. This could be the only basis on which an should be made. That was the only basis on which there ought to have been emergency legisThis lation. I suggest to the House that it should look at ways in which emergency legislation in the future can be dealt with. I would have thought that where there is complex legislation, such this Bill even though it is only short, and where there is complex Utigation which involves many parties and spans many countries, once the Opcover position agreed in principle to the urgency and allow the BiUs to go through, it might be better Opposition and Government supporters sat down together and hammered out a number of sits these points before the Bill came into the House.titled Government supporters were not aware full context of the Bill. Some were and some not. Opposition members may or may not have been fully aware of the context. Despite disquiet the Bill was passed through this House and through the Senate even though a number of ber honourable members raised serious doubts about aspects of the legislation. But everyone cepted that it was emergency legislation. I am entirely impressed with the argument that it emergency legislation which it pass on the night of 18 November. Why it not have come in the day before, or the week fore, or the week after, I am not certain. I Uttle concerned that in future we should try devise, albeit informal, mechanisms to enable emergency legislation to go through the Houses without a preponderance of members of ParUaquestion ment being in the dark about the full ramificaable tions of the Bill. The debate on 18 November supplanted debate on the White Paper on Defence. Despite the arguments for an emergency hearing, I think it was most unfortunate that thetimeof the House had to be taken to displant an extremely important debate. The White Paper calls for the most wide-ranging debate in the community on an extremely important topic ment which the White Paper points out is thefirstpriAttorney-General ority orfirstduty of the Government, namely, the security of the nation. On the night November the debate on the White Paper been launched. The radio broadcast was carrythis ing that debate to the widest possible section the community which was prepared to listen to The debate was stopped half-way through and this legislation was brought in. It has now had be brought back again with a number of imporback tant amendments. The defence debate was uranium shoved over and eventually a for it I think today. It is to be disposed of at the very end of the sitting without the community being able to listen to the broadcast of the proorder ceedings. I think that is most unfortunate. leads me to the suggestion that we should do everything possible to obtain clarification of the practical procedures which are to be adopted by the House in passing emergency legislation. as Another matter raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith related to the Privy Council. I think the British legislation should that. If it does not, we are probably thrown to back-as this legislation stands-to , paraif doxically, an English amendment. As the honourable member knows, the Privy Council as a court of appeals from the States. It is ento do that and it is the ultimate court of of the appeal from those courts. were Mr Kevin Cairns-What about defence?",46
83,Mr NEIL,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"I will not repeat my speech on defence although, no doubt, the honourable memfor LUley would like to hear it again. I stress the importance of looking at emergency legisaclation from,firstly,the point of view of the forms not of the House and, secondly, the need to avoid was repugnant sections such as section 4(2) which was necessary to slipped through. could Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (2.40)-In relation to be the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain am a Evidence) Amendment Bill reference was made to by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) and the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) to it being a matter of urgency and emergency. I that. Let me say at once to the honourmember for St George that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) is to be congratulated because the the amendments which the Attorney-General has proposed in this legislation were pointed out quite forcibly to the House when the initial Bill was dealt with on 18 November. Equally, I note that the Attorney-General in his second reading on defence speech on this Bill stated: The Government has concluded moreover that the Parliashould be able to disallow an order made by the in the same way as it would be able to act if the orders were made by regulation. of 18 I commend the honourable member for had Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) who raised matter on 18 November. The only factor of which is remiss is that the Attorney-General at it. that time was not prepared to accept either suggestion. In relation to this being emergency to legislation, I placed on the notice paper, as far as 8 September, a question relating to cartels in 7 parts. I shaU cite 3 of those few hours will be points. They are: (1) Is the World Uranium Producers' Cartel, which was formed on the initiative of the Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation (RTZ), still in existence company from the cartel earher this year. (5) Does the current United alleged uranium price-fixing or other breaches of the United States anti-trust laws relate to the activities of these ations; if so, which organisations? (6) If not, what is the basis for charges which have been made in the United States against Australian uranium companies for alleged price-fixing. On 9 November I put another question containnational ing a number of parts on the notice paper. It is question No. 1507. The question is directed the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony). I asked: Have any companies made representations to the ment to pass legislation to validate uranium price-fixing agreements which would otherwise contravene (a) the Practices Act, (b) Article Economic Community and (c) United States of America anti-trust laws; if so, which companies. I did not know what the emergency legislation was but I suggest to the Attorney-General that had more than advanced knowledge of what keting would happen. As a matter of fact, in the week leading up to 18 November I attempted every day of the sitting to ask a question without notice of the Attorney-General. Unfortunately, the only day on which I had an opportunity was 18 subpoena November. Tbis is the question I asked: I draw the attention of the Attorney-General tions on noticerelatingto alleged uranium price-fixing and action being taken under the United States anti-trust the Minister aware that subpoenas were lodged in preme Court of New South Wales last Tuesday week? ted to understand that requests for the collection of this nature for foreign tribunals practices and procedures of relevant State courts. Minister considered taking legislative action similar taken by the Canadian Government last September approved aregulationunder the Atomic to preventremovalfrom Canada of informauon relating to this matter? Can the Minister state what effects the action being taken under the United States anti-trust laws on his Government's uranium pohcies? Finally, can I get an answer to the questions that have been on the notice since 8 September? The 2 preceding quesuons to which I referred still not answered. I assume that because of passage of this legislation they will become which largely irrelevant. But I want to deal with the orderly question of price validation because I beheve any returns that that was the signal to the Attorney-General that he ought to do something about it. I will deal with that later. The purpose of this to give some immunity to directors, public officials and companies. As I have pointed out before, we should extend that coverage as this legislation will give immunity only within Australia. That is quite apart from the principle involved in the legislation and the question national sovereignty. I do not want to canvass at length the excellent speech made by the honourfollowing the withdrawal of this able member for Kingsford-Smith, but I suggest States of America inquiry into to the Attorney-General not only that people should peruse the statement made by the organis- Canadian Minister for Mines last September but also that they should take the trouble to read the background paper to that statement, which is headed 'Background Paper on the Canadian Uranium Industry's Activities in the InterUranium Market'. That is important if one is to understand the necessity for this piece of to legislation in the international context. The other matter I want to raise- I have raised it before, but I have not had an answer from the GovernAttorney-General-is that the question that faces the Government on this issue is not so much the Trade passage of this legislation, important as that is, 83 of the Charter of the European but that, if this legislation is to maximise the immunity to directors, public officials or companies, the only effective and real way to he accomplish that is through a government marauthority. At the moment we trust that this legislation will give these people and these companies immunity within Australia; but, as I have said before in the House, any individual who gets off a plane in San Francisco and is issued with a is bound by it. I well recall that at the height of the uranium debate in 1973 it was the Labor Government's pohcy that uranium ought to my questo be marketed through a government marketing laws. Is authority. That was repugnant to the then Oppothe Susition and it was repugnant to the uranium proI am ducers, but I noted in the Press recently that the of evidence uramum producers have changed their tack on would be regulated by the Has the this matter now. They would welcome a govern to that ment marketing authority for no other reason where it than that it would give them the blanket Energy Control Act immunity that they want. I support the legislation and equally I support will have the amendment. Again I impress upon the paper Attorney-General and the Government the need to establish as quickly as possible a government are marketing authority, particularly for uranium, the not only to protect the people or companies the Government seeks to protect under this legislation but, above all, to allow for an marketing of uranium and to ensure that from the marketing of uranium will be maximised in the best interests of the people. I legislation is support the legislation.",47
84,Dr KLUGMAN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"I would Uke to reiterate to the House a point that I raised when the original piece of legislation came before us. In a sense the blame must rest on the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), whom I have of found to be a reasonable person; but it is depressing to realise that on 18 November this year honourable members opposite agreed to pass a piece of legislation which contained section 4(2) which is now repealed in the amending legislation. To remind honourable members. I will read the sub-section which is now being deleted. Thefirstpart of the section deals with the powers which the Attorney-General can exercise under the Act. The second part, which is now being deleted, read: (2) The validity of any exercise, of any power of the Attorney-General affected by, and shall not be subject to challenge in any court by reason of, any failure to section. What is the point of putting provisions into legislation lation if the Attorney-General is then exempted from them? He is the officer who is charged carrying out the provisions. I am not satisfied with any explanation that I have heard so far. am depressed about the fact that the present Attorney-General, or for that matter any Attorney-General, was prepared to introduce could legislation such as that and to defend it in House. I am particularly depressed about the fact that obviously an overwhelming number of a Government supporters in this House and in the Senate were prepared to pass that sort of legiswhich lation which was binding not onlyMr Neil-What about those on your side?",48
85,Dr KLUGMAN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable member However, should look at the division lists that appear Hansard. One honourable member on his side, dicate the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates), tried to support the Opposition; gagged by the Government Whip when he showed that he had enough guts to get up and dicate that he would support the Opposition. It extremely depressing also to realise that the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil), vious for example, who practises law, was prepared to pass that sort of legislation, giving that sort power to any Attorney-General. I hope that, closing the debate, the Attorney-General will give us some explanation even now, so late in E iece, as to what possible reason there ave been for section 4 (2) which is now being ehminated.",49
86,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"in reply-One wonders why the legislation Opposition is not prepared to accept the fact that is for that reason the Government and I are prepared to look at legislation so that this Parliament most effective legislation possible. That is the reason why this debate is taking place today. I listened to the debate on the last occasion and took into account what was said. As events happened that night it was not possible to accept any amendments, having in mind the processes of this House and of the Senate. I considered and investigated the matter at the time and, even though I felt that there was some merit in some of the matters that were being raised, it would not have been possible to accept any amendments. It was for that reason that Senator Durack, with my approval, indicated to the Senate that we would take these matters into or refusal of the exercise, under this Act is not account. I hope that whUe I am Attorney-General I will comply with the provisions of this approach legislation on the basis that the Parliament should produce the most effective legispossible. For that purpose I personaUy am prepared to take into account what members of with the Opposition say as well as what honourable members behind me say. So, that is the reason I why we are debating this legislation and that is the reason I give to the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) as to why the matter not be dealt with on the last occasion. I was the troubled by those who took that point of view, and it seemed to me that in the long run this was provision that could be left out. The justification for it was to place beyond debate a matter is a pecuUar consideration for a Minister of State-namely , the public or national interest - and to leave it beyond the examination of a court which is not appropriate to deal with it. the views of honourable members opin posite and those behind me and in the Senate in that that sub-section might best be left out. It is for that reason that the Government is but he was minded to leave it out. There has been some suggestion that the legisinlation was invalid or unconstitutional. I do not is regard the legislation in its existing, unamended form as unconstitutional. As I said on the preoccasion- I repeat it now-if section 4 (2) is left out it will improve it as a piece of legislation of insofar as it confers on an Attorney-General-no t in just this one but also future Attorneys General- a power which might be regarded as the being excessive. The honourable member for could Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) made a suggestion. When Ifirstconsidered the suggestion I thought it was reasonable. He said that m a makes such as this where an Attorney-General an order the Parliament that produces the ought to be able to review the order. It I felt it was appropriate for the produces the provision to go in. Senator Steele Hall said that he was troubled by the fact that the words' foreign tribunal' could I include the Privy Council. There again it seemed to me to be reasonable to exclude the Privy Council where it was exercising jurisdiction way of appeal from a court in this country. It unfortunate that these appeals to the Privy Council continue. I remind honourable members opposite that 3 State Attorneys-General are their poltiical colour and I invite honourable members opposite to say to those State Attorneys-General: 'Why do you not take the step of removing thatrightof appeal?' I have legislation. said this in a pubUc speech to one Attorney General while he was present. If therightof appeal was removed, this question would arise. I refer now to the reservation that the honourin able member for Kingsford-Smith has. I do not Uament have the same trouble. The Privy Council is laid on the taken out of the definition of'foreign tribunal'. We are deleting When the Privy Council is exercising jurisdiction the Act. I say to sub-section on appeal it is not likely to be in a situation, as athat if they indicate to me any foreign tribunal, where it is requiring evidence troubles them about this legislation from persons in Australia which would possibly ation in ensuing months or at any time be against the national interest. It would ing with a matter within the purview of Ausaccount and give it careful consideration. I it would traUan law, albeit that the Privy Council, as somethink would see it, is a foreign tribunal. I invite honour-the able members opposite to go to the State the legislation. Attorneys-General and see what they say. Some other matters were raised. I do not feel panies any threat from my rear, but it was suggested ority. That that I had no sense of urgency, rupted a defence debate. Let me say that since and marketingwanted that occurred proceedings have come before the Petroleum and Minerals Supreme Court of New South Wales and an form of nationalisation which order was made by me as I have already indibers cated to the Parliament. Those proceedings since been adjourned as a direct effect of the order made under this legislation. I say that in simply to indicate that the passing of the legiscomments lation on that night was necessary. request themselves were executed according to my information by a judge of the United District Court in Virginia on 21 October 1976. The honourable member for Hawker knew-the facts were not easy to discover; it is a pity he did not tell me-that the proceedings came before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on, I would imagine, 7 November. According to the honourable member it was Tuesday, 7 November. That only indicates that this matter was considered in some On the morning of 18 November I said to himrefer to this matter perhaps to defend myself to '2A. some extent: The matter of whether such evidence should be produced is under consideration at the moment. I meant that. The question of whether legislation by should be introduced that day was determined is that day. Thefinalform of the legislation had to be determined that day.

I do not apologise to the House or to members opposite or behind me for the Government's seeing fit on that night to introduce that Perhaps if I deal with the amendment now it may save time at the Committee stage.

In Committee The Bill.",49
87,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS,"The Opposition indicated at the second reading stage that it wished to move an amendsense of urgency.ment. I move: I After clause 2 insen the following new clause: Section 2 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section: '(2) This Act shall cease to be in operation on the expiration of 30 June 1977, and shall thereupon be deemed to have been repealed by an Act other than this Act.'. Let me advert to the position. The matter was urgent on the night of 18 November. As has beendealt said by both sides of the House, no party had chance to discuss the legislation. I understood predicament of the Attorney-General (Mr The Ellicott) and naturally, as a responsible Oppopoint sition, we could not say that we would oppose the legislation. Although we had no notice of the legislation we were on notice. There was litigathat tion in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The following week the House would not sit. Unbefore less the Attorney-General had the facility make the order it could well have been that he intended doing could not have been done be the cause there would have been no requisite legisin lation. We were very mindful of the fact, ever, that we regarded the legislation as being defective. The fact that the proposals have now had to be introduced as an amending piece of legislation convinces us again that some of the matters that have been discussed by our party colleagues have merit. Some concern will exist in certain sections with regard to penalties, the nature notice and particularly the nature of the exercise of the power in respect of these proceedings in orderly marketing situation. This was suggested by the honourable member for St George (Mr faced Neil) who seems to be more on the side of the Opposition than the Government regarding this matter. That is a matter in which he should exer-that cise his rights in the Party room. The Opposition wants to emphasise that by 30 June will have been another session of this Parliament. The Parhament may not necessarily be meeting on 30 June but by that time the Parliareject ment should have been meeting for some months. I envisage that it will do so from that February onwards. The Opposition may wish to raise matters arising out of orders made. The torney says that this could be done by motion disallowance but we might want to go to the merit of the situation, that is, to the Bill itself. do not want to be in a situadon of trying to concertain tinue to disallow orders made under a piece of legisladon. The Opposition might well want amend the legislation and it would want that be done by the Government. We need to have some understanding situation. I refer particularly to the debate Senate where senators, who are always deemed to have more wisdom than we in the House of side Representatives, were critical of the fact that previous Bill was urgent. Apparently the Government did not have enoughtimeto tell Government senators that litigation was schedintroduced. uled for the following week in New South Wales and, therefore, that the legislation had to be with that night. They were of the view that a the legislation should not have been rushed the through. So we are all ad idem on that position. Opposition is still convinced, from a Party of view, that there may be other matters which ought to be included in this legislation or deleted from it. Accordingly, I have no doubt the Opposition will be discussing this legislation in the fullest context of calm and reflection 30 June next year. I trust that the Governto ment would do likewise. The members of the whatGovernment who are so hostile to the ambit of legislation might well encourage a discussion then party room also. The Opposition is not howopposed to the principle of orderly marketing but it is opposed, perhaps, to the suggestion that the Attorney-General, irrespective of his merits or otherwise, can be given powers of this nature. The Opposition is anxious to ensure that justice is always done, whether it be in Australia or anywhere else. Accordingly, as a result of a party discussion, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation itself but opposes the urgency with of which the Bill was introduced. There has been no cleartimeto consider the ramifications of the an legislation and the underlying emotional issue of uranium contracts, the prices and the difficulties by producers. It is felt that this legislation should be reconsidered. Another piece of legislation should be introduced in thefirstsession, is, before 30 June 1977, after the Government and the Opposition have considered their 1977 there respective positions. I am aware that the Government intends to the amendment. The Opposition intends to press the amendment for the very good reason this is a fundamental issue. I advert again to the fact that the Opposition raised these matters Aton the evening of 18 November but it accepted for the view that if it pursued that issue, if it deliberately prevented that Bill from being We passed that night, it could well have destroyed Australian companies involved in litigation proceedings in the New South Wales courts. to It is a pity that Government members did not to understand what some of their Ministers conveyed to the Opposition. of the Mr ANTONY Whitlam (Grayndler) in the (3.8)- I second the amendment. I hope that some honourable members on the Government will support the Opposition on this question. the Nineteen days after the Act wasfirstpassed through both Houses of this Parhament, a much improved piece of legislation has been I think that by mid-year next year we could have an even better piece of legislation. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) ought to be able to acknowledge that fact. There is certainly nothing unusual about giving legislation ited Ufe and there will be plenty of time next in this Parliament and in this House to look ways of improving this legislation. I think should discipline ourselves to doing that. legislation was initiaUy a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation and was introduced in far rushed a fashion, as the Attorney acknowledges. It has been improved very greatly a mere 19 days after it was first introduced and we ought to be able to improve it very much in the months that lie ahead. It can hardly be said that advisers the Attorney-General's Department, have, for many years, been vexed about this question foreign proceedings and the prohibition of certain evidence. It is clear that they have not. measure has been introduced in relation to one specific proceeding begun in a United States trict court. This is a matter which the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has been States interested in and agitated about for a very long time. I think that we can look to perhaps improvations ing this whole question of the taking of evidence for foreign tribunals in Australia. I think that ought to look at it in a big way, in the large picture. The concern of the honourable member for Hawker has been very properly about orderly discussion marketing of raw materials. Clearly that is a ter on which Government members take a very different view from members on this side of the House. This is not the first instance in which the United States district courts have directed their processes towards the domestic courts in this has country under the United States anti-trust laws and under their reach in relation commerce of the United States corporations. It support. has been in relation to questions such as the manufacturing of television sets, such as in Zenith and Admiral litigation. I think that great many members on this side of the House would regard that litigation and the extent to which evidence was able to be produced as a result of letters of request issued to Australian domestic courts as very beneficial to world comand merce and in breaking up of cartels of an objectended tionable nature. This will be an increasing lem. The Attorney-General may well recall that when this matterfirstcame very hurriedly before the House, one of the other aspects that only perturbed me was the question of reciprocity and the extent to which other countries would seek to Umit the access of Australian courts their own courts for the purpose of taking evidence relating to proceedings begun in Australia a Umunder Australian laws. year The Attorney-General scored a couple of at cheap poltiical points when he spoke about the we attitudes of Labor State Attorneys-General to This the Privy Council. He will notfindany narrow 'States lighters' on this side of the House. I sugtoo gest that with regard to this question, which involves very difficult questions of international law, the Parliament should look at the rights of States in international law. I refer not to colonies, provinces or sub-units of a national government in but to how we are to deal with questions of foreign commerce and trade between all counof tries of the world, between what we called 'States' in international law. It would be a wonThis derful thing if Australia were seen to take some kind of leading role in this process because, disincreasingly, it will become a problem. Increasingly, not only the laws of the United but also the laws of other countries, will try to affect the foreign commerce of corporincorporated in those countries, which in turn will affect operations in Australia in which we evidence will need to be taken in Australia. Increasingly, too, we will see the operation of Australian laws affecting Australian corporations outside Australia. It is not an easy question. It is one about which we should discipline ourselves. It is one to which we could very well givetimefor during the next session. If it involves matnothing more than we have seen in this session, as in the stevedoring industry legislation or simply extending the operation of a current piece of legislation that may be satisfactory. But if this question does not deserve at least as much as the few minutes, hardly hours, that the Parliament prised. devoted to it this year, I would be very surto the foreign bers and I commend think it the amendment to all memdeserving of the Committee's the Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (3.14)- I rise to supa port the amendment. I want to draw the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr EUicott) to the question of what, I suppose, could be termed the validation of uramum prices. This matter is crucial to this legislation, particularly if directors public officials and companies are to be eximmunity from the claim made that perprobsons who are not United States nationals or residents or persons carrying on a business in the United States, are subject to those laws by reason of some economic effect of their conduct. I put 2 simple questions to the Attorney. Does he now agree that the one way in which blanket to immunity can be extended to those people is through a government marketing authority? would have to agree with that, as it would cumvent United States law. I turn to the second question. I get very annoyed with people have hangups about cliches. more homework and not merely say that the Opposition's poUcy is socialistic. The Attorney General should have taken a little more trouble to try to understand our policy. I raised this ter earUer. On 10 November an article appearedrights in the Australian Financial Review, which stated: Potential Australian uranium producers are lobbying Federal Government to move to frustrate the US Administration's attempts to ensure a free international market uranium. I assume from the remarks of the Attorneywe General that he believes that sociaUst. No doubt Mr Mackay will be pleased toremain on the statute hear that. The article continues: The managing director of EZ . . . Mr G. A. Mackay, has written to the Minister for National Resources . . . raising the possibility of an Australian uranium marketing authority supervised by the government, a move which would effectively protect local uranium ducers from US anti-trust moves. It states further: The US. Adrninistration is anxious to avoid the of producer cartels that canfixprices and market uramum on an OPEC model. It also states: However, Mr Mackay's letter to Mr Anthony provides an answer to . . . Jacobi's question. The letter alerts Mr ANTHONY It is a pity he did not read that on 10 Novemberto the US. Justice Department's investigation of uranium producers and he alsorecommends that the marketing undertaken by a government backed agency which help protect Australian companies from US. laws. Whether the cUche is nationalisation or socialquite ism, it is obvious that the uramum producers Australia regard the formulation of a national policy as sound, and I continue to press it. If thethought Government wants maximum blanket protection given to compames in the resources sector of country, the way in which we can afford them the immunity that they deserve is by establishing government marketing authority. I again ask Attorney-General to refer this matter back to histion Cabinet colleagues for serious consideration.",50
88,Mr ELLICOTT,FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS," I have dealt basically with matters that have been raised. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel office. Bowen) spoke for sometimeabout inserting an Question put. amendment in the legislation. I indicated earUer that so far as I am concerned the Government is That wUling to listen to any amendments put by the Opposition. If members of the He examine the legislation in the ensuing months cirand feel that it is ineffective or unjust, or breaches some basic principle, I ask them to who bring it to my attention and it will receive He should do a Uttleconsideration. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) raised the question of recimat-procity. He said that we have to consider the of States in international law. Well, I guess we have to do that. This legislation is concerned with the rights of Austraha in relation to this the matter and the intrusion of anti-trust laws in the for United States of America into what basically is Australia's concern, namely, the price at which willfixour uranium. We are acting in our Mr Mackay is a this wayinterests. national and that That is why we are acting in is why this legislation ought to books, f can understand the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) being a Uttle sensitive because I referred to him as a sociaUst. He does not Uke being called a socialist. When I was referring to him during the prodebate at the second reading stage, I was referring not to him personally but to the poUcy of the Opposition when in Government, namely, the formationpohcy of mining every piece of metal in Australia shares for and then selling it. That was the previous Government's method of having a marketing authority. This Government wiU not foUow that course. It has made it quite clear that it wants the mining operations of this country to be carried out by another method-on e that is more Ukely to be efficient and in the national interest. I have no doubt that in the range of pohcy be options that the Government will consider m this would matter will be the question of estabUshing some form of marketing authority. Let me make it clear that what the Labor Government did in and what previous Government did so far as their participation in any activity which is now to be the subject of anti-trust laws in the United States was concerned was exactly the thissame. The Labor Government did nothing about it. It had an opportunity to do something but it a did not take that opportunity. It continued with the the poUcy of the previous Government in relato this matter. It Ul-behoves the honourable member for Hawker to suggest at this stage that somewhat in default for not having taken the this action when the Labor Government had the opportunity to take it during the 3 years it was in the new clause proposed to be inserted (Mr Lionel forwardBowen's amendment) be insened.

89,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"by leave- I move: (1) That a Joint Select Committee be appointed to examine and repon on(a) the operation of provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Aet 1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Council; (b) the adequacy of provisions of the laws of the Northern Territory relating to entry to Aboriginal land, the protection of sites of significance, wildlife conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land, and (c) any other matters referred by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. (2) That the committee consist of the five members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs nominated by the Prime Minister, the three members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, and three Senators nominated by the Leader or the Government in the Senate and three Senators nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. (3) That every nomination of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. (4) That the committee elect as Chairman of the committee one of the members nominated by the Prime Minister or by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. (5) That the committee elect a Deputy Chairman who shall perform the duties of the Chairman of the committee at any ume when the Chairman is not present at a meeting of the committee, and at any time when the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are not present at a meeting of the committee, the members present shall elect another member to perform the duties of the Chairman at that meeting. (6) That the committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of three or more of its members and to refer to any such sub-committee any of the matters which the committee is empowered to examine. (7) That the committee or any sub-committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, to move from place to place and to sit during any adjournment of the Parliament. Tellers: Cameron, Donald (8) That seven members of the committee constitute a quorum of the committee, and a majority of the members of Corbett, J. a sub-committee constitute a quorum of that sub-committee. (9) That in matters of procedure the Chairman or Deputy Chairman presiding at the meeting have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, have a casting vote, and that, in other matters, the Chairman or Deputy Chairman have a deliberative vote only. (10) That the committee be provided with all necessary staff, facilities and resources. (11) That the committee or a sub-committee have to authorise publication of any evidence given before any document presented to it. (12) That the committee report by 31 May 1977 and any member of the committee nave power to add a protest or dissent to any report. (13) That the foregoing provisions of thisresolution,so far as they are inconsistent with the notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. (14) That a message be sent to this resolution andrequestingthat it concur and take action accordingly. I indicated in my statement to the House on 17 November that the Government proposed to establish a Joint Parliamentary Committee to report not later than 31 May 1977 on the operation of provisions of the land rights Bill dealing (vi) with the identification of traditional owners and their relationship to the land councils and on the adequacy of laws of the Northern Territory ing to entry to Aboriginal land, the protection Of sacred sites, wild life conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. The successful operation of the land rights legislation depends to a very great extent on the way in which the land councils are able to reflect the wishes and interests of Aboriginals with traditional interest in land. In particular, where there are proposals for the leasing of land, for exploration of minerals or development of mining on their lands, or the construction of roads, and so on, it will be necessary for the land councils to act in accordance with the wishes of the traditional owners of the areas concerned. To do this properly, the councils must establish registers indicating which people are associated with particular areas of land. The councils will need to employ competent staff to carry out this work and to help consult with traditional owners. These are matters which the Joint Parliamentary Committee will be asked to examine. In addition, and of equal importance, the Committee will be asked to consider and report on the adequacy of the complementary legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in the several areas referred to in the land rights legislation. There is a recently introduced ordinance on wild life protection and the Committee may consider whether any amendment to it is necessary to take account of the provisions in the Commonwealth legislation. There is an existing ordinance for the protection of sites and objects of Aboriginal and historical significance and we will be preparing proposals for amending legislation in this field. The Assembly has proposals for new laws in relation to entry to Aboriginal land and access to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. These are all matters of power very real day-today importance to Aboriginals it and in the Northern Territory. I cannot overstate the importance of the Committee's work in these 2 that areas. I assure the House that it will have the full co-operation of my Department in its work.",54
90,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I standing orders, have effect move: Omit paragraph 1 (b) and substitute the following the Senate acquainting it of paragraphs: '(b) The operation of laws of the Northern Territory which affect Aboriginal land, in particular lawsrelatingto: (i) entry to Aboriginal land; (ii) protection of sacred sites; (iii) wildlife conservation; (iv) entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land; (v) roads upon Aboriginal land, and right of entry upon pastoral propeity. '(ba) The effect of mining operations, including exploration and prospecting operations, on aboriginal land or relatland which is claimed by Aborigines, and*. I am disadvantaged in this debate because it appears that the terms of reference proposed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) have not been circulated. If i am correct in saying that, all members are disadvantaged as I am.",55
91,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,They were circulated at 11.30 a.m.,55
92,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has this tendency to engage in a bit of ad hockery. When it is all said and done the matter about which we are talking is not scheduled to be debated until the House has dealt with the Defence Services Homes Amendment Bill. It is just fortuitous that several members of the Opposition who are actively involved in this matter happened to be in the House at present. This is not the first occasion on which the Minister has sprung this kind of surprise. I think that we are entitled to a little more consideration. Mr Chipp- I rise to order. Could I suggest to the honourable member that if what he says is true, he raises a valid point. Would it not be sensible to adjourn this debate for an hour or so so that we can all be informed on what he is talking about?",55
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Mr Drummond) There is no point of order as this is not a matter upon which the Chair can decide.,55
94,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not averse to any initiative that the honourable member for Hotham might want to take in that regard. I am prepared to bat on in view of the fact that we are like riding school horses heading for home. The amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Opposition is intended to widen the reference of the proposed committee to include control of roads over Aboriginal land and also to cover the question of entry to pastoral properties. Both of these matters have been referred to extensively by His Honour Justice Woodward. They have been a subject of considerable debate in recent days. They have also been the subject of amendments. It would seem to me that honourable members on both sides of the House would acknowledge that they are questions of very great significance and importance to the Aboriginal people. The operations amendment proposes an additional term of reference to include in the Committee's functions oversight of exploration and exploitation of Aboriginal lands by mining interests, including matter. those grants made under the proclamation sections of the land rights Bill where Aboriginal consent to mining was mandatory. The situation generally is that the Opposition is not impressed with the fact that the appointwith ment of this Committee has become necessary ail. It has been the view of the Opposition these matters which are to be the subject of inquiry to be undertaken by the joint committee should have been retained as responsibilities of the Australian Parliament. I might just take opportunity to mention that on 27 May 1967 the referendum seeking to give power to the Combeing monwealth in respect of Aboriginal matters was carried overwhelmingly by the posal sought to remove any ground for the belief that the Constitution discriminated against people of the Aboriginal race and at the same time to make it possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to enact special laws for those people. The proposal was carried in all States. A total 5 183 113 people voted for the proposition and 527 007 voted against. In other words there was a massive majority of4 656 106 people who said as distinctly and as clearly as they possibly that they wanted the Australian Government to accept responsibUity in respect of Aboriginal affairs. The fact that this Government has been unpreority pared to take responsibiUty in respect of number of matters gives cause for very grave concern. We have indicated that we have no alternative but to participate in the now being offered to us. If the Government is to turn responsibiUty over to the Legislative Assemmittee. bly of the Northern Territory for such important matters as sacred sites and access to Aboriginal lands we certainly would want to be involved in a process of scrutiny. But we do not want to it in a half-baked way. We want to get into effectively in respect of all the issues and not the ones that the Minister has mentioned. Why is it that the Minister has excluded from the committee's proposed area of inquiry the question of the control of roads over Aboriginal Mr land? Why has he deliberately omitted the need for the committee to investigate this very serious problem of Aboriginal entry to pastoral properties? I believe that the whole area of the Ranger inquiry, the question of mining by Nabalco Pty Ltd at Gove, the operations of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Groote Eylandt and other mining in other parts of the Territory could stand the scrutiny of the committee as well. I regard this whole proposition as a backward step. The people of Australia have spoken on this Only this week when we were talking about winding up the Council for Aboriginal Affairs I drew attention to the fact that the Council had been involved for a long time in co-operating the States and in arranging for a transfer of at power from the State governments to the Austhat tralian Government in respect of Aboriginal the matters. In October 1973 the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act was passed. The effect of that legislation is thatfiveof the six the States have relinquished almost all of their involvement with Aboriginal affairs, Queensland the only State refusing to co-operate in terms of the will of the people as expressed in the people. That pro1967 referendum. That is what has been happening; that is what was caused to happen under the Labor Government which gave effect to the wish of the people. To turn these activities over to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory is tantaof mount to turning the clock back. It is like giving all of the other responsibUities for Aboriginal affairs back to the States in which case we would get varying degrees of enthusiasm and varying could degrees of neglect. There would be an enormous differential from one State to the other. Moreover, there would befinancialdeficiencies in that some States would not attribute the sense of prito Aboriginal problems that others might. a Obviously the Commonwealth has a responsibility in this respect. On consideration of these matters one can see that the proposed committee process that is has an important job to do. The Opposition will co-operate with the comIt is intended that the committee should comprise the eight members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 6 senators. This means that 14 be in people from the 2 Houses of Parliament will it comprise this joint committee. The Opposition just will join the committee and, as it has done in the past in regard to other Aboriginal problems, play its part enthusiastically. But I believe that once we go about our business we ought not to adopt a half-baked approach. I ask the Minister earnestly to consider accepting the amendment that has been put to him in good faith so that we can ensure that all of these matters are thoroughly investigated and the best interests of the Aboriginal people can be adequately served.",55
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS, Is the amendment seconded?,57
96,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,I second the amendment. I will be relatively brief in my remarks. Mr Martyr-You can't.,57
97,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Yes I can. It would not take me more than half a minute to describe the honourable member's inadequacies or adequacies. I support my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) in this matter. Whilst it is true that the Minister Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) may by reference expand the proposed committee's work, I think that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hughes gives the committee's terms of reference more precision and more direction and therefore we ought to act upon it. I will not go over the ground which we canvassed during the debate on the land rights legislation. I will not repeat our lack of faith in the capacity of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to carry out the duties that we think were imposed upon us by the people of Australia in 1967 and in following years. I think the suggestion to expand the membership of the present Committee to include members of the Senate is a good one. The original suggestion was that a separate committee be appointed. However, I think that the re-creation of the Standing Committee in the form of a special land rights scrutiny committee is a good step towards strengthening the parUamentary committees. I also think it is an interesting step in the role which this Parliament plays. My beUef is that the Parliament spends too much of its time considering legislation upon which it has no effect and too little time upon its proper function of scrutiny of the results of that legislation. The new committee will be involved in the scrutiny of legislation which has been passed by the Parliament. I think that is an important step. It may be that the Parliament could turn its attention to other areas as well. The present Committee, with the addition of the senators, will be a fairly powerful one. I think it will have on it at least 4 people who have been Ministers responsible for the general area of Aboriginal affairs. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will agree that the present Committee has some very distinguished and effective back benchers on it. The chairmanship is pretty sound, as long as it is given proper direction. I note the Minister's statement that we will get full support from his Department. I hope we will be able to get support from a large number of areas of government, particularly from the House committee staff and so on. Over the last 6 months a number of us have become very deeply involved in the committee side of Aboriginal affairs. I know it has been a very strenuous exercise physically. It has been very demanding intellectually. I am convinced that committees will not be able to work as effectively as we wish unless we expand the servicing of them. The staff travels all over Australia continually. They do their work with great dedication. I am certain that this House is stUl rather miserly in its apfor proach to the staffing and servicing of committees. There is one other matter to which I think we ought to turn our attention in regard to the work of committees. I think it is time that we allowed committees to appoint one of their members to investigate a particular aspect of a subject. In any other area of government we are Ukely to appoint one person to carry out an investigation and report. Sometimes it is a waste of resources to have a number of people-fiv e or six-listenin g to one lot of evidence or even investigating one area of activity. This is a question for the Standing Orders Committee or perhaps for a special resolution of this Parliament. I know that the activities of the present Committee would have been expanded enormously and would have been carried out with a greater economy of human resources if individual members could have done some of the work that sub-committees do on occasions.",57
98,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am impelled to say a few words about the amendment because I think the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) seriously misunderstands the purport of the motion. Nothing proposed in the amendment is not already contained in the motion which, when passed, will cause this committee to be set up. I fear that when the honourable member for Hughes moved his amendment he included 2 extra subparagraphs, (v) and (vi), in sub-paragraph 1 (b), under the impression that the 2 new subparagraphs are not already included in those matters which may be investigated under the original motion. Therefore I ask him to turn his mind to the terms of the motion. Paragraph (1) states: That a Joint Select Committee be appointed to examine and report on(a) . . . (b) . . . (c) any other matters referred by the Minister iginal Affairs. They could quite clearly and quite easily embrace the points made by the honourable ber for Hughes. I fear that out of goodwill failed to understand that. The more he spoke more I was certain that he misunderstood it. The Committee should be seen as a testament of good faith. It is a testament of good faith. there be any doubt about that, there are 2 points on which I wish to comment. Thefirstis the innate generosity manifested by the House Representatives in respect of any joint comhonourable mittee. Paragraph (2) of the motion of the ter for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) makes clear that there will be 8 members of the House of Representatives and 6 senators. Already the Senate is over-represented. I hope that members of the committee from the House tives do their best to see that the chairmanship authority remains where it ought to remain. If there were any residual doubt beyond that as the good faith of those who propose the Comrefer mittee, I refer to paragraph (3) of the Minister's motion. Mr MCLean-Are you on the present original CommiUee?",57
99,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I am not on the Compastoral mittee. I suggest that members opposite and members on this side of the House look at paracerning graph (3) of the Minister's motion. Paragraph (12) states: That the committee report by 31 May 1977 and that member of the committee have power to add a protest sent to any repon. If there were any doubt as to the purpose of ting up this committee, that doubt ought to be removed immediately by the paragraph. Mem70 bers of the committee retain their freedom to come to what they feel are legitimate judgments and to report those judgments. So the committee Except would not operate in a complete vacuum and do otherwise nothing while another legislature passes legisern lation. It is emboldened and requested to report by 31 May. It may not necessarily report. That merely indicates that the effluxion of In time will not become a weapon which would be defence used to make the activities of the committee and void and inappropriate to the examination of this legislation and its operation in the ern Territory. That report has to be in within months. That is not a long period. So I think thatwill. the OoDOsition has, with the greatest of goodwill, misunderstood those paragraphs of the motion which propose to set up the committee and which embrace all those propositions. They embrace an attitude of sincerity and an attitude of for Abor- goodwill. They retain freedom for members of the committee. There is one other aspect in the whole attitude memof the Opposition to this legislation which he worries me. I feel that it has not yet the comprehended that the Northern Territory is to be given statehood within 5 years. This is a simple fact. We will not build up the greatest of Shouldgoodwill or sense with respect to Aboriginal affairs if we seek continually from here to create a barrier between Aborigines and those who are of exercising legitimate authority. I hope the member for Wills (Mr Bryant), the Minishonourable member for Hughes and the honourit able member for Reid (Mr Uren), if and when he speaks from his position of great authority, will comprehend all those things and will seek to look at them, having in mind goodwill for the of RepresentaAboriginal people. Two other aspects of the statements which to have been made ought to be borne in mind. I to the proposition contained in the amendment moved by the Opposition that the operation of the laws in the Northern Territory should be investigated insofar as they affect Abland, in particular laws relating to roads upon Aboriginal land and therightof entry upon property. From the way in which Opposition members have made their statements conthese matters, one would think that they were not aware of what the legislation here and in the Northern Territory now encompasses. I any suggest that they have one or two hangups with or disrespect to these matters whichflowfrom their 1975 legislation. I ask honourable members opsetposite to look at the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, in particular to clauses (1) and 70 (3), which relate to the entry of people onto Aboriginal land. These clauses are worthwhile examining. Clause 70 (1) states: in the performance of functions under this Act or in accordance with this Act or a law of the NorthTerritory, a person shall not enter or remain on Aboriginal land. Penalty: $1,000. be a final Clause 70 (3) states: proceedings for an offence against sub-section (1), it is a if the person charged proves that his entry or null remaining on the land was due to necessity. Under the 1975 legislation there were many Northroads in the Northern Territory on which an 6 effective toll bar could have been imposed at I believe that that is the hangup which still remains when this proposal is criticised. I refer to clause 73 of the Bill, which makes it quite clear that ordinances of the Northern Territory have to coincide with and not differ from, nor contradict, what can be enacted here and those laws which this Parliament retains the right to enact. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) appreciates these things immediately. At the end of clause 73 (1) the following saving provision states: . . . but any such Ordinance has effect to the extent only that it is capable of operating currently with the Commonwealth, and, in particular, with this Act So in each of those cases there of goodwill. I would hope that the Opposition would not use this merely to set up bargaining positions, political or otherwise, with respect Aboriginal land rights. I have a prevailing feelthe ing that the principal aim of Opposition memtutions bers is to do so, and that would be to the detriment both of this Parliament and of people on behalf of whom this legislation being introduced. Motion (by Mr Donald Cameron) agreed to: That the question be now put Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 3 December, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be nowreada second time.",58
100,Mr UREN,DEFENCE SERVICES HOMES,"The Opposition opposes this Bill. The Bill demonstrates the tionalism and the narrowness of the Fraser meant Government's approach to housing. The low purpose of this Bill is to aboUsh a Labor Governand ment initiative-the Australian Housing Corporthe ation. It is just one more example of this Government's fear of endorsing anything that in the Labor Government created. In support of this measure the Fraser Government states, without qualification, that the Housing Corporstatistics ation represented an unnecessary and undesirservicemen, able duplication of services already avaUable and, in particular, services already provided the various State governments. This must be of the most naive statements that any governstructured ment anywhere has ever made. It equals the naivety of the yo-yo devaluation of our currency the future. and the Government's announcements on tariffs. This attitude to the Housing Corporation onstrates once again the Government's inadthe equacy and its lack of understanding of the strucinequities, tural inequities in the current housing approach. We in the Labor Party never saw the Housing Corporation as the beginning and the end of our attempts to make housing poUcies more responsive to the needs of the people. But it was an important step forward; it was an evolutionary step. We saw the need to estabUsh a housing bank to direct housing finance and assistance to those sectors of the housing market which most needed help. This housing bank was to introduce innovative programs aimed at those sectors of the laws of the community that were not and still are not . . . being catered for by any of the existing housing is a manifestation sources. The programs and schemes that the Housing Corporation was to introduce at the beginning of to this year were to complement and supplement operations of traditional home finance instiand the State housing authorities. They would not have dupUcated any of the functions those or programs being offered by any of these is bodies. Apart from these innovative programs that were designed to help those in need of special forms of housing assistance, one of the Australian Housing Corporation's main responsibUities was the ongoing administration of the defence service homes scheme. This responsibUity in itself was an important step. It was a step which was intended to regularise and to improve the defence service homes scheme. The Corporation undertook the first comprehensive review Second Reading of the scheme since its inception 57 years ago. Until 1975 and the establishment of the Housing Corporation, changes to the scheme were made by ad hoc amendments. This ad hoc approach resulted in many undesirable consesecquences. In particular, most of the changes that the ordinary soldier, the private, the income man, never really got the benefits. By large, the people who really benefited were semor members of the armed forces, the officers and the well-off-thos e who 'succeeded' life. If the Government doubts this all it has to do is to look at the statistics which have been produced by the Housing Corporation. These clearly demonstrate that the ordinary past and present, have not received the benefits that the nation promised themby benefits that they cannot and now never will reone ceive because of the way this scheme has been and administered in the past and, no doubt, will be restructured and administered in It concerns us on this side of the House that the demGovernment has not tabled the annual report of Corporation, which demonstrates these even though the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman), who had the responsibility for the Corporation, has had the report for at least months. The Government is afraid to table this report before this debate because the informaThe tion and recommendations in it embarrass the Government. The Government, for narrow sec20 tional reasons, is not prepared to introduce the sweeping changes recommended in that report. There actually is a report on the whole war serreduced vice homes scheme, or the defence service homesBut scheme as it is now known, which is a report of the Housing Corporation in which certain recomCanberra. mendations are made. The Government has had that report for 4 months. It will get the debate of the way and then table the report. The been Government's failure to table the report, as required by the legislation, is just another example of its mode of operation. The Governto ment is deliberately keeping the people and Parliament in the dark. By holding back the report and by ignoring the recommendations of the now defunct Australian Housing Corporation the Government is seeking to ignore the probscheme lems which have been apparent for sometimeinin the defence service homes scheme. By holding back the report the Government is denying the Parliament the opportunity to properly debate this legislation. This is one other reason why should oppose the Bill which is before us. The Government is deliberately maintaining scheme which discriminates against those it intended to help, that is the ordinary Australian servicemen, past and present. The Government is ensuring that this discriminot natory practice will continue by replacing what was an 8-man corporation with a one-man body.even I mean that the secretary of the Department Veterans' Affairs will replace the Australian Housing Corporation. The effects of this will regretted. The bureaucracy will take steps to ensure that the mode of operation and the administration of the defence service homes scheme, as it existed prior to 1975, will be recon-development stituted. This will result in 2 things. It means Parliament will not have access to the detaUed accounts and analyses of the operations of the defence service homes scheme. It also means the morale of the officers employed in adminisgovernments, tering the scheme will be lowered. The very nature of the Australian Housing Corporation and the innovative programs it was going to administer in every area of housing made accountability and analysis mandatory. In the short Ufe of the Housing Corporation major savings in administrative costs is something which this Government says it sup4 ports. It argues that it supports cuts in administrative costs. Here we have an example of this. system of decentralised administration and accounting led to significant reductions of about per cent in overhead costs. If the Corporation had continued to operate there is no doubt in our minds that the overhead costs could have been by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent. now these savings will be lost as the administration of the scheme is once again centralised in In the last 12 months, for the first time in 57 years, people involved in the administraouttion of the defence service homes schemes have given the opportunity to use their own initiative. In other words, the people in the Corporation were encouraged to use their initiative and be involved more in the decision making prothe cess. This will now be taken away from them. Another area of the defence service homes which caused the Australian Labor Party government great concern and which led to the amalgamation of the scheme into the Australian Housing Corporation was the problem of land purchases by the old administrators of the we defence service homes scheme and its lack of interrelationship with either Federal, State or a local governments in urban and regional was development strategies. Under the administration of past conservative governments large parcels of land were bought up in capital cities and in major centres throughout Australia. I do not for one moment say that the purchase of land is a good thing. But this should be done in cooperation with State and local government and with other government agencies. It should of be done on a rational basis, knowing the time table of development, instead of buUding up an be enormous bank because of a poor accountability system. Currently more than 1 200 hectares of underdeveloped land are held throughout the country. There has never been any responsible or economic management plans for that these estates. SimUar parcels of land have been developed in the past on an ad hoc basis. They were developed without regard to the developthatment strategies of local authorities or State or of our overall urban and regional development planning trusts. In some cases their development led to the estabUshment of enclaves of wealthy returned servicemen. The worse example of this is the development of the North Rocks estate. The price of homes and land on that estate ranged from $35,000 to well over $55,000, with the majority of homes being in the were made. This top bracket. Obviously, when the maximum loan obtainof able under the defence service homes scheme was $15,000 the ordinary serviceman or serviceman on the average wage or even above the average wage could not afford to chase a home on such an estate unless he had owned a home previously and transferred the money from the sale of that home into the new war service home. A maximum loan of $15,000 was available and yet the purchase prices ranged up to $55,000. One can imagine the enormous total loan which would be necessary in order to meet that commitment. Later I shall incorporate in Hansard some tables to show the real debt burden remaining because of the high interest rates which exist today. In talking about high interest rates I exclude the defence service homes scheme. After all, if one wants to raise a loan pay off a $55,000 home, the $15,000 loan is just drop in the bucket. If schemes like this are to meaningful and if they are to satisfy the housing needs of the ordinary serviceman or exinterest serviceman, the maximum loan available has be increased. Mr Newman-Why did you not increase it?",59
101,Mr UREN,DEFENCE SERVICES HOMES,"The Labor Government in 1973 increased the maximum loan from $12,000 to $15,000. But the latterfigureis now insufficient. Today the maximumfigureneeds to be at least $20,000. With an amount of $20,000 available most of the ordinary servicemen would be catered for. It concerns me that this Government, when in Opposition, was critical of the Labor Government for introducing a waiting period for defence service home loans. But when this Government had the opportunity to shorten that period it refused to do so. In fact, it appropriated a much smaller amount thisfinancialyear than we appropriated in the last year in which we were in government. I have already said that administration of the defence service homes scheme, while an important function of the tralian Housing Corporation, was only one funcearnings, tion of that body. The Corporation was estabthe lished to direct housingfinanceto those people who were being ignored by the existing housing market. There can be no doubt that everyone the Parhament is aware of this problem. We quagmire. know, as the Government knows, that people whose earnings currendy fall between 95 per facing cent and 135 per cent of average weekly earning knows this cannot obtain housingfinancefrom traditional problem. Inbut sources. These people are deprived of the opportunity and benefit of home ownership. I have explained before, but I think I should explain again, that we were able to meet housingits commitments of people earning up to 95 per centknows average weekly wages. We made money available through the Commonwealth-State exHousing Agreement. Previously under the old well conservative government, the MCMahon purGovernment, this money was made available at the long term bond rate. Of course, written into the agreement was a tax rebate to meet the situation. When our Party came into government we reduced that rate from the long term bond rate to 4 per cent. The long term bond rate is about 10 per cent today. Therefore, that money was made available at a 6 per cent subsidy. People on housing commission waiting lists who earn up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings can make application for that money. More money should be made available in order to reduce die number of people on the waiting lists. The interest on to loans from the advance to the home builders a account is at a slightly higher rate than 4 per be cent- I think it is An per cent-and there is an administrative charge on that, malting the total rate about 5 per cent for people earning to between 85 per cent and 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. People up to that level have been protected, although the waiting lists are still excessive. But at least there are schemes in existence under which those people can get loans. The people in difficulties are those who earn between 95 per cent and 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. Later in the debate I will show that, because of actions of this Government in the last 2 weeks, that level of 135 per cent of average weekly earnings will be extended to 155 per cent. People earning between 95 per cent and 155 per cent willfindthemselves in a no man's land when they try to obtain a loan for land and housing. This will be true particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. We all know that banks and building societies do not lend where the rate of the repayment exeeds 25 per cent to 30 per cent of earnings. What this means is that people who Ausearn less than 135 per cent of average weekly or less than $248 a week, are denied opportunity of home ownership. At least 88 per cent of all wage earners earn less than 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. So one can in see that potential home ownership is in a Young people and others seeking a home are a difficult situation. The Government has done nothing to face up to the fact the Government has refused to do anything for this group. It also knows that the repayment gap problem will worsen because of its mismanagement of the economy, particularly actions in the last 2 weeks. The Government that interest rates will increase in the next year by at least 2 per cent. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who is at the table, is aware that interest rates will rise by at least 2 per cent in the next year. The Government knows that this will add, on average, between $28 and $36 a month to the repayment gap faced by these people. The effect of this will be to deprive non-home owners earning up to 155 per cent of average weekly earnings of the opportunity to own their own homes. That is what the Government's economic poUcies will achieve in housing. Yet, recognising this, the Government goes on with its deliberate intention to aboUsh the Australian Housing Corporation, a body which was estabUshed to introduce programs and forms of assistance to NA Rate of interest Per cent per annum 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 10.5 11.0 11.5 12.0 NA Rate of interest Per cent per annum 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 10.5 11.0 11.5 12.0 ease the repayment gap.

Even the Labor Government found it extremely difficult to meet its commitments to this group.

Those programs were only in the early stages of development, but they were being will undertaken by the Australian Housing Corporation. If one examines the table onefindsthat on loan of $20,000 at the existing interest rate 10.5 per cent the monthly repayments over years would be $199. That is well in excess of the capacity of those on average weekly earnings $184. People trying to repay that amount on basis of 25 per cent to 30 per cent of their ings would be in a very difficult situation. interest rates are increased next year by 2 per cent or even more, those repayments will represent an enormous burden.

I would have thought that a rate of 12 per cent would have been sufficient, but regrettably I will have to exhave the table reviewed and I will have to show rates of up to 14.5 per cent. The Minister at the table, in his cynical way, can laugh. Does he want to put into the record that interest rates not rise by at least 2 per cent in the next year? Mr Newman-It is already on the record.",63
104,Mr UREN,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"The Minister says that it is a already on the record. We will see how history of deals with him. This Government, which has 20 showed complete incompetence in economic management, knows the enormous pressure that of this will put on the home building sector. The the Government has intimated already that it is earnorienting all its economic pressure to export If incentives and that the rural sector and the export of the minerals sector will be protected by directions from the Government to the Reserve Bank. Enormous pressures will be placed on the home building sector in relation to the availthis ability offinance.If the Government trunks it can isolate this sector, it is badly mistaken. Labor Government tried to protect this sector itself. When interest rates rose in the year by more than 2 per cent, we gave a direction the Reserve Bank to make sure increased by only one per cent. The situation is that interest rates, Uke anything else,findtheir own level. Consequently moneyflowedaway would from the home buUding sector because the mally have returns from interest rates in that sector were ing developments lower than those in other areas. The Governmentventure basis by private cannot isolate any one sector from That rise in interest rates will put enormous pressure on the whole home buUding sector. I say that with great gloom and not with great deUght. The Labor Government in its last Budget proposed to introduce a deferred mortgage repayment scheme on second mortgage loans, to assist those people earning between 95 per cent and 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Labor Government appropriated $20m for this purpose in the Hayden Budget. If this scheme had been introduced it would have meant that in the early years of the loan repayments would have been lower than those on loans obtainable from traditional financial sources. The program would have helped the low and middle income families, particularly onewould income and one-parent families, to obtain equate housing. It was our intention that these funds initially would be made avaUable to ies whose regular weekly income, excluding overtime and chUd endowment, did not exceed 110 per cent of average weekly earnings in State. Recipients would have been expected to contribute no more than 30 per cent of regular gross income of the household to meet mortgage repayments. We did this even though we knew that some buUding societies were introducing simUar schemes. Our scheme was to supplement the buUding societies' programs. The buUding societies' schemes did not cater for people earning as Uttle as 110 per cent of average weekly earnings. The schemes operatives introduced by the private lending institutions catered only for those earning marginaUy less than 135 per cent of the average weekly earnation ings. They did not even get close to those people earning 110 per cent of the average weekly earnation ings. Although our scheme initially was to loans avaUable to people earning up to 110 cent of the average weekly earnings we intended progressively to increase thefigureto 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. We knew that was a difficult area. We thought that the dethat ferred mortgage repayment scheme was one way Theto attack the situadon. With the coming rise in interest rates and the scarcity of money these pri1974 vate institutions will be forced to abandon the to programs they introduced for these potential that interest rates home buyers. The Corporation under a Labor government loans also have made avaUablefirstmortgage in thisfinancialyear, but these would norbeen avaUable only for specific housbeing carried out on a joint developers and developthe others. ment corporations or land words, for buUdings carriedcommissions;out in in other co-operation with respective State authorities. We recognised that to achieve our urban and regional development objectives specific housing programs of this nature were necessary. The Corporation also had been instructed to look at the possibility of introducing loans to cover the fuU cost of housing. To achieve this and to aUow traditional institutions to lend a higher proportion of the total value of a home it was our intention to amend the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation Act to guarantee low income earners. This form of guarantee would have allowed the low income home buyers to acquire their home loans and to repay them by minimising thefinancialburden in the early years of the loan. In this way we have been able to Unk the income of the adhome purchasers with a guarantee that they would never have to pay more than 25 per cent famUof thenincome as repayments until the home purchasers reached the point where they had enough equity in their homes to be regarded by each banks and building societies as normal risks. It was also our intention to use the Corporation to estabUsh cost rent housing associations. The basic principle of this proposal was that non profit-making co-operatives would be funded in part or in full by way of loans or if necessary grants to construct, acquire or refurbish housing according to their needs and interests. We allocated $9m to the Australian Housing Corporthe ation in 1975-76 for this purpose. These coalso would have had access to funds from conventionalfinancialinstitutions. This scheme was developed by the Housing Corporin thetimeof the Labor Government. As I said at the beginning of this debate, the Corporwas not the be-aU and the end-all. Its estabmake lishment was an evolutionary step towards per developing working poUcies to overcome the structural inequities in the provision of housing in Australia. I believe the Corporation was a fine body. I think it had good foundations. It is a great regret that it is to be abolished. I think would have, made a great contribution to the whole housing situation in Australia.",63
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF, the Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
106,Mr KING,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"There is one position thing we must admire. Since the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) was elevated to theaccusations. position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition he has certainly been carrying on a rearguard fighting spirit. Perhaps he learned that attitude 30-odd years ago when he was recognised as something of afirst-classsoldier. However, I the think I should remind the Deputy Leader of the homes Opposition that the purpose of this Bill is to reconstitute the Australian Housing Corporation in accordance with the Government's anmatter nounced policy and to change its name, nature and function so that its sole responsibility will the administration of the defence service homes scheme. I alsoremindthe Deputy Leader of Opposition that it was the stated policy of Liberal and National Country parties prior 1975 elections that the activities of the Australian Housing Corporation would be critically increases examined. Following that examination the increase, Government decided that the Corporation amount should be abolished. The decision was anGovernment nounced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 2 February this year. We hear members of the Opposition often $3,000. criticising the Government because it has changed or not fulfilled its policy or has broken promise. The intentions are quite clearly set m the second reading speech of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community ment Development (Mr Newman). Of course, honouration able members opposite have become critical of that too. Basically this legislation is a machinery measure. I regret that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett) cannot participate this debate this afternoon. I know that he wishedentered to do so but he has beentieddown with other important business. Naturally enough he will until 1972. attempt to join in the debate before it is concluded. The legislation gives one an opportunity of examining the issues in a somewhat limited It is unfortunate that since the Prime Minister announced the Government's proposals there be has been a great deal of speculation. Fears been expressed that the principles of the original Defence Service Homes Act will be removed. There have been suggestions of increasing often it interest rates. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition today forecast an increase of 2 per cent. I suppose he is entitled to make a guess the same as anyone else. I do not know how he arrives at 2 per cent. I look forward to seeing how far out his forecast is by the end of next year. One would expect that it is the role of the Opcontinually to throw doubt in the minds of the people outside this place by making wild Let me refer to portion of the Minister's second reading speech. This will remove all doubts as to where the Government is going on some this matter. The relevant part reads: . . . me Government is whole-heartedly committed to preservation and continuation of the defence service scheme, which we see as a scheme of historical and social importance for a large number of Australians. One must remember that the original Bill on this was introduced way back in 1918. Since thattimethe Liberal and National Country parbeties have carried on the principle of preferential interest rates. This appUed for aU the funds made the avaUable in this area up until 1972. With a the change of government we saw a change of polto the icy. It is true that the Labor Government increased the amount of the loan. Those have to be taken for granted as costs though it is fair and proper that the of the loans should increase. The Labor did not follow the preferential rates of thetimebut rather increased interest rates from 3% per cent to In per cent for the amount of loan which exceeded $ 12,000; that is the last It is true, too, that thefieldof eUgibUity has been widened. There is no doubt in my mind athat this has been acceptable to many people. out But whUst this has been appreciated by many, I believe it is the general consensus on the Governside that we do not want to see any alteror interference with the original claimants of the old defence service homes. I want to make that point very clear. I for one would not go along with any interference with those claims bein cause I believe that that was an agreement into by the individual claimant and the Government of the day which has been upheld With regard to the question of the upper Umit, which is running at $ 15,000 at the presenttime,it is pretty obvious that it naturally has not kept E area. ace with demand and the increased cost of ousing. If this was a straight out grant, it would different. But it is not a grant; it is a loan. No have government can make such a loan without havmg some form of security. Naturally enough it demands security for afirstmortgage. Quite it is rather difficult forrecipientsto be able to take full advantage of the loan of $15,000 still have sufficient funds premises which they have purchased. There is no The need for me to spell that out because it is obvious permits that one does not obtain any sort of reasonable relations home costing under, say, $20,000 today. There is no doubt that it would certainly cost much in housing excess of that amount. I commend to the Parliament. I do not think there is any need to go into lengthy discussions on it. I do not It agree that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Australian needed to go into all the ramifications of the gathered Housing Corporation. I do not think it is at all benefit of the necessary. I conclude by compUmenting the Government on carrying out its original promise to do exactly what has been done. I think I can say, on of a lot of ex-service personnel throughout Australia, that they certainly appreciate importance of the change of name from the old Repatriation Department to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. At the sametime,I certainly welcome the opportunity of tying the defence service homes to that Department where, in opinion, it should have been many years ago.",65
107,Mr LES JOHNSON,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"The position honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) oudined (Mr could easUy give the unsuspecting the impression people who that nothing of significance is involved in this ing a housingare legislation. He seemed to convey the idea that we are dealing with an innocuous matter, whereas, in fact, the Parliament at thistimeis actually taktutionality ing a decision to abolish the Australian Housing Corporation as it has been known and undertraUan stood. There is nothing provided for in this legisin lation at the present time which brings advanvicemen, tage to ex-servicemen in any way. The Bill designed simply to take that Housing Corportralian ation, with aU its great objectivity and characterGovernment istics designed to assist people to obtain houses Australia and to whittle it down to an authority which will do nothing more than administer the Defence Service Homes Scheme. That is the whole essence of the Bill. In other words, we involved in the Government's pursuance of devolution, this attempt to brush out of the records the reforms of the Labor Government. We have seen this happen in respect to many other matters. We have seen the mutilation of Medibank and the destruction of the Australian Assistance Plan. This insidious campaign is going on and on. I remember the great debates that look place when the legislation to establish the Australian Housing Corporation was introduced. I was the Minister for Housing and Construction who and introduced the Bill in 1975. On that occasion I to be able to pay for the said: Australian Housing Corporation proposed in this Bill us to explore a fresh field of endeavour, that of direct between government and private enterprise, and between government and non-profit organisations, in the of the large number of ordinary Australian families. this legislation I went on: is an anomaly of policy in this countiy that although the Government possesses a substantial reserve of power in the housing field, that power has never been fully together, concentrated and mobilised for the people. Through the Housing Corporation the Labor Government was attempting to do just that. It was the most significant legislation since the behalf Chifley Government negotiated the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in 1945. the Honourable gendemen know that over 280 000 houses have been built as a result of that legislation. But, of course, much more remains to be done. The Housing Commissions have concentrated on caring for poorer famUies, but other my forms of assistance for housing are needed in Australia at the present time. I will not go into the figures because the Deputy Leader of the OpUren), who spoke earUer, has the difficulty faced by people, even comparatively well off, in obtainloan. The Labor Government looked at the constithat was avaUable to it. It was to the effect that nobody would quibble about an AusGovernment asserting its role and rights regard to the housing needs of migrants, serex-servicemen, persons Uving in the is Territories, students, employees of the AusGovernment or contractors to the and their employees. The former in Government saw that responsibility and legislation in respect of those categories of people were spread amongst different departments and different enactments. There was a need to conare trive a corporation which would be the housing authority of the Australian Government so that this area could be run effectively and so that there would be some consistency of phUosophy and benefit. In addition to assisting those categories of people, the Labor Government was able to establish that under the fanuiy aUowances powers of the Constitution, it was competent for an Australian Government to provide a very wide range of assistance to the average home seeker in the Australian community. That view, which I contrived, nurtured and pursued wasfinallyendorsed by the Attorney-General of the day and, under that general umbrella, the Housing Corporation came into being. The purpose of the Corporation was to strengthen Australian-Government machinery to perform those housing functions for which it has constitutional power. The Labor Government wanted to provide the Government with a vehicle capable of flexible and energetic initiatives to rent housing problems to be overcome. The Corporation was primarily to be a lending institution to make housing loans to home seekers within the Australian Government's constitutional responsibilities, including the categories of people I have mentioned. It was to have powers similar to those contained in the Defence Service Homes Act. Indeed, it was to administer the Defence Service Homes Act. Among the initiatives which the Labor Government had in mind and which I certainly had under active consideration by officers of the partment at the time. I ceased to be Minister for Housing and Construction, were initiatives to provide second mortgage loans to cover the deposit gap for young couples; to direct loans to special hardship cases; to provide loans for pri- was? vate enterprise building and to assist in limiting rentals. The Labor Government intended to provide loans to co-operative building societies viding middle income housing. Today, this Government is abdicating its responsibilities in this regard. The Labor Government wanted to do the things I have mentioned. It wanted to cooperate with private enterprise direcdy and openly and without inhibition in the creation of good standard housing for people with moderate incomes. All honourable members will be aware of the to conditions that prevail at the presenttime.The predominance of financial resources available ways of providing for housing from the Australian Government goes to people on a limited income-peopl e have whose income does not exceed 85 per cent of deposit average weekly earnings, and people who qualthe loangap. ify for assistance from the State housing authoriperiod oftime.We ties. Those people whose income does 95 per cent of average weekly earnings can qualrates ify for loans from the terminating buUding societies which are financed by the Australian Government. Today there are people whose income is higher than the levels to which I have referred-peopl e who are on the average weekly earnings and even above the average weekly nings-wh o are unable to attract a building for reasons enunciated in detaU by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). For example, if one had a loan of $22,500 from buUding society repayable over 20 years to years at 11 per cent, the repayment rate is $220 month. In order to pay $220 a month a fanuiy would need to have an income of $220 a week if the objective of not requiring people to pay more than 25 per cent of their income for housing purposes is to apply. Of course, there are many people whose income does not reach that level enable curand they will need assistance. The contention has been made that the Australian Housing Corporation would duplicate the efforts of the States, despite the repeated assurances that I gave on behalf of the Government when I introduced the Australian Housing Corporation legislation that that would not be the case. We readUy acknowledged the important work being done by the States and greatly increased allocations for housing commission purposes from about $160m to $385m a year. We recognised that there was another tier of De- people who needed assistance. The Housing Corporation was going to set about that kind of process. The Labor Government would have supported people",66

Before I introduced legislation dealing with this earmatter in 1975 I went to the United States of loan America and to Canada to study the bodies which were operating in those countries and which were comparable to the Australian Housa ing Corporation. The proposition that is being 25 put by this Government seems to me to be a incredible. It is to the effect that Australia can go it alone as a country without competent Federal authoriues to fulfil the housing needs of the tralian people. In many respects the Corporation that I proposed was similar to the corporation that operates in Ontario and similar to bodies operating in the United States of America. I say to the Minister that he cannot continue on this destructive course. Australia will face grave housing problems unless this Government starts to show initiative and take effective action in relation to the housing problems in Australia. This legislation is disastrous in that it away from the Australian Government and the tried Australian people an instrument which could have been extremely effective in moderating housing activity around Australia, sustaining degree of construction buoyancy and leveUing out the funding of housing by way of assisting those people with the type of support they need to get into the home buying and home renting processes. I deplore what is happening today and I am sorry that we do not have moretimeto with this matter.

112,Mr NEWMAN,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"Bass-Minister for Environbuild ment, Housmg and Community Development) (4.50)-in reply- I want to respond to a few points made by the Opposition. I should like deal firsdy with the remarks of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) whose the speech, as usual, was spattered with his usual exaggerated terms and words. The GovernDeputy ment's position on this legislation has been for a longtime.Just for the record, I wiU recall what that position has been. When the Ausdid traUan Housing Corporation Bill 1975 was inflation debated in this Parliament the attitude adopted by the Liberal and National Country Parties, which were then in Opposition, was that the tralian Housing Corporation was unnecessary and undesirable and that it duplicated services that were avaUable in many other places. we came back into government we found that there was no evidence to the contrary that would have shown that our argument, when that first debate was held, was wrong. The existing cial institutions, the functions of die Federal Government, the functions of the State governless ments and good economic management fulfil all the functions that the Labor Government then designed for this Corporation. I should Uke to make the record totaUy clear. AusWhen we went to the poUs at the 1975 election, we made it perfectly clear that the activities of the Australian Housing Corporation would be critically examined. FoUowing that examination we have found that there were no reasons for not abolishing the Corporation. I turn now to some of the very important points that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) tried to make. I referfirstto the annual report of the Australian Housing Corporation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested that for takes some mysterious reason the Government had to prevent the tabling of the report in this Parliament. The reason is very simple: Under section 46 (3) of the Australian Housmg Corpora ation Act, the Auditor-General is required to report the results ofhis inspection and advise the Minister. The simple facts are that the Auditor General's report for 1974-75 and 1975-76 have not been received by the Minister and that is why the report of the Australian Housing Corporation deal has not been tabled in this place. the The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also had few words to say about the North Rocks estate. I find this rather pecuUar for 2 reasons. First, despite his criticisms of the North Rocks estate, it his Government that proceeded to build, I believe, 300 houses in that area. If the government of the day was not satisfied with that program, why in heaven's name did it proceed to so many houses over such a long period? Secondly, the more interesting point that was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to concerned the value of those houses. To examine the record of North Rocks estate is to examine record of the Labor Government in office. Ifi can use a word that has been used by both the Leader of the Opposition and the clear honourable member for Hughes, the Labor Government's record was 'disastrous' for what it to the cost of buUding a house-the terrible that it inflicted on this country. For example, at the outset the cost of buUding a house on a block of land in the North Rocks esAustate was $25,000 to $30,000. It now costs between $35,000 and $50,000 to build a house in the North Rocks estate. That is what I mean by When the sorry record of the Labor Government. Again to make sure that the record is absolutely clear in Hansard, I point out that in August finan1975 the Labor Government provided only $ 122.5m in its Budget, and that was substantially than the amount required to meet the anticipated demand under the defence service homes scheme. That is when die present waiting period of 11 months began. I was staggered to near the Deputy Leader of the Opposidon talking about waiting dmes and Budget allocations. I say once again that it was the last Government which produced the waitingtimeof 11 months for fence service homes. We at least have managed to provide appropriations which will not extend that period. We would like to have reduced waiting period, but when we came to office the financial situation we faced as a result of the mismanagement of the last Government prevented us from doing so. The honourable member for Hughes and the Opposition Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried us of vacating the field of housing, ing responsibilities and of not taking any new iniintroduce that very scheme. In fact it does tiatives. Our record shows that ment is totally wrong. In fact we have adopted several initiatives. The debate last Friday on the Homes Saving Grant Bill and this debate today have been totally negative debates in the sense that the Opposition has not produced one positive measure that it would adopt to correct the terrible situation that potential home owners forthwith. now face in this country. It is beyond me that members of the Opposition should criticise us. I might add: If this matter is so important to the Labor Party, where are all its speakers? honourable member for Hughes and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were the only people who spoke. I want to Ust once again what this Government is doing about home ownership.",68

I want to list what we are doing about home ownership. First of all, by decent and proper economic management we will provide the best chance that a potential home owner will ever have to own a house in this country. In the term that involves reducing interest rates sustaining them at proper low levels. Secondly, we introduced the homes savings grant-this will begin from 1 January-and it probably will mean that 50 000 or 60 000 home owners a year will benefit. We are examining the functions of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation so that arrangements may be made for improving the deinsurance cover for home buyers. We have introduced the home allowance voucher experiment, which I hope will benefit between 4000 that and 5000 people seeking decent accommodation under rental arrangements. By negotiation with the States, I hope, we are improving the present allowances we make to the States under the housing arrangements of 1973-74.

Before the debate on Bill is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the ministerial statement relating to the tariff structure review.

117,Mr SCHOLES,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"We are dislong cussing 2 BUls, which are largely machinery and measures to deal with events that took place sometimeago, and a statement aimed at undoing most of what was done as a conscious act by the Government in relation to tariffs throughout the year. The major matter before the House, quite obviously, is the statement made last night by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), and the ramifications of that statement and the events which led up to Some things in the statement deserve more excerned planation, and I trunk the House ought to conwhich sider other areas. The decisions to devalue and to revalue ously have consequences for manufacturing industry, which is the substantial recipient of porary tariff protection under the Commission. Those decisions obviously conmean that there fused the situation and they could have very serious long term effects on the Australian omy. Unfortunately the statement by the Minisas ter does not clear up all that many of the effects on manufacturing industry. Certainly, in short term, superficially at least, benefit by an addition to the protection. I stand that in technical terms the Government's decision will bring the levels of protection to approximately those which existed in about 1970. That may be true of some industries but not of others. One of the things I would Uke to hear the Minturers ister explain is the change in the tariff for the passenger motor vehicle industry. As I underof stand the statement, the additional 10 per cent protection, which was introduced as a result of Temporary Assistance Authority report some time ago and confirmed as a permanent featureforthwith. by the Government, is now being removed, but in fact the Government is retaining the quota levels of 80 per cent or will operate imports exceed 80 per cent. The statement of the Minister appears contradictory, but I think that what I have said is most Ukely the effect of decision. I draw attention to the fact that there a considerable number of cars in bond in Australia. Those cars will be at a considerable trading disadvantage when they are released, because of the change in the tariff arrangements. The tariff on them will'not have been paid. I of wonder whether that fact has been taken into consideration. In the short term at least there be some advantage to certain importers who already brought their full quotas of vehicles into the country-the number of these vehicles may not be as high as it was-in order to beat the emissionthe controls. When those controls were to be introduced there was a substantial influx of veturing hicles and these were held in bond for sale afterstudied the date of the introduction of emission controls. moment. Another area where obviously the Government is not taking any action but in fact is ing certain things is that covering the British preferential tariff. The British devaluation fact altered the relative position. As I understand it, the removal of the British protective tariff merely restores that country's position to what it it. was prior to Australian devaluation. I am conwith that part of the Minister's statement indicates that certain industries, namely, footwear, clothing, textiles, domestic obviappUcances,filesand rasps,finepapers, plywood and orange juice will retain the additional temassistance which they were given preIndustries Assistance this wUlIbe. viously. am not sure of what the actual effects of However, in all probabUity it will will be an equivalent increase in E econrices to the consumer. In fact the Government decided effectively to increase tariffs in that area beyond the level that the Temporary Assist the ance Authority had in fact recommended and industry will which was adopted. underOne area that I would draw to the attention of the Minister encompasses the wool textile indusback try and carpet manufacturing industry which have both been disadvantaged in a manner that, as I understand it, has not occurred in other areas of the textile industry. The wool textile manufacdid not gain the benefit of the tariff protection to the same extent as did other areas because the change in the domestic price of wool which was immediately increased by 17Vi per cent by a direction of the Minister. As a result the cost of this industry's major raw material increased The industry thus lost a substantial proportion of the benefit of the temporary assistance it received plus the benefits created by the the quotas if changed currency situation. The wool carpet industry is simUarly affected in that it imports most of its raw material from that overseas. A small quantity of carpet wool is is grown in Australia but most of this material is imported. The cost of the industry's basic raw material has been increased by the devaluation decision. The industry has received no assistance comparable with that received by other sections the textile industry or by its competitors which are making carpets from synthetics. Therefore, will as the Minister would reaUse, the industry is in considerable trouble. It is now placed in an adverse trading position compared with its Australian competitors which have not suffered same price rise in respect of raw materials. The whole question of protection for manufacindustry is one which I believe needs to be in far greater depth than is the case at the The measures before the House seek to valiremov-date a series of Industries Assistance Commission reports that have been adopted by the has in Government and a statement which almost invalidates all of those reports because the Government has determined to take action unilaterally which alters totally the considerary ations on which those reports and the legislationI we are validating were established. I am concerned about employment in Ausis traUan industry. I do not think that I have ever made any secret of the fact that I believe in levelsurgent of protection which are adequate to ensure that employment can be maintained and that Austhatfindsitself tralian industry has a fair chance of operating, given that the conditions under which are quite different from those existing for many of our trading competitors. I would challenge one statement made by the Minister; that is, thatdebate. those industries which are aggrieved can seek as-reports sistance from the Temporary Assistance Authfrom ority. That is not a fact. Industries are able seek assistance from the Temporaiy Assistance Authority only if their application to do so is agreed to by the Department of Industry and Commerce. That can be an extremely protracted and difficult proposition. The record of the in this area is not good. I think that out of 13 appUcations that went before the IAC for temporsiderable ary assistance last year 13 were rejected and number of the industries concerned disappeared an totally from the Australian scene. A number of appUcations have been made this year. In at least on case of which I am aware Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) indicated that an apphcation should be made because theplanning Government had decided to adopt the IAC's report on commercial vehicles. This major Auslong period. traUan manufacturer was told that it could make apphcation to the Temporary Assistance Authority for additional protection if it thought that such action was necessary. The apphcation was made in March. The apphcation had not been completely processed by the department consave cerned as late as August. It was never agreed the decision on the apphcation would be foralter warded to the manufacturer concerned. In fact the decisionfinaUycame out when a new IAC report on the industry was called for. I would suggest that temporary assistance, which by its very nature means urgent assistance,tion is not readUy obtainable if an organisation wait for something Uke 8 months for a decision to be made on whether a reference to the Authorityof will be made in thefirstplace. We also have to take into consideration the time factor required for the Authority to produce a report. It is reasonable that the Government should have some control over references. The legislation provides-and this requirement was insisted on by the present Government-that the Government cannot alter a recommendation on temporassistance as opposed to a general report. But would suggest to the Minister that an mdustry which is in trouble and which has to wait for 8 months tofindout whether it will get a reference hardly in a position to say that it is being dealt with fairly. Nor can we say that in such a case assistance is obtainable. The Minister's statement appears to indicate that any industry in trouble can in fact make an apphcation. I would suggest that the position is it operatessomething less than that. I want to make only one other comment in this I refer to the general pattern of IAC and the general pattern of action arising those reports. At the moment it appears to that the Government's poticy and the general conclusions of the IAC are at some variance. References to the IAC, interim reports and final reports of the IAC, which are no longer always published before decisions are made, and IAC Government decisions are almost always at convariance with each other. This situation must create serious problems in decision making a within industry. An industry mayfirstof aU see interim report which indicates, as it sees it, all sorts of disruption. Thefinalreport may lead that industry to draw somewhat simUar conclusions. This is the norm. But then the Government's dethe cision may be quite different from the IAC recommendation. Such a situation must create problems within industry. The decision making process is usuaUy spread over a fairly The textile industry has been dealt with fairly kindly in the Minister's statement. However, action taken by the Government may or may not the industry because I do not think that a that17Vi per cent change in the currency rate will the competitive position of the industry in respect of imported goods. In fact I think that devaluation will make Uttle difference to the margins on which importers operate, particularly in the case of the majority of cheaper textiles which are being sold over the counter. DevaluawiU make a difference to the price that the has topubUc pays, but the margin between the Australian price and the price of imports in a number areas is far greater than 20 per cent. In fact I think that a 100 per cent increase in the cunency would be needed to make the industry competitive. Although such a situation would be completely unacceptable to the pubUc, it is a consideration that obviously the Government and everyone else has to take into consideration. As I have pointed out, industry is faced with uncertainty over very long periods. The Government will have to keep this fact in mind if it is to encourage industry to implement more efficient processes. We hear almost repeatedly in this House and outside blame being placed on employees for the difficulties in which industries find themselves. We are told that employees have gained a the greater level of wages than some people think they are entitled to. I think we should also look at made. the fact that a considerable amount of Australian industry is geared to make a living for the manSpeaker, agement or the shareholders, without any real attempt to create a viable industry with long term prospects. Quite a lot of our industries inefficiently structured. Much of the middle manand agement is at least as blameworthy as the ployees, if the employees are at all blameworthy. I suggest that no long term planning in any industry can take place while the degree of unwas certainty that exists is repeated each year. No government is blameworthy in this area because no one can make up his mind, really, where he wants to go. In the early part of this century governments were made and broken on protecally tion issues. At the moment it is a little different but not much different. Certainly industry does not benefit by the pursuing a pohcy which is diametrically opposed to that of the Government. The Government might have to lay down its policy requirements so they can be taken into consideration when inquiries are taking place. At least would be based on a situation in which the recommendations have some chance of acceptance by the Government. It seems unreal to that we should have this situation with an faces. organisation with the expertise and competence of the IAC. I do not deny the expertise and comgrasp. petence of members of the IAC. I disagree with most of their basic philosophies. There is no question of their competence and expertise in the field. If it is going through a substantial exercise of inquiring into an industry on a basis which known in advance the Government will not has accept, this seems to me to be a complete waste of resources. It seems to me that somewhere along the line, if the Government's policy is different from the general philosophy being purget sued by the IAC, there should be some way of bringing the two together. Useful reports, reports which are likely to be adopted, are far better attitude. than reports which are disruptive to the industry and which cause all sorts of disruptions and paigns to be mounted. In the final result, the Government overrides them anyhow. This is becoming a pretty regular pattern. I suggest to the Minister that some coming together of the Government and the IAC on their aims would greatly benefit all Australian industry. I think the statement by the Minister does Uttle to clarify the situation relating to the future tariff poUcies or the effects of devaluation but, in view of the confusion that reigns supreme not only in industry in country at large but also in the Government, I think it is the best the Minister could have",69
118,Mr KELLY,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF," Mr Deputy as you know, it is not unusual for me to be heard talking in this House about tariffs. Originally when I started out in this House on this are rather lonely campaign to get a more sensible responsible attitude towards tariffs, I tackled emit from the point of view of the damage that unwise tariff protection was doing to my rural constituents. As my thinking developed and as I led along the road by other people, I reaUsed that even more important than that was the question of resource allocation so that we could use our limited resources in the best possible way, so that the standard of living of the people genercould be raised. I will not talk about either of those 2 matters today, because today I am interested only in the impact on inflation of the Government's decision to devalue. The cost of IAC living is the long winded way of saying it. I do not pretend to be one of these high fliers or high steppers. I am a modest man by nature, with a limited kind of intellect. I do not pretend to be the able to take apart an economic problem in the the inquiry same way as some people can. I believe- I have been told-that inflation is me the number one problem which the country It was not hard to understand this. It is the kind of thing that a man of my intellect can We had the example set by the Australian Labor Party when Dr Jim Cairns was grinding out the money down in the bowels of the Parliament, and the rate of inflation was rising and the level of unemployment wasrisingalso. It was it is clear-anybod y could see-that a country which a high rate of inflation will not attract investment. A country which has an inflation rate akin to that of a banana republic will not attract investment. Everybody said to me that we had to the rate of inflation down. I could see those kinds of problems clearly. There was something that was kind of pathetic, I suppose, in that I have been a member for a longtime.I have camseen these brilliant young people going past me in a steady stream. I often wondered why. Then I realised what I must learn to do. I had to polish up my footwork and forget the things which had been told were important ifi were to get in this politicalfield.Until now, because I do not have this wide ranging and eloquent way of looking at life, I stuck with the problem that is clearly before us. Inflauon is the number one problem. That is what they told us, and that is what I believe. I think if one looks at what is pening around the world it is not hard to realise it, to echo it and to mean it sincerely. We must something worthwhile about inflation. Then the decision to devalue was made. From where I sit, I am not in a position to criticise decision. One needs to be in the Cabinet to know whether it ought to have been made and, if it were made, how large the percentage ought to have been. I waited around because I knew the Government was dedicated to the task of defeatinflation. ing inflation. I knew that shortly there would some strong, competent, anti-inflationary action taken. I knew there were only a Umited numberin of things which it could do. I knew that one of Umited options was to have an appreciation-t get rid of the problem by going back to where were previously. This has started to happen. think it is very sensible. I am not trying to be funny. Of course the exchange rate must rise. It one of the things. Revaluation is one of the things that can save us from inflation-one of the Umbe ited options to get us away from this dreadful problem of inflation which everybody is saying so serious. Another option is to work out some way-this is where I am well outside my sphere of tected goods. knowledge-in which, when the money comes flooding back in, it is grabbed and put in ticular yard. That is the kind of word which Iincreased would use. People with the competence of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) would have afiner,flowingphrase for it. Either that or interest rates will be put that the money is kept in the Government's hands and is saved from sloshing around on the cowshedfloorand upsetting inflation again. I sorry if my more rural Ulustrations offend Minister, but that is the way I think. These options. The third is to freeze wages and prices. I heard of that suggestion previously. It is the kind of thing that everybody talks very wisely about. It was tried in the United Kingdom. We know did not work, except for a short whUe. It would not be easy in Australia because we have constideals tutional problems of division of responsibUity between the States and the Commonwealth. wages front. However, that is one option. We must do someI thing. My beUef is that if the Government reaUy on means what it says it will do something about inflation. That is the third of the Umited options. The fourth option is to take some action on the tariff front. There are 4 options. There may be others. Maybe brighter people here will think up hap-another one or two. They are the four which I have on my Ust. We know that if we do not use doone we must use one of the other three. We must do so more courageously because they are Umited options. If we are earnest, as I assume we are, in our determination to beat inflation, one of that those 4 measures has to be used. I repeat them: Revalue and grab the money, raise interest rates, freeze wages and prices, or take tariff action. Things can be done with tariffs that will affect We know that the price of imported be goods is going to increase by about 20 per cent. About 60 per cent of these imported goods come duty free and the prices of these goods will rise the by about 20 per cent. Indirectly most of these o goods go into manufacturing goods. So obviweously the people who use those manufactured I goods will have to put up their prices. We know also that a devaluation of llVi per cent increases is the level of the barriers to imported goods by between 70 per cent and 75 per cent-on e cannot specific. In many cases the extra height of the tariff wall wiU stop theflowof goods coming into is Australia; and the price of the Australian goods might not necessanly rise to the duty paid price, although in many cases it is Ukely to do so. So there will be an increase in the price of tariff proa parEven more importantly, behind this greatly tariff waU is the opportunity for sweetheart agreements between people who now have a great deal more fat to use-wh o have a great deal more room to manoeuvre than they had beup so fore. Sweetheart agreements can then be made with the workforce. This was a chronic problem prior to the review of tariffs. That is why the am metal trades were always Ukely to be leading in the any wage demands. We know what happened are 2 with General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd who demanded and indeed received from the Government an increased protection which enabled have them to negotiate a sweetheart deal with their people. One can always pick a person who is dining out on an expense account by the enthusiasm it with which he summons the waiter. The fact is that in this area people can make sweetheart because someone else pays for them. The impact of this is Ukely to be devastating on the The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said in his second reading speech that Government hopes to stop such agreements by telling companies that if they do that kind of thing they will not receive tariff protection. a youthful person, the Minister would not remember wartime when we used to have ration-figures ing and the Uke. We were trying to stop the supply and demand pressures from working natdone urally. In those days we had theflameof patriotare ism to reinforce the edicts of the law, but measures did not work at all well. Honourable members might remember the story of 2 doctors in a hotel lounge talking aboutper their practices. One said to the other: 'I have cases of meningitis in this district'. The chap sitting behind him patted him on the shoulder whispered: 'Look, IU take the lot'. With the best will m the world, nobody can pretend that any arm of government can control the pressures of supply and demand for long. Perhaps it can be done with the big compames, but we all know ways to beat the system. I am looking at the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) who is smiling knowingly. In his time has used most of those ways to beat the system. Of course, he would not talk about them now, but from his past he would be well aware of whatto is done and will be done again to beat the government system. I knew that tariffs were important and that something could be done in that direction. Of course, I knew that the Governof ment had the stern example of the United not Kingdom before it, knowing that if something not done following devaluation the country will happen. go down the economic drain. Maybe it will go down with its eyes shut and its mouth open but,ment. whatever happens, a government must be tough after devaluation. With the example of Britain clearly and sadly before it our Government mustGovernment have been determined to do something. I sat back waiting. I thought: Now the Government means to do something about inflation. On 3 December I asked the Minister whether the Government was still keen to do something Government about inflation. With typical eloquence he spelt out the position yet again. So I waited conbarriers fidently for the statement that I knew wouldwould shortly come. I was not confident about across-the-board bulldozer. tariff cuts, because I must admit that I think that into the Government has almost believed its own elothe quence about the damage caused by a 25 per in cent tariff cut. Ifindthat I often have to defend very statesmanlike the Whidam Government's decision on this because the nervous NelUes of the Labor Partythink honourables members have heard of them before-ar e not willing to take up the chaUenge. the But I shall do so because the nonsense that we have talked on this side of the House about a 25 Eer cent tariff cut is now doing us a great deal of Being arm. I hope the Minister will Usten to what I have to say. I hope that if he can chaUenge my he will do so. If he does not do so, I hope he will stop talking as he does about the damage by the 25 per cent tariff cut. All of us who in the game and who have studied the matter those know that the 25 per cent tariff cut was the equivalent of about a 4 per cent alteration in the exchange rate. When the Labor Party was in government it altered the exchange rate by 20 cent, which influenced industry about three 6 times as much as did the 25 per cent tariff cut. and We know that the main reason why secondary industry is in trouble Ues in wage increases. We could take the knitting industry as an example. The 25 per cent tariff cut damaged that industry to about the same extent as an increase of about of 13 per cent to 16 per cent in wages, depending upon whether they were male or female wages. Actually, wage rises during that period he amounted to 60 per cent. So to blame the problems of the industry onto the tariff cut is demonstrably wrong. I am sorry to have to come again the aid of the nervous NelUes on the other side of the House, but I am sorry that we have made goats of ourselves by talking with great eloquence about the 25 per cent tariff cut when most us knew we were wrong in doing so. So I did really hope for across-the-board tariff cuts is but I felt that something significant would Then last night the Minister made his stateTo say that it backs away from the problem would be putting it at its mildest. There are so many things in it that are nonsense. The is going to reduce the tariff barriers on black and white television. Honourable members can imagine what an impact that is going to have. I think it missed out on wagon wheels. If we go through the tariff quotas wefindthat is making great fellows of itself. But do honourable members realise that the tariff on cars are now about 100 per cent? We have to crawl up the tariff wall in a fourwheel drive car or push our way through with a That is the only way we will get cars Australia over this tariff wall of immense magnitude. The Minister says: 'We will take off quota restrictions. But if any more cars come we will put the restrictions on again'. That is a position to adopt! II will not gorightthrough the matter again. There is no doubt that the Government has not used the tariff as an effective weapon against inflation. The Government has not made any worthwhile difference to the who has studied the quesuon will know that there are no effective anti-inflationary pressures from this area contained in the speech of the Minister. So more has to be done in other fields, assume. I go over these fields again: Interest rates, money control, wages and prices or revaluation. It may be that the honourable ber for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) will give one or two other options. But they are the other options I have, if the Government is going to anything about inflation.",72

121,Mr YOUNG,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"After listening to the honourable member for ber Wakefield (Mr Kelly) what can one say? All this say year I have taken the opportunity in my role as could shadow Minister in this area to speak in debates honourable before the honourable member. Today I took the view like that liberty to speak after him. I think that is probably the views which one of the best speeches the honourable member turers and the workers has made all year. On some occasions when he has spoken I have had to leave the chamber to attend committees or to do something else. I have enjoyed listening to him today. If the honourable member thinks that the talk about tariff cuts stirs up the nervous NelUes amongst supporters of the Government, as he described them, I suggest that he should ask them how they feel about increasing interest rates. He will find that it is usually the same group of people. If it is true that there were nervous NeUies among the supporters of the previous Government, only the faces have changed. The same number are stiU on the other side. We will have to put up with the situation. Anybody same problems. I do not want to see out my years in the Parliament battering away at the walls as the honourable member for Wakefield has done. Obviously, I he puts forward lots of views to which some of us in the Parliament-from both sides-listen , although I am not too sure about honourable memmembers from the Government side who will us speak after him. I think they may have views different from those of the honourable member do for Wakefield. The Government, of course, has avoided the problem. Over and over again it raises the issue of devaluation. There can be no of the effects not so much of the ones in the comConsumer Affairsthe statement which Minister for Business and (Mr Howard) made last night I have spelt but of the Government's earlier on tariffs. predictions about the effect of devaluation on inflation still said The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has continually that he cannot quantify them. All of us could If the Minister can say without of contradiction that the effect of on inflation wdl be substantial. canAlthough the fact is that tariffs may have been more removed from a small portion of our imports, I overwhelmingly the cost input is stUl there and the consumers in Australia will have to meet it. The missing link from the contribution of the to honourable member for Wakefield to these debates of course is the structural adjustment element which is required with tariff reform. In the safe seat of Wakefield with every little industry, a sometimes one can take liberties which are a litde foreign to the problems than can be taken by the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) who sits beside the honourable memfor Wakefield. I am sure that the honourable member for Kingston would not be at liberty to some of those things about industry and what and could not be done in Australia. The member wouldfindthat to express a would bring bim into conflict with may be held by the manufacat Chrysler Australia Ltd. I think that we have probably had as many discussions on tariffs this year in the Parliament as we have had in most years. I cannot go back too many years but 1976 seems to have been a good year in that people have been given the opportunity to discuss these questions. I would think that the honourable member for Wakefield and others would have had their fill in relation to tariffs for the year 1976. But be that as it may, it is impossible to talk about the need for reform if we do not talk about structural adjustment. If we talk about stuctural adjustment we are talking about industry as a whole and about the absenceisters of the White Paper. As I said last night, until can discuss all these matters there will be a fear among the working people of this country that tariff reform merely means that they will lose their jobs. If that is the fear which is held working people in this country, tariff reform never come about because governments will never have the courage to introduce reforms. seems to me to be such a simple exercise for us attitude Austraha to come up with the design to look after those people who lose their jobs and perhaps manufacturers who may have to be shifted or, some cases, closed down. I think it is important always when discussing what may be the prob-He lems of high tariff in Australia also to discuss thewife welfare and the well-being of the people who arewith with involved and affected by decisions which are from $120 to $140 taken by governments Far too often these things are ignored. reiterate what the honourable member for Wakefild said about the 25 per cent tariff cut. honourable members in the House who take Australia some interest in the matter I suggest that they should forget forever trying to say that the 25 cent tariff cut completely dismantled Austrahan industry. At the same time as the 25 per cent tariff cut took place there was such a thing structural adjustment. People could apply for their full wage for 6 months if the employer ned a document stating that the employee had lost his job as the result of the tariffcuts. Very people were paid their full wage. There were very few people for whom the employer was pre-accept pared to sign the document saying that they lost their employment as a result of the 25 per cent tariff cut. It did not put 100 000 people of work. It did not put 10 000 people out of It put perhaps a few hundred people It is nonsense to go on saying that the 25 per cent tariff cut had that sort of impact. All honourable members have to do is read the annual report the Industries Assistance Commission, and argue with that.",75
122,Mr HOWARD,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,You will be sorry that you put that into Hansard.,76
123,Mr YOUNG,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"It is true and it has been said from this side of the House on a number of occasions. It is so much hogwash for the Govern-would ment continually to use the 25 per cent tariff as the basis for saying that the Opposition not think about the welfare of industry or the people who work in it. What the Government ispUed saying is so much nonsense. In the past fortnightwage we have become accustomed to listening to Mintelling us that there are 4 arms of the econweomy with which they are dealing. They say.'This greatis one arm. That is another arm.' andfinallythe Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relabytions (Mr Street) get on to the wages arm. As the will honourable member for Wakefield has pointed out, what can the Government do in thefieldof It wages? Obviously it is in a quandary as to the in it should adopt at national wage case hearings. It takes the view that one of the ways to theovercome the problems is to see that wage inincreases are kept to an absolute minimum. Let me cite thefiguresof Professor Henderson. says that the poverty line for a man and his 4 2 children going to a man and his wife children with the wife not working can go a week, averaged throughout Australia. There will be some sUght variation depending on the location, but that is a very high I amount. Professor Henderson says that that is the poverty Une. How on earth can the GovernForment convince the wage and salary earners of that the way out of this economic malaise is for the working people to accept all the perburden? Devaluation was extremely generous to some of the vast mining compames in this country. People read in the newspapers about the as advantages thatflowto those compames as a result of devaluation and they wonder why the sig-Government can say to them: 'You are not going to get $3 or $4 a week increase at the national fewwage case hearing because we believe that if we can convince the Commission that you should less the country will be better off'. At the hadsametimethey are reading that devaluation can take the profit of the Utah Development Co. for outthis year, if it is converted, from $132m to work.$179m. It seems to me that the argument is out of work.balanced all one way. Obviously, as Bob Hawke has pointed out on a ofnumber of occasions on behalf of the trade unions, if indexation is destroyed at the Arbitration Commission we will go back to the old system under which the strongest unions can get the increases they desire and die unorganised workers-the other 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the work force which is not organised mto associations or trade unions-wU l miss out. Perhaps that is the Government's purpose. Perhaps it prefer some of the strong unions to be cutable to bargain their way out of the problems doeswhile a substantial number of wage and salary earners stay as they are. It is the system that apfor a long period of history before national case hearings in Australia. People talk about the problems which industry faced in and 1975. Let me remind them of what was conseas sidered to be a substantial wage lift in 1974. substantial wage lift at thattimewas the $24 rise.with EarUer in the year the metal workers received $15 and later in the year they received $9. In tween those 2 hearings the transport workers received $24. All the blame is apportioned to the trade unions for receiving those increases in salaries. Most of those decisions were given by wage provisions fixing tribunals. In other cases, because industo attract and tries were doing so well out of what they conalternatives under which sidered to be the economic boom, there was very overseas and under which they Utde dispute about what was then considered to here. I refer particularly to the Prices be a quite massive wage increaseflowingright Tribunal, the Trade Practices Commission through industry. So industrial relations, in terms of bargaining, almost disappeared. But why the some Government blames the trade unions more than ment caninput it is prepared to blame industry astounds me. operate Industry gave the increase because it considered or that it could afford it. The wagefixingtribunals only do gave it. It was not just a case going out on long strikes or industrial achieve it. It was given as soon as it was asked we expected to say that800 for. The blame, if there is any blame, for the see that they cannot get jobs? Itdowe jump in wages that occurred in 1974 belongs to tries the community. It belongs to both sides of indusIndustries trial relations. As we know, wage earners receiving wage increases of that America go Industries size at atimeof inflation, which bring about Canada.

So 1974 was a particularly important year about being able as far as industrial relations were it was not the fault of the unions that those wage everybody says and asThings increases were handed out. I want to refer to a couple of other matters relation to our industries. I have spoken very briefly about structural adjustment. I think that that is one of the important matters that have be looked at by the Government. It certainly being looked at by an Opposition committee, see what we can do and how we can encourage problems. the adjustment that must take place in this country in view of what may occur, particularly in relation to our educational standards and our population, between now and the year 2000. There is nothing magical about the year 2000; it just happens to be a convenient time scale which to work, in view of the long term policies that are required for industry in this country. relates Continually we hear talk of compames in this country going off-shore and the suggestion that all the problems of the companies that go offtries shore are the problems of high wages. It is quite as simple as saying that wages are the only things that are driving compames 1974 Many companies in Australia have gone overwUlingly. There is no way that we can disThe cuss rationaUy Australian industry competing the industries to the north of this country. To speak of it as if we could wave a magic wand beand get the textile industries, the shoe industries and perhaps some of the component parts of the car industry back into Australia is to talk nonsense.

Nevertheless, 1977 may be a better year for us.  think the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) summed up his speech in one of the words that he used-hogwash . For the shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to say that only a few hundred people lost their as a result of the decision made in December 1973 by the then Labor Government is absolute clap-trap. Thousands of people have been put out of jobs in this country by a decision which was made by the Labor Government. That is not the type of concern that this Government The decisions made last night and announced this House by the Minister for Business and sumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and in the Senate the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton) are very important to the future of this country. The positive aspects of this decision are already being seen. After a few telephone conthis versations it has come to my attention that one manufacturer in a country town in Victoria will be increasing his employment from 50 people to 100 people. This will be followed on by the relation action of another manufacturer just outside bane who between now and 1 February will increase by forty the number of people he is curthe rently employing. Another manufacturer in Meltraders bourne City itself till last night was not intending to employ 29 school leavers. Following the cision that was announced last night he is going to employ a further 31 school leavers. This deation. cision is part of a series of decisions which this Government is taking to fix up the economic mess which we inherited on 13 December 1975.I am sick andtiredof the crocodUe tears which are shed in this Parliament by the Labor Party. shows a complete lack of understanding, regard and concern for this nation and the people who have been employed here for so many wonderful years. I would like to quote from the editorial the Australian Financial Review of Tuesday 7 December. In the debate this afternoon are put outmoded and outdated poUcies have been announced. Some of these go back 18 years. The change in the best editorial reads: As the Governor of the Reserve Bank recently pointed out, '25 years ago, about 15 per cent of our labour forceplus self-employed-worke d in the rural sector. The proportion is now less than half of that . . . In 1949-50, 87 per cent of our exports were rural products; in 1975-76, the break-up was 44 per cent 38 per cent mineral, and 18 per cent manufactures.' good This shows a dramatic change. I am pleased to year be part of the Government which is concerned on about the unemployed people of Australia and about the industries which we believe have built up quite successfully over a number of years. One reasons that we have had the difficult position in relation to unemployment over the last few years is the decision taken by the previous Administration. One of the advantages of being in the Liberal Party is that it does not have a jobs Caucus. I believe that the type of across the board decision which is made by the Labor Party does not show any degree of concern for the unemployed people in this country. The decision announced last night by the Minister shows a concern which has never been shown by the preshows. vious Government. The Labor Party's in involement in 1973 was the darkest day in ConAustraUa's manufacturing history. It showed by that had litde understanding, Uttle knowledge and litde managerial responsibiUty.",76
124,Unknown,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.  evening after having enjoyed a very pleasant dinner with the seventy-fivers and I would like to assure the House that we did not have any cake this evening. Some assertions have been made into the so-called free trade in tariff areas. BrisCertain aspects of the assertions which have been made on numerous occasions do not show truth of the matter. In actual fact the free are not thinking in the long term context. The Government decision, announced by the deMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) last night looks at the long term situIn the last few years we have seen a country, Japan, which, for a number of years has been considered an area of cheap labour, imposing for the firsttimein the latter part of 1975 quotas and tariffs on imported goods, particularly clothing. It The second area of concern if we did not have protected industries in this country, is how we would obtain the goods that are supposed to be imported. It would be extremely difficult to get of them through the demarcation disputes which have been occurring on the major wharf areas in some Australia for some years. Only this year, for a period of 6 weeks, container that arrived in this country was held on the wharves. That meant that those people throughout the community who had business commitments were placed in a difficult situadon of having orders to fill but not having the goods. The importance of the protected industries in country has been that throughout the 1950s and 1960s and into the 1970s Austraha has been to supply to the Australian market goods which were manufactured by Australians, which were sold to Australians and which, for a number of years, until the changes to the export incentive schemes in 1973 and 1974, were exported theories throughout the world. Australian industry has created for itself a reputation for high efficiency. This has come about, particularly in the traUan market place, as a result of the very deep and important consideration of efficiency high standards. The legacy of the previous Administration in one area, that is, the garment textUe industry, was that in March of 1974 approximately 147 000 people were employed in that industry but as a result of decisions the Labor Government the number of people employed in the industry were reduced to 116 000.",78
125,Mr GRAHAM,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"It was the tariff cut.  that was responsible for that drastic increase the number of unemployed people. AUied with this was the fact that an unfair section of the trade union movement pushed wage demands beyond aU comprehension. The situation has also now been reached in Australia hi which the averthose age weekly wage paid is $47 a week more than the average weekly wage which is paid in the United States of America. At this stage we do have the same level of productivity, which is necessary and which must come and will come this country under the good management of this Government. It has been said on numerous occasions that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is something that should be taken into consideration more and more. The GATT agreetoday, ment has been conveniently forgotten by the can United States, Sweden, France, England and West Germany on numerous occasions when a nationals of those countries were in danger of losing their jobs. Only recently, beef quotas been imposed in the United States and Japan contrary to GATT. In the aftermath of the Second World War and under the wise leadership of 2 great men, Robert Menzies and Sir John MCEwen, this tinuing nation has been buUt up with the introduction a system of import replacement. That import every replacement poUcy meant very simply that we up manufactured goods in Australia and provided people who were employed in those industries with a reasonable standard of Uving, a reasonable wage and a degree of protection from nations in our immediate region and also around this the world. That was the legacy that was passed on to the previous Administration in 1972. There able was little or no unemployment and a very low inflation rate. After careful consideration, our tariff poUcies had made sure that industries within Australia were protected and were able to employ our fellow Australians. The academic to which I referred previously destroyed the jobs of numbers of people. They destroyed a number of industries and as a result of the cut in Aus1973, they created a situation in which some industries have been lost for a number of years. and These industries have unfortunately moved offshore. However, the advantage of having industries offshore manufacturing in cheaper labour areas is only a short term advantage. taken by The union movement in Australia is a very important part of our social and economic structure, and the conditions and wages which apply for our fellow Australians, determined as a result of negotiations between the unions and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, have created a climate in which, quite frankly, in Australia is the envy of the world. The Liberal and National Country Parties upon coming to office on 14 December 1975, reinstated a partnership not only with the union movement but with labour intensive industries. In the main, industries are protected. Australia cannot compete with other areas throughout the world; nor should it. Our standard of living is unique to not Australia and we do not need to lower our standard of living to prove a point. The Prime Minisin ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Minister who announced the decision last night and the Minister in the other place have made a decision on this matter which is of vital importance to Australia's future and to its confidence. Industry under the new arrangements for tariffs, go forward with a great deal of confidence. It can invest and produce with full expectations of strong future. It must now follow the Government's lead and positively attack home markets. have I am delighted with the response I have had from numerous people concerning this matter. I believe that Ministers concerned and the Cabinet as a whole have received responses welcoming Sir the decision which was made in relation to contemporary assistance in the most imporof tant secondary manufacturing areas. It is with deUght that I announce to the House the receipt of a telegram from the Womens Clothing Section of the Austrahan Confederation of Apparel Manufacturers which arrived in my office during the dinner recess. It says: On behalf of the womens apparel industries I congratulate you on the intelligent you have taken regarding devaluation that as the weeks go by most Australians will see the wisdom of your decision that will from the Whitlam days of disaster and darkness. After I received that telegram I checked it out further. Those people have told me this evening that they will be going one step further. Their program in the New Year will be to employ 280 extra people in their 3 plants which are situated outside city areas in Victoria. At the present time about 13 per cent of the garment textile industry is situated outside the major city areas. This has been one of the means of keeping together a number of important country towns which rely on the industries which are located there. They rely on payments made to the people within the towns. I look forward with confidence to the fact that those people will continue to be employed. Tariffs have become an emodve issue on numerous occasions. I am deeply concerned that in certain quarters the understanding and the realisation of what the Government does with tariffs is being misconstrued and misunderstood. Tariffs must be, and have been for some hundreds of years, a means of protecting certain industries in certain countries. It has been the wise use of tariffs which has assured the future of before the industries within those countries which need that degree of protection. I should Uke to refer the situation in the foreseeable future in counto tries such as Japan and Hong Kong. Only retective cently in Hong Kong there was a 300 per cent was equal wage increase. Admittedly, the wages paid Hong Kong are much lower than the wages we pay in Australia. At the same time, that is a stantial increase in wages. That increase in wages already has put up the prices on most imported goods. Let us put Australia's position into perspective: We are not a big importer in the world market scene. We represent about 1 per cent of the total export market from Hong Kong overall in the garment and textile area and a lot of areas which are not normally referred The future of our country must Ue with tariffs. It must lie with protecting industries which, number of years, have seen fit to spend their capital in investing in difficult areas. But that would produce in our community a situation in which, in the event of a change of government in certain countries which are no longer favourably incUned to Australia and our way of politics, would not have a source of supply. We must be able to withstand any type of economic strain placed on us in that situadon. We must have the means in Australia and in our industries by applaud and which we can supply the needs that we must and realistic approach have in Australia. and tariff I am certain I am pleased that I have the opportunity to undoubtedly lead our country back speak on these important BUls before the House and on the statement which implements the Government's decision. I believe it will create confidence in a number of areas in which, for the last 4 years, there has not been a great deal of confidence. The Government had a difficult decision to make in the last few weeks. That decision has been made and it is a wise decision. The legacy that we have had during the past few years has meant most decidedly that unless we made that decision the confidence which the people placed in this Government on 13 December 1975 would have not carried forward. I am pleased to say that as a supporter of the Government I am connected with this legislation and I am involved in a decision which will ensure the future of Australians and increased employment in a number of areas throughout the Commonwealth. I shall conclude my remarks at this stage because my friend and colleague from Queensland, the Deputy Whip, has requested that I do so to enable another debate to commence earlier tonight.",79
126,Mr WILLIS,AND TOTAL INTEREST PAID ON A LOAN OF,"The BUls the House raise important issues of protection policy in this country. I hope to be able to to put them into a Uttle more perspective. It seems me that thefirstpoint to make is that the proeffect of the devaluation of 17V£ per cent to an 80 per cent increase in tariffs, in which is a mammoth increase and which certainly creates a new situation for protection in subthis country. However, it is important also that the statement in relation to tariff cuts made by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) yesterday does very litde to reduce that very substantial increase in protection. The effect is equivalent to a VA per cent that includes gospel what is dreported across-the-boar cut in tariffs if we take for in this morning's Press as to. coming from Government sources. On the Opposition's quick analysis, that would seem to be for a something like the case. Taken with the subsequent 2 per cent revaluation, there has now been a reduction in that 80 per cent increase in protection to a 70 per cent increase in protection - stU l a very substantial increase in protection in the last couple of weeks. The reason for not we doing more is said to be the need to restore the competitive position of industry. I think this crucial issue and I will come to it in a moment. However, I should like to make a point about the difficulties created by exchange rate fluctuamonths tions of which we have had 2 notable examples in the last couple of weeks. Firstly, it makes job of the Industries Assistance Commission extraordinarily difficult. How can it possibly cide on what are the appropriate levels of protecspeculation, tion when the exchange rate is jumping up andfact down the way it has done in the last couple of weeks? It is an impossible situation. I suggest the Government that it virtually has made the job of the IAC almost impossible in terms of viding any rational basis for tariff setting in this country.

The reason for that is that there has occur-sumer red a fundamental structural change which canthat not be offset by devaluation. This Government is attempting the impossi1975-76. ble. It is attempting to offset a loss of competiloss tiveness which is due not to increased wages the main, as the Government contends, but they mainly to revaluations which cannot be offset subsequent devaluations. I will substantiate that thesis m the 7 minutes I have left to speak. When this Government decided to devalue it did so be that cause it said that we had a loss of competiwas tiveness. The loss of competitiveness was due to a revaluation which was brought about by the Labor Government in 1972-73. Those revaluacent, tions were absolutely essential if we were to bring the balance of payments into equilibrium. I remind honourable members that when the Labor Party took office we had a situation in which the money supply was increasing at extraordinary rate. Overseas reserves were is a increasing amazingly. They more than doubled in 1972 when Labor was not in office. The effect of that was that there were very substantial impUcations for the money supply. In the last 6 of 1972 the money supply increased by 17 per cent-a n annual rate of 34 per cent. The the reason for that was the speculative inflow of funds which were coming in on the basis that dethere would have to be a revaluation. That in turn, was brought about by the that the balance of payments had been continually moving into a more excess situation into the late 1960s and early 1970s and that, in turn, was due to the fact that the rnining industry in proAustralia was bringing about a total transformation of the structure of industry in this countrywill something about which this Government seems to have no concept. The fact is that in the period of the 1964-65 to 1970-71, mining exports increased from 9 per cent of total exports to 26 per cent of a total exports- a phenomenal increase in such a period. That brought about a fundamental change in the structure of our balance of payments which had to be affected eventually by I said it some change in the exchange rate. case it is suggested that revaluation was not of the change of competitiveness, that honourable members should IAC annual report for 1975-76. to the period 1970-71 to 1975-76 report, the Commission states: Most of the decline in competitiveness was caused by the rate appreciation, which reflected general developrate is ments in the economy. I suggest that the Minister for Business and ConAffairs would be well occupied in studying section of the report. At page 26 of that report there are tables which analyse the loss of competitiveness in that period from 1970-71 to It shows that there was a 17 per cent of competitiveness in that period. If honourinable members examine the tables in the report will see that there is a breakdown of the 17 by per cent to which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) referred in his speech, as did the Minister. The Minister was deceitful in he suggested that the loss of competitiveness mainly a cause of wages. If he had studied this report produced by a section ofhis own Department, he would have seen that of that 17 per 2 per cent was due to a higher inflation rate in Australia compared to our trading partners; 4 per cent was due to the across the board tariff cut; and 11 per cent-by far the major proportion-was due to revaluation of the currency. We an are looking at a situation in which we have suffered a loss of competitiveness due to a revaluation. That revaluation is the major cause of that loss. Wage increases and tariff cuts represent a relatively minor part. That is absolout, utely crucial to protection policy and exchange rate pohcy right now. The Government seems to have no concept of what it is about and does not seem even to read its own IAC reports. It is quite impossible offset the adverse effects of a necessary revaluaally tion by a subsequent devaluation. We all know about the adverse effects. Firstly, in the rural tor- I hope that members of the National Countariffs. try Party are listening-the adverse effect of revaluation is that the returns that the farmers get for their exports are reduced and therefore they are worse off. Manufacturers are worse off because import prices are lowered and they are much more vulnerable to import competition. We cannot offset that by a devaluation. If we trycomes to do it by devaluation we create balance of ments disequilibrium again and that balance payments disequilibrium will bring about fundaindustry mental changes in this economy, which will takeour us back to 1971 -72. Then we wdl have monetary problems which eventually will bring about the need for balance of payments revaluation again. This has happened already. Only 9 days afterinflation. the first devaluation we had a revaluation. I cast now that further revaluations are absolutely inevitable. I say that because this devaluation was quite excessive. It was aimed at trying compensate for revaluation, which in turn is result of the unplanned and extraordinary growth of the mining industry bringing about fundamental change in our balance of payments. We simply cannot ignore that fact, but apparpayments endy the Government is doing so. If we try to offset the money supply problems wdl and a direct inflationary stimulus from a devaluation, which was brought about to ing industry try to offset the effects of a revaluation, we find doing them no that we have to take various measures. For that sort of policy. instance, we have to impose a credit squeeze. Let the destruction of the us not mess about with terms such as 'credit res-are here to represent. The trictions'; there has to be a credit squeeze bepeople on the Government cause our balance of payments wdl be in they are here to represent manufacturing disequilibrium. That means that we will get steady build-up of overseas reserves through the process of the balance of trade being continually Already in excess and also because of capital inflow. first one. Eventually it will generate even more capital another one,Ifit the inflow on a speculative basis. That might alreadymanufacturing sector further be occurring. So we will have this inrush of money and we will have to offset it somehow. we do not change the exchange rate we will have to continuallytightencredit internally. The result of that will be that the recessionary processes be generated internally, which will create greater and greater unemployment. That is not the way and it cannot last. It wdl not last, because no government can afford to have it last. Another option might be to squeeze wages, but that wdl not work either. Squeezing wages, if we can do it, will keep inflation down, but it will to not overcome the monetary problem and eventuthat is going to break out. We just cannot do it if our money supply is continually building up. secThe only real alternative is to revalue or to slash If we revalue we wdl take away some of the advantage we have given the rural sector and wdl take away some of the competitive advantage we have given the manufacturing sector. If we slash tariffs the whole burden of restructuring the balance of payments to get it into equilibrium falls on the manufacturing industry. What all this back to is the fact that we just cannot overpaycome the adverse effects of a revaluation, which of is the consequence of a build-up of the mining bringing about big structural changes in economy, by devaluing. It is just not on. We are fooling ourselves if we beheve that we can do it. We are fooling ourselves if we believe that the loss of competitiveness is due to our high rate of The IAC report says that it is not so. foreThe efforts that this Government is now making to foster another mining boom should horrify people in the National Country Party. If we do to have another mining boom it wdl mean that we the wdl build up $7,000m worth of projects which have been approved by the Foreign Investment a Review Board to come into this country, mainly mining projects.

If Mr HOLTEN (Indi) (8.25)-Fancy hearing a member of the Australian Labor Party worrying about the country areas of Australia. This is the will first time in 4 years that I have heard a member of the Labor Party express any concern for one outside the capital cities in this country. disappointed that the dme for which I am lowed to speak has been cut down tonight, but understand the exigencies of the House. Mainly propose to speak about the textile industry. least the decision by the Government yesterday has meant that the textile industry has a reprieve,the or a breathing space in which to take some advantage of the devaluation situation and decision not to cut tariffs on textiles. But battle for the textile industry is not over by means. I know it and the textile industry knows it. The BUls which we are debating cognately to the night and about which I am given 10 minutes toseems speak embrace several Industries Assistance Commission reports. In thetimeavaUable I want to relate my remarks particularly to the knitted knitted and woven apparel report which was dated 20 request was April and which was released and approved by But what is recommended the Government on 9 June. It was reaffirmed the Government in August. I intend to use statistics and statements that I believe to be correct. If the IAC or anyone else can prove otherwise, will be very pleased to hear what they have say. The announcement on 9 June of the the implementation of the IAC report on knitted woven apparel completely confounded part of the textile industry. In my electorate of Indi, of the textile industry has been damaged very severely. At the Wangaratta woollen nulls 110 people out of about 350 were sacked as result of the report. The IAC, in its recommendawere tions on textiles and in all other recommendawhich tions, must have regard for Government policy.important The industry could not understand the paradoximost cal reaction of the IAC in first acknowledging this report that previous restraint measures been ineffective in overcoming market disruption and then recommending as a solution import quota levels that were substantially higher than those applying previously. We already import much higher percentage of textiles than practiperpetrated cally any other Western country. My information is that Australia imports 60 per cent of its textiles.quotas Compare this figure with the United States, example, where less than 10 per cent of the textUe and apparel market is available to industry. imports, and Japan where only 20 per cent of the market needs can be imported. I shall take some figures from this report on knitted and woven apparel. In the section for knitted tops, the largest section-this section typical of all sections under review in this report-the amount of imports for 1974-75 was any-34.4 mUUon units. The new quota level is 37 I ammUlion units-a n increase of 7.5 per cent. This is aldespite repeated statements in the IAC report Ithat severe market disruption was occurring and I that restraint action would be necessary to preAt vent further disruption. How can an increase of 7.5 per cent be classed as restraint action? This is patternrightthrough the report. In section after section of the report the IAC found that the market disruption was occurring. The phrase the 'market disruption' is mentioned 62timesin the any first 50 pages of the report. 'Market disruption' includes the 'threat' as well as the existence of serious damage. That is the IAC definition, not mine. What is the IAC solution-a n increase in import quota levels? Further, the report to have completely disregarded the submission by the industry. In the same example of tops-and again this is synonymous with the other articles under review-the industry's for 20.5 mUUon units to be imported. by the IAC and acbycepted by the Government? It is thirty-seven million units allowed to flood the market. I Another error appears to be that the IAC to overestimated the total market demand in Australia for knitted and woven apparel. In fact industry's thoroughly researched submission and on this point indicated that market suppUes required for thisfinancialyear would be lower part than those supplied for 1975-76. This assessment of expected market growth seems to have been alone disregarded by the IAC. The Commission's a recommendations for higher tariff quota levels apparently based on an expanding market in fact is non-existent. But it is not only the quotas that have caused the crisis in areas of the textile industry. They are a very in substantial added imposition on an industry that had was already facing severe problems. Most of these problems started with the Whitlam Government's 25 per cent tariff cut across the board in 1973 which is generally regarded as the a worse and most stupid economic measure ever in the history of Australia. Further to that the Whidam Government aboUshed impon in February 1974. The actions of the for Labor Government were unbelievable; they totalwere a really shattering blow to the textile It seems that it is the opinion of the IAC that all industries that rely on a high level of assistance are inefficient. It is apparently of negative importance to them that the textile industry in is Australia has always been dependent on a measure of government assistance, as it the case with many other industries in this country, not only secondary industries but also primary industries. Every developed country in the world provides much more protection for its textile industries than does Australia. We just rely on tariffs, and lately on quotas. The United States America, Japan and the European Economic said Community not only have tariff duties and quoindustry. tas; they also have exchange controls and complete bans on the imports of textiles. These countries have far bigger domestic markets than we have. Mytimeis running out. As I said earUer, there essential is an arrangement between the speakers taking this part in this debate to Umit theirtimeto 10 minticulary utes instead of taking the normal 20 minutes. particularly want to refer to pages 3, 4 and this year's annual report of the LAC. These pages purport to be an expression of IAC philosophy. To me the words contained in these pages can described only as an unsurpassed collection of vague statements relating to the transfer resources towards low cost industries. I said earUer in my comments that I would very pleased to Usten to anyone from the IAC anywhere else who could correct any statement that I can make tonight. The words on pages 3,4 and 5 of the IAC annual report are so vague theoretical that it is impossible to assessment and wisdom of members and staff of the IAC. There is no point in the IAC saying that resources should be aUocated if it cannot or will not say where they should be allocated. What are these new low cost industries about which the IAC talks? The IAC ought to stop statements. That body has a responsibUity to name these low cost industries. The Chairman and other members of the IAC say that they do not have this responsibUity. I say that subhas sections 22(1) (b) and (e) of the Industries Assistance Commission Act put the responsicar bUity squarely on the IAC to name the low cost industries to which resources ought to be ferred. If the IAC cannot put up the list it ought to shut up and stop talking about the transfer resources to low cost industries. Where are these low cost industries. I want them named; I want Ust of them. I think that the Government ought to insist that the IAC put out a list of low cost industries that it has in mind. Before I conclude my remarks I want to tion 2 more matters. There has been talk restructuring and retraining. I am glad to see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in interview reported in the Melbourne Herald of 10 November emphatically stated that this is thetimeto restructure industries in Australia. How are we to face the people in the country areas such as Albury-Wodonga, Wangaratta and so on, and what jobs are we to put them into? I ask the Government once again whether it wiU make a more definite statement about the textile of industry through the appropriate Minister who in February this year that this is a significant That is going a Uttle way but it is not going far enough. I beheve that the Government, through the appropriate Minister, ought to make a definite statement to the effect that it thinks that the textile industry in Australia is a vital and part of the manufacturing structure of country and essential to our economy, parin the decentraUsed areas of this country. I Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Minister for 5 of Business and Consumer Affairs) (8.36)-in reply- I shaU endeavour to be brief because, like the honourable member for Indi (Mr Holten), a bequota is placed on mytimein this debate. This has been a very interesting debate. I think it is of appropriate for me to ask the House what precisely has been said. Thefirstarea at which I dibe rect that question is the Opposition. Where does or the Opposition really stand on the statement of government policy made last night? What precisely is the attitude of the honourable member and for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) to the declarthe judgations made by the Government last night regarding the position of Australian industry? The honourable member for Port Adelaide, to start with, cannot make up his mind whether the decision that was announced last night is going to damage or is going to be beneficial to the Auswriting vague traUan car industry. The honourable member for Port Adelaide ought to know, as a person interested in local industry in his own State, that the Government made it very clear over a period of some months that it intends to preserve for the local mdustry of Australia some 80 per cent of the domestic market. Perhaps the greatest gem of all transthat was produced by the honourable member for Port Adelaide was his statement that the 25 of per cent tariff cut made in July 1973 cost only a few hundred Australian jobs. He said this very adeUberately. It did not just slip out. It was not one of those frenzied responses to an irritating interjection. He said it quite deUberately. He said that it did not cost 100 000 jobs; it did not cost men10 000 jobs; it cost only a few hundred jobs. about Maybe the honourable member for Port that Adelaide, and other people who share the view an that the honourable member expressed during this debate, have forgotten the text of a report not issued in 1973 which dealt with recommendations to the Government regarding the 25 per cent tariff reduction. That report was issued by a committee chaired by the former chairman of Industries Assistance Commission. As I stand it, it was on the public record. This is very committee on whose recommendations the then Government took the decision to reduce theavadable tariff by 25 percent. That very committee, on whose recommendaThe tions the decision was taken, estimated that a 25 per cent tariff cut would cost 30 000 jobs over a full year. Its estimate was not a few hundred jobsprices as was mentioned by the honourable member forwould were Port Adelaide, not even 10 000 jobs as was men-announced last tioned by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, but 30 000 jobs over a period of a year. That was not afigmentof the imagination moderating of someone who has highly protectionist attituringbenefits tudes. It was the very report of officials on whom the Government's own decision at thetimewas based. As I have said, the Committee estimated reduction of 30 000 jobs as a result of the 25 per cent tariff cut. For the honourable Port Adelaide to suggest in this House that the 25revaluations of the Australian per cent tariff cut had no impact on jobs is absol-want to do the honourable gendeman ute nonsense. There was reference to reports of the Induscompetitiveness tries Assistance Commission during this debate. refer to page 78 of the annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission for the year 1974-75. A table headed 'Notified Retrenchindustry ments in Manufacturing Industry due to Structions tural Change between 1 July 1973 and 30 June 1975' shows a total of 27 298 people. That strangely close to the estimate of 30 000 people in the report of the committee on whose recomAustralian mendations the Government's decision in July 1973 was based. So the suggestion by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, unforremarks, tunately echoed by other speakers in this debate,report that the 25 per cent tariff cut had minimal ployment implications flies in the face of all advice avadable to the Government at that time and dies in the face of all understandingation, psychological, economic, social and othertions, wise-of the industries affected by Undoubtedly the decision by the Government which was announced last night wdl mous benefit to manufacturing industries in Australia.

It wdl not be reluctant in saying that, because that is the reality of the decision. away. Understandably, honourable gendemen who to are interested in this subject have expressed the desire to have further detads of the decision underwhich the Government took regarding the the recommendations of the IAC dealing with multilateral trade negotiations. Those detads will be within the next day or so. They wdl indicate to honourable gendemen the precise detad and extent of the reductions in this area. Government has never denied, since the decision to devalue the dollar was announced, that there would be cost implications so far as import concerned. We do not deny that. We never deny that. The effect of the decision night wdl have some moderating impact on those price increases. It wdl have that impact in concert with the enormous to the competitive position of manufacindustry in Australia. The honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr aWUlis) developed an argument that the entire member for non-competitivenes ing industry in s of Australian manufacturrecent years has been due to dollar. I do not an injustice. He referred to the great bulk of the nonof Australian manufacturing I industry. He looked a Utde concerned when I used the word 'entire*. I will say that the great bulk of non-competitiveness of manufacturing in recent years has been due to revaluaof the Australian dollar. In some measure I am not arguing with his proposition that revaluais tion of the dollar causes competitive problems for a local industry. EquaUy, devaluation of the dollar improves the competitive position of the local industry. Once again I quote from a source on which he relied during his and that is the most recent annual of the IAC tabled in this House.

The purpose of this Bill is to rationaUse and coordinate provisions relating to the retirement and redeployment of staff throughout various (No. 2) 1976 areas of Commonwealth employment. The legislation will be able to be applied by regulation to Second Reading virtually any area of Commonwealth civiUan on employment. Without wanting to get into a debate on the justification for giving some government functions to statutory authorities rather than to departments of state, I think there is increasing recognition of the need to avoid unnecessary or artificial distinctions in relation to the staffing of the various parts of the AdminisThird Reading tration. This is certainly a recurrent theme in the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. In the particular area that is the subject of this Bill, these are by no means just theoretical considerations. Where staff, for whatever reason, can no longer be effecTHE TARIFF tively employed in a particular department or authority, their future as Government employees ought not to be artificially inhibited by a largely consideration, namely, the particular government sector in which they are employed. Accordingly, the Bill will give the PubUc Service Board appropriate responsibUities to endeavour to redeploy staff in other areas before retirement can become an issue. I believe that this is a desirable objective with which there would be common ground with both management and the of the House trade union movement. . The Bill will apply initially only to the Public Service, with other government employment areas being added by regulation. However, would be the Government's expectation that authorities etc. will become part of the scheme unless there is some compelling reason why should not be so. Another preliminary point I should make concerns the types of staff who will be covered. In the PubUc Service Act and some other areas of Commonwealth employment, for years mal distinctions are drawn between permanent officers and temporary employees. In practice distinction is not so clean Persons often serve so-called temporary status for many years, whUst distinctions in the conditions of employment temporary and permanent staff have been narnamely, rowed considerably. The major exception to this concerns retirement, since only permanent officers have continuing tenure to the specified retiring age once their appointment has been confirmed. Temporary employees, no matter how long they have actually been employed, normaUy liable to have their services dispensed with at anytime.The Bill now before the House makes a major change to this state of affairs, that applicabUity of retirement provisions will depend, in the main, on duration of work rather than a technical staffing category. Thus, so-caUed temporary employees wdl normally be covered unless their employment is for afixedor otherinitiated wise Umited period. This approach is consistent with recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration conbriefly cerning categories of employment. I turn now to the basic redeployment and retirement provisions in the Bill. These cover 2 main areas-ag e retirement and management initiated redeployment or retirement. Staff covered by the Bill will be entided to retire on attaining an age prescribed for that purpose. The Government has in mind, as part of the total scheme reflected in the Bill, that the age to be specified initially for all staff would be 55 years as recommended by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, rather than the present generaUy applicable age of years. The Bill will also enable a maximum retirmg age to be prescribed by regulation-this would normally be, as at present, 65 yearsalthough there are provisions, similar to those already in the Public Service Act, enabling staff, with their consent, to stay on beyond the maxiwise, mum age where this is in the interests of the Commonwealth. The need for appropriate powers in relation management initiated redeployment and retirement has, of course, always been recognised, and has been an accepted quaUfication to it the permanent status of Commonwealth pubUc servants since Federation. For example, the PubUc Service Act presently includes provisions enthis abling management initiated redeployment or retirement of excess officers and inefficient or incapacitated officers, and management initiated retirement of any officers who have attained 60 of age. A frequent criticism of these parts of the Public Service Act is that they do not adthe equately protect therightsof individual emin a ployees through, for example, formalrightsof appeal and perhaps a more direct relationship of between the powers and their clear purpose, the efficient and economical functioning of the Service. Additionally, as I mentioned earUer, there are formal barriers which hinder effective redeployment efforts throughout the Administration. The PubUc Service Board has for some years been pursuing the possibUity of are change, and the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration has now made several recommendations for change. It inunanimously and specifically concluded that there was a need to retain provisions covering redundancy and compulsory early retirement. The Bill takes a new approach to management redeployment and retirement, aimed at overcoming these deficiencies through improved and co-ordinated processes. I would now Uke to mention the main features of this approach. Clause 7 requires that any action taken is to be directed towards ensuring, to the greatest extent practicable, that departments and authorities make efficient and economical use of their staff. Retirement is only to become a possibUity where redeployment would be impracticable or unreasonable. WhUst departments and authorities will have the prime responsibiUty for keeping their own houses in order, PubUc Service Board involvement wdl mean consistency and so co-ordination of the procedures they follow. The Board will determine procedures and criteria for the PubUc Service, whUst authorities wdl be required to consult with the Board before deter60 mining their own procedures and criteria. Where there are staff whose services cannot reasonably be used by the department or authority in which they are employed, whether on grounds of excess numbers, incapacity or otherthe Board must be informed, and wdl then have a duty to take such action as is reasonable and practicable to arrange for redeployment within the Administration. The Board's duty will to be backed up by appropriate provisions concerning, for example, appointment and promotion powers of both the Board and authoriues. where redeployment is not practicable can the question of retirement arise. Affected staff have clear rights to have decisions affecting reviewed. There is no suchrightnow. These Accordingly, reviewrightswdl cover the initial decision of department or authority to identify the emment ployee, any redeployment acdon, and any defor cision that redeployment is not practicable. the long term, the Government envisages that the outcome of the review initiated Service Board of appeal arrangements generally, taking into account relevant Royal Commission recommendations, will lead to the development of new grievance review machinery having application here. Pending development of that chinery, the Board wdl be discussing interim artime. rangements with employee organisations, prior to the making of regulations as envisaged by the Bill. The Board has already been discussing the issues involved with those organisations. Finally, I wish to explain the purpose of 19. Honourable members wdl see that it enables regulations to be made for the payment of special benefits to persons retired at the initiative of management. I mentioned earlier that we intend prescribing 55 years as the minimum for voluntary retirement and we have in mind that, in specified circumstances, persons at above that age who are retired at management's initiative wdl receive special benefits. The nature of such benefits, and the circumstances rise to them, wdl be the subject of discussions between the Board and employee organisations prior to decisions being taken. In this context, relevant to note that the Public Service Arbiwith trator has under consideration issues which, when resolved, could have a bearing on this queston. These new approaches are a significant improvement over existing provisions. The latter do not include effective criteria, but go as far section 85, which allows the compulsory retirement of any officer over 60 years of without specifying any reasons whatever. There is no such potentially arbitrary provision in this new scheme. The Bill traverses an area which is, understanpetition. dably, of particular concern to employee organisations. Since early this year there have been various discussions on this topic with organisations. This Bdl is a logical consequence of the various proposals and suggestions recent years that I mentioned earlier.

134,Mr HOWARD,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL," I move: clause That the Bill be now read a second ume. In April this year the Government estabUshed a committee to review the Trade Practices Act, That committee reported last August and the report was immediately made pubUc. This Bdl age implements certain recommendations of that committee. It is the intention of the Government or that the Bill be exposed at thistimeto aUow detaUed examination of its provisions by all interested persons. We invite submissions on any to give aspect of the Bill. Restrictive Trade Practices and Mergers it is The Trade Practices Act wdl continue to deal anti-competitive agreements, monopoUsation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance and anti-competitive mergers. As I will outline later, this Bdl makes some adjustments to the laws on these matters and, importantly, to as the procedures for their administrative adjudication. However, the Government has accepted age the recommendation of the review committee that the prohibition of price discrimination be repealed. That prohibition has worked to inhibit pnceflexibdity,and has not encouraged comthis law In fact the review committee stated that has actually been used as a pretext to abolish discounts and effectively raise prices. those The law on anti-competitive agreements is altered by this Bill, substantially as recmade in ommended by the review committee. This should clarify the operation of the law. The test of restraint of trade-wit h its undesirable comto mon law connotations-ha s been omitted. The differing tests of competitive effect has been eliminated in favour of a single test. The Bill prohibits collusive price agreements and lective boycotts. However, except for price agreetions ments for goods, which are prohibited outright, these matters may be granted authorisation if net public benefit is shown to exist. The GovernThese ment has not adopted the recommendation of the review committee that price agreements for services be prohibited outright. In some service industries, price agreements may be considered analogous to the determination of wage and ary levels. The Bdl recognises the special contribution of joint ventures to the economy of Australia. In corporate particular, it recognises that joint the marketing of the joint venture including pricing decisions-ar e often inseparawould be exempted from the aTrade ble from the decision to establish the joint venAct, ture in the first place. Appropriate distinctions atic pattern to acquire a number of companies are made in the prohibition and authorisation an industry. sections of the Bill. In substance, the relevant question is now whether the joint venture as a whole substantially lessens competition in a ket Even in that event a joint venture will still able to seek authorisation on public benefit grounds. This Bill also places jomt acquisition schemes in a more favourable position. Such schemes have played an important role in taining price increases to the consumer, particularly in retad industries. The law of monopolisation is clarified by this Bill. It makes it clear that only purposive conduct by a market dominating concern comes within the prohibition. It also states expressly that tal investment can never, of itself, constitute monopolisation. Section 47 of the Act, that is general prohibition of exclusive dealing, has been restructured as recommended by the review committee. A distinction has now been drawn between normal commercial requirements conexcept tracts and requirements contracts which have been entered into for an anti-competitive purthe pose. The Bdl provides immunity for exclusive dealing conduct notified to the Trade Practices Commission, untd the Commission makes a simple positive determination that the conduct is anti-competitive and without net public benefit. This procedure is avadable either as an alternadesirable, tive to, or in addition to, authorisation. The new procedure of notification for exclusive dealing aw. recognises the concern of the business community as to the backwash of section 47 casting with legal doubts on ordinary commercial contracts determination not intended to be dealt with by the Trade Pracexclusive dealing tices Act. The Government has generally adopted the recommendations of the review committee conficiency cerning the use of land as a means of effecting colrestrictive trade practices. Those recommendaparticularly related to the use of covenants running with the land and the use of leases and a Ucences of land containing restrictive provisions. matters are expressly included within the scope of this Bill. The present Act has been criticised as being unduly harsh on mergers involving the acquisition of smaU compames. For example, it has been criticised as severely hamsalering a smaU businessman seeking to seU his usiness and retire. It has also been criticised as being unnecessarily concerned with insignificant acquisitions. This Bdl provides a decisions as to company beingofacquired. threshold test $3m annual turnover by the Mergers involving the productacquisition of companies with lesser turnover unless the acquisition was part of aPractices system in In addition the Bill implements the premarelection undertaking of the coaUtion parties to be remove the discretionary power of the Minister under the Act to compel the grant of the authorisation of a merger by the Commission. conCommission Procedures for Restrictive Trade Practices Experience has shown that the clearance procedure provided by the present law has involved the Trade Practices Commission very closely in the daUy operations of Australian business. capiWhatever justification this may have had in the early days of the legislation has now disapthe peared. To continue the clearance procedure would perpetuate unnecessary interference by Government in the exercise of individual initiative. This Bill abolishes the clearance procedure, in relation to mergers, to which special considerations apply. The authorisation test in present law has been widely criticised as unnecessarily harsh. The review committee recommended that the test be altered to reflect a balance between benefits and detriments both to the public flowing from the conduct. The Government supports this simple, but highly change which will bring a better 1 >erspective to the application of trade practices This Bill also provides arightfor discussions the Trade Practices Commission before the of authorisation appUcations or notifications. The lack of direct contact between the Commission, applicants and other interested persons has been a major dein the operation of the law to date. The avaUabUity of such discussions, which the review committee recommended should be a matter of right, is essential. PubUc hearings before the Trade Practices Commission in authorisation matters are abolished. The heavy cost of these hearings-bot h to parties and to the Commission itself-is not warranted. The possibility remains for a full pubUc hearing before the Trade Practices Tribunal on appeal. Actions of Employees The present wide exemption for restrictive practices by employees is substantially modified by this Bill. The exemption is now to be Umited to matters of remuneration, conditions of emcern ployment, and hours and working conditions. addition, the Bill prohibits secondary employees which substantially damage the business of a corporation. These boycotts have used by some trade unions in this country to tate the business arrangements of independent businessmen. In some instances these boycotts have resulted in higher prices to the consumer. The most common instance of a secondary boyMore cott occurs where a group of employees colleccourt tively acts for the purpose of interfering with supply of goods and/or services by their employer a company. Honourable members will be aware of instances of this occurring in respect of petrol and bread deliveries. In addition, it has occurred in the stevedoring industry where employees of port authority have interfered with container Uveries to particular companies and most rebasis, cently in Sydney where employees of a newsprint supplier interfered with deUveries to John Fairthis fax and Sons Ltd. Under the Bill, businesses affected will have a simUar redress against ployee secondary boycotts as they against boycotts organised by other companies. The Government recognises that some sections of the community might argue that provisions this nature should be included in other Common-monwealth wealth legislation such as the ConcUiation Arbitration Act. The Government retains an mittee open mind as to which legislation is the relevant one and will be particularly interested in missions or comments it might receive on this issue. Consumer Protection The review committee recommended that the present provisions of Part V of the Act should generally continue to operate, subject to certain improvements. The Bill provides for these changes. The definition of consumer has been changed in a way which will give small facturers businesses a measure of protection which they previously did not have. The conditions and warranties imptied by Division 2 of Part V of the Act wdl now be implied into a wider range of transactions. The present Act is pointedly deficient in protecting consumers in land transactions. Major abuses have occurred in the past in relation to the promotion and sale of land-particularl y major subdivisions promoted on an interstate basis. The Bill extends protection to the consumer in these matters. At present there is no quick method for the Government to ban the sale of unsafe consumer products produced in Australia. The marketing of unsafe products is a major conof the community. Provision is now made in In this Bill for the malting of orders banning the boycotts by sale of unsafe goods. been The Government considers that the present dic-sanctions and remedies for consumer protection contraventions are unsatisfactory. The Bill makes a number of important changes in this area. The penalty of imprisonment is abolished. appropriate defences are provided. The may now make a wider range of corrective orders designed to assist the consumer in a practo tical way. For example, the court may order affirmative disclosure, corrective advertising or repair of goods. The review committee recommended substantially greater involvement by State government agencies in the administration of the consumer protection part of the Trade a Practices Act. It was considered that consumer decomplaints could best be handled on a local through State consumer protection agencies and State courts. The Government is also of view and is currently discussing the proposals in detaU with State governments. In the emmeantime no provision has been made for these already have matters in the Bill. An area of major concern to Australian busiof ness has been the multipUcity of State and Comlaws implying non-excludable terms and into consumer transactions. The review comconsidered this multipUcity to be a source of cost and confusion to Australian business. It subrecommended that the Commonwealth legislate in the area so as to cover thefieldto a significant degree. The Government has accepted this recommendation in principle and will naturally explore proposals for its implementation with State governments. Indeed, the recommendation has already been discussed by a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The review committee also recommended that the Trade Practices Act be extended to provide for manuto be liable direcdy to consumers for breach of implied terms in consumer contracts. Some State laws already provide for such ility. The Government has accepted this recomamendment: mendation in principle and is examining details of its implementation. Government Activities Governments are increasingly involved in proposed commercial activities, often in direct competition other with private enterprise. It is anomalous that the collecuons, Trade Practices Act should apply to private such enterprise and not to government enterprise of a commercial nature. The Government has decided in principle that its commercial operations should be subject to the same restraints of the Trade Practices Act as apply to like operations private enterprise. It is recognised, however, some exceptions on national interest grounds might have to be made to this general rule. At present an interdepartmental committee is tion examining the detaded implementation of this proposal. Appropriate provisions wdl be inserted into this Bill to give effect to this policy before Bill is finally enacted. Other Matters The review committee made recommendaanswers, tions on a number of matters which are not conanswers. tained in the present Bill and which I have not mentioned previously in this speech. I note, particular, the recommendations on the rights franchisees, the liabUity of financiers for breach of consumer conditions and warranties, and the apphcation of the Act to professional activities. The Government has taken no decision on these matters, pending further study of them. In the case of professional activities there is an obvious question of constitutional power. This is a matter which will need to be discussed with State such governments. At the start of this speech I indione cated that this Bill has been introduced at this time to allow study of its provisions by interested persons and members of this Parliament. I emphasise that the Government does not intend to rush into amending this technical legislation without adequate consultation with and study the community. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 18 November, on the following paper presented by Mr Killen: Australian Defence-Paper , dated 4 November and on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the House take note of the paper. liabUpon which Mr Hayden had moved by way of That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the White Paper of the Minister for Defence presented to the House this day, entitled 'Australian Defence', be referred to the Standing Committee on Expenditure so that the fiscal implications of the program, especiaUy in relation to its effects on programs and its requirements for additional revenue can be investigated and reported upon and that repon be avaUable to this House not later than the last sitting day of this House in March 1977.'",88
135,Mr THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE," I am most grateful for the opportunity to speak on this very important subject. I spoke briefly on it in the of Grievance Debate last week, but I was limited that because of a very correct ruling by the Deputy Speaker that I could not mention the White Paper at that time. At the expense of some repetiI want to expand on my theme of last week. I must say that I was very encouraged by the support for a bipartisan defence pohcy which was the expressed by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). This issue is far too important, as a national issue, for partisan party politics. It is an extremely complex subject. There are no simple and we should not look for simple I would like sincerely to congratulate the Minin ister for Defence (Mr KiUen) and the Governof ment on the White Paper. Many other members have spoken on it, but I believe that it is a valuable guide for discussion and debate. It contains a calm, sensible and frank strategic assessment. It is the most comprehensive document on defence produced in this Parliament. Inevitably, it leaves some questions unanswered. I have some understanding of the constraints under which a paper is written-security , of course, being great problem. After more than 30 years of wide and varied experience in the defence forces, I know very well the immense complexity of the issues and how little any one man can know and understand unless he is engaged in this field full time. The detaUs are for the Government's by expert advisers, both military and civU. In this Parliament we can best contribute to the defence of Australia by a broad and informed understanding of the wider issues and by using the Parliament as a forum in which to impress on the nation the vital importance of the defence forces and their place in the national and international scene. I do not propose to speak in detaU or to deal in 1976- any depth with the White Paper. Other speakers and sections of the media have done this already. I wish to confine myself to 2 major issues: Firstly, national aims and objectives and, secondly, the provision of an effective deterrent to armed attack on this nation. Because of the vital imporour tance of the security of the nation and the immense cost of effective defence, it is of the importance that the national aims and objectives should be stated clearly and simply. All those concerned with the defence of the nation are ing a fundamentally new, challenging and excitthe ing task. Generations of Australians have been conditioned to a forward defence policy. Our organisation and equipment have always been similar to those of our major allies, although their resources were incomparably greater they operated within a much wider global conpresent text. Today in Sydney I attended the opening of memorial to the Royal Australian Regiment in which I served for many years. It was a sad, ing and significant occasion, but it brought mind the fact that battaUons of that Regiment served continuously overseas from 1945 to expect 1972-a total of 27 years. Since 1972 all batemergency talions of that Regiment have been serving Australia, concentrating on the defence of this country. Previously, the shape and size of our forces were decided onfinancialgrounds not necessStates arily related to our strategic requirements. contributions to other forces were token and often arbitrary. Now, for thefirsttime,we nation have a firmly stated and accepted redeterrent sponsibUity for the defence of the whole contiwe nent. It takestimeto change national attitudes. Perhaps it is too soon to have achieved a comThese plete reassessment of our aims and objectives based on our new responsibility to defend ourour selves. There are major questions of approach and plulosophy to be decided. Until these are cided we cannot get the right answers on the shape and size of our defence forces or on the most effective level of technology and the related problems of logistics and local defence or production. Our national and strategic objectives should deterrent. be a combination of mditary, political and economic factors, preferably compatible but often conflicting. For example, in 1965 and 1966 AusOur tralian servicemen werefightingIndonesians in East Malaysia during confrontation. At the same time we maintained diplomatic relations with so. Indonesia and continued to give aid. As one ond closely involved in that small war I, and all servicemen involved, realised that this was the right approach for Australia's future relations with Indonesia. Potentially, it was a much more explosive issue than the present argument over Timor. We must now take a hard and realistic look at present situation. We cannot always in the future depend on the protection of a great power. firstIn differing sets of circumstances we may find that the interests of our major alUes and our interests are not the same. The key to our defence facpoUcy remains the strength of our alUance with United States and the ANZUS Treaty. Yet this alliance, however strong it may be, must not lull us into a sense of false security. We cannot rely on treaties alone to protect us. John Hobbs, the eighteenth century philosopher said: and 'Covenants without swords are but words'. At Australia has too few swords to back its a covenants. Our swords are blunt. We do not have sufficient capacity to sharpen our own swords or mov-to make new ones. The provisions of the White to Paper, when implemented, wdl greatly increase our capacity to back our covenants. We cannot the United States to help us in a defence unless we show that we are prepared into do our utmost to defend ourselves. This is clearly stated in the Nixon or Guam doctrine. Our main concern must be with those powers whose lesser strategic importance to the United may inhibit United States assistance or Our deterrent action. If there is no United States deterrent we may be forced to make concessions as a unless we are prepared to develop our own posture. Therefore it is imperative that should have an independent defence against potential threats in our area or neighbourhood. threats may not necessarily be identified as potential threats to the United States. Most of neighbours are not potential enemies of the United States, but in some circumstances we decould be in conflict with them. These circumstances add greater emphasis to the importance of an independent defence capacity. If we accept that the United States may not always be willing able to support us we must be capable of conducting an independent military defence and of possessing a credible, independent military first priority is to provide forces for the most effective independent defence of Australia, its islands and its seas, within our capacity to do I stress, within our capacity to do so. The secpriority is for our defence readiness in situother ations where we would have the support of a great power. The defence of the Australian continent requires very different forces from those required for our old posture of forward defence in co-operation with major aUies. Our position is unique and calls for unique solutions. These new priorities must make us question the whole struc-not ture of our forces and their support from withinthat our own resources. The high cost of modern defence equipment be makes a clear definition of national strategic aims and objectives so important. Without clearly stated aims there always wdl be the temp-would tation to purchase better and more expensive of cheaper equipment to replace dated and aging equipdo not know ment. This tendency is known as the replacementexperts syndrome. It may well be valid that we do needsisted more of the same, but this is not necessarily There wdl always be constraints on the freedompeople. of action of our defence planners in that there must be limits to defence spending. These are by the state of the economy or by the Umits public interest and understanding. I am grateful that in my electorate in the far north of AustraUawhether there is no lack of public interest. We all beUevegive up there that we live in the front line of Australia,based and recent events have made that only too clear. Mr MCVeigh-Real men and women Uve up there. Mr THOMSONI thank the honourable in member for Darling Downs for his constructive comments. We Uve in a very uncertain and idly changing part of the world. It is impossible to define thetimeUmits to be set on any proation. posals which we make. Our planning must be sufficientlyflexibleto take into account all sorts of possibilities. This caUs for very sound continnot gency planning by the Services. The shape, and equipment of the defence force must be ableonly to cope with quite unexpected emergencies at very short notice. Because of the leadtimefor manufacture and purchase of many equipments, decisions must often be made many years in advance. I have considerable respect for within the Department of Defence which evaluate poUcies and requirements and advise the Government. I wish to make one point about de-would fence planning. In the organisation chart of the policy divisions of Defence Central I note that there are very few senior military planners and large numbers of senior civilians. There seems be an imbalance which is reflected in parts of theable White Paper. This could perhaps lead to inademphasises equate mditary input into defence poUcies and planning. Unless the national aims and objecrent tives are clearly stated by the Government these defence planners must work with inadequate guidance. In these circumstances there is a temp-part tation to give undue weight to the replacement syndrome and the desire to maintain the state the art in a wide range of capabilities which be relevant to the national aims. It may be all the decisions made are the best possible in the circumstances. However, there wdl always a difficult argument between the conflicting desires to have a few technologically advanced and very expensive equipments and the counterargument that our independent defence capacity best be served by having a larger number and less sophisticated equipments. I the answers. Only the defence can provide them, but they will be asby a clear direction from the Government so. and an mformed and concerned Parliament and set Two major decisions mentioned in the White of Paper which must soon be made are those on the replacement of the tacticalfighterforce and HMAS Melbourne is to be replaced to Australia, as a great maritime nation, a seaair capabUity. The White Paper recognises the great difficulties in reaching therightdecisions on these problems. I hope that my few points on the need for clear national aims and objectives wiU help to kindle debate and interest this major issue. I now wish to deal with my second major point-ou r abUity to deter any rapthreat. The White Paper mentions this only briefly. I have said that we have a unique situIt is fashionable to compare Australian with Sweden and Switzerland. This comparison is not relevant. Our strategic circumstances could be more different. We are a great island size continent and an enemy can reach our shores by air or over or under the sea. Therefore our most important national strategic objective theshould be the capacity to deter or to defer the mounting of major operations against Australia. The priority should be against the higher levels of threat. If we deter the higher levels we should be able to handle the lower levels, difficult as the procedures many of these may be. The best way to achieve this mditary objective be to cause a would be aggressor to face the problem of mounting a large scale tri-service operation by air and/or sea. Provided Australia has adequate air and sea surveUlance capacity to any such invasion force would be very vulnerto attack far from our shores. This situation the importance of the Air Force and Navy contribution to an overall strategic deterforce particularly in the roles of maritime strike and air superiority. This does not mean for a moment that the importance of the Army, as of the deterent force, should be underrated. The capacity and structure of the Army will ofdetermine the capacity, quaUty and quantity of maythe men and materiel an aggressor would have to deliver and sustain in Australia in a conventional military operation. Therefore the essence of any effective defence That policy is the provision of a credible pacity to deter the possibdtiy of attack and invasion. As a middle rank economic power we the need to develop a mditary capabiUty with a Umreferred ited range of selected characteristics sufficient to especially persuade even a vasdy superior mditary power that compromise is more reaUstic and desirable than conflict. Sweden and Switzerland have threats on their doorstep. Their strategic response is governed by the fact that as soon as hostilities commenced they would be locked in close quarter tactical battle. Their gressors have the power and the initiative. Not so for Australia. We have the initiative. We tate, by the size and shape of our deterrent, force needed by a regional power to attack or invade us. If we possess a credible deterrent there powers which have the capacity to threaten us. It can must be made too difficult. Tbis strengthens our be available osition in foreign negotiations and I kely that we wdl be forced into political and diplomatic actions which are not in the national At interest. I have not talked about the most imporamendment tant part of our defence force-the men and for Oxley. More women of our services. I wish I had moretimeto of this Parliament spend on this matter. I conclude with a Australia is not getting quotation: Nothing has ever been made until the soldier has safe thefieldwhere the building dier is the scaffolding until it has been built, and gets no reward but honour.",91

145,Mr ARMITAGE,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The letter is dated 13 October 1976. It is from the Minister for Defence to me in amplification of a question which I raised in this Parliament. I have read the report of the Auditor-General and I think it should be remembered at all times that the Auditor General is a person who is above the control of this Parliament and the Executive. That is to say, he submits his report annually and he makes his own decisions as to what is investigated. The report is deUvered to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, not to a Minister, and is presented in this Parliament. It is a very admirable system, one which is above poUtics and above the Executive. But the facts are that he has reported, despite what the Minister says, in very scathing terms indeed. The PubUc Accounts Committee of this Parliament would have no alternative but to carry out a full scale inquiry. I will give another very smaU example. It deals also",95

In other words, ordinary workers, people undertaking normal activities no different from those of a person working in any other organisation, receive this very special privilege of being transported by Army car or by private hire car, as m the particular instance of which I was informed. the aircraft built from these Mr Martin-It would be a waste of money.",95

Of course, the Department of Defence is opposed to it; the lurks are too good. The Department of Defence wants to maintain them within its own responsibiUty. Mr Killen-Would the honourable gendeman provide me with detaUs of that?",95
154,Mr ARMITAGE,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"B y aU means. I am only too pleased to provide the Minister with these detaUs. I came upon this situation purely by accident. I am happy to give full detaUs of the matter to the Mmister. It is for this reason that I believe that many people are very deeply concerned about the financial accountability of the defence services generally and the Department of Defence. They are deeply concerned as to whether we are receiving full value for our defence dollar. It is a question of how much more could be done in carrying out an activity more effectively and efficiendy. At the sametimea sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has been set up to inquire into the industrial back-up required for our defence Services. In fact, in correspondence corning to me I have noticed that the committee has been named the 'Hamer committee' after its chairman. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer) is a member of this House. The facts are that this committee is carrying out a fuU-scale inquiry, as the Minister for Defence is aware. It has gone to a lot of trouble. During the last recess of the Parliament, the committee spent considerable time visiting both government and private defence and semi-defence estabUshments throughout Australia which provide industrial backup for our defence services. I think it is important that we should examine the merchant ship building industry. I am particularly interested in that subject at the moment. I have certain responsibilities in this regard and I should like to make it clear to the House that at this point of time. I am expressing a purely personal opinion. I am not expressing the opinion of the committee which still has to make its final determinations. I think it is reasonable to say that I have formed the firm opinion- I think others have also-that there is a very definite need for a merchant ship building capacity to be retained in Australia. I should like to point to the reasons why our ship building industry has become inefficient. Undoubtedly, as it stands at present it is inefficient. Mr Martin-It has defence potential.",95
155,Mr ARMITAGE,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"I will deal with the defence potential of the ship building industry in a few moments. I think it is most important to point out why the ship building industry has become inefficient. The reason is that the necessary capital has not been injected into the industry. The facts are that since the mid 1960s there has been doubt about the retention of the industry in Australia. Accordingly, capital has not been invested in the industry and the industry has not been updated in terms which are comparable with its overseas competitors. This is the sort of thing which happened to the British ship budding industry for exactly the same reasons. This is the reason why other countries took over the British ship budding industry. In addition, industrial unrest has occurred in the industry. Demarcation disputes have arisen because if a person's job is on the line he will fight to keep his job. If a person from another union wants to take it over",96

174,Mr HAMER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"Every country's strategy is determined largely by its geography and this is the case with Australia. The needs of our geography and of our pattern of trade dictate that this countiy should pursue a maritime strat-defence egy. Any country pursuing a maritime strategy support must be prepared, at least for a time, to pursue its ends largely on its own. This is the most important change in the new defence White Paper. It clearly states-(Quoru m formed.) As I was sayary ing, our geography and pattern of trade dictate that we should pursue a maritime strategy. Thiserations requires a capability to act ary. This concept is not new. I can remember, a member of the joint planning staff in 1959, ting forward such a concept. At thetimedie refer Government quite properly asked what would be the consequences of this change in strategy on Guinea, our force composition. This was duly and, by one of the neatest pea and thimble tricksThose of which I have ever heard, the Government cepted the force structure and rejected the stratrecognise egy assessment on which it was based. Times have changed since then and now this concept isever, an idea whose time has come. It is helped, too, by another change in recent defence planning-tha is, the announcement of expenditure of $ 12,000m over 5 years to provide for the defence of Australia which, for thefirsttime,allows the 5-yearrollingprogram to be effective. I hope that the Minister for Defence KiUen) wdl draw the attention of his Cabinet fact, colleagues to the fact that devaluation wiU necessitate an increase in this amount for the equipment to be derived from overseas because the undertaking was that $A12,000m would be in 1976 prices. It is very important that we shouldport not cut back on necessary overseas equipment. When we are providing the defence forces with equipment to do what we have to do on our own it is important that they should be equipped properly but not excessively for thisrole.The forces then might not make an ideal contributionfleet to an allied force but they would be capable doing that which we must do on our own. Thatnot. should be their role. What might the defence forces have to do on their own? Thefirstthing they might have to deal with, of course, is lowthe level threats-suc h as guerillas, confrontation over seabeds, confrontations overrightsof passinfrastructure. age in the air or on sea, or even conceivably the dispatch of an overseas force to prevent taking place in our area events which we would regard as contrary to our interests. In this area find that the White Paper is rather gentle. shows aU the haUmarks of being a committee could document. One remark to which I would Uke to draw attention appears in paragraph 28 of chapter 3 and is as foUows: Our assessments of the international situation have not revealed any present likelihood of our being called upon provide any direct military assistance to associates. Were this son of situation to arise in future, in certain circumstances we would be able usefully to local forces by making available equipments or skills in which they were deficient Well, that is true; but I hope that where necesswe will be able to do a great deal more than provide equipments and skUls, because these opmight be vital to our security and our on our own, if necess-survival. as The second doubt I have about an understateputment in the White Paper concerns Indonesia. I to paragraph 38 of chapter 2, which states: The Indonesian archipelago, together with Papua New would be an important factor in any offensive miliprovided tary strategy against Australia. countries are more than important; they acare vital. Any defence strategy which does not this is not truly founded. I am sure that the Minister for Defence does realise this. HowI think we should state clearly in this House that the Indonesian archipelago is the key to our t defence and we must always recognise that fact. We must, of course, be able to co-operate with our allies. I would like to draw attention to the remarks in the White Paper about the Indian Ocean. They are not overstated, as aUeged by the (Mr honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant). In I think they are a true statement of the situation. I welcome the decision made by this Government to expedite the construction of the naval base in Western Australia. This is a very important step forward. I also welcome the supthis Government has given to the establishment of the base at Deigo Garcia. I do not think anyone in this country wishes to see a confrontation between the super powers in the Indian Ocean, but it takes 4 to 5 years to budd up the infrastructure which makes it possible to base a in that Ocean. The Russians have such an of infrastructure now at Berbera; the Americans do What we should do now is encourage them to budd the infrastructure, to build the base, so that if they need to do so they can base afleetin Indian Ocean. It is no use waiting until the requirement is there to start buUding one's It is very important that this country, as one of the countries most affected, should from make this clear to the Americans. I The other level of threat we must consider is It that of actual invasion. I do not think anyone envisage this at present, except in a situation of world chaos, probably in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange. In our defence planning we should look at this situation. Again I think that the defence White Paper is atittlebland into this area. This is what it says about the possibility our allies or other of a nuclear exchange: Given the enonnousrisksfrom military conflia, ditional calculations the restraints on use of force the 2 powersThat is America and Russiaand the framework of their co-operation should endure. Well, I hope so; but I do not think that is necess-arily arily the belief of either Russia or America. think they take the risks of a nuclear exchange very much more seriously man that, and we mustabout look at what our situadon would be in the after-ern math of such an exchange. I do not beheve that we would be a target, except possibly for North West Cape and installations in central Australia. We would not be a target; we would be a prize. We have to examine what our defence industrialsea. situation would be in the aftermath of such a nu-requirement clear exchange. This is an area which the defenceWe White Paper does not explore, perhaps for secur-volved ity reasons; but I think it is one that we should keep in mind. Despite my strong support for the main thrustquick of the White Paper, I have a number of qualms be destroyed about it-mainl y in areas we have inherited from the role of theby the previous Government, although in other cases they have been going on for some years. am concerned about some of the implications battaUon which are read into the core force. The core more force, as I see it, is the regular force which mustefficient be prepared to deal with the immediate low level threat and which also must be capable of sion to meet a higher level threat. There danger, though, in our staff structure, that core force wdl be equipped with atinynumber ofdeterrent highly sophisticated weapons which would be too elaborate, too expensive and too few for the task the core force would have to do on its ownmarines and which would be an unsuitable basis for the mass expansion that would be required to budd up the major force. I am sure that the Governin ment is aware of this and I beheve that it must take the necessary steps to control this inevitable escalation. Risks must be run in peace as well in war. I also am suspicious of one aspect of the core force when we talk about having this to keep up with the state of the art. It is one way of keepingsoon up with the state of the art, but in many cases it and a wddly extravagant way of doing so. I cite one example: The British invented the tank and between the 2 world wars they kept a core forceand of tanks in operation. The Germans were forbidwhen den tanks by the Versadles Treaty, yet when theto Second World War came they were far ahead. They were able to be in that position because they had studied the subject, they had seconded their officers to other countries such as Russia, particular, to operate with other people, and they on all trahad husbanded their resources. They were able between to expand on a much better basis than a country which had kept a core force in existence. I merely draw to the attention of the Minister for Defence the fact that the state of the art does not necessdictate that we should have a tiny force of I highly sophisticated weapons of every type. I want to refer now to suggestions we hear Army operations on a large scale in northAustralia. I think we get involved in a circular argument. There is no way in which we could maintain, say, a division in northern Australia, except with supply by sea. If we can supply it by sea, that means that we have command of the If we have command of the sea, the for such a large force does not arise. have to be very careful that we do not get inin a circular and totally irrelevant argument. I believe that the role of the Army in northern Australia is to be sufficiently mobde and reacting to cause any potential invading force to concentrate in such a way that it would our maritime forces. This was British Army prior to 1914 and it is I a very proper and effective role for our Army. A there before a landing is very much valuable than a division going there 3 weeks later. We need a small, highly mobUe and Army. expanWith regard to deterrents, on which the is a greathonourable member for Leichhardt (Mr this Thomson) touched, by far the most efficient to an invasion is a submarine force. I draw the attention of the House to a fact that we must consider soon, namely, that any future subwe order almost certainly wdl have to be nuclear powered. There are no diesel electric powered submarines of a modern type avaUable the world now. If we want to get a new type of submarine it wdl have to be nuclear powered. I would like to make a couple of remarks asabout the Department of Defence. I dunk it is well known that I do not entirely approve of the structure. I am deUghted that the Minister has estabUshed the Defence Council. I hope that it will grow into a body established by statute is one which has coUective responsibiUty for all the affairs of the Department of Defence; that its members will be chosen on a functional basis; that the number of professional people on it, its structure is changed, will be appropriate the profession of arms. I would like to say one other thing about the Department of Defence: We seem to be getting an enormously top heavy structure, with deputy secretaries, first assistant insecretaries, and so on. Unfortunately, this is being matched by a simUar rise in the uniformed personnel. One could notfirea revolver down one of the corridors of power at Russell Hill these days without knocking off about 50 stars. If we look at the proportion of senior officer in our Armed Services-that is brigadier and above-w e have one to every 697 men. The Unites States has one to every 2127 men. That country proportionately, has one-third of the number of senior officers we have. I shall take a different example in the trahan setting. In the Second World War we had a Navy of 40 000 and we had 3 admirals and 3 commodores. Now, with a Navy of 16 000 we have 8 admirals and 12 commodores-the e defence times as many. The structure is getting out line. I give one further example: A DDG by the Americans has one commander among the senior officers, while one of our DDGs has one captain and 4 commanders. The reason is that because we have this high structure ashore we have to provide suitable sea bdlets for people of all ranks. The top heaviness of our structure ashore means that it is the tad wagging the dog. think we have to straighten this out in the 3 interests of the efficiency of our Services. If have too many senior officers we wdl become regarded as the army of Oz. Also there are things in junior ranks one can learn and do which people promoted too high can no longer do.",96

176,Dr RICHARDSON,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The quite White Paper on Australian Defence is a sigwas nificant and important document. It marks turning point, or perhaps even a starting point, for modern realistic defence thinking and ning in this country. In thetimeavadable to me, wish to comment on the nature of this thinking coastline. and planning, its importance to Western Australia andfinallywhat is necessary to its realistic effectiveness. .Not since the days between Federation and the First World War has an Austrahan Govern Mr ment intimeof peace, estabUshed a coherent, intelUgent or intelligible defence pohcy. Between the 2 world wars there was simply an empty which was perhaps understandable because memories of the appalling bloodbath of World War I were quickly followed by the depression. the HouseSince the Second World War we called forward defence poUcy based on great mobility, until of course the events in South Asia, and more particularly Vietnam, demonI strated the weakness of this stance. Irrespective of its moraUty, militarily the main problem with this confused thinking was that we did not possess the substance to maintain a worthwhde defence poUcy and even less the capabUity of mobitity to sustain it. In the Ught of these facts, the White Paper is in a sense an apology for the past 30 years of neglect and lack of planning. However, buUding on this impUcit apology the White Paper more importantly now provides the basis for a coAusordinated defence pohcy which is thefirstthat Australia has had since the period of 1901-1914. It is a basis which is surely needed considering the almost complete run down of our national over the last few years. The poUcy is of of course based on the concept of the continental manned defence of the Australian homeland. The pleasing aspect of the White Paper from a Western Australian point of view is that there is recognition that the continent is more than just the south-east corner. There has existed in Australia since the Second World War a Brisbane line mentality. If one doubts what I say one I only has to look at the present deployment of the Services in Australia. It is true that the southwe east corner of the nation contains the majority of the Australian population, but can anyone seriously suggest that an external threat is likely to come from the direction of New Zealand? The White Paper recognises the existence of the north and the north-west. Perhaps in due course it wdl further reaUsed that the most vulnerable place in Australia is the PUbara which has enough basic services to sustain an occupation army, beside its wealth in natural resources. It very pleasing to see that there was a defence a exercise in the Pilbara this year. Western Australia has 2.5 rnillion square ldlometres of planterritory and a population of just over one I mUlion, strung out along 12 500 ldlometres of ensure Mr Armitage- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.

178,Dr RICHARDSON,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"The Pilbara is an Tange, inF.contrast immensely wealthy area containing some of the Brigadier richest deposits of iron ore and other vital minmajor erals in the world. Yet my State, the size of India,the is defended at the moment largely by some 300 men of the Special Air Services Regiment, one considered small patrol boat based at Fremande and a region squadron of Macchi jets at Pearce. Thankfully and rationally the White Paper contains indications of impending improvements to this ludicrous situation. Defence infrastructure and relevant civilian infrastructure are still limited in the north the west. The White Paper recognises this and hopefully recognition of a deficiency step to correcting it. The White Paper further recognises and ranks high in infrastructure development plans the need to develop airfields and patrol craft bases in the more remote areas of Australia, particularly in the north and west. Related to this, and especiaUy welcome, are the plans to develop increased fuel storage the Royal Australian Air Force base at Learby month and to develop the existing, boat bases at Cairns and Darwin. The White Paper further indicates the estabUshment of patrol boat facUities on the north west coast to given cover the gap between Darwm and Cockburn try's defenceWar Sound.

These and other improvements are welcomed in the west as a start in a real pohcy of continental defence. the have a real policy of continental defence our deisfence improvements must be relevant and, above aU, we as a nation must be self-reUant. Western Australians feel isolated and there is real concern wdfully and persis-for defence there. A principal theme of the summer school at the of Western Australia in January 1976 concerned Australia's defence. It was an outsuccess due to the quality of the speakers attracted and the efforts of the director, to Mr John Burman. It was ably chaired by the disAustralian military historian, Peter Firkins. The threat to Australia presented by the speakers varied between the ebb andflowof international politics, as suggested by Sir Arthur to the clear conviction by P. Serong that there would be a conflict between Russia and China within next fiveto ten years and the side effects that would take place as a result. Dr M. Teichmann that the developing nations in the were Ukely to assume communist type pose governments of various shades, but that did not a significant threat to Australia, and that it was a development that Australian governments should accept and learn to live with. He also considered that Australian governments had grossly exaggerated the threat of Indonesia to this counand try and expressed the view that they never had been a threat and were not likely to be in the is the first foreseeable future. Dr Teichmann also expressed the view that the Government of Papua New Guinea was Ukely to dissolve into a series of secessionist northmovements, and the same could well occur with Indonesia during the next 10 years or so. In dealating with the various shades of threats submitted the speakers, the following courses of action interim patrolwere suggested. Dr K. Foley was critical of the lack of direction by Australian governments during the post-World II period as to what the counposture should be. He suggested that no clear and co-ordinated or rational direction had been given, either to the armed Services to the defence bureaucracy, as to what its polor strategic poUcies were. Such lack of direction had very serious consequences in a wide variety of directions, not the least of which the unco-ordinated manner in which the 3 Services still made their equipment prowith Utde or no consideration of the poltiical, strategic or tactical situation. Dr Foley also commented that the Defence Department, whUst probably relatively efficient, was To simply not effective and, as a consequence, the defence planning as presently constituted was in disarray. Dr Robert CNedl was also highly critical of the procurement methods practised by the and armed Services, largely for the same reasons mitted by Dr Foley. Dr 0 'Nedl oudined the variGreat ous options avadable to Australia in the type defence structure most suited to its requirements, ranging from a nuclear deterrent to me use of highly trained irregulars who could be used harass enemy occupation forces. However, he recommended the development of highly trained conventional forces possessing a high technology capacity, backed by effective territorial forces, something that would have to be strongly conAustralia sidered. Dr ONEILL also supported the view that Australia should develop its own highly sophisticated intelUgence services, particularly attuned to the South East Asian area, so that it did not have to rely on information from other countries'our services in this deUcate area. Rear-Admiral A. Synnot outlined the present structure of the Australian armed forces which he regarded as more than a match for any nations in our immediate vicinity. He considered the basic pohcy of core-force experts, who could be used to expand effective forces intimeof threat or general mobilisation, as being best suited to present requirements. Dr M. Teichmann strongly attacked the lack confidence generated by successive Australian governments that had espoused the need to rely on big and powerful friends, and the incapacity of the nation to defend itself, and the resultant breakdown in the wdl of the people being preI pared to defend their country. In more simple terms, this type of political chche has tended destroy any sense of patriotism in the Australian people- a sense that historicaUy has been very strong. In the light of the White Paper, I believe Australia is unlikely to repeat past mistakes relevance. Our defence forces need to be specially geared for continental defence. Withfirst out going through all the improvements listed the White Paper, I believe we are equipping selves in this vein. We simply need more of everything. However, it is self-reUance that the real key. With respect to our alliances, not wish to underplay their continuing imporMinister tance even for a moment. The ANZUS Treaty its will remain an essential element in Australia's defence considerations, but one could not have understated the true position more subtly than the White Paper. I quote: Both countries (the United States and New Zealand) are important to us; but it is prudent to remind ourselves that the United States has many diverse interests and obligations. It is indeed prudent to remind ourselves of that I would suggest that we do so often. By all submeans we should continue to draw on our allies, Britain and the United States, as imporof tant sources of intelligence and assessment of mditary doctrine and defence science and technology. We must continue to rely on them, too, to for advanced weaponry and equipment. Yet it is in this area that I feel we should be looking to supply more and more of our own hard heavy equipment. Not even during World War II, with astotal mobilisation of national resources, was able to approach a position in which supply for its forces came solely from within. The White Paper recognises reaUsticaUy that until a position is reached in which we can supply defence needs from within self-reliance cannot be spoken of with confidence. Put simply, external aggression is not necessary if the object of conquest is being slowly but surely destroyed from within. It is unfashionable to talk of fifth columnists and the adverse effect that their activities are having on Australian security, both internal and external, yet this is perhaps the one deficiency of the White Paper-it s faUure to discuss those in our midst who for traitorous reasons or out of idealistic ideological allegiance to some new Utopian world order would gladly sell us of down the drain for 2 bob. However, the call to increase our defence manufacturing, which I make, wdl bring them out of the woodwork. The victory of one over the other will decide whether Australia can be really self-reUant. have spoken previously in this House on defence, welcoming government initiative to to improve the security of our nation. I have spoken now and wdl speak again on defence in future with more confidence. It is a confidence based on the White Paper which I believe presents a sound basis for this country's defence planning. All that or ir-remains is for us to get on with the job",100
179,Mr SHORT,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"This is the debate on a White Paper on defence that in this Parliament has had for very many years. For ourthat reason I commend the Government for providing the opportunity for such a debate. I also holds commend the Government for the broad thrust I do of the White Paper. I pay a compliment to the for Defence (Mr Killen) for arranging organisation and for being there to listen to the debate tonight. It is a subject on which we in Australia have a very great need for much more pubUc debate and for, I believe, a bipartisan approach to the subject. Speakers from both sides have adopted such a bipartisan approach. am very sorry that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) was gudty of one of the most cynical, hypocritical and childish perforin mances I have ever heard in this House. It be that in terms of Standing Orders he was not guilty of wilful and persistent disruption, anyone who listened to this debate tonight and anyone who read the record of this debate wdl have no doubt that that is precisely what he been wanting to do, what he had doing and what he has been doing throughout this year. (Quorumthe formed.) The quorum that has just been called for simply reinforced what I was saying before The honourable member for Chifley might wantthe to act in this way and to portray his Party in this way, but I do not. I want to talk about some serious matters in relation to want to mention two or three main issues in which I have a particular interest. First, I think it is necessary to quote one very telling phrases from that White Paper cause I think those phrases really determine we ought to approach any debate and further thinking on the subject of defence. I can do no better than quote the first sentence of the Paper: Thefirstresponsibilityof government is to provide nation with security from armed attack and from straints on independent national decisions imposed by threat of such attack. The section of the White Paper which I think very important- I shall come back to it later-i in the introduction and reads: The national defence effort is expensive, and it substantial proportion of the Government's annual ture. Notwithstanding the priority given by the Government to its efforts toreduceinflation omy, it has undertaken to increase the Defence Vote nextfiveyears, the period the Defence Department its forward programming. The other extract from the White Paper that I and private should like to mention, and it is the only other ex-years. tract to which I shall refer, comes from the section where the White Paper discusses the changing world in which we live. It makes what I to be a very telling point when it states: Change does not necessarily mean insecurity. The statement that change does not necessarily mean insecurity is a statement with which totally agree. What I think it means is that we need to have a very close review indeed of basic thinking in relation to our defence posturethe and our defence requirements. It is this aspect that I want to concentrate on tonight very brieflyfence because I think some important issues are more involved. I Firsdy, there is the issue of what sort of preparationtimea nation such as Australia needs if we are under potential threat of attack or conflict the period ahead. People make various estimaymates on this. One can read studies which say that the preparation time and the warningtimeis but a period of 10 years. Not many people say it is more than that, but many do say it is 10 years; others say it is less. I have recently read a study hasanalysing the preparationtime,as distinct from the warningtime-there is a difference between two-of all the major conflicts in the world between 1939 and the mid-1970s. The study init.dicated that the preparationtimeinvolved for countries concerned has been a maximum of about 2 years and 3 months. In fact, many countries have had a considerably shorter preparation the White Paper. Itime than that. I think that turns us to a very significant factor, that is, Australia's own domestic capacity to deor twofend itself intimesof potential danger. I perbesonally have doubts as to how much a country howsuch as Australia is Ukely to come under early threat. But any Parliament that basically ignores this point and the need for preparation is open to Whitevery considerable disputation. Because of Australia's situation in the world we have to look the very closely at our domestic defence capacity. the conMany people say that what we need to have is a the vast array of defence industries. That is a simptistic view because, in my opinion, the greatest deis fence capacity that any nation can have is a ssound and broadly based industrial structure. Too often we separate the economics of developcounts for ament and the development of our manufacturing expendisector from our defence requirements. I believe that the 2 aspects are very closelytied.What that andrevivethe national econover the in turn means to me is the need for a much uses forgreater co-ordination and a much better relationship between the defence sector of our economy, in terms of the Department of Defence, industry than we have had in recent think Like the honourable member for Chifley and others who have spoken in this debate, I am a member of a sub-committee of the Parliament which is looking at industrial backing for Australia's defence requirement. I think we have I all been impressed, as we have moved around Australia looking at this matter, at the lack of our communication which appears to exist between private sector of the economy and those within government who are involved in the deindustry. To my mind there is perhaps no important issue that we need to focus upon, and I hope that the Government wdl do this in the period ahead. I know that it is closely at the matter. There are many other aspects that I to speak on tonight. I know other speakers to participate in this debate, so I shall conclude by saying again that I congratulate Government on the preparation of the White Paper. I beheve that it forms a very useful for public debate, both within and outside Parhament, on the whole subject of defence. I remark. hope that it is the forerunner of a much debate in the period ahead.",101
180,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"There is not a great deal of time left for this debate and lieve that the issues of defence have been fairly well canvassed in this long and protracted cussion. I should like to remind the House that today is one day after the anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbour. A lot has been already by honourable members the House. There are a few old diggers on the other side of the House as well as on this side and, as one who is grateful for his whole think it is reasonable to thank the the other side of the House. Although I have demned some of them in the past, I know that some honourable members opposite have as to much interest in defence as we have on this of the House. We should like to see a bipartisan attitude adopted towards defence, but there are particular reasons why honourable members on all. the other side of the House cannot adopt a bipartisan attitude. These reasons go the past, and honourable members opposite are all too familiar with them. I shall not canvass them now. I emphasise to the House that everything is said in this debate musttieup with pened at Pearl Harbour all those years ago. The fact is that the democracies have ready to defend themselves. No matter what we try to do to convince the Australian people, and even to convince people within this House, this is still the case. I do not want to be the conscience of the peace, but I do not think has been treated with the seriousness that it deserves. It was interrupted severaltimes.There is nothing more serious to which our attention should be directed than the matter of defence. Mr Keith Johnson-You are a warmonger!",103
181,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"Yet there are people on the try other side of the House who always misrepresent our intentions by calling us warmongers, fascists and so on. Mr Keith Johnson-That is right. You love war. looking Mr MARTYR-If wanting to defend this country is being a fascistshould like Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable wish gendeman wdl resume his seat. The honourable simply member for Burke must cease interjecting. the Mr Keith Johnson-He is still a warmonger. basis Mr SPEAKER-Order!

185,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,I require that the question be put never been forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA that this debate Debate resumed.,103
186,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"If I have to accept the epithets from the other side of the House in order to speak about defending this country, I am pleased to do so. Somebody has to do it. Ifi am going to be a target, that is well and good. But somebody has to speak about the problem which this counis facing. We are still unready, even with the White Paper and aU the things it has told us. I approve of aU the things in the White Paper but we are stiU unready for any sort of an attack. We are surrounded by potential dangers. There is no question about the main line of danger to this country. There is no doubt at all that it comes from the communist countries. We cannot do great deal, I suppose, to retaliate against a attack. But there is much that we can do to ensure that we are properly defended within. It seems me that the responsibility of this House and of the people in it is to give the message to the trahan people. Somehow or other we have to get them out of the feeling of apathy which they have at the moment. Mr Keith Johnson-Warmonger .",103
187,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"Mr Speaker, I ask you not to worry about die interjection.",104
188,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,Order! There is too much conversation in the chamber. I remind the House that this is a debate on the defence statement. The honourable member for Swan is speaking. He is entitled to be heard. I do not want to take disciplinary action but if I need to do so then I wdl do it.,104
189,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"I am pessimistic about the whole situation surrounding us. I think colleague from Tangney (Dr Richardson) alluded to a speech by Brigadier Serong, and agree with a great deal of it. I do not think in the position where we can sit back and nothing. We have a tremendous problem. We are alone in this part of the world. It is all well for us to base our present defence ideas being helped by allies. But I think, as the defence White Paper admits, we cannot really rely on anybody. We are on our own, probably for the first time. I think honourable members in the House have to develop a Churchillian attitude matters of defence. Mr Innes-What about Santamaria?",104
190,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,I think Mr Santamaria is anywhere doing a wonderful job. If only honourable memter bers opposite would hsten to him they would better informed.,104
191,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,Order! I want to maintain order in the House. I wdl take care of the jections if the honourable member wdl continue with his speech. If he replies to an interjection encourages a continuation of interjections. I upon him to continue his speech.,104
192,Mr MARTYR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE,"We are on our own. We can no longer rely on anybody. That is the message which everybody in this House, including honourable members opposite, have to take the Australian people. I am a great believer in going about and talking with the people in my electorate. There is no door at which I do not present the case for Australian defence. I can without any equivocation that the people in electorate want the country defended. There is a no doubt about that. When I speak to people as direct individuals I find that they want the country defended. We have to take the message to them to and keep on telUng them just how much it wdl cost and what sacrifices they will have to make. If Auswe do this I believe that we will lay a foundation for the yean of danger which we will face in the terribly alone situation in this part of the world. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. NA Chilean Refugees-Identity Cards-Aircraf t Accident-Aid s for the Deaf-Newspape r Report Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",104
193,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT, I rise this evening to discuss the pUght of Chilean refugees who face deportation at the hands of this my Government. On 18 November the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) I in response to a question which I placed on the we are notice paper some months ago stated that dedo portation orders had been signed against 30 ChUeans who were Ulegally resident in Australia very and that other cases were under consideration. on He further stated that there was no evidence to suggest that those persons would be subject to persecution if they were returned to Chde. The Minister must live in some sort of fairyland and perhaps to the right of that. What he proposes is to the equivalent of sending Jews to Germany in 1940. The members of the ChUean regime will go down in the annals of history as one of the most vicious cliques of people to ever hold power in the world at any time. If the Mmisor anyone in the House is in any doubt about be that they have only to browse through the many totally authoritative reports prepared by Amnesty International. Information made avaUable interin August 1976 suggests that approximately 3800 political prisoners currently are held in he detention in ChUe. This figure includes only call those who can be accounted for. It does not include the number of prisoners who have disappeared since the date of their detention. Between 1500 and 2000 prisoners have disappeared since the mditary coup on 11 September 1973. More than 1000 persons have been detained at some to time or another for political reasons. People continue to disappear and this massive persecution affects a wide spectrum of political say groups as well as large numbers of other my opponents of the government such as lawyers and social workers who are involved in poltiical prisoners and their famUies. The ations ChUean secret poUce-the DINA-ha torture and totalitarian control to a degree of which Goebbels would have been envious. Yet this regime which is one of the most inhuman the world has ever seen even has this House. One honourable member made a speech protecting the regime. He rejected the concept that it was an inhuman regime. I direct Speaker. his attention to the absolute matters of are avaUable. I am sure other speakers wdl supgendeman port me in this.

197,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,"I will withdraw it. Part ofhis derest fence of these butchers consists of the claim the ChUean economy is now recovering. In fact the ChUean Government, under the guidance the University of Chicago, engaged Mr perhaps Friedman to lead it into salvation from its omic situation. It is not my intention to launch into a major discussion of the evils of the current ChUean Government's economic poUcies. What I want to do is to impress upon the Minister",105

203,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT," I have been disturbed in recent weeks as I have noticed from newspaper reports that some State governments are considering the introduction of identity cards. The apphcation of ID cards can go far and wide. I want to convey to the House some of the uses to which various you governments throughout the world require ID cards to be put. They may be required for the simple act of voting. On many occasions they are by poUce. They may be required for security or tax purposes. In one country a not person needs an ID card even to go to school. may be required for travelling in a country or for internal security purposes. I think it is in Laos that they are required for obtaining government rations. ID cards may be requiredforcensus purposes and for a host of other reasons. Some have been introduced simply for the of voting, to identify a voter at the poU, E ut they have been developed within those counas a general identification card. Some couneven require a person'sfingerprints,as well as his photograph, to be set out clearly on the card. In some cases there is the likelihood of arand prosecution if a person fads to carry his that ID card at alltimes.In the United States of America one is not required by law to carry an of ID card at aUtimes,but in that country I, Uke a number of other members in this econchamber, have been called upon to produce an ID card and have even been refused service because of my mabUity to identify myself properly.",105
204,Mr LUSHER,ADJOURNMENT,What about your gold pass?,105
205,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,What a sUly interjection! I ask permission of the Opposition member at die table to have incorporated in a paper prepared for me by the Legislative Reference Service of the ParUamentary Library.

209,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"While the honourable member for Melbourne examines that complex document, I wdl mention that in many instances it traces the history of the initial introduction of ID cards, seemingly for innocent purposes, but their extension later to become as indelible upon a nation's lifestyle and as permanent as a number tattooed upon the citizen's hand. The ills of this nation are of an economic nature and not of internal subversion. In the moments that remain to me I make a plea to all honourable members of this chamber to ensure that they resist any attempt, whether it - DENMARK: be by a State government or by a Federal government, to introduce identity cards. When the day arrives that each and every Austrahan has to carry an ID card this nation certainly will - FRANCE: have lost a lot.

212,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,I would Uke to compUment the Legislative Reference Service on the excellent job it did in the preparation of the document which has been incorporated.,107
213,Mr CHARLES JONES,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE," I wish to raise the question of the need for a full judicial public inquiry into the accident investigation report dealing with the crash of the Connair DH114 Heron aircraft, registered number VH-CLS, which crashed adjacent to the Cairns Airport in Queensland on 23 October 1975. On 6 December I directed a question to the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) and sought and (iii) ID card for those that from him an assurance that a full judicial inquiry would be held. I received a very evasive answer from the Minister who said that the matter would be investigated, that it was being examined and that he would advise me. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the report was prepared in August 1976. That is the date that appears on the report. From then until 6 December 1976, surely the Minister had sufficienttimeto receive advice as to whether a full public inquiry should be held into this incident. It occurred during my time as Minister for to identify the different racial Transport, and at thattimeI indicated to the Department that when the inquiry by the air safety branch had been concluded there would be a full public inquiry into it, because the idea of just die Department holding an inquiry andfindingout as best it can what was the cause of the accident, and then putting the report into a pigeon hole somewhere, is just not good enough. Some years ago there was a crash of an Ansett Airlines of Australia Viscount aircraft at Port Hedland in which a considerable number of people lost their Uves. No inquiry was held. Numerous people wrote to me when I was the shadow Minister for Transport, complaining that no inquiry had been held and wanting to know the circumstances that brought about the deaths of their daughters and sons. Yet the Government of that day was not prepared to go on with it. When my turn came to make decisions on it I said that I beUeved that an marital status. It should be carinquiry should be held. A number of small matters in the report are securworth drawing to the attention of honourable members. If they want to go ahead and read the report, they can do so. First and foremost, the pilot was a man with some 3000 hours experias to their position in the preence. He had made 42 flights from Mount Isa to Cairns, 37 of them at nighttime.He had made 10 instrument landing system approaches, but not one ILS approach, as far as I could make out from the report, had been made in weather ditins similar to those prevailing on that particucommunication lar night, when there was a bad thunderstorm, torrential rain in some parts, heavy rain in parts and light rain in other parts. The pdot officer who was with him was not qualified to the aircraft in question. All that he was able was give radio communication assistance. Eight passengers and 3 crew lost their lives. Three air traffic controllers were rostered for thetimethat the aircraft was scheduled to land at Cairns. Yet two of them had been given permission to leave the control tower. Only one air traffic controller was left in charge of the airport. Page 21 of report reads: Nevertheless, it is considered that greater use of logical surveillance radar facUities should have been by the air traffic control system. There was a heavy storm. If honourable memmagnificent bers look at the map displaying the flight path the aircraft they wdl see that at no stage was aeroplane ever on the correct line of approach and at no stage was it in line with the runway.",107
214,Mr BAILLIEU,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,Why not?,108
215,Mr CHARLES JONES,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,I do not know. That is why I want a full public inquiry. The honouration able member for La Trobe should bear that this report gives no indication whatever why at no stage was the aircraft on line with the instrument landing system. If the honourable member had a look at this map he would see that it is obvious that the pdot was trying to find ILS to as to come in on the correct approach. these circumstances there is a need for a full lic inquiry.,108
216,Mr MCLEAN,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE," I would like to Social speak tonight about a matter that has been tigate whetherof brought to my attention by a number of my conassist possible usersnot stituents. It concerns the possible introducuon by purchases or rentals of these devices. this Government of special telephone services for that these people are just as entided, and use by deaf people. I refer to the Magsat teleably much more entided, and deserving of phone typewriter which is manufactured by the Magsat Corporation. I think the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) menorne tioned this matter during the Estimates debate couple of months ago. I commend him for that. often get the feeling that the deaf people are as well catered for by governments as are other handicapped people. This is partly due to the nature of their disability. For a start, because their affliction, the majority of the prelinqually deaf have to work in unskilled employment and therefore do not have normal earning capacity. Also because the deaf are employable they do not receive any special benefits or concessions from the Department of Social Security. They do not individually possess the capacity to meet the concosts offinancingdevelopments, such as these devices, which would simplify and improve life for the deaf. some Briefly, the devices I refer to are telephones which operate on the teleprinter principle. They fly are small, lightweight and portable. When the to do telephone is connected a display Ught glows mforming the user that the line is open and ready for his call. If the person being called is deaf his telephone ringing mdicator system will activate a flashing light. The device can also attract a hearing person in the normal way. Therefore it can be used for deaf people to communicate with memthe bers of their famdy, their relatives and their friends who do not suffer from this affliction. meteoroOnce this has been done the 2 parties can type to made each other and the letters wiU be displayed simultaneously on both screens. This to my mind is a technological advance designed for of the sole purpose of helping partially to overcome the the difficult communication problem of deaf people. In my representations to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) I was pleased to learn that several of the devices which can be used in this regard are being obtained by Telecom Australia for evaluto assess their suitability for use within the in mind Australian telephone network. I am also informed that some of these types of equipment are fairly costly. I certainly understand that. They represent very sophisticated the electronic advances. The Minister has informed In me that the Australian Telecommunications pub-Commission intends approaching the various social welfare departments-the Department of Security, the Department of Health and the Department Veterans' Affairs-to invesor they will be prepared to financially by subsidising I submit probteleChone services at a by other individuals in society for the cost no greater than that ainstallation and renting costs of telephones. I The Government has a very substantial obtinot gation to provide these services to these handicapped people. If capital costs are very substantial perhaps a pdot scheme could be introduced of linking such telephones to emergency services such as hospitals, potice,firebrigades, and the ambulance services. This could subsequendy be extended, if it is possiblefinanciaUy,to include a communication network between all deaf people and between them and their famUies, relatives and friends. If costs are such as to make the Government equivocate on introducing such a scheme I suggest that it lay faith in the wed deserved reputation the Australian public has raising money for charitable purposes. I emphamost sise that this is essentiaUy a government responsiwas bUity. I ask the Minister to give this project top priority. It would not only greatly benefit 8000 prelinqually deaf people in Australia- I think there are more than 400 in Western tralia-bu t also it would benefit those people who have sustained a severe hearing loss later in shattered Ufe and who cannot use the normal services. I urge the Minister, the Government and this Parliament to take a compassionate on: view in this matter.",108
217,Mr COHEN,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,"On 17 able criticism November I made a strong speech in which I until attacked a member of the Press, Kavanagh, for what I thought at thetimeto be grossly misrepresentative article. I do go into the detads of the matter. The article was about uramum. I had been given misinformation Cairns in a telephone call from Adelaide in regard to the ticised article. The headUne in the article concerned stated that the Caucus had made a decision attacked regarding uranium. It turned out that the person continued: who telephoned me gave me misinformation. It Dr was the shadow Cabinet which made cision regarding uranium. It was later changed by the Caucus. The reason I raise this matter is that Mr Kavanagh on numerous occasions has any written a large number of very distorted articles which are grossly untrue and which are marked by beatups. First of all, let me say that I apologise to Mr Kavanagh for my speech on his article. I have never yet attacked a person in this House without reason. However, Mr Kavanagh wrote a letter me. It was a private letter. He criticised quite strong terms and caUed me a craven coward or something to that effect. I assure this House that whenever I have been wrong I apologise, and I apologise in this case. ever that I do not withdraw my remarks about Mr Kavanagh as a journalist. I was so incensed by him because of a series of articles that were grossly distorted and in many cases untrue. Early of on 22 December 1975 1 was moved by one of the dishonest articles that I have ever seen. It headlined: 'Labor Delays Decision on Leadership*. I was so moved that I sent a telegram to the Mr Kavanagh telling him what I thought of his journalism. I would Uke to go through die article Ausand pick out aU the errors. It reads: The meeting became extremely heated as members of the Labor Party levelled abuse and criticism at some telephone leading figures. This did not occur. It is untrue. The article went It is understood Mr Whidam himself came in for considerfor suggesting he should stay as leader only Mr Bob Hawke, the President of the ACTU, can enter a Mr Trevor Parliament and take over. a That did not occur. There was no criticism of Mr not wish to Whidam. The next section reads: Mr Whidam's supporters hit back with rebukes against Dr and Mr Cameron, the 2 sacked Ministers who criMr Whitlam's leadership after the election debacle. That did not happen. Neither Minister was or criticised at that meeting. The article Cairns was rebuked for stating that Mr Whitlam's the deleadership had been 'elitist'. Dr Cairns did not say that, nor was he rebuked in way. This is typical of the articles which have appeared written by Mr Kavanagh. I said previously that he was a fool or a Uar. I said that anyone who wrote an article which was totaUy fictional and imaginary had to be either a fool or a liar. I could go through the article and pick out more inaccuracies. Though I apologise profusely to Mr Kavanagh for the error I made before I do to not withdraw by one iota my criticisms of his me in journaUstic standards.",109

(3) Will he, if necessary, take steps to amend ensure that the Court abides by section 78 of the Judiciary Act 1903 which provides that parties may appear personally in every Court exercising Federal jurisdiction. Mr Ellicott-the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3)1I have seen the Review to which the question refers. The commentator did without express an opinion that, by the decision, ""natural justice has been offended in the matter of a man's liberty"". The comThe mentator disagreed with the conclusion in the joint judgment of Barwick C.J., Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ. that section NA upon noticewere circulated: 78 of the Judiciary Act does not apply to an appUcant for special leave to appeal to the High Coun. He also disagreed (Question No. 1038) with the view of MCTiernan J. that section 78 only provides a rule of practice and as such is subject to the power conferred on the Justices of the High Coun by section 86 of the Judiciary Act to make rules of court regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. It is not uncommon for a commentator in legal matters to express disagreement with a decision of a court, or with the reasons for a decision. It is not appropriate for the Attorney General to express an opinion, in an answer to a ParUamentary question, on the legal merits of the particular decision of the High Coun. there is any substance in this Having regard to the decision of the High Coun in the case referred to, it must be taken that, as a matter of law, section 78 of the Judiciary Act does not confer on an appUcant for special leave to appeal to the High Court a right to be present personaUy in the Coun and to argue his case on the application for special leave. Whether section 78 should be amended in anyrespectis a matter that wttl be considered by the Judiciary Act Review Committee now examining the Judiciary Act and the Committee will report to me on this matter in due course.

Although the estimate item to which he refers relates not to any one Division of my Department but to all the law to staff engaged on civU aviation operations.

231,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In general, Australia supports the proposals for the reorientauon of the Food and Agriculture Organisation's activities that were placed before and endorsed by the 69th Session of the FAO Council in July 1976. (2) Central to the re-organisation a new technical co-operation programme, which is in the course of formulation, to assist agricultural development in individual countries; and the appointment of FAO country representatives of higher status, which appointments are to be phased in over several years. Steps are being taken to appoint the first of them. These measures are intended to promote decentralisation of activities to the grass roots level. (3) Australia considers the World Food Council to be a potentially valuable body provided it develops in the direction of giving greater attention producing more food in developing countries to meet deficit situations and is able to exert ational organisations and governments through recommendations for action affecting the world food situation. Australia, which sees as one advantage of the International Fund for Agricultural Development the attraction of resources from non-traditional donors, was a co-sponsor of World Food Conference Resolution XIII which proposed the establishment of the Fund and was active in the negotiation of the Agreement whose signature by participating countries will make the Fund operational. In common with a number of other participants, Australia has had doubts regarding the usefulness of the Consultative Group on Food Producuon and Investment in Developing Countries (CGFPI) but agreed at the Third Meeting of the Group, held in Manila in September 1976, that it should continue to function for a further year to enable a better assessment of its role and potential to be made. Australia has consistently supported UNDP's central coordinating and planning role within the UN system. It is the largest multilateral source of technical assistance in the world operating in 147 developing countries and territories. In addition, UNDP is now responsible for coordinating the United Nations multilateral technical assistance program. It also provides important planning and advising services to developing countries which often have not the manpower or expertise to undertake these functions. (4) FAO has close relationships of assistance and advice to these bodies. It is Australian policy to foster this co-operation as the most effective way of achieving satisfactory results. As one aspect of this, FAO collaborates with the World Food Council Secretariat in the preparation of background material and reports for use at meetings of the Council. In regard to the co-ordinating of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, nel resources through existing institutions, mainly for purposes directed to increasing food production in developing countries. It is expected that FAO, together with other international and regional multilateral not insignificant role in the appraisal and execution of projectsfinancedby the Fund. FAO, the IBRD and UNDP are the co-sponsors of CGFPI and share equally the costs of its small secretariat. The three sponsoring bodies are represented at meetings of the Group and prepare studies and information papers on request. FAO, as already indicated, is an executing agency for UNDP and as such FAO is accountable to UNDP in relation to those projects funded by the latter. (S) FAO is recognised as the UN agency having prime responsibility in agricultural matters. It is not always possible to draw afirmline between agriculture and other activities, especially in developing countries where the bulk of the population is rural and a range of measures, not confined to the strictly agricultural, is necessary to promote development and the betterment of the Uves of the people. The involvement of a number of organisations is necessary to ensure access to requisite skUls and the existence of several organisations tends to tap wider sources of aid for development. are the development of However, it is a constant consideration of governments, including the Australian Government, to ensure that overlapping and dupUcation of functions by bodies within the UN System are minimised. Within the System there is machinery for inter-organisation consultation and coordination. As a means of seeking maximum efficiency under changed and still changing conditions, the whole framework within which the economic and social activities of the UN System are carried out is currently under review. to the fundamental matter of Diplomatic Passports a substantial influence on oper(Question No. 1521)",116
232,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon nodce: (1) Can he say which countries issue diplomatic passports to Members of Parliament representing their country at meetings of the (a) United Nauons General Assembly, (b) Inter-Partiamentary Union and (c) Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. (2) If so, which countries do so, and why are Members of the Australian Parliament not accorded simUar status by the Australian Government as is accorded by countries such as Canada, Austria, Sweden and others.  member's quesuon is as follows: (1) and (2). The information requested in this question is not held in my Department. To attempt to collect and collate the considerable detail involved, given existing staffing and financial restraints, would not be practicable. Goods Purchased for Government Use (Question No. 1565) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Are the relative total costs of purchases of goods, for Government use, in (a) Australia and (b) overseas assessed by the Treasury. (2) If so, are related costs taken into account, such as payment of unemployment benefits and loss of revenue to persons and businesses whose employment and business profitabUity are affected by orders placed outside Australia. it is intended that it will chan(3) If assessments are not made, how does the Government assess the actual cost of saving to revenue involved in acceptance of the lowest tender price. organisations, will have a Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) The relative total costs of purchases of goods for Government use are not assessed by the Treasury. Each purchasing authority is required to compare costs involved in competing tenders for Australian and overseas goods and notionally to add customs duty to the prices in tenders offering overseas goods. (2) and (3) Given the scope of Commonwealth Government purchasing it is quite impossible for all indirect costs and benefits to be computed as a matter of routine when considering competing tenders. In the processes leading to the establishment of the tariffs (which as indicated above are notionally applied to tenders offering overseas goods) the Industries Assistance Commission and the Government do of course take many such broader considerations into account. Additionally, I would refer the honourable member to the Prime Minister's press release of 1 October 1976 about Government purchasing policy. That statement indicated that, while the basic principle of best value for money spent should continue generally to apply to Government purchases, the Government recognises that special circumstances can exist in which preference should be given in favour of Australian production. A Committee of Ministers has been established to examine cases in which evaluation by purchasing authorities, on the basis of best value for money, would lead to goods being bought overseas. The Committee will consider whether purchase from Australian sources would assist a depressed industry or area within Australia, or enable the establishment, development or retention of industrial or technological capabilities required for reasons of national security or independence. Private Investment Mr Les MCMahon asked the Treasurer, upon Kenya notice: With reference to his statement of 6 November 1976, how Madagascar does he expect the economic recovery to bring about a Mali greater private investment which the Government claims is Mauritius necessary for economic growth.

(2) Which countries have ratified or acceded covenant, and on what dates.  member's question is as follows: (1) The question of whether Australia should ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is presently under consideration. There have been no consultations with the State Governments as yet, but before a decision is taken whether to ratify the Covenant, the Government will discuss with them implementation of the obligations in the Covenant The subject matter of many of these obligations comes within the jurisdiction of the States.
