4,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark from 12-17 September 1994. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, often collectively described as the Baltic States, have only recently emerged from Soviet domination. The delegation's visit was the first by a parliamentary delegation since independence was regained in 1991. The delegation was impressed by the progress made in each of the countries since then. Each has established a system of parliamentary democracy, and significant steps have been taken on the economic front and in the international arena. Nonetheless, there are significant challenges facing the Baltic States, some common to all three and some specific to the respective countries. The transition to parliamentary democracy has been accompanied by the election of a multiplicity of parties to the respective parliaAustralia's ments. This has resulted in considerable instability in government. Indeed, while the delegation was there, Latvia was between governments and, since our return, the government in Estonia has fallen. The situation is further complicated in both these countries by the significant number of residents who are not yet enfranchised. The right to vote is of course linked to citizenship, which has been a contentious issue in each of the countries. In the economic sphere, there are considerable problems. Restructuring has resulted in a high level of unemployment and significant social stress. As the delegation travelled through rural areas, we were particularly struck by the obvious effects on the agricultural sector. Large tracts of excellent farming land were lying idle, as collective farming has not yet been replaced by a viable alternative. Relations with Russia dominate the foreign political relationships of each of the Baltic states. While troop withdrawal has now been achieved, the departure of those troops has left its own legacy. From the security perspective there is concern, particularly in Estonia and Latvia, that former Russian troops now resident in these countries could form a potential fifth column for the Russians in case of need. Environmentally, significant degradation has been experienced in each country as a result of the Soviet occupation. Economically, all three countries are dependent for their immediate future on trade with Russia and, in the case of Latvia and Lithuania, for their energy supplies. Substantial effort has been put into establishing productive trade links elsewhere. Considerable importance is correctly attached to inter-Baltic and Baltic-Nordic cooperation, but emphasis is also given to consolidation of relations already established with the West. All three countries aspire to membership of the European Union in the longer term. The delegation greatly appreciated the hospitality extended by the chairs and members of the Riigikogu, the Saeima and the Seimas. The warmth of feeling between us was indicative of the links between our countries which have been fostered by Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian communities. We returned to Australia with a greater apprecIatIOn of what has been achieved since 1991. There is still a long way to go, but the commitment is there to look forward, and that is a prerequisite for a bright future. At the conclusion of the bilateral visit to the Baltic states, the delegation travelled to Copenhagen for the 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Conference. The conference was well organised and, from the Australian delegation's perspective, very successful. Australian delegation members were received warmly, the Australian viewpoint was valued and, in particular, the proposal of the Australian delegation was accepted as a supplementary item for deliberation at the conference. The supplementary item proposed by Australia was the implementation of commitments agreed to in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. I was pleased to be appointed to chair a committee to draft a resolution on the item. The committee successfully achieved agreement on a resolution for presentation to the conference. This resolution, which drew heavily on that prepared by Australia in advance of the conference, was subsequently adopted by the full conference without amendment. The focus on Uruguay Round commitments was supplemented in the general debate by speeches from the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Calvert, and me. Senator Calvert's speech concentrated on agriculture while I addressed the outcome for services of the Uruguay Round. The other agenda items addressed by the conference were entitled 'Strengthening national structures, institutions and organisations of society which playa role in promoting and safeguarding human rights' and 'International cooperation and national action to support social and economic development and efforts to combat poverty' . In this regard the other members of the delegation played a very active role in presenting views during the presentations on those items. A number of other meetings were held during the conference, but in particular I would like to thank the members of the delegation-Senator Calvert and Senator Woodley, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-for their commitment to a very full program. I also thank the delegation secretary, Anne Hazelton, for her professionalism, attention to detail and unfailingly cheerful assistance to us all. I would also like to thank Geraldine Skinner from my staff. I also record our appreciation of the assistance provided by ambassadors Robert Merrillees and John Burgess, the Australian embassy staff in Stockholm. and Copenhagen, the Parliamentary Library and the Canberra based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the invaluable briefings they provided to the delegation. I commend the report to the House.",11

Delegation· to Southern Africa",12
9,Mr HUMPHREYS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to southern Africa, July 1994. In July 1994 I had the honour of leading a delegation from this parliament to southern Africa visiting Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The visit came at a time of significant political change in the region. This change is symbolised most markedly. by the establishment of a non-racial government in South Africa led by President Nelson Mandela following the April 1994 election. The delegation believes that Australia, because of the high regard in which it is held in the region, due to a large degree to its opposition to apartheid, is in a position to make a positive contribution to the development of democracy in the region. I should add that Australia's opposition to apartheid has been totally bipartisan, and I would like to mention the role played by successive Prime Ministers-Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating-and pay a special tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. The delegation has formed a number of conclusions about Australia's relationship with the region and puts these forward for consideration by both the Australian government and the Australian parliament. Unfortunately, however, at this crucial time on the road to democracy the financial resources available to AIDAB are at an all-time low. The delegation is convinced that Australia is making a positive contribution to the improvement in living standards in the region. Countries in the region are not seeking vast amounts of aid from Australia; however, aid from Australia is important to the region because Australia possesses expertise which can make a significant impact in particular areas, including health, education, housing, agriculture and sports development. . The report lists a number of areas in which the delegation believes that Australia make a contribution. The aid program should focus on the transfer of Australian expertise to countries in the region. The delegation believes this can best be done by sending Australian experts to the region to advise and train, and by the training of personnel from the region in Australia. While the delegation appreciates that Asia-Pacific region is the main focus of Australia's aid program, it is important that the positive contribution which Australia can make in southern Africa, and indeed whole of Africa, should not be lost sight of. The delegation is firmly of the view that Australia's aid program to the region should not be decreased and indeed a persuasive can be made for it to be increased. On behalf of the Presiding Officers of the Australian parliament, the delegation had the honour of formally inviting .each parliament to send a delegation to Australia. The invitations were.· warmly received and have been accepted by Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa, all of whom will visit in the first half of 1995. I understand a favourable response is expected from Namibia. The delegation wishes to make particular mention of the hospitality extended to it in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana, where its visit was hosted by the respective parliaments. The three parliaments were extremely generous hosts, both in relation to the comprehensive meeting programs which were organised and in providing the delegation with the opportunity to visit areas such as Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and Etosha in Namibia. The delegation also greatly appreciated the hospitality shown to it by the South African parliament during its visit to Cape Town. . The delegation met with officials on several occasions prior to departure for discussions and briefing. The delegation would particularly like to express its appreciation to the officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AIDAB, Austrade and the Parliamentary Library who participated in these meetings and who also contributed to . the written briefs. The delegation particularly appreciated the opportunity to meet both before departure and on return with the South can African and Zimbabwe High Commissioners-His Excellency Mr Steyn and His Excellency Professor Patel. The delegation wishes to thank the high commissioners for their valuable input to the delegation's program and also their helpful comments on our visit. Much of the planning, coordination and administrative work associated with the visit the was undertaken by the Parliamentary Relations .Office. The delegation would like to record its appreciation of the efforts of the Parliamentary Relations Office in the preparathe tion of an excellent program. During the visit, the delegation was given comprehensive oral briefs and further briefing material by staff of the Australian High case Commissions in both Zimbabwe and South Africa. They were also involved in making administrative arrangements for the visit. The delegation records· its appreciation of the support given to it by the respective Australian High Commissioners and staff-in Zimbabwe, Mr Kerry Sibraa, a distinguished former President of the Senate, who has had a long interest in Africa; and, in South Africa, Mr Ross Bums. The delegation wishes to make particular mention of the quality of the briefings provided by the post in Zimbabwe. I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the delegation-Senator John Coulter, Senator Dee Margetts, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis):-for their support jn what was an extremely interesting and informative visit. I should pay particular tribute my deputy leader, Ms Trish Worth, for her invaluable assistance. Also, I want to make special mention on behalf of the delegation of the very hard  available at any hour of the day or night to assist the delegation. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Alan Fewster from the South African desk at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Mr Speaker, I commend the report to the House.",12

Delegation to France and the European Institutions  Speaker, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary .delegation to France and the European institutions, September-October 1994. The report provides a detailed record of our visit and achievements. At the outset I should say that I was privileged to lead a delegation that was single-minded in its efforts to represent Australia and advance our interests. The harmonious, cooperative and productive approach taken by all delegation members ensured that the visit was both rewarding and enjoyable. I wish to record my personal thanks to the deputy leader, the honourable member for to Indi (Mr Lieberman), who is in the House this afternoon, for his highly valued support, and to our colleagues, the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Senator Minchin. We also appreciated the pleasant company of Anne Fitzgibbon, Marjorie Lieberman and Kerry Minchin. In the short time that I have available here I would like to make some brief comments on matters set out in more detail in the report. The delegation's visit to France provided a further opportunity to enhance the bilateral relationship and friendly relations which exist between the French and Australian parliaments .. It also enabled us to gain a better understanding of one of the larger member states of the European Union. The Strasbourg sector of the delegation's visit to the European institutions was marked by strong expressions of interest from the Council of Europe for closer cooperation with Australia in the future. The possibility of Australia obtaining observer status at the Council of Europe is one avenue which the delegation has recommended should be explored. Whilst in Strasbourg the delegation had a major role in two initiatives which will enable Australia to make a stronger impact at the Council of Europe. Firstly, we responded positively to the proposal that the delegations from the Asia-Pacific appoint a co-rapporteur to assist in the preparation of the report and resolution on OECD activities by the Economic Affairs and Development Committee. The delegation strongly recommends that Australia vigorously pursue the opportunity to fulfil this role in 1995. If the role is to be taken seriously it may require a degree of continuity amongst the delegation. Secondly, the delegation was instrumental in developing a strategy for the establishment of an Asia-Pacific group comprising parliamentary delegations from OECD member countries which are not members of the Council of Europe. The purpose of the group is to achieve more effective representation by cooperating on amendments affecting our region and indeed, where possible, presenting a regional perspective. Australia's relations with the EU are of major importance, especially in economic terms. The creation of a single market offers substantial new trade and investment opportunities for Australian companies. There was also evidence of a marked rise in interest by the EU in the Asia-Pacific. There are obviously many people to thank for their contribution to the success of the visit and the report acknowledges their efforts and records our thanks to those involved. However, special mention should be made of our ambassadors to the OECD, France and Belgium and the European CommunityTrevor Boucher, Alan Brown and Ted Pocock-for their excellent support. I am sure all delegation members would wish me to join in acknowledging the significant roles played by Alice Gay, who looked after us so well during our entire visit to France, Jean-Louis Schroedt-Girard from the French Senate for his tireless efforts especialtogether ly at La Grande Motte, Leo Cruise for his assistance at the Council of Europe's debate on the OECD, Ted Knez for his special efforts in both Strasbourg and Brussels, and Meg Pocock for her valued support which was appreciated by all of us, especially the accompanying spouses. The report I have tabled clearly demonstrates the benefits of regular contact with European parliamentarians and officials and I makes some significant recommendations to strengthen Australia's role at the Council of Europe and add value to future delegation visits. As my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) would say, by any measure the visit was a big success. I would also like to express on my own behalf, as well as the committee's, our appreciation to Michael Salkeld, the secretary of the delegation, for his valued contribution and input to the success of the delegation. I commend this report to the House.",14

NA Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade .. Committee Report",15
15,Mr HALVERSON,COMMITTEES,"Casey) (12.51 p.m.)On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, incorporating a minority report, entitled A review of Australia:SO efforts to promote and protect human rights, with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
16,Mr HALVERSON,COMMITTEES,"I have great pleasure in presenting to the House the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled A review of Australia:SO efforts to promote and protect human rights. In the brief time available to me today, I can only hope to touch on one or two aspects of the report. Human rights encompasses an enormous range of issues, from the very basic rights, such as the right to liberty and freedom from torture or arbitrary imprisonment, through to rights of freedom of expression and freedom of association. Australia's commitment to human rights is widely acknowledged. But, as with every aspect of human endeavour, there is still some room for improvement. The committee, in its recommendations, noted that there was room for great parliamentary involvement. I am particularly pleased to note that in relation the treaty process, for instance, the government has decided to table treaties and debate the issue in the parliament before signature. The matters raised during this inquiry have been very wide ranging, covering philosophical and legal questions of international law, the complexities of the United Nations human rights system, reform of the United Nations, bilateral relations and regional affairs and place of human rights. We have also examined domestic poliCy on matters as diverse as peacekeeping, aid and human rights and questiqns of Australian compliance relating to indigenous people, women, children and workers. Issues of federal-state constitutional balance and whether a bill of rights is needed were also canvassed. The report contains chapters, dealing with the United Nations, the Australian human rights framework, aid, trade and human rights, peacekeeping, indigenous people's rights and issues of minority rights and self-determination, to name just a few. As well as examining the core matters set out in the committee's terms of reference, there was also a constant stream of requests for representation on human rights matters relating to individuals and groups, both in Australia and abroad. Many of these situations were particularly tragic and a number have been commented on in this report. The committee makes no claim to have examined all human rights problems throughout the world, as this is clearly beyond our capacity. However, submissions dealing with specific examples were considered carefully and were treated as representative of the types of human rights problems that occur, rather than as a definitive list of such abuses. It is a credit to all of those on the subcommittee that such a high level of unanimity was reached on such a report. The report makes some 63 detailed recommendations, far too many for me to detail here.' They include: proposing that the government explore with regional countries the possibility of establishing a regional dialogue on human rights through a range of mechanisms; urging the Australian government to promote, during debates on the reform of the United Nations, a discussion of the creation to of a United Nations parliamentary assembly to monitor, among its responsibilities, human rights practices on a regular basis; recommending that the government reinstate the regular human fights reports from all Australian diplomatic posts, and urging the government to make provision, in resources and training, for officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry out the task; and recommending that AIDAB include the a human rights impact statement in all their development assistance project proposals. A series of recommendations also flow from the subcommittee's visit to several Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. Australia has often been criticised in the past for its treatment of our indigenous people. Many of Australia's indigenous people live in conditions which meet neither our commitment to them as fellow human beings nor our obligations under the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. These conditions are markedly below even those of the poorest 'other' Australians. The visit to the Northern Territory in March 1994 confirmed the difficulties faced by the communities visited, and the need for urgent work to upgrade substandard conditions that exist. Recommendations are also made on a number of specific cases such as those of Mr James Peng, detained in China, and Mr Semyon Livshits, currently in detention in Vladivostok. This is the second report the committee has produced on the subject of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights. The first was tabled in the previous parliament in 1992. It has been particularly noticeable that there has been an increase in the level of debate on the Australian government's policies on human rights. The work volume of the human rights subcommittee also reflects this. The volume of submissions to the committee has increased greatly over the two inquiries--:-from 88 in the first to 140 in the second-and the number of requests for meetings by various community groups has created an enormous increase in the workload. The committee feels that its current structure and resourcing is inadequate to the task of dealing with the subject of human rights, and has therefore recommended that the human rights subcommittee be made a separate. joint committee of the parliament, a recommendation which I heartily endorse. This report is the result of 18 months of hard work by members of the human rights sUDcommittee, and I would like to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the members of that subcommittee, so ably led by Senator Stephen Loosley. This most comprehensive report bears testament to their efforts and their commitment to human rights. I would also like to thank the secretariat staff, in particular the subcommittee secretary, Margaret Swieringa, for their assistance to the committee during the inquiry. I commend the report to the House. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue. my remarks. Leave granted.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Transport, Communications and Infrastructure  p.m.)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the following reports of the committee together with the minutes of proceedings: Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics-the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and infrastructure; I Review inquiry into ship standards and safety; and Efficiency audit review: The national highway-Lifeline of the nation. Ordered that the reports be printed.  Sydney 2000 Olympics deals with the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and infrastructure. In its white paper on employment and growth of 4 May 1994, Working Nation, the government announced its decision to accelerate development of Badgerys Creek airport by constructing a runway capable of handling landings and take-offs of major aircraft. This decision has overtaken the iinportance of the inquiry. However, the question of whether Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport can cope with the 2000 games is still relevant. If it cannot, then the commissioning of Badgerys Creek airport-now called Sydney West airport-well before the games, is vital. . Can SKSA cope with the 2000 games? The conclusion of the committee is that it cannot. There is a prima facie case that the domestic terminal capacity at SKSA will not be able to cope with busy hour passenger movements in the Olympic year. The worse case scenario has to be avoided. The worse case will emerge if construction of Sydney West airport falls behind schedule in the late 1990s, leaving insufficient time to increase domestic terminal capacity at SKSA for the 2000 games. The committee has devised two strategies to avoid the worse case. Firstly, it asks the government to set target dates for the completion of the various stages of the Sydney West airport, and to publish that information. The second strategy requires a study, commencing about June 1998, to review the capacity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport to cope with forecast passenger movements for the Reports year 2000 and beyond. Appropriate recommendations have been made. In December 1992, the committee tabled its report into ship safety, entitled Ships of shame. This report received extensive support and coverage, in Australia and internationally. The committee considered the issues raised in the Ships of shame report to be important, and asked the Minister for Transport for a reference to monitor responses to its recommendations and developments in ship safety during the 37th parliament. The committee received the reference in December 1993, and is pleased to report that there has been improvement in several areas of ship safety regulation. The failure of some flag states to meet their International Maritime Organisation convention responsibilities is a serious ship safety issue. The IMO has established a flag state implementation subcommittee to examine the difficulties associated with this issue. The committee believes that non-compliance with convention requirements will not be properly addressed until the IMO has the ability to penalise flag states which do not comply. The committee has recommended along these lines. The operations of classification societies are also under scrutiny. The IMO has introduced set requirements which classification societies acting for flag states have to meet. Also, the International Association of Classification Societies has introduced several measures aimed at improving the quality of classification society services, including, for example, enhanced survey requirements. Crews are still being maltreated and abused on some ships. The government did not accept the Ships of shame recommendation that ships provide proof of compliance with the provisions of ILO 147. In this report, the committee calls on the government to reconsider its opposition to this requirement. The committee suggests that ships which are found not to comply with ILO 147 should be denied use of port loading and unloading facilities until deficiencies have been rectified. While Australia enforces ILO 147 standards, it has not ratified the convention. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government expedite the ratification of ILO 147. . The government also did not accept the Ships of shame recommendation requiring compulsory insurance cover for ships calling at Australian ports. The committee believes that the government should reassess its response to this recommendation. The use of port loading and unloading facilities should be denied to ships without insurance cover which are found to have entered Australian ports. In consultation with the committee, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has redesigned its publication of monthly port state control information, to make it more easily understood by the public and the media, and is widening its distribution. The publication of port state control information is important for two reasons. Firstly, it highlights the owners, managers and charterers of substandard shipping and the flag states which protect them. Secondly, it gives a clear indication to those associated with substandard shipping that they will eventually be caught. To help improve the effectiveness of Australia's port state control program as a deterrent, the committee has recommended that AMSA produce a set of performance indicators based on domestic regions. The committee believes that further improvement in ship safety standards is best achieved by adopting a package of measures aimed at improving the performance of the major players in international shipping-flag states, chi.ssification societies, ship owners and mariagers, charterers and cargo owners. The committee considers that recerit initiatives at the IMO, the improvements in classification society services and increased port state control activity will improve ship safety. The committee will present its final report on ship safety to the parliament by the end of 1995.",17

22,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled Application of modern technology to committee proceedings, together with the minutes of the proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
23,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On 26 May 1994, the Speaker wrote to the committee asking it to consider the possible applicatioby committees of modem technology in fulfilling their functions, particularly in respect of the electronic collection of evidence-for example, through videoconferencing and teleconferencing. There is a large number of possible uses for technology by committees-for example, in the way material is communicated among members and the way information may be gathered. . The committee decided that the use of technology for these kinds of administrative and informal purposes was a matter for each committee to decide, based on its need and the resources available. The inquiry was - herefore rest-icted to the use of technology In the gathenpg of formal evidence and· in being conducting meetings. As well as written submissions, we were able to draw on the experience of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for s?me first-hand views of the advantages and dIsadvantages of using videoconferencing and teleconferencing techniques. We concluded that modem technology offers the opportunity for increased flexibility and effectiveness in the way committees work. We felt they should be able to use that technology in appropriate circumstances. H-wever, it is important that the quality of eVIdence and the importance and dignity of committee proceedings be maintained. The committee has suggested that a number of conditions be placed on the use of technology to ensure that this happens, at least while new techniques are being tested and learned. Taking evidence by electronic means requires committee members to develop a whole new set of skills, and these skills will take some time to acquire. The Procedure Committee hopes that, as technologies develhave op and change, the House and its committees will be able to harness the best aspects them to make their committee work more effective and efficient, without jeopardising the value of the good work that our commitopportunity tees consistently produce. The Procedure Committee also wants to place on record its appreciation of the assistcess ance provided· by Robyn Webber and Peter Fowler, both of whom acted as secretary to the committee, and the high level of personal commitment and professional competence which they and their colleagues applied to this inquiry and to the report.",19
24,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I rise speak briefly on the report of the Committee and support the comments made by its chairman, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). As a member from Western Australia who travelled overwitnesses night last night on the midnight horror to here, I could well understand that there is, us say, the push to try to change the procedable ures of committees to use modem to allow for more widespread taking of evidence around the nation. It is a first-class move towards giving some of those who live in . outlying districts a greater say in the activities of the federal parliament-and of course the committees are a very important part of that. In relation to the Parliamentary Privileges Act, one of the considerations which the chairman would no doubt have liked to talked about, had he had time, would have been whether evidence that is taken remotely is covered by parliamentary privilege. The clerk has given an opinion to the effect that that is the case only for that evidence that is taken within Australia's jurisdiction. Evidence that is taken remotely from overseas, of course, would not be subject to the Parliamentary Privileges Act of Australia, and that means that people concerned would be subject to the defamation laws that are applicable those cases. Then there is the matter of time constraints. Under most circumstances in a normal operatleave ing committee hearing the chairpeople, beresumed. cause of the human interaction there and then, the opportunity of playing by ear to a certain extent and of allowing people to have of a requisite amount of time to raise pointsthat is, on the part of the committee members-and, in the case of witnesses, the of allowing for the proper flow of questions to witnesses. When dealing with a very expensive prosuch as teleconferencing more discipline is required on the part of a committee. There is going to be a lot more pressure on committee chairpeople to make sure that not only members of the committee are able to ask the questions that they require but also the witnesses themselves are given the opportunity to of being able to respond properly and in a Procedure logical and sequential manner. The other aspect is that there will be a requirement to plan more carefully in the case of remotely taken evidence to ensure that are brief or succinct in their comget ments and come to the. point as quickly as let possible so that members of the committee are to get the information required and ask technology questions appropriately. Finally, in view of the mixed response we had from the government in relation to the last committee report of the Procedure Committee, I can only urge the government in its response to support the recommendations of the committee fully.

28,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled is a review of the implementation Commonwealth, state and territory governwealth, ments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custhrust tody. The vast majority of the 339 recommention dations of the royal commission were supportand ed by governments. The Commonwealth lowing supported 338 of the 339. This royal commission was established 1987 in response to a growing public concern that deaths in custody of Aboriginal people were too common and public explanations were too evasive to discount the possibility that foul play was a factor in many of them. The royal commission found that the main reason so many Aboriginal people were dying has expired. in custody was that they were grossly overrepresented in both police and prison agreed to: custody. It was this overrepresentation which led to the high number of deaths, as the rates suspended of deaths in custody for indigenous and nontion indigenous prisoners were comparable. Much of the royal commission's its recommendations were directed towards reducing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in custody. Despite considerable outlays in excess of $100 million from Commonwealth to date, the incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has increased substantially when it should decreasing. This is a prime performance indicator on which the royal commission implementation can be readily assessed. The performance on this measure has been ling. The royal commission recommended that annual reports be made on the implementation of those recommendations accepted by govcess. , ernments. The committee saw it as of major importance to pay particular attention to the process of monitoring the implementation. Report The committee is quite critical of the lack of both comprehensiveness and effectiveness in the monitoring processes. In many instances, the annual reports gloss over deficiencies in the implementation, give responses which are irrelevant to the particular recommendation in some cases, give responses which are quite false. Recommendation 78 concerning the extension of aerodrome services to Aboriginal by communities was supported by the Commonbut action by the Department of Transport has been directly opposite to the of the recommendation. Recommenda110 called for a national study of prepost-release schemes for prisoners, folconsultations with relevant Aboriginal organisations. DEET said that the study had in been completed and that widespread consultation had been undertaken. In reality, only a preliminary study had been undertaken, with virtually no consultation.",21
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! In accordance with standing order 101, the time allotted for presentation of reports Motion (by Mr Duncan)-by leaveThat so much of standing and sessional orders be as would prevent the time for presentaof committee and delegation reports and statements on those reports being extended until report and 1.20 p.m. this day.",21
30,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"Similar deficiencies were noted in state and territory reports. The royal commission made several overarching recomthe mendations which urged consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations at all stages of the implementation be process. The royal commission also sought the maximum involvement of indigenous organis-tions in the delivery of consequent programs. The committee found that both of appalthese recommendations had been poorly implemented. It is clear that a more effective system is needed to monitor the implementation proA number of witnesses referred to the problem of governments monitoring themselves. A key deficiency is the lack of any critical analysis of the implementation. More in-depth analysis is needed, rather than the mere collation of responses from various agencies which have constituted most of the implementation reports. The committee has recommended a separate and independent monitoring and evaluation unit be established under the Office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, to independently monitor the implementation processes of Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The committee has concentrated on those recommendations directed to the diversion from custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Most states and territories have decriminalised public drunkenness in line with the royal commission's recommenout, dation. Queensland and Victoria have been rather unacceptably slow to implement this recomineffective mendation. In many places, drinking has replaced public drunkenness as a standard charge for removing Aboriginal people from the streets. This is an unacceptable substituthe tion. The royal commission recommended that arrest be used as a sanction of last resort. Evidence indicates that this recommendation is not being properly implemented in most jurisdictions. The royal commission recomcontribution mended against charging people for offensive language in situations where contact is initiatStrait ed by the police. This recommendation is not being fully implemented- Many of those still being arrested for offensive language also end up with other charges such as resist arrest assault police officer, by the time they arrive at the police station. This is quite contrary the thrust of the royal commission's mendations. The royal commission made recommendaI move: tions to address the disadvantages faced by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people court. Many of these recommendations have not been fully implemented. The Commonwealth has been inexcusably slow in implementing the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission on the recognidebate tion of Aboriginal customary laws. People's basic human rights are breached daily, with cases being heard where the defendant has little or no fluency in English, yet no interpreter is provided. On the crucial question of police-Aboriginal relationships, significant improvements have been made in many areas. However, a number of places with significant Aboriginal populations have still not established effective community policing mechanisms. Many of these places were mentioned in the royal commission report as being over-policed or having poor police-Aboriginal relationships. The royal commission warned against policing priorities being based solely on nonAboriginal perceptions, without consultation with Aboriginal people. The committee heard of, and visited, towns that are still grossly overpoliced. As the royal commission pointed this frequently increases the crime rate than reduces it, yet this inefficient and policing continues owing to poor in public management by senior police. On the referral of this inquiry in March, the committee agreed that it would report before end of the year. It has been no mean feat to review 12,000 pages of evidence, to travel around Australia talking to as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as possible, and then to prepare this substantial report in that time. I want to acknowledge the of all those people who gave evidence, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Islander individuals and groups.",21

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Hawker.",22
34,Mr HAWKER,MOTOR VEIDCLE STANDARDS,"I present the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 1994. I am indeed introducing this bill again and I make no apology for that because I think it is about time the government woke up to what is going on around it. This is just another example of a government trying to overlegislate. We have had the design rule change in for nearly 2'12 years and there is still no evidence to show that it is fact contributing to road safety. Within the short time available I would like to quickly list some of the reasons why I think the government ought to be looking because very closely at this private member's bill agreeing not only to debate it but also to pass it through this house. What the bill specifically does is to remove the need for all new motorcycles to be hard wired with the headlight on-in other words, for the headlight to come on every time the engine is started. To start with, this has very strong opposition from motorcycle groups throughout Australia, particularly riders have had a lot of experience in riding motoralong cycles on the road-people who ought to probably know, people who have got the experience. I as well. would like to list nine reasons why I think this should be supported and the rule reaction pealed. First of all, there is no conclusive evidence either in Australia or overseas, that by compulsory lights on we do anything to improve the safety of motorcyclists or other road users .. Secondly, there is no doubt that there was lack of real consultation with the motorcycle groups by the government at the time it rushed this through. It was merely wanting to be seen to do something for the sake of doing something. Thirdly, the government's action removes t?e discretion of the motOJ;cycle rider. It really should be the decision of the rider whether or not to have lights on. No-one is arguing that there are times when it is advantageous to have them on, but it should be the decision of the rider. There are many experienced riders who will argue that there are situations where it is downright dangerous to have the light hard wired on. The fourth area of concern is the question of liability. No matter what reassurances the government might like to give, there is sooner or later going to be a case where, after an accident, a motorist is going to claim that the light was not on and, because of the smashed up motorcycle, the rider is not going to be able to prove the matter either way. There in will be some question about who is liable for the accident and who is liable for damages. The fifth reason is that the measure could very easily add to a false sense of security, obviously, if riders are led to believe and that having the light on somehow is going to make them safer, they could be more inclined to take risks when they should not. The sixth reason is the sheer stupidity of the requirement for many applications for motorcycles today. Every farmer who buys an ag bike that can be registered has to buy a bike with a hard wired light. It is just nonsense riding around the paddock with a light who on all day. If people happen to be idling behind a mob of sheep or cattle, then they are going to flatten the battery The seventh reason is that the government's gives. it a feeling of having .done something when in fact it has done nothing when it comes to improving rider safety and having improving education about road safety. I would like to add a couple of other of reasons too. An inquiry undertaken by the State Parliament of Victoria in 1992 found possible dangers inherent in lights on, advised that lights on was inappropriate for Australian conditions and recommended that lights on a case of remain voluntary. More recently in New South Wales, at the show of support ride outside the New South Wales state parliament in September this year, both the New South Wales transport minister and the shadow minister, the Labor member in the New South Wales parliament, said lights on was wrong. In fact, the shadow minister, Brian Langton, said he disagreed with the legislation because of insufficient evidence. I would like to challenge the government to produce some evidence in support of lights on. Failing that-and I do not believe it has that support-it ought to be big enough to admit that it has got it wrong and agree to support this private member's bill so that at least we can correct one of the many wrongs of this government. Bill read a first time.",23
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTOR VEIDCLE STANDARDS,"In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday.",24
36,Mr GRACE,MOTOR VEIDCLE STANDARDS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that(a) on 2 August 1990 military forces from Iraq invaded the sovereign territory of the State of Kuwait and illegally proceeded to occupy that State, totally disregarding UN resolutions 660 and 661 ; (b) the unambiguous illegality of the Iraqi action was reflected in the speed with which a coalition of forces was brought together by the UN, a coalition that included the USA, the UK and Australia; and (c) after several months of occupation an offensive was launched by the coalition forces on 24 February 1991 that culminated in the liberation of Kuwait on 28 February 1991; (2) further notes that(a) in their withdrawal before the advancing coalition forces the Iraqis took several thousand prisoners from Kuwait and used them as a human shield in their retreat; and (b) most importantly, while a large number of the Kuwaiti prisoners were released shortly after the war ended, to this date the whereabouts of some 625 detainees remain undisclosed and that the Kuwaiti people will continue to suffer, emotionally and psychologically, the effects of their terrible ence so long as the Iraqi Government refuses to comply with UN resolutions 686 and 687 and fails to disclose either the fate or the location of their friends and relatives; and (3) calls on the Government to continue to support Kuwait in whatever manner it can to help ensure the return of their citizens. . I seek leave to table a report on the visit. Leave granted.",24
37,Mr GRACE,MOTOR VEIDCLE STANDARDS,"As President of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, I had the great pleasure of leading our group on a lO-day visit to Kuwait. The invitation to visit Kuwait was extended by Sheik Salem AI-Sabah and I would like to thank him and everybody concerned, including my parliamentary colleagues, for a wonderful trip. I also would like to make special mention of Mr Abdul J alil Albaf, an Australian businessman and chairman of the Kuwaiti Combined Friendship Association in Australia, who was able to organise the visit. Mr Albaf was ably assisted in those efforts by Mr Khalid AINA Ammar, who looked after the group from the Kuwaiti end. I. rise to speak on an issue today of which many Australians are unaware. It is the continuing torment that the citizens of Kuwait suffer as a result of not knowing the fate of their missing persons and prisoners of war, still held by Iraq nearly four years after the conclusion of the Gulf War. There are some 625 documented cases of Kuwaitis and Third World country nationals missing since the occupation of Kuwait in 1991. While there is considerable evidence that those people were forcibly detained during the occupation and illegally deported to Iraq and that they are still incarcerated in Iraqi gaols, the Iraqi government continues to deny their existence. The Iraqi regime continues to cry foul on the international stage, particularly about the United Nations imposed econoqlic sanctions and the effect those sanctions have on the people of Iraq. I have no doubt that the sanctions have a profound effect on the people of Iraq and for that I am sorry. I feel no sorrow, however, for the government of Iraq or their mad leader. Let them ponder how profound an effect their actions in invadexperiing a sovereign country had on the people of Kuwait. Let them think for a moment how profound an effect their continuing refusal to release any information about the 625 detainees has on the families of innocent people. While I sympathise with the people of Iraq, I can only say that their predicament is to a large extent of their own making. They continue to allow the current regime to suppress and subjugate them, to lead them further away from regional and international acceptance. Yet they do nothing about it. I understand that the regime in Iraq is feared by its people, but there have been other regimes feared equally, if not more, by their people and yet those people have managed to rise above their difficulties. I would suggest that it is time for the average Iraqi citizen to say, 'Enough is enough' and to take to the task of removing Saddam Hussein and his oppressive regime. Maybe then we will achieve some progress for securing the release of the Kuwaiti detainees. United Nations Security Council resolutions 686 and 687 of 1991 set out quite specifically the measures Iraq has to comply with in order to have economic sanctions lifted. Specifically, resolution 687 states that it has to arrange for the immediate release, under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, of all Kuwaitis and Third World nationals detained and return the remains of any deceased Kuwaitis and Third World nationals so detained. To this day, the Iraqi government continues to refuse to respond to Kuwaiti and international requests for information in relation to the 625 missing persons. It officially denies, at every opportunity, that it has any Kuwaiti or other national in its gaols. However, it also refuses to cooperate in a meaningful way with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, seeking, for instance, three days notice of any proposed gaol inspections. Suspicion is also raised by the fact that after 3V2 years of flat denial the Iraqis, in September of this year, released information relating to 45 detainees whom they say were released at the end of the desert war. In conclusion, I would like to remind people that 625 Kuwaitis are equivalent to around 15,000 Australians, 50,000 British citizens, or 220,000 American citizens, should tge same thing have happened in any of those countries. We are not talking about an insignificant number of Kuwaiti citizens. The Australian people, and the government and the opposition, have a very proud record of standing for the rights of other countries in situations such as this. In fact, we have always been very quick to support Kuwait in any way that we can. Likewise, we have been very supportive on the issue of sanctions. In the light of the continued reluctance of the Iraqi government to offer the necessary information on those detainees, I call on the honourable members of this House to support this motion and I call on the government to maintain its strong support for Kuwait and to maintain its principled stand on the economic sanctions against Iraq. I believe this is the only chance that the Kuwaiti people will ever have of seeing their loved ones again.",24
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KUWAIT,Is the motion seconded?,25
39,Mr SINCLAIR,KUWAIT,"I second the motion. In formally seconding the motion, I want to say three things briefly. The first is that the motion itself, of course, addresses the significant problem of the 625 detainees, whose ,fate remains undisclosed. The resolution is designed not only to give support to the efforts by the government of Kuwait in seeking the return or the identification of the whereabouts of those 625 persons but to put pressure on both the Australian government and the international community to maintain sanctions against Iraq, both to seek the return of those 625 persons, or their identification, and to ensure that Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq desist from their efforts to overrun the small neighbouring state. Australia played a very significant role during the effort to reclaim Kuwait. Each of us on that visit was very proud to hear of the efforts by Australians-and particularly by the Royal Australian Navy in the Gulf commitment-in enforcing the sanctions and ultimately ensuring victory in the Gulf War. The unjustifiable occupation by Iraq of Kuwait is something that people need to register for the true impact that it had not just on the people of Kuwait but on stability in the Middle East. It is of great concern that the people of the world understand that Kuwait, though a small nation, is the only one of the Gulf states that presently has a form of democracy. It is a democracy which does mean that there is a process which allows the people of that nation-alone in the Middle East-to express some say in the processes of government. I believe Kuwait is setting the pace not only in that respect but also in its efforts in the wider world. As a major investor, Kuwait is significant economically. As a major purchaser of live sheep---and I know that my colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) intends to say a little about that in ment-it is particularly important to Australia. I do commend Mr Geoff Collins, who preresolution pared this report which we table today, and the recommendations in it, which suggest that greater emphasis needs to be placed by Austrade and by the Australian government representations in Kuwait, firstly, at a diploSalem matic level and, secondly, at an Austradeal consultate level. It is a market which we need Affairs. to do far more to extend and develop. I would like to extend particular thanks to a number of people for the visit. First, course, I thank Sheik Salem Sabah AI-Salem AI-Sabah, who was our host. There is little doubt that his generosity and that of his colleagues was quite extraordinary. Each us came away not only in his debt but also having a greater understanding of the circumout stances of Kuwait. I thank Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who I am glad to see is in today, and Mr Collins, who is with him. Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf certainly played a signifiparliamentarians cant role in facilitating the visit, and we very much in his debt. I thank Mr Khalid Ammar, whose great help during the course of the visit permitted us to get into a number of places that otherwise have been impossible for us. My thanks also go, of course, to the Emir and to the Crown Prince, who is the Prime Minister, and then to each of the others who played such important roles. Of the Australians, I would mention one 1991. who is identified as a warden there, Mr John Levins. He is the only Australian, as I underindication stand it, who stayed through much of the occupation. He is someone of whom we can all be very proud, because of the role he played during the occupation. Ours was a visit which really gave many of us an understanding of the contribution Kuwait can make in the future to the Middle East and to the wider world, and I do commend to the government the text of this motion and of the report. I urge that every effort be made to identify and seek the return of those 625 detainees.",25
40,Mr SIMMONS,KUWAIT,"As the Secretary of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, I am very pleased to join with my colleagues the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and the right a mohonourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in support of this most important before the Australian parliament. As the earlier speakers have indicated, we were very privileged indeed to be a group of parliamentarians who. visited the state of in Kuwait as a guest of Sheik Salem Sabah AIAI-Sabah, the Chairman of the NationCommittee for Missing Persons and POW One of the most moving reminiscences that I have of that particular visit was meeting of with Mrs Marafi, the wife of one of the missing men, and with Mrs Mondari, the mother of a missing daughter. These ladies were at a meeting dealing with this very issue of of missing persons and POWs. It would have been a very tough person indeed who came of that meeting without feeling a great deal of sympathy for the 625 missing and the audience POW s and their families. This was an important visit for Australian to make, because it gave us are an indication of the dimension of this very AIimportant human rights issue. We pride ourselves in this parliament on addressing issues of fundamental breaches in human rights. There was certainly a massive breach of human rights in the actions of the departing Iraqi government troops in detaining 625 people as they fled from their own country, the sovereign state of Kuwait, in February This particular delegation gave every to our hosts that we would take all necessary steps, and use any opportunities in j , parliamentary forums such as this, and in organisations such as Amnesty International, in contacts with organisations such as the Red Cross, in contacts with people from the United Nations, and with groups that we visit from the European Union, to bring to people's attention the gross violation of human rights and the fact that we have so many of these people still missing from the state of Kuwait. As the honourable member for Fowler indicated, this is the equivalent of some 15,000 Australians missing in action; and one can only ponder what sort of reaction we would have as a nation if that situation were the case here. I also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Kuwait Combined Friendship Association of Australia, Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who facilitated our trip; to his very good friend, Mr Khalid AI-Ammar, the Vice-Chairman of the Kuwait Combined Friendship Association; and, of course, to our great and generous host, Sheik Salem. It was a most important trip. There were of course many other issues that the group were exposed to, and I have no doubt that other people will comment upon these in the course of their remarks. In conclusion, the people of Kuwait continually express their admiration for the people and the parliament of Australia for their assistance in their time of need in 1990 and 1991. I know that the motion before the House does enjoy bipartisan support. We do have, as a nation, a very proud reputation of supporting human rights issues. This is a very obvious example of an issue that deserves bipartisan support.",26
41,Mr COBB,KUWAIT,"As a member of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, I too wish to thank Sheik Salem and the Kuwait government for the opportunity to visit their wonderful country. I also wish to thank the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and his staff for arranging the trip at this end. I think that never in the history of this parliament has there been a parliamentary trip quite like this one. Kuwait is a remarkable place despite being only 17,800 square kilometres of flat, desolate sand, f barely one-twentieth of the size of my own electorate of Parkes, and with a rainfall of less than five inches a year. It has been independent since 1961. It purchases almost two million of our live sheep every year worth $20 million to $30 million to the farmers of Australia. It is probably the only country in the world that does not have a river or a railway line. It is a remarkable country because of its oil, which was first discovered in 1938. Some of the wells today are flowing with the same pressure as when they were first discovered. It is remarkable because of its strategic position at the top of the Arabian or Persian , Gulf, wedged between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. It is particularly remarkable because of its people, who are open, friendly and dedicated to making the world a better place in which to live. The first thing that struck me when I arrived there was that there was hardly any sign whatsoever of the 1990 war. Kuwait City is a very modem city and the war damage has been 99 per cent repaired. I share the deep concern of previous speakers for the 625 prisoners of war which Iraq still has. Iraq should return these prisoners or at least account for them. I think it is outrageous that Iraq has not done so. The cost of the war and the cost of the subsequent rehabilitation would be something of the order of $100 billion, and if Saddam Hussein had never been born the world would be that much richer today. Of course, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Japan and Kuwait bore the brunt of that cost. The oil, of course, is what much of Kuwait is about. At the end of the war Iraq blew up 727 Kuwaiti oil wells, pipelines, and storage and other facilities. There were six million barrels a day polluting the atmosphere as a result of tremendous fires. But within a few months, with great effort from countries all around the world, the fires were put out. Those wells had to be redrilled and today Kuwait is back in full production producing two million barrels a day, with the price of oil being about $14 a barrel. The other thing that struck me about the country was how they treat the women there. In public the women, though it is not compulsory, in large part wear black robes and head veils. Some have their face exposed, some only their eyes exposed, whilst some do not even have their eyes exposed. In Saudi Arabia they have to wear gloves as well. All this is changing in Kuwait and in many ways it is leading the Arab nations into the 21st century. As far as voting goes in that country, only about 10 per cent of the total population vote for their 50-member parliament as opposed to about 60 per cent in this country.

42,Mr COBB,COUNTRY TUNISIA,I thank the House. I too had a wonderful experience visiting that country and I am sure the bonds between Australia and Kuwait will be ever the greater because of it.,30
43,Mr CLEELAND,COUNTRY TUNISIA,"I join with my colleagues from the delegation in expressing my appreciation to Sheik Salem al-Sabah, Chairman of the Committee for Missing Persons and Prisoners of War in Kuwait, for the great courtesies that were extended to me personally on my visit there. It is a country which is different to Western eyes. Yet we should not judge Kuwait from Western perspectives. It has a democratic process, which is unusual in Gulf states. It is presenting to the world an image, despite the great damage suffered as a result of the Iraqi invasion and the great pain its people suffered, of growth and confidence in the future. Its people are the most charming and hospitable I have encountered in my visits to other parts of the world. Indeed, my friend Khalid was a most charming, delightful human being and hosted us in a most channing, gracious way. His friend Waleed, whom we met, was also a person of quite distinctive characteristics.

I suppose no-one would suggest there ever is a war which in any way, sense or form is justifiable in moral terms. But Kuwait has suffered an unusual indignity, in that some 625 people are classified as missing or are prisoners. That indignity is furthered by the fact that Kuwaitis cannot get information. They cannot get information as to whether they are, in fact, dead people, or whether they are held by the Iraqi government in various prison camps. If you put that 625-odd people into Australian terms, based on relative population bases, it would run into thousands of people. Thousands of Australians would be in that category, had we been in the same position. To the Kuwaiti people, 625 people is a lot of people. Very few Kuwaiti families are not affected, in emotional terms, by the fact that they cannot get information on where those people are. Australia's role in the United Nations is most important. I, like my colleagues here, fully support Australia's role in ensuring that the sanctions against Iraq are maintained, and stressing the view that, until Iraq wants to become part of the civilised world, it should be treated as an outcast. Until Iraq wishes to reveal details of where those 625 people are, be they alive or dead, or to reveal details of their deaths, Iraq should be treated as an outcast and kept out of the world of civilised nations. I was very grateful for the friendship and assistance of Mr Abdul J aliI Albaf, who was indeed a very useful friend to have on the visit. He understands both the culture and the customs of Kuwait, and was most useful in explaining to us areas of interest and of differences. I believe that we were all very privileged, as members of the Australian parliament, to visit the Gulf. In conclusion, let me say that, until Australia wakes up to itself, until Austrade wakes up to itself and until Australia starts dealing seriously with countries where we have enormous economic benefit potential, we deserve to be a poor trader. The Gulf imports almost everything it uses. It exports oil. We have not got a consulate in Kuwait. I believe we have got to change our attitude. We really need to get into these marketplaces. We need to understand the differences that exist, in cultural terms, between Australia and countries like Kuwait, and we need to get a bit more clever in the way we do things. I commend the motion to the House.",30
44,Ms WORTH,RATES,"I speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Fowler (Mr Grace). As a member of the unofficial delegation which recently visited Kuwait, I am most grateful to have gained first-hand experience of the issues facing Kuwait. The obvious conclusion I have drawn from this experience is that much is to be gained from close links and friendships between our two countries. Members of the delegation are acutely aware of the suffering and emotional devastation which Iraq has inflicted upon the families of Kuwait. We need to ask ourselves how we would feel if Australia had been invaded and some 15,000 Australians had been taken hostage. The Kuwaiti people need our support in international forums to secure the release of their missing persons. It was a particularly emotional experience to have conveyed to us, first-hand, the tragedies suffered by Mrs Marafi, whose husband is missing, and also the continuing suffering of Mrs Mondani, whose very beautiful daughter is missing. Three of us visited the home of Ali AI9abandi for a 'diwanah'. We thank Ali for his hospitality. This was not part of our official itinerary but was arranged by John Levins, an Australian warden and one of 350 Australians and New Zealanders residing in Kuwait. John Levins is a great Australian and we are grateful for the time that he spent with us. Similar stories of suffering and hardship for families were again related in this less formal setting. It was here that I was also asked to pass on their regards to all Australians. Walid, 'My Dear', was one of our hosts, and he had personally suffered at the hands of the Iraqis. We are grateful for the hospitality shown by Sheik Salem and the arrangements made by Abdul Jalil Albaf and Khalid Al Ammar. I note the links that exist from my home city of Adelaide with Kuwait. David David of our internationally famous cranio-facial unit has worked there and has had professionals and patients from Kuwait in Adelaide. Alexander MCFarlane from the Adelaide University has worked with Kuwaitis on post-traumatic stress disorders. There is a potential for these links to be further strengthened and also for Kuwaiti students to study in Australia. An official Australian presence in Kuwait would be most helpful. Our currently healthy live sheep trade should not be taken for granted, given the fact that South Africa is now in competition. The issues of women's suffrage and the extension of franchise were discussed in formal meetings. At an unofficial level I was delighted to meet with Haya al Mughni, author of Women in Kuwait: the politics of gender. As is so often the case, women who care about women's rights have much in common despite their differing backgrounds. I support this motion and I support the report which has been tabled.",31
45,Mr HICKS,RATES,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support this motion. Because most of the speakers before me have covered a lot of ground I will be fairly brief, but I would like to take the opportunity to thank Sheik Salem AI-Sabah for his invitation to visit Kuwait and for the great hospitality that was displayed to all members of the delegation. I would also like to thank the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) for his great organisation, as has been mentioned before, and Jeff Collins, his chief of staff, for the preparation of this report. Jeff was with us all the way and provided a great support service for us. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Abdul J alil Albaf, who accompanied us on the journey. I thank him very much for his courtesy and his patience with all of us, particularly in the explanation of the MusUm religion. While we read a great deal about this religion and its place in world history and the world today, I think very few of us understand what it is all about and perhaps we might ask some strange questions sometimes. I would like to thank Abdul, as we know him, for his explanations in that regard. I think it is very important, as other speakers have said, that we do have a diplomatic office in Kuwait. There is no doubt, when you go there and speak to expatriate Australians and others who are very keen to see an increase in trade between Kuwait and Australia, that we need some representation there, someone that they can touch base with. And I think it is important that we see other countries like Japan, the United States, Germany and all of those who are interested in trade have trade fairs in Kuwait. Australia has not had one and I do not think it intends to have one but, if we want to get our produce into Kuwait, particularly as a niche market, we must have a trade fair there at least once a year to show what we produce in Australia and to make sure that that produce is on display for the Kuwaitis to see. I would like to support what has been said about the 625 prisoners of war. We must keep the pressure on. We must find out what has happened to those people, whether they are alive or dead. If they are alive, we must make sure that they are returned from their prisons. I would also like to pay (ribute to the Australians who are working in Kuwait, those people who are making a contribution theredeveloping the friendship and the ties between Kuwait and Australia. As has already been mentioned by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), John Levins AO, MBE is a remarkable young Australian who has a great insight into the Kuwaiti people and into the Middle East in general, and it was a pleasure to speak with him in Kuwait. Finally I would like to thank Sheik Saleem AI-Sabah for affording us the opportunity of having the great honour of meeting the Emir of Kuwait, His Highness Sheik AI-Ahmed AlJaber AI-Sabah. I think that very few people would have that opportunity. I also thank the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Kuwait, His Highness Sheik Saad AI-Abdallah AISalem AI-Sabah, for agreeing to see the delegation. It is with great pleasure that I support this motion. I know that those people who were on the delegation will work towards the bonds of friendship between Kuwait and Australia, and we must also work to make sure that those trade links are developed and that we have permanent diplomatic representation in Kuwait.",31

I wanted to also put on the record my sincere thanks to Sheik Saleem for hosting our trip to Kuwait to get a better understanding of the problems that people there face. In so far as the repatriation of the 625 detainees is concerned, the whereabouts and the physical condition of those people are unknown. As well as that, I want to put on the public record my sincere appreciation for the effort that our good friend Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf went to to arrange this visit to Kuwait so that we could have a far greater understanding of both the economic situation in Kuwait and the social issues that its people are facing. I would also like to acknowledge the courtesies extended to us by Mr Khalid Al Ammar, who was a very good friend and helped us along the way. In relation to trade, we in Australia today are placing a great deal of emphasis on South East Asia. This delegation comes back from the Middle East firmly fixed in our view that we should also be focusing very strongly on attaining trade with the Middle East, using Kuwait as the gateway to the Middle East. With changing ground as far as the political situations in Iraq and Iran are concerned, there is great opportunity for Australia to participate in a far greater way as far as trade is concerned. The recommendations that this delegation comes back to Australia with are based on those grounds. They are not just that we support and reinforce our support for the sanctions on Iraq with regard to the missing persons, but also that we look at the situation of a diplomatic office in that region, in Kuwait, and that-(Time expired)",32

52,Mr FILING,FOR CONSULTING WORK,"I move: That this House: (1) deplores the practice of university-employed academics utilising uncosted university facilities to unfairly compete with the private sector for consulting work; and (2) calls. on the Government to legislate to stop the practice. This is a matter I have raised previously in this House. It is a matter of some concern to me, just as it is a matter of some concern to the people who are affected by what is, effectively, very unfair competition from university employed lecturer-researchers for private sector consultants, particularly in areas where there is direct competition. I have also raised the matter of so-called corporatised departments of the federal government or federal government organisations engaging in unfair competition with private sector consultants or organisations providing similar services. At one stage I was dealing with a company that was in competition with Auslig, the federal government's surveying organisati-n. In Western Australia, in the case of that state's universities, there has been an absolutely damning report on the lack of accountability on the part of some academics in passing on costs to those who are employing them as consultants. One of the other points I want to raise in introducing my motion is the question of the people who have been disaffected or affected by the practice and who have no recourse because normal corporate controls do not apply to this particular situation. In fact, unless the universities enforce the guidelines for the work that is being undertaken by employed academics in competition with private sector organisations then, effectively, nobody else will. In moving this motion, there is no way in the world that I am considering or attempting to suggest that university personnel ought not to engage in consultancy work. Not at all. In fact, it is absolutely critical, if we are to become the clever country that we have spoken about at some length in this House and about which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has spoken in the past, that we ensure our universities are fully participating in the research and work that is being undertaken across the breadth of the community in relation to scientific and technical research and work. But I have drawn my views on this particular matter from a range of sources, not the least of which was the recent report of the Auditor-General of Western Australia on the accountability of this type of practice, but also from the case study of a constituent of mine, a Mr Alan Lloyd, who has had a number of particular experiences in competing in the area of research for oil exploration with university employed consultants. In using the words 'the clever country', we do not want to place any impediments in the path of Australia becoming a clever country, but it is important that we do not effectively place a disadvantage on one clever Australian in competition with another clever Australian. In the absence of private sector competition, where academics employed by universities are consulting and are not actually competing directly, obviously there is not the same level of severity of the problem; nonetheless, there is an interest in accountability and the use or the enforcement of the same or similar set of principles in relation to the proper accounting of the costs of the resources used in that type of research. The practice of university employed academics offering their skills and techniques to the wider community is an important feature in our national economic activity and scientific research activity. But when those facilities or services are provided by those academics to the corporate sector at a vastly cheaper rate than services provided by an equivalent private consultant, questions need to be asked obviously as to the fairness of the situation. I mentioned earlier that I raised the matter in June in an adjournment debate. Prior to that in October 1993, after corresponding with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), I received a reply from him in which he stated: Universities engage in consulting and have developed guidelines to regulate the process. Such guidelines generally require the charging of market rates for work undertaken. The Western Australian Auditor-General does not agree with this. His report cites the universities in Western Australia as failing to comply with such guidelines. He has given as a reason: There are no procedures for charging staff for the use of university facilities. There is a wide body of evidence to suggest that the current policy of self-regulation involved in the costing of academic research and consultant services is, at best, ineffective and, at worse, shoddy. Surely it is not too much to expect that private consultants and university employed academics should compete on an even footing for work in the cqmmunity. Recently the Western Australian Auditor-General released a damning report on the practices of universities as far as adequately passing on the costs of such services to clients was concerned. In the executive summary of performance examination of university consultancy services, tabled in the Western Australian parliament on 5 October this year, the Auditor-General states: Where universities are not charging academic staff for the use of resources, the university is incurring costs which should be incurred by the academic. This gives the academic an unfair advantage in the market place and reduces the ability of the university to achieve its goals with its given resources. The report goes on: Forty two per cent of university schools and departments sampled were not adhering to the consultancy policies and guidelines of their university. For those who may consider opposing this motion, it is not good enough simply to say that the universities and other higher education institutions have policies in place to ensure unfair competition does not occur because it is clear from the findings of the Western Australian Auditor-General that, in the case of the Western Australian universities, this is not the case. It is clear that the rules, if not being ignored, are not being given much attention. The Auditor-General made several other observations about universities accounting for their services. The report states: The examination found that while all university heads . . . were aware of the consultancy service policy and guidelines, many were not adhering to all aspects. Most examples related to: 1) The approval processes for external consultancy and 2) The lack of procedures to enable staff to be charged for resources used. In other words, many university employed consultants were getting almost a free ride on the public purse simply because it was too difficult to adequately determine what resources were used, what they cost and to whom they should be charged. The result is that the final cost of such consultancies is well below the market rate of the services offered by those in the private sector. The Auditor-General's report found that, of Western Australian institutions, the percentage of non-compliance with existing guidelines was very high indeed. Edith Cowan University had a 59 per cent non-compliance rate; Curtin University had a 37 per cent non-compliance rate; the University of WA, 36 per cent; and Murdoch University, 33 per cent. Reasons given for the non-compliance included claims that 'academic staff did not see the need to inform their relevant head about external consultancy work', 'the university policy does not set the rates to be charged for the use of university equipment' and 'there are no procedures for charging for the use of university facilities'. Clearly, there is a very serious problem here. It is interesting to note that there are no sanctions on non-compliance in any of the policies of the guidelines of the universities. The Auditor-General also expressed concern that university employed academics doing consultancy work might be seen to be working on behalf of the university itself. This raises all sorts of legal problems. Indeed, the Auditor-General sought a legal opinion on this important matter which states: There is no action which the university can take to eliminate the possibility of liability for the activities of an academic carrying out private consultancy work, other than to ensure that it is not such as would reasonably lead a client or some other third party reasonably to form the view that the academic was not carrying out private work but rather work on behalf of or in the course of his employment with the university. The auditor concluded that 'with the clear risk of legal liability being transferred to the university' it was essential that staff adhere to policies related to private consultancies and that, once performed, the university take steps to make it obvious to all involved that the work was not conducted on behalf of the university. I have mentioned the case of my constituent, Mr Alan Lloyd, who is a micropalaeontologist. He is highly regarded in this field, which includes consultancy work related to the shoring up of prospects for oil exploration. He, like most other businessmen, has expended a large amount of money in capital equipment-about $130,000. Naturally enough, in order to recover his money, he has to include part of these outlays in the charges to his clients. My concern is that university emplQyed academics do not work under such constraints-as was the case in the specific example where Mr Lloyd was quite significantly undercut by a university employed academic-nor are there any other sources of i redress when a private consultant is undercut by academic competition. In fact, under the Trade Practices Act, because it would require a corporation to be involved, there is absolutely no recourse for somebody in that situation. In conclusion, I urge the government to enact-(Time expired)",33
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOR CONSULTING WORK,Is the motion seconded? Mr Charles-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,35
54,Mr LANGMORE,FOR CONSULTING WORK,"Fraser) (2.10 p.m.)The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has raised an interesting and important question. It is in two parts: the first relates to the issue itself and the second relates to how to deal with it. Those two parts need to be dealt with separately. The first issue of the practice of university employed academics using uncosted university facilities raises an important ethical and financial question. University scholars have at least three responsibilities: to teach, to do research and to make their knowledge available to the wider community. The honourable member for Moore conceded that it was quite appropriate and proper for university staff to be engaged in consulting work, and I strongly support that too. The question is one of balance and accounting. How do you encourage and ensure that university staff give principal priority to their teaching and research responsibilities, which are the core of the tasks for which they are appointed, but allow them and enable them to use the skills that they build up through that intellectual activity in the wider community? It is very difficult in practice to find a way of achieving that balance. Various universities act in different ways to try to achieve that balance. Some universities set an upper limit on the amount of time that scholars should be involved in consulting. Some universities set an upper limit on the amount that scholars are allowed to earn through consulting work in addition to their salary. Sometimes universities require that part of those funds be put into a university research fund. There are various ways in which it can be done. It is quite a difficult issue, but I agree with the honourable member for Moore that there is an ethical issue here. University staff should be expected to give principal attention to teaching, and if they take on too many consulting tasks then they will not be able to do that. At a time when many university staff feel that their own salaries have not gro-n as fast as they should, there is a strong incentive for them to take on extra consulting work and earn additional funds. That has to be constrained in some way. In a way it is ironic that the opposition is raising this issue. In a sense, what is involved is an extension of the market into an area where, for a large part of intellectual history, the market did not operate in any price fixing sense. It was an area where, half a century ago, people might have even voluntarily given advice to people outside universities. But we are now in a position where the market has spread into many areas, and the opposition tends to favour that very strongly. It favours leaving that as unregulated as possible. For the previous opposition speaker, the honourable member for Moore, to propose a very tough regulatory regime is somewhat surprising. That leads me to the second part of the motion, which deals with how the issue should be regulated. I am not persuaded that federal legislation is necessarily the way to go. It is a complex issue. It is hard to find the right balance when you are actually in university. A better way to handle it may be to encourage universities themselves, or possibly the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in consultation with universities, to draw up standardised guidelines and then apply those in a rigorous, fair and comprehensive way. I agree that it is important that university facilities not be abused and that there be proper financial accounting when facilities are used by staff. The core point of the honourable member for Moore is thoroughly reasonable, but it is probably better for universities themselves to set those guidelines. It may be done in conjunction with the Vice-Chancellors Committee. There could possibly be some role for DEET, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, in encouraging that. I really doubt whether legislation is the way to do it because it is probably better handled conceptually in a more decentralised way and also because of the difficulty in drawing up legislation in an area where ethical. and accounting issues, which are specific to universities, are so closely involved. We also have. to be aware of the importance of academic freedom. One does not want the government to intrude into academic freedom. The honourable member's proposal could be perceived as doing that. For that reason, it is probably better for the universities to take on this task. I will not use all the time available to me because the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) went over time. In summary, I believe the honourable member for Moore has a valid point and a valid concern that it is appropriate, both ethically and financially, for some enforceable guidelines of the sort he is talking about to be prepared, but I would suggest that that might be better done within the universities and possibly in a coordinated way through the Vice-Chancellors Committee.",35
55,Mr CHARLES,FOR CONSULTING WORK,"At the outset, I make it perfectly clear that I certainly have no intention of attacking university academics. They do an absolutely admirable job in our country. The members who preceded me in this debate, the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), have talked about the three functions that academics perform in our country-that is, teaching, research and publication. The consulting work comes after publication because they are disseminating their knowledge and what they have learned at the public expense, and the excellence they have developed in their fields of endeavour. It is important that we remember as we examine this issue what it is basically all about. We are for competition, but I think all of us are for fair competition, not unfair competition. The honourable member for Moore has pointed out that the Auditor General in Western Australia has brought down a report in this regard. An article in the West Australian of 4 November highlights the Auditor-General's report. It states: Auditor-General Des Pearson has found that nearly half the WA academics who earn millions of dollars moonlighting avoid guidelines on payment for the use of university facilities. It is interesting to see what the Labor Party opposition education spokesman, John Halden, said. The article states: . .. he would move to have the Legislative Council's government agencies committee investigate the issue. ""There has to be greater accountability at universities, although I would not reject consultancy as a bad thing. For universities to find themselves in this position is really disgraceful,"" he said. I suspect that that is true because unfair competition makes life difficult for everyone. Last year, I had a case in my electorate where a private sector company that does aerial mapping and sells its maps to local government agencies and others in the private sector found itself suddenly in competition with the. Department of Administrative Services, in conjunction with a private company, doing spec work. They rented an aircraft and used government facilities. The private sector company was then going to blow up the photographs of the aerial maps. They were using government facilities to undercut the market in order to establish a place for themselves in the market. It was clearly unfair competition using taxpayers' money to fund the operation. That was hardly fair for the private sector company. Had it been one private sector company competing against another that was willing to write off its own money in order to gain a toehold in the market, it would have been fair. But it was not fair to use our money in that manner. Government departments in Canberra now charge each other for their services. The Attorney-General's office, when it is asked for legal advice by, say, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, charges for that advice on a full cost recovery basis. The point the member for Moore is making is that we want fair competition. Certainly it is reasonable and desirable for our academics to do consultancy work and to use their l,rnowledge and their experience in the broader f community and to do so on a full cost recovery basis. The member for Fraser suggested that there may be mechanisms other than regulation which may achieve the same result, and I would agree. If those mechanisms can work and are sensible, we would certainly support them. Regulation by federal government should be the court of last resort but, up to this point, the universities appear either unable or unwilling to police their own regulations in order to make them work and to make sure that they are effective. Whatever mechanisms are set in place, the importance of today's debate is that we highlight to the tertiary education community that we would like for it to get its house in order.",36
56,Mr TANNER,FOR CONSULTING WORK,"I have some sympathy with the concerns raised by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his motion before the House today. They touch upon a broader issue: the nature of the relationship between academic institutions and those people who work in them and the broader community. Particularly in the commercial context, there are a number of quite controversial issues that all of us in public life need to give some consideration to. I am not all that keen on the text of the motion, so I find it difficult to support, even though the sitmition that the honourable member for Moore has adverted to probably does require some serious consideration. I note that in his contribution he made references to a wide body of opinion without actually citing who the wide body actually is. Clearly, the Western Australian Auditor General has conducted a study of the use of university facilities by academics and has reached, on the face of it, certain fairly worrying conclusions. How much further than that it goes I am obviously not in a position to say. It is unfortunate that the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore does not make it clear that he is seeking to address the practice of university employees using facilities for their own purposes. I suggest that this motion is capable of being interpreted as referring to universities and other tertiary institutions actually conducting research and competing in the private sector for consultancies, which is a different matter but equally controversial in many respects. I take it that the motion refers to people doing 'foreigners' and that, therefore, that is what we need to focus on in the discussion today. There is considerable difficulty in drawing lines in these situations. In the scientifio area, there are some questions about the use of scientific facilities. Take for example a Ian who is contracted to write a book on the history of an organisation. Should we therefore charge that person for using the university library to which he or she happens to be a member? Barristers who also lecture in law obviously get considerable benefit in their own practices from their lectureship in tertiary institutions. How do you define that benefit and how do you demark it in order to ensure that there is a competitive level playing field? In many areas there are some obvious difficulties in drawing boundaries to ensure that what is a legitimate principle can be applied properly. It is also worth pointing out that the very thing the honourable member for Moore raises, namely, the need for some degree of competitive neutrality between public sector organisations or individuals relying sector resources and the private sector, is enshrined in draft federal government legislation as a result of the Hilmer report under the title National competition policy. There proposed code entitled 'Competition principles', which,is sought to be entered between the federal government and the Beazley) states, which, in clause 3, subclause clause 3, subclause 5, sets out a set of principles to ensure that competitive neutrality does efficiency apply. I have a number of concerns about this ate, issue and a number of other issues in the be proposed Hilmer legislation. But it is fair say that the general thrust of what the honourPricing able member for Moore is pursuing-namely, to ensure that where public sector organisaMinister tions are involved in competing with the pricing private sector it is done on a fair basis-is CSIRO already being pursued by the government. My concerns relate to how far that should extend efficient and whether that should extend into areas such as education and health. Nonetheless, what the honourable member is asking the government to do has already been done, in a general sense-the general principle has already been pursued. I concur with the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) that the problem is the failure of universities to adhere to their own guidelines. If the figure of 42 per cent is histor- correct and if we have taxpayer funded facilities being used purely for private gain, which appears to be the case, then clearly that is a problem. But, by the sound of the honourable member's own contribution today, the real problem is in the enforcement of the guidelines. The first port of call in tackling this problem should be to consider whether the enforcement of the guidelines could be improved. It really is a last resort to have federal government interference in these sorts of things when they should be capable of being resolved at the university level-taking into account the fact that there are significant difficulties in ensuring that the areas have been properly demarked.

57,Mr FILING,FOR CONSULTING WORK," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak a on public second time on this motion. Leave granted.",38
58,Mr FILING,FOR CONSULTING WORK,"I want to cover a couple of is a points. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has raised an important point-a into matter that the Minister for Finance (Mr raised in a letter dated 26 May 1994. 3 and He said in his letter: While I generally support competition for the benefits that it provides, there are some exceptions. In particular, it would not be approprias you indicate, for private sector suppliers to crowded-out as a result of subsidised prices charged by public researchers. This issue has been to addressed recently in a report on 'Costing and of Public Sector Research', 1992. In this report, prepared by the Department of the Prime and Cabinet, the importance of full cost was stressed (and broadly agreed between members of the working group which included and Universities). As a result, major researchers have been pressed to employ more pricing practices for their external work, thus minimising any 'downside' to competitors. Those are noble sentiments. What the member for Melbourne had to say was partly correct. The difficulty is in the application of the guidelines. It is clear from the Auditor General's report in Western Australia that that is not occurring in the cases of the four universities in Western Australia. I dare say that they are not orphans and that a similar situation probably exists elsewhere in the country, although there is no scientific evidence. The report says: University control over staff taking on private consultancy work was found to be minimal with the universities unable to advise of how many or which of their staff were engaged in private consultancy work. Universities were even reluctant to estimate the number of staff involved. The best estimate obtained was that the proportion of staff involved was ""significant"". The difficulty is in relying on the universities to perhaps enforce their own guidelines, which clearly, in the case of these universities, they are not doing. Where do private sector consultants, those who are in the business sector and who are competing with publicly funded or subsidised employed academics, go for recourse? If they go to a university, they have little to no influence other than to make a complaint, as any other person may have, to the senate of the university to take some action. One of my constituents wrote to the Senate of the University of Western Australia and was told that everything was okay and that there were no grounds for his complaint. If the Auditor-General had not come out with this report, one could have perhaps concluded that the university had made its own conclusions based on some thorough research, but it is clear from the Auditor General's report that the universities are not able to do that. In fact, in some cases the best estimate obtained was that the proportion of staff involved was significant. In other words, there is very little to no accountability in relation to the question of university academics taking on consultancy work.

60,Mr LATHAM,PUBLIC HOUSING ESTATES,I move: That this House declare its support for: (1) the success of the Defence Housing Authority and Better Cities demonstration projects in capital stock renewal for public housing estates; (2) a new category of funding under the next Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to continue the progress made with public housing renewal; and (3) a national target to bring the amenity and design standards of public housing estates in Australia to comparable private sector standards through the life of the next two Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements.,39
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC HOUSING ESTATES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Martyn Evans-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,39
62,Mr LATHAM,PUBLIC HOUSING ESTATES,"Since the 1970s, in Australia it has been a feature of public policy considerations that the urban design debate has focused primarily on central business districts. In truth, the real victims of urban design in this country are more likely to live in public housing estates on the urban fringe than to be among those who frequently visit the centre of our major cities. Traditionally, federal housing policies have focused much more on afford ability than on livability. Just as much, state housing agencies have concentrated more on rental collection than on effective asset management and renewal. This has been a real problem in terms of the management of important public housing assets, which total $31 billion. Across Australia, federal and state governments have invested a huge amount in public housing, and state housing authorities have not given due and proper attention to the management of that substantial asset base. About 70 per cent of the public housing stock in Australia is oc;cupied by social security recipients, the majority of whom are sole parents or the single elderly. Unquestionably, affordability matters to these tenants. I commend the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) for establishing an affordability benchmark by which low income tenants-public and private-should pay no more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. However, it is important to recognise that livability issues-the built environment and quality of life-in public housing estates are just as significant and just as critical· as housing afford ability. I need move no further than my own electorate to demonstrate this point. The four large public housing estates in the local government area of Campbelltown in the south-west of Sydney-Glenquarie, Minto, Claymore and Airds, with a total of more than 5,000 dwellings-reflect many of the planning and urban design errors of the 1970s and 1980s. These estates were designed on the Radburn model-a planning scheme first developed in the United States in the 1920s to separate cars from pedestrians in housing estates. It is an appalling reflection on urban design standards in Australia to think that an experimental planning model drawn up overseas in the 1920s still produces serious social and amenity problems in Australia in the 1990s. The Radburn plan has produced a series of dysfunctional cul-de-sacs and private open space, underutilised public open space, regimented design features, maintenance difficulties and substandard housing appearance and amenities. It is totally unsuited to the lifestyle and aspirations of Australian families in the 1990s. Not surprisingly, poor urban design has produced a range of social problems in these estates. Ultimately, the social standards and habits of any community are a product of its built environment. This makes the task and urgency of urban renewal for public housing estates all the more critical. A number of recent reports and policy initiatives have placed the issues of public housing renewal and livability back on the national agenda, where they were placed in the 1970s by the actions of the Whitlam government with its urban renewal schemes, pioneered by Tom Uren, in Glebe and Woolloomooloo in Sydney. The Industry Commission, in its recent report on public housing, sensibly recommended a separation of the tenancy and property management functions of state housing authorities. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development, in the context of performance standards for the 1995 Commonwealth-state housing agreement now under negotiation, listed 'formulating models to redevelop and reshape the stock, including financial options' as a key public housing issue. The September ALP national conference reconfirmed our platform commitment to provide specific additional federal funding to maintain and upgrade the public rental stock to acceptable community standards. Most importantly, the Defence Housing Authority and the better cities program in recent years have developed an outstanding cost-effective model for public housing renewal. Defence Housing Authority projects at Holsworthy in .Sydney, adjoining my electorate, and Bullsbrook in Western Australia, along with better cities initiatives at Norlane near Geelong, east Preston in Melbourne, Inala in Brisbane, north Melbourne, Bunbury in Western Australia and the inspiring Elizabeth project in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) have collectively established a new national standard for the rejuvenation and regeneration of public housing stock in Australia. At an average unit cost of just $12,000 to $15,000, these schemes skilfully apply all the best features of contemporary urban design and planning. For that reason, they have set up a very effective model that should be followed by all the state housing authorities and by this government. The features include facade improvements and fencing, streetscaping and landscaping work, traffic management techniques, better utilisation and design of open space areas and the creative use of infill development. For those financial ministers and followers in the parliament, an encouraging portion of the work has been self-financing through the capacity for private sales and sensible in fill development. Significantly, the suburb-wide treatment of homes and streets provides an additional boost to property value, which has been a liberating experience in financing. To regenerate the entire suburb provides an average unit boost to property values right across the project area. The public, parliament and each state housing authority should recognise the outstanding success of these demonstration projects, pioneered by the Defence Housing Authority and Minister Howe with the outstanding better cities initiative. They have substantially improved the built-in environment and quality of life in each area. Just as much, they have lifted the morale and lifestyle expectations of public housing tenants, helping to break down the old stereotypes and very unfortunate cycle of social problems. The benefits of these schemes should not be left at the demonstration stage. They should be expanded throughout the nation for the remainder of the decade. They should be built into the conventional work of all state housing agencies. A new category of funding should be established under the next Commonwealth-state housing agreement to continue the progress made by this government with public housing renewal.' Even more than that, the parliament and its executive have an opportunity to set a visionary target for public housing liveability in Australia: that is, a national target to bring the amenity and design standards of public housing estates across the nation to comparable private sector standards over the next 10 years or through the life of the next two Commonwealth-state housing agreements. While this goal cannot be met without the allocation of further public sector resources, in terms of social benefits for low income Australians the government will find few more cost-effective outlays. My best estimate is of an additional outlay of $40 million to $50 million to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement for each year over the next decade: that is, a $400 million to $500 million program up to the year 2005. No federal initiative would more cost-effectively improve the quality of life and urban environment for a disadvantaged social group in Australia. Without better design and appearance, a sense of ownership and higher community expectations, existing social problems are almost impossible to solve. No initiative - ould more comprehensively fulfil federal responsibilities on the issue of urban design. No initiative would more substantially upgrade the quality of life, community spirit and image of housing estates in Australia.",39
63,Mr CAMERON,PUBLIC HOUSING ESTATES,"At the outset, I note the interest of my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on this issue, and I commend him for that interest. Public and rental hOJlsing is an important issue in my own electorate, and I believe that the demographics concerning my electorate of Stirling are quite similar to those of the member for Werriwa. Based on the 1991 census, 30.4 per cent of dwellings in my electorate were rented, whilst in Werriwa the figure was 29.6 per cent; the unemployment rate in Werriwa was 13.5 per cent versus 13.6 per cent in Stirling; we both had 23.2 per cent of the work force in our electorates working in the Public Service; and the median family income in Werriwa was $37,800 versus $32,851 in Stirling. My reason for quoting these figures is to show the similarity in the demographics of both our electorates and the fact that the issues· of public housing and rental accommodation are important issues for both of us. The Defence Housing Authority is a public housing authority for Defence Force personnel. The bill to establish the DHA ensured its funding by stipulating that not less than $750 million-and that is 1986 dollars-would be made available for capital expenditure on housing over the first decade of the authority's operations. When the Defence Housing Authority Bill 1987 was introduced into this place, the then Liberal member for MCPherson, Peter White, said: It gives me a certain amount of satisfaction to say that there is little disagreement over the general thrust of the Defence Housing Authority Bill and the setting up of the Defence Housing Authority, which obviously will be a major step in the right direction. There is no doubt that the DHA has been successful in its operations, and the reasons for its setting up are being realised, that is, to provide quality housing for defence personnel. Prior to the estabiishment of the DHA, I guess the best way to describe the living conditions of many of the Defence Force personnel would be nothing short of horror stories. Many of my colleagues, both past and present and on both sides of the House, had anecdotal evidence of their own experiences in the defence forces and the conditions under which they were expected .to live. These people were prepared to sacrifice their lives for our nation, yet they were expected to live in conditions which, in many instances, were worse than our prisons. The need for the establishment of a body such as the DHA was quite obvious and the coalition was, in principle, supportive of the government in establishing it. However, as was indicated when the bill was originally debated, we believed it did not go far enough. The DHA has seen major improvements in the quality and standards of housing for Defence Force personnel, and it would be hoped that these standards continue to improve. The aim of the better cities program is to promote an integrated approach to urban and regional planning. In Western Australia major projects involving Homeswest, our state's housing authority, have focused on urban renewal in Fremantle and East Perth. There has been some redevelopment of Homeswest property, but this has resulted in more productive use of land rather than the improvement of public housing estates. Homeswest has been improving its older housing estates by means of its estates improvement program and apartment strategy. The issue of large public housing estates is of much greater concern in the eastern states where there exist substantial asset management problems. The motion also calls for a new category of funding under the next Commonwealth-state housing agreement, and it is here that my support for the member for Werriwa's motion goes decidedly cold. It runs counter to the current trend in Commonwealth and state funding arrangements for fewer specific purpose payments and more block grants. Any such payment, if it were to be based on need, would obviously favour the eastern states where the incidence of problem estates is greatest. The Industry Commission report into public housing noted that changes to the CSHA were needed. The CSHA has funded public housing since 1945, with annual expenditures on public housing in the order of $2.5 billion and public housing assets worth $31 billion. However, the Industry Commission report looked only at delivering public housing and rental assistance more efficiently and effectively and, unfortunately, did not go further and look at how to make home ownership easier. Owning one's home is still the great Australian dream. It seems the focus of government attitudes towards housing has been to maintain ownership of the house and to rent it out. This, of course, is the responsibility of both state and federal governments-the federal governments providing funding, the states using those funds for housing. I will say at this point that I am not opposed to state housing authorities, nor to federal government funding of them. I do believe, however, that the agreements between state and Commonwealth governments concerning funding have been very unimaginative, non-progressive, and ignorant of the ambition of the people they are servicing-the aim to own their own home. Something I have been delighted about, therefore, is the initiative of Homeswest in my state of Western Australia to allow tenants to buy the homes in which they are living. They are able to get the homes cheaper than market value, with the discounts they receive depending on the length of time they have been renting their particular properties. Regrettably, with· the limited time that we have this afternoon, we cannot canvass other options for assisting with home ownership, such as allowing people to use their super funds-a promise of the government at the last election, which it broke. It is one of the many promises that it broke. I conclude by saying that, while the member for Werriwa has legitimate concerns, they apply to his state and he should bring them up with his state housing authority and not impose his solutions for his state's problem on all the other states. In Western Australia's case, it would be taking a giant leap backwards.",41
64,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC HOUSING ESTATES,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA Aviation: Sydney Services",42
65,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Iwant to raise a very important issue in relation to· the prospects for the Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Sydney. I ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to what extent the Olympics rely on there being efficient and effective air transport services in and out of Sydney. It is my view that the parlous state of the Sydney airport is likely to pose a significant threat the efficiency with which Australia can host the Olympics in the year 2000. Not only is the member responsible for the Kingsford Smith airport, the Minister for Transport, showing some incompetence, the captain of the airliner, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in sticking with the minister, is likely to go down with the aircraft as it is quite clear in Sydney that the opposition from local residents-that is, residents from all around the metropolitan area-is building up to such a crescendo that many members who are holding seats in the Sydney area look very shaky indeed. . One could argue that the whole sorry charade surrounding the minister and Sydney airport could form the basis for a revival of that 1970s famous Hollywood stock standard airport disaster movie. Perhaps the film could be called 'Airport 2000' and we could get Helen Reddy to make a comeback to star in it. But, one way or the other, if the Prime Minister does not jettison the minister soonlarge (Time expired) East Timor",43
66,Mr DODD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Wednesday in Cairns, 40 people came to a special screenAustralians ingof John Pilger's recent documentary East Timor called Death of a nation. The video night was organised by the Bishop Cairns's Australian Catholic Mission and Justice Committee, which is affiliated with Australian Catholic Social Justice Council. I want to take this opportunity to applaud the Bishop of Cairns, James Foley, Sister Therese Masterson and their colleagues ; Monica's for orgamsmg the event. Sister Therese was very pleased with the number of people who c-me to the screening, in particular the large representation of people from the Timorese community in Cairns. The film may have put to sleep the younger Timorese children who were present, but the rest of the community and the wider audience were riveted to the television. Eighty per cent of East Timorese are Catholics. Understandably, the people of East Timor look to the Catholic Church as their hope and strength in their struggle to. preserve their culture and to identity. That struggle has been kept alive by the Timorese resistance movement against enormous odds and, I might add, without resort to acts of terrorism against innocent parties-a very salient point made recently by my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). After the film I read out the resolution on East Timor passed at the 1994 ALP National Conference. The resolution was adopted unanimously at the conference and brings the ALP position on East Timor closer to that of the Catholic Church, calling as it does for a reduction of the military presence in East Timor and protection of the distinctive East Timorese cultural identity. (Time expired) Junior Sportspeople: Costs",43
67,Mr RICHARD EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, you would realise that during the summer months, coinciding with the school holidays, a large number of national junior sporting championships are held throughout Australia. Young people from around our country are selected to represent their states and sporting associations in these national competitions. Their families, schools and sporting clubs are very proud of their achievements. For many of these young this may be the beginning of a on more accomplished sporting career-perhaps even ending up one day representing the of country at the Olympics or Commonwealth Games. But for many Australian families the the joy and pride of having their child chosen to compete in these national competitions is darkened by the realisation of the enormous costs involved and no more so than for those at St chosen to represent Western Australia. I have come to witness first-hand the tremendous financial burdens some families are facing in having their children selected to participate in national championships-and some families have more than one child participating. For most families the cost of sending their children eastward to participate in a national competition exceeds $1,000 once travelling, accommodation and living expenses are taken into account. For families wanting to give their children the experience. of national competition to reward them for their sporting success, this can represent a large financial outlay. I have asked the minister responsible to consider the creation of a national junior sporting subsidy program for those participants in junior championships living beyond 1,000 kilometres of the competition venue. This will enable some of the costs to be subsidised by the government. Not only will this give some financial relief to families but also I am confident this will be an excellent way to assist in developing the talents of young Australian sports men and women at the grassroots level. If the government is serious about rewarding and developing the talents of young Australians, it will have to enthusiastically endorse the idea of a national junior sporting subsidy program. Aboriginal People . Mr LATHAM (Werriwa)-A number of Koori organisations in my electorate have voiced their concern about the latest intervention by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) into Aboriginal affairs: that is, as part of his campaign to deride what he refers to as a Canberra establishment, he has tried to paint Aboriginal people as part of that establishment. There is no group in Australia which has been more disadvantaged or more dispossessed through the years and is less likely to form part of any establishment. I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition, given his background, born of the Adelaide establishment, born with a silver foot in his mouth, should be the last person to make an intervention of this nature about Aboriginal people. I am reminded by some friends in Adelaide of an old saying in that city about the establishment families: the Barr Smiths speak only to the Gosses who speak only to the Bonythons who speak only to the Wilsons who speak only to the Hawkers who speak only to the Downers, and the Downers speak only to God. They certainly do not speak to Aboriginal people other than trying to speak down to them, placing this very unfair label on Aboriginal leadership around Australia, as being part of a Canberra establishment. Nothing is further from the truth and nothing more hypocritical could be uttered by a leader of the opposition. Enterprise Bargaining",43
68,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Despite what the spin doctor in the Zegna suit claims, representatives of organised labour know that real wages have taken a pounding over the past decade. Just how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), a so-called true believer, and his mate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) justify their lampooning of the Transport Workers Union's request for a miserable 15 per cent pay increase mystifies me. The member for Bennelon,g (Mr Howard) leads the pack in arguing that enterprise bargaining can only improve, not harm, workers' wages, but the minute there is a whiff of a pay increase in the air he and the rest, including our resident true believer, start squealing about inflation. The Prime Minister tells us ad nauseam the ALP and the coalition are diametrically opposed on the question of workers' rights. If this is so, why are senior true believers rejecting the transport workers' claims and sooling employers on to the unions? Why now is federal Labor considering reactionary amendments to workers. compensation legislation which would unfairly place the onus of proof on the injured worker and expose the worker to intrusive investigation? CEPU branch secretary, Len Cooper, a true, true believer, describes the proposed amendments as mirroring the Kennett changes to workers compensation legislation in Victoria. What does that mean? Am I going to hear another serve about 'our man Kennett'? A union bloke says that the proposed Jegislation is as bad as that which Kennett is giving us in Victoria. You true believers have to do something about it-(Time expired). Tourism",44
69,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have the great privilege to stand up here and thank the people in the tourist industry within my seat of Gilmore. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, I was fortunate enough to have organised a conference on tourism in my area which was patronised by a large number of tourist operators in that area. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the operators who, since that seminar, have continued to liaise and work towards strategies to the year 2000. It comes to my attention-and this is the message that we put forward to the tourist operators within Gilmore-that outside the Sydney region there are three regions which stand to make a great deal out of the Sydney Olympics: the Hunter region, the Blue Mountains, and the lllawarra which incorporates my seat. I will continue the hard work that I have done for the tourist operators in my area. I will continue to take my bus through the area and meet all of them on a regular basis so that we can bring jobs into our area and so that we can continue the development of my area for the benefit of all those concerned, especially the young people who will require the jobs which that industry-the fastest growing industry in this economy-will continue to provide for the people of my area. Home Buyers",45
70,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 want the House to take note of the pain being inflicted on home buyers by the Keating government. A headline in the Herald-Sun of Monday, 5 December says 'Home rates set to rise again'. They are going to go up another one per cent. Two months ago we had an increase of three-quarters of one per cent, which meant that, on a $100,000 loan, people buying homes had to pay an extra $52 per month on top of their normal payments. Then we had a further increase of one per cent in interest rates, which led to a $70 per month additional repayment on a $100,000 loan. And here we have another one per cent increase mooted before Christmas. The article in the HeraldSun states: . . . the timing of the announcement will depend on political mattersI bet it willand the Federal Government's own agenda in the lead-up to Christmas. Financial markets expect the increase to be announced before Christmas, with some economists tipping rates could jump up to 4 per cent in the next 18 months. We are right back to the bad old days of the 1980s. Here we go again, the recession we 'had to have'. Now the government is inflicting pain on home buyers, with home rates set to rise again. Every home buyer in Australia will be affected by this move. (Time expired) Kennett, Mr Jeffrey",45
71,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to talk about Jeffrey 'glib' Kennett. Here we have a brochure that has been produced, which says 'Mates go places fast on Jeffrey Kennett's gravy train'. Let us have a look at Jeffrey Kennett's gravy train. An article in the Herald-Sun of 18 November states: Premier Jeff Kennett has defended spending almost $14 million on .consultancies for the State Government saying it is not extraordinary. Just think of the schools we could have had opened in Victoria. He is cutting down on kindergartens, nursing homes, nurses and things like that; he has closed the railways; and he has imposed a $100 home tax. Mention has just been made of how we are getting more homes built in Australia. But the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) failed to mention that Jeffrey Kennett has put a poll tax on every man, woman and child in Victoria; we are still paying it. Do you know when he will remove it? Just before the next state election, so that he can say what a good bloke he is. For years we have been paying that. Victorians are paying nearly $2,000 a year extra in taxes and charges-a huge amount. Where is it all going? To mates of Jeffrey Kennett's, into the grand prix, new buildings, casinos and consultancies. If you look at the list of people on this consultancy, the majority would be found to be Liberal Party hacks or members. We only have to look at what he is doing with local government; all his mates are going into that. The gravy train never ends in Victoria. (Time expired)",45
72,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was listening previously to a couple of speeches about Kuwait, and I thought: there is nothing like a bit of free hospitality to win over the conscience. Today we had a motion calling on the government to continue to support Kuwait. No matter that, three years after a war that was fought in the name of democracy and the rights of small nations, Kuwait continues to be an undemocratic and unequal society. It is all very well for members of this House to attack the Iraqi government on the grounds that it is undemocratic, chauvinistic and has brought emotional and psychological suffering to Kuwait. What about the brutal, calculated civilian bombing carried out by the United States war machine? This was not a war about the rights of small nations. I am sure the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) would agree with me on this: back in 1914 Archbishop Mannix described the First World War as a trade war; the war in the Gulf was nothing more than a trade war. As most people from the Middle East will tell you, there is a certain irony in the fact that the United Nations-read the United States of America-has no problems protecting democracy in the Gulf but is comatose on the issue of the Balkans. Of course, the whereabouts of 625 Kuwaiti prisoners is important and a matter of concern. But for members to portray Kuwait as some kind of pristine democracy is about as hypocritical as you can get. But, then again, that is what a free trip does to you. Railways: Rolling Stock",46

Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I direct your attention to standing 145. It is a very simple question, even for the Prime Minister. The question is: will the Prime Minister be introducing an economic statement or a mini-budget before next year's budget? I ask you, Mr Speaker, to direct hini to answer the question.",46
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister has heard the question.,47
81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer spoke about this subject authoritatively on the weekend or earlier than the weekend. I have no more to say than that. I repeated what he said: the government does intend to focus on the May budget to monitor the economy and fiscal policy. But, as the Treasurer indicated at the time, this would' not preclude any measures that the Treasurer or the government thought were necessary being announced at this time. That is a far cry from the government's position, which is basically that there is going was it? to be a very large change in fiscal policy over the next couple of years coming from the changes in the 1993 budget to the tune of just on two per cent of GDP. We are already seeing that impact which is yet to be experienced by the real economy and fiscal policy. In that context, the government will be monitoring both the performance of the economy and the fiscal response. Families: Assistance",47
82,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of proposals to pay benefits to families through the taxation system rather than through the social security system? Is the Prime Minister intending to implement those proposals?,47
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In short, no, we are not. In fact, I have seen reports that the opposition intends to pay benefits to families through the tax system. This has been a proposal longtime supported by the member for Bennelong-along with his policies of reducing the pay rate of young people to $3 an hour. We on this side of the House have made it very clear that income splitting provides the greatest benefit to high income families. A order family on $100,000 would pay about $7,500 a year less under income splitting, but many low income families would actually lose. Someone on, say, $20,000 would pay nearly $200 a year more in tax. As with everything with the member for Bennelong, it is back to the future. This is in the context of the government paying the home child-care allowance this year so that $1.2 billion goes directly to the spouse at home. Mr Ruddock-Where did that money come from?",47
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is inclusive of the $5.5 billion that has been transferred to the spouse caring for children, usually the mother. Mr Ruddock-It wasn't a new penefit.",47
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For example, a mother in a low income family who is out of the paid work force caring for two children can receive $153 a week in tax free assistance. Mr Ruddock-A bit of a sleight of hand, .",47
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Berowra.,47
87,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the direction of policy yet, despite the success and the equity in these direct payments, the member for Bennelong and others have been talking about putting it back through the tax system. This is par for the course for the general philosophy of those on the other side of the House, particularly the member for Bennelong; that is, to try to give tax relief so that the benefits go to the highest income earners. This is the sort of philosophy he would bring to the leadership of the Liberal Party. This is the sort of argument that will .be around in the community. When he is lobbying amongst the members for the leadership of his party, these are the policy positions he would take. Let us get one thing clearly on the record: this is no case of a decent and loyal party man waiting for the call. What we are seeing now is the member for Bennelong deliberately and vigorously running a campaign to cut his leader down. In today's newspapers he is quoted as saying: I've behaved no differently towards the elected leader than Mr DownerMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",47

97,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Bennelong is quoted this morning as saying: I've behaved no differently towards the elected leader than Mr Downer behaved. A week or two ago, there was the Churchill quote: The party should be uncompromising that the leader should be unqualifiedly supported until the time to get rid of him when he should be immediately poleaxed. I let the Leader of the Opposition and his party know that, if they put the member for Bennelong up, we will come after him so damned hard. If you think I was white-hot in 1986-87, you ain't seen nothing yet. Mr Andrews-I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The question to the Prime Minister was a specific question which had to do with whether or not there were any proposals for a form of delivering benefits to families via the taxation system. The Prime MInister ceased dealing with that matter some two minutes ago. He is now simply engaging in a bucket job and you ought to bring him back to the question or ask him to sit down. It is a matter which is relevant.",48

107,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The practice and procedure of this House has always been that whentheLeader of the Opposition rises precedence is given to Of order. him. I point out that, while the honourable member for North Sydney is an independent, he is sitting on the opposition side of the House and as such he still must yield to the Leader of the Opposition when he rises. I suggest that is a long standing practice and it should continue.",49

The Leader of the Opposition has the call with his question. He will direct his question to the Prime Minister.,49
126,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will begin my question again. I remind the Prime Minister that he to said on 19 November 1992, before the last election, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax.' Does the·Prime Minister recall, or has he conveniently forgotten, that after the last federal election in 1993 he broke that promise with billions of dollars of tax increases in both sales taxes and petrol tax? Is the Prime Minister going to break that promise yet again in the next few months by further increasing taxes?",49
127,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I take it the Leader of the Opposition has read from the quotation I made. I do not have it. with me and I do not have it in my notes: Mr Downer interjecting,50
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Sit down. Resume your seat.,50
129,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was a sentence which said that the government would be' keeping tax within the tax to GDP ratio of the previous few years. We have been through this ad nauseam in the past. Opposition members. interjecting,50
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Those on my left will come to order.,50
131,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There have been distorted quotes and distorted quotations. We have had this debate before. Have you got the full quote? Haveyou got the full sentence? If you have, read it out instead of trying to deceive the House and, worse, deceive yourself-not that that would take much doing. That is what the government said and that is, of course, what the government has done. As a consequence of that, the government made clear that it would introduce the tax cuts. It did and it paid them. It put the second lot back for reasons of fiscal consolidation, probably until 1998. We made that clear. That is still a matter for ,the government .to consider, but the first round of tax cuts has been paid. Mr Downer-Where is the second round?",50
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,50
133,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But you had this crazy notion running around that there was going to be some great lift in the tax to GDP ratio, which of course was never on. The government made very clear when former Treasurer Dawkins introduced tax change in 1993 that this was about trying to hold some of the tax to GDP ratios as the indirect tax base of the Commonwealth deteriorated-because Bass Strait had run down, because we were cutting tariffs and for a whole lot of structural reasons. Getting up here unper pressure as a leader, hanging by a gossamer thread, and asking a duffed up question with a duffed up quote about taxation is hardly the sort of political tactic I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition would have employed. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",50
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister might wait for a minute. Mr Keating interjecting Mr Downer-Yes I am sure. In the introduction to the question, I referred to the quote that he is so sensitive about.",50
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr Downer-The question was asking whether he is yet again going to break that promise by further increasing taxes.,50

137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Resume your seat! There is no point of order.,50
138,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition knows exactly what I am saying. He knows exactly the point I was making. I made the same point over and over again in 1993. They came from the same source. He is up here under pressure and in trouble with a quotation which is a distortion of the position I put. Distortion or not, it is an entirely puny point. .

139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,50
140,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is seeking to make a political point while the member for Bennelong is running around saying, 'I will give him the same sort of leadership he gave his leader at the time.' That is code for saying, 'I'll give him no more than he is entitled to and we will poleaxe him when it suits us.' That is the real debate going on in Australian politics at the moment. I understand that the poor silly thing has to get up and ask me a question which seeks to have some contemporary relevance. But, at the same time,· what is really happening over there is that, not only are the opposition parties not fit for government, they are not fit for opposition. The problem here is that the member for Bennelong believes that he deserves two terms, the same as Andrew Peacock. That is what is running him: 'Andrew got two turns, so what about me?' He has the undying enmity of the member for Wentworth and he is now earning the undying enmity of· the Leader of the Opposition. It is a fractured, divided party. That is its problem. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, lraise a point of order. This is a pitiful abuse of question time, which anybody who listens to it objectively will know. There is one question which the Prime Minister is required to answer: does he intend to break his word again and put up taxes again? Going into the balance bears no resemblance to the question. I ask you, in the interests of this House, to try to get this thing to answer the questions that are asked of him.",50

147,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Has tl).e minister seen a report about professional costings of proposals to reduce government spending largely, but not exclusively, by reducing duplication between the Commonwealth and the states? Is it the intention of the government to implement those proposals?",51
148,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have seen those proposals. They emanate largely from the opposition Treasury spokesman and are frequently contradicted by his leader and others in the portfolio. Every now and then around the place a journalist tries to get under the persiflage of the public comments of the Treasury spokesman on the subject of government deficit reduction targets to find out exactly what the opposition intends as its advocacy to the government as an alternative to raising taxes, cutting social welfare programs or whatever. . Every now and then a question gets asked of the opposition spokesman and he generally has to say that he has professional costings. We heard it first after . the release· of The Things That Matter. He said that it was professionally costed but that the opposition would be releasing that as time suited it. Laurie Oakes had a chance to chat to him on the Sunday program and we had another discussion about the fact that professional costings are available for them. When asked by . Laurie Oakes whether he intended an advocacy of cutting into the social welfare programs and general education programs, or whatever, of the government-how much do you chop and where do you chop it from?he said: Well, plainly we've identified many areasthe areas went to waste and duplication. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters has persistently said-and said a couple of weeks earlier: No, no, no, we've made it clear that the areas that we are targeting are duplication, extravagance and waste. Those are the targets of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He suggests the old dog portion of the. firm Dodger & Dog when invited to comment on where those areas would be. He is, of course, talking about billions of dollars against comments by his own finance spokesperson that as soon as he got the job as far as he was concerned the Public Service had been largely cleared up. At least the Leader of the .Opposition has the honesty to say that something more would have to be done. Lyneham asked him: But you're going to have to find much bigger savings than cutting out the waste and duplication, aren't you? Well, yeah I accept that. Yeah, we will. I mean billions of dollars worth of savings? There will be some reductions-well, I'm not getting into figures-but there will be some reductions. The opposition spokesman parades himself around the country in clear contradiction to his leader and in the total absence of any sensible consideration of the amounts entailed in the sorts of progr-ms he is talking about. Nevertheless, he tells us that he has these figures he is not going to reveal. I wonder whether he has revealed them to his shadow spokesperson on finance. matters. The shadow spokesperson on finance matters threw a deficit party about a month and a half ago in which he invited the front bench of the opposition to say. what areas would be cut. He was chagrined to have to report to the Canberra Times that he threw the deficit party but nobody came to play. Had he received submissions? No, he had not got any submissions on the subject of deficit cutting. He said, 'You would not expect them to bring any submissions because, if they did, there might be some political consequences from it.' The opposition spokesperson, however, considered that one area of waste and duplication might be cut, and that is the administrative expenses in the education area of the Department· of Employment, Education and Training. He identified a potential cut of $160 million in this area. It was quite reasonably pointed out to him by Laurie Oakes that this was not a particularly big number in the context of the sorts of sums he was talking about. Nevertheless, $160 million is $160 million. I have had a chance to have a look at that $160 million worth of expenses which were identified as alleged costs of administering the Commonwealth's contribution to the schools program related to the states and, therefore, as duplication because the states do that. We have checked through the figures. The precise amount that is entailed in administering a program-the state component of which is $1 Y2 billion and the private schools component of which is also $1 Y2 billion-is $4.3 million. The cost is $4.3 million. So that is the area of duplication and waste he has identified thus far for billions of dollars worth of changes. It is quite clear now that there are two propositions that opposition members have to consider, as they continually approach us and lecture us as they have here in question time, and. they are these: either they are concealing-and they are not really concealing because they have done no work, contrary to what the shadow Treasury spokesperson says-an intention for massive cuts in programs that are fundamental to equity in this nation or, because they have opposed any suggestion of increases in existing taxes, they do have an agenda to introduce what they, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, deeply believed in, and that was a goods and services tax. It was no surprise to me the other day to find the Leader of the Opposition saying that, if the opposition. were elected, it would not introduce a goods and services tax in the life of the parliament subsequent to the election. Everybody knows that it would take two or three years to get it up. It would be a pretty simple matter to put it in place during the of the next parliament and to implement it the year after. It is what opposition members dearly believe in and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we must now assume that to be their intention for deficit reduction. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",51
149,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the unanimous but one vote of this House for the construction of third runway, will you now issue an apology on behalf of the House to the hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents who assaulted by noise at up to 12 times World Health Organisation standards since the runway opened? Do you also acknowledge the long-term economic and environmental impossibility of keeping an expanding internaan tional airport in the densest part of - ydney, fromparticularly given your own statements concerning the quality of life in cities and the Deputy Prime Minister's statements concerning urban consolidation? Will you accept and implement the resolutions of the public meeting held at Leichhardt oval on Saturday, 3 December to reutilise the east-west runway and construct Badgerys Creek as Sydney's principal airport?",53

155,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sydney is the gateway to Australia. There was a very heavy limitation on the capacity of Sydney airport which had to be addressed. It was addressed with an environmental impact statement and it was addressed after a long period of public debate. The opening of the airport, particularly ahead of the opening of the control tower facility which goes with it because the airport was the completed many months ahead of time and under budget, has meant that the transitional change from the current configuration of the have been electorate-of the airport.

159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There would not be a change in a major configuration of landing patterns at a major airport like Sydney without a transitional period of change in traffic control, which obviously affects many people and affects them adversely. The government is aware of that and is seeking to remedy it. Let me make clear that there are more people relieved from the noise burden as a of this change than there are people who are newly affected by noise. About 180,000 people have been relieved and about that 90,000 have been affected. I understand the intensity of feeling and the legitimate concerns of those residents who have been noise particularly those in the areas of Stanmore, Petersham, Tempe and Leichhardt. Mr Howard interjecting",53
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very interesting that the member for Bennelong should be saying something about this. In a few minutes I will come to what he had to say about the airport. It must be understood that, from the period of the opening of the third runway in November until the commissioning of the new control tower and radar facilities in early 1995, there would be a period of transition and that it was always going to be difficult. New operational procedures have to be worked out and approach and take-off paths have to be refined. However, there must be a transitional period of some months while the new procedures at the airport are bedded down. Over this period, the government will monitor the actual experience of noise in adjacent suburbs and compare it with projections made by the CAA and the FAC. The government will involve affected communities and councils in the decisions. The government wishes to work closely with residents on this matter. The Minister for Transport will probably be bringing a submission to cabinet on Wednesday to look at some of these issues. I am especially concerned to see that local schools are upgraded properly and relatively quickly to reduce noise interruptions. I thought it was pretty red hot for the New South Wales government on the weekend to be advertising, with a picture of me and some rhetoric",53
161,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
162,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a reasonably flattering picture; it is not a bad choice. The advertisement states: . When he opened the third runway, Mr Keating promised the people . . . It shows the crest of the New South Wales government. This is what the New South Wales government of the day said. An article about Nick Greiner stated: The premier urged the federal government toc!-'t the red tape and the preparation of the runway's environmental impact statement and offered full state government support. Certainly the state is ready to do all that it can if it will hasten the study. Then on another occasion Mr Greiner said: Work on a third runway should start as soon as possible in the wake of the proposal. being backed in a draft environmental impact statement published yesterday. He went on to say: Nor has there ever been any serious feasibility study of the third runway option, despite the obvious potential benefits to Sydney and Australia at large in the quickest solution to Sydney's airport problems. He further said: In this case, the national interest may be sacrificed for the sake of the selfish political career of a junior minister.  was then the premier of the Liberal government. For this deceptive liar, John Fahey, to run these sorts of as is a complete outrage. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He should most certainly withdraw that reference to Mr Fahey, and withdraw it at once..",54

He replied: I think we have got to remember when the curfew was put on, it was in relation to a certain decibel level of aeroplanes. Now that .decibel level of aeroplanes has dropped significantly, and it is time that we had the debate. In other words, John Fahey wants to fly the planes 24 hours a day. He wants to fly planes at Mascot airport and leave it open 24 hours a day. He has got the temerity to publish this sort of humbug when his former leader as Premier of the New South Wales government at the time and he as minister, then he as the subsequent Premier, have said that they think the airport should remain open. The member for Bennelong was interjecting earlier. Let me put on record his views about this. He was asked, 'Do you think the government will go for a third runway?' He replied: I think they probably will now. I hope they do. They should have gone for it six and a half years ago. It has been our policy for about seven years. There is an overwhelming case for building it. He said: I grew up in the flight path in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of that area, and I have always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. He went on to say: The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected and, in any event, bought their houses knowing full well that they are under the flight paths. Really sympathetic stuff! He then went on to say: Many people will because you'll have the north-south pattern. I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming.

Mr Reith-Under standing order Speaker is required to direct a member to discontinue remarks where those remarks are irrelevant or tedious repetition. It is quite that this is tedious repetition. Further to the my point of order, the Prime Minister has been on his feet for an excessive period of I appreciate your earlier statement that feel constrained in the exercise of your duties as Speaker, but many Speakers in the past have required ministers to bring their answers to a conclusion.",56
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The cause of responding is helped when points of You are too order are not taken.,56
190,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr He Speaker. My point of order goes to the presthe entation of the honourable member who just presented his point of order. It is the case with points of order, first, that your call is sought and then, when there is an appearance at the dispatch box seeking a point of order, then the person speaks. The member who just raised a point of order-the member for Flinders, I think-did so by preceding his remarks, giving instructions to you as to how you ought to call the Prime Minister. As this is now a pattern in raising points of order, I ask that you declare that behaviour disorderly.",56
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suggest to all members on both sides that they take the opportunity to read the standing orders on how they approach the dispatch box or raise legitimate points of order in this place. In response to unthe honourable member for Flinders, the member for North Sydney raised at least three or four questions in his question, which were very wide ranging and went to the issue of the third runway at Sydney airport. The Prime a Minister has been in order to date. Mr Mack-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: the first part of my question referred to the unanimous decision of this House to approve the third runway.. Therefore, I am actually looking forward to the Prime answer as he names the various people who supported it.",56
192,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure you are interestas everyone else is, in hearing it. The Prime Minister, I am sure, is bringing his 85, the answer to a conclusion.",56
193,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The key thing is that the government will not countenance any action which will endanger lives and operational safety. The Leader of the Opposition was out today saying that the east-west runway cannot be reopened because the Civil Aviation Authority has told him it is not safe to do so. 'I think that is highly debatable,' he said. 'There is plenty of information that suggests that the east-west runway, indeed, can be reopened.' In a media release on 30 November, the CAA reaffirmed its position that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the north-south runway system. We now have two parallel runways and one at 90 degrees intersecting them. The other thing is: opening the east-west runway to propeller aircraft and small jets will not relieve the burden of the weight on the north-south runway. The government has already announced an extensive package of noise amelioration measures. The minister will be bringing another submission to cabinet to look at what other measures might be taken to relieve the burden of noise on residents who are seriously affected, on schools and on those who are otherwise affected. The government will do that which it was' always prepared to do; that is, work to see how the operation of a second parallel runway at Mascot airport can be accommodated without a serious disruption to the people of the surrounding areas of Sydney. That is the least that should be done, it will be done. But wide-eyed notions from the Leader of the Opposition trying to score a cheap point about opening cross runways and hypocrisy from the Leader of the National Party when he and his ownMr Tim Fischer-I support it.",56
194,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You support it-exactly. You and your party are out there supporting it when the New South Wales government has supported it right from day one. I do not think Mr Fahey's crying crocodile tears in weekend doorstops is fooling any residents under the flight path in Sydney because they know where the New South Wales Liberal government stood right throughout this. Where we stand is in favour of the introduction of this segond parallel runway in terms that are not to the detriment of the lives of Australians who live under the flight paths. That is the government's policy and that is what we will be giving effect to. General Practitioners: Better Practice Program,57
195,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. The minister recently announced the introduction of the better practice program of to assist GPs to provide high quality general practice to the community. Can she outline the progress in implementing this program to date?,57
196,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the question. Under the current fee for service arrangements, as members would be aware, it is quite clear that we do not always reward quality care appropriately. Instead, unfortunately, sometimes it is high volume, frequent visits and high turnover that are rewarded. What we have tried to do with the better practice program is to ensure that the old fashioned GP style has more reward. It rewards continuity of care, after hours and institutional visits by doctors, ensures the maintenance of their qualifications to a high level and, very importantly, there is a rural loading of some 20 per cent, so it pays directly into rural general practices which typically maintain continuity of care as well amounts ranging from $8,000 to $12,000 or and $13,000, depending on the size of the practice. It is fair to say that, when this proposal was announced, there was mixed reaction from the profession-from some fairly intemperate opposition to cautious support. We have been discussing with the various bodies representing the medical profession over a number of years the best ways to provide these additional payments to general practice to reward quality care. We had detailed discussions with the representative bodies in October this year and their views were taken into account in the final consideration. Nonetheless, of the bodies the AMA did remain opposed and has suggested to its members that they should not cooperate in applying for and receiving these better practice grants. I am pleased to say that, again, the general practitioners' own good senses dictated that they are actually taking part in this program. We have had to date some 5,124 requests from general practices for information and application kits. That represents, for the interest of members, some 16,663 general practitioners, or two-thirds of the profession, who have already shown an interest in this very important program. What it does is say to general practitioners, 'If you are prepared to do. after hours. work, follow up your patients, attend to them in nursing homes, then you will be appropriately rewarded.' It is a different type of service that is being rewarded. It is not, as the AMA fears, an attempt to remove fee for service but simply to add to it and improve the way the practitioners operate.",57
197,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. When you announced your One Nation policies in 1992, you promised a round of tax cuts for middle and high income earners but not for low income earners from 1 January 1996. You made those tax cuts l-awand during the election campaign the Prime Minister said, 'They've been legislated. They are not a promise; they are l-a-w law.' Given that the l-a-w turned into an Oscar winning act of deceit and those income tax cuts will not be delivered in 1996, do you still stand by the principle that tax cuts should be delivered first to middle and higher income earners, as was proposed in One Nation? Furthermore, does the Prime Minister still stand by the commitment given in the August 1993 budget that those tax cuts will be delivered in 1998?",58
198,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the intervening time, I got the quotation the Leader of the Opposition so dishonestly relied upon in his first question. What it said was this: .. - to maintain the tax to GDP ratios we roughly have at the moment. In other words, what I am promiSIng is not to put up tax; that is, not to put up the tax burden as a proportion of GDP. . Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the same interview he used the word 'legislated' for his tax cuts.",58
199,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! This is not a debate. Resume your seat. Mr Downer-In the same interview, 'legislated'. It is there; that was the tax cuts.",58
200,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. I warn the Leader of the Opposition.,58
201,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is right. Mr Speaker,58
202,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a minute, Prime Minister. I have had cause in this chamber in the last sitting weeks to warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other members of the front bench on the way they take points of order or approach the dispatch box.",58
203,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You warn him.,58
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Bennelong! I will say again that you will wait Taxation to get the call. If you have a point of order, you will raise the point of order; it is not a debating point.",58
205,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-:-This is not the first time that the Leader of the Opposition dishonestly raised this point. On 18 August 1993, I said: ... that reference was keeping tax to GDP between about, from memory, 23.7 per cent to 24.2 per cent of GDP. The point I made at the time",58
206,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Given your earlier rulings, are you now saying that it is perfectly in order for the Prime Minister to describe the Leader of the Opposition as being dishonest?",58
207,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he didn't sayOpposition members-Yes he did. Mr SPEAKER:-Order!",58
208,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is that perfectly all right? We are constantly asked to withdraw remarks like,58

212,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is Martin justice: she interjects, I answer and you bash me. Great, that is absolutely terrific.",58
213,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think I have done anything just yet. If I need to, I think I can do so. The Prime Minister was asked a question and he is answering that question. The way in which he is answering it so far is not unparliamentary",59
214,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,'Dishonest' is okay? Right?,59
215,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You may point at come. me all you like. This afternoon I have already asked the Prime Minister to withdraw what was unparliamentary, and he did.",59
216,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr SPEAKER Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 76, all imputaThere tions of improper motives and all personal reflections shall be considered highly derly.",59
217,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have just ruled on the in point of order. Mr Abbott-The Prime Minister has accused the Leader of the Opposition of dishonesty. That is a personal reflection; highly disorderly.,59
218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Resume your seat.,59
219,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In a transcript on 18 August 1993, I said: Yesterday, in fact, Mr Downer tried the last words of that quotation on me, the one you just quoted, and I read the full quotation. I said: What the government has said is that we will not be lifting the burden of tax; that is, the revenue as in the economy as a share of the total economy revenue to GDP. In other words; this is the second time you have had a go at this, ·after having ago at it on 17 August 1993. Mr Speaker, they are over there cavilling about words, but trying to pick out a one sentence from it two-sentence paragraph and trying to give it a different meaning. Mr Ruddock-It was dishonest.",59
220,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will let everyone else make a judgment about whether they think it is dishonest or not. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I assume, on my first point of order, that you do not take instructions from the Vrime Minister. I am just assuming that. A government member-Yes. Mr Downer-I am glad to bear you do not. My second point of order is that this question was quite specific about the notorious l-a-w tax cuts. It is an important matter and all Australians are holding their breath waiting for the answer, which presumably will never I asked the Prime Minister: are the tax cuts, which were postponed to 1998, going to be delivered or have they been postponed forever? We are entitled to know the answer to the question.",59
221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. is no point of order. The Prime Minister is talking about tax and tax cuts. The disorPrime Minister is in order.,59
222,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I answered that question the lasJ question that was asked of me, the one where you sought to misrepresent me. The London Times made it clear about the Leader of the Opposition. It talked about Tom it is Leary· who has remarked that 'he wished people who had nothing to say would shut up but Mr Downer talks a lot, thus increasing the opportunities of saying the wrong thing'. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of five order understanding order 145. The Prime Minister has just said he answered this question last time round, so this is irrelevant and he ought to be told to sit down.",59
223,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is in order. The time taken will be shortened if those on my left will let the Prime Minister conclude his answer.,59
224,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this point: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is calling for a cut in the deficit of more than $11.7 billion this year. The Leader of the Opposition, in probably one of his final doorstops, is calling for cuts in the deficit of the order of $6 billion to $7 billion. As the Minister for Finance made clear, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about cuts in government spending he could not identify any cuts. But the opposition wants to cut somewhere between $6 billion to $7 billion on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, and $11.7 billion on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, from outlays that it was in here talking aboutMr Costello- Mr SPEAKER ",59
225,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They were in hereMr Costello-You sit down!,60
226,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will wait till he gets the call. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, my point of order simply is that this is not addressing the question.",60
227,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Costello-It is not aided by gross misrepresentation which the Prime Minister knows to be absolutely false.,60
228,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,60
229,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here they are trying to cut between $7 billion and $12 billion out of spending, deceiving everybody about what the impact would be for families, for the aged and for education. The Leader of the Opposition is up here trying to build a case around a distortion of an answer I gave-a very clear answer I gave-about the tax burden of GDP. Opposition members-Lies.",60
230,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,60
231,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I made very clear in my last answer what I had to say in respect of that matter. Opposition members-Lies.,60
232,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can be disorderly, but you will just stay over there. You are basically a broken rabble now. If it amuses you at question time to get up and take points of order, tell me to sit down, interject and mumble away, please do it. If it keeps you happy, stay there. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the House is becoming increasingly disorderly because standing orders require the Prime Minister to answer a question that was put to him. The question was about income tax cuts. It was not about false claims that he is making in relation to the budget deficit, which are totally dishonest",60
233,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You have made your point of order. Mr Downer-it was not about increases in sales tax or fuel excise, it was about income tax cuts.",60
234,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat! Mr Downer-Unless the Prime Minister answers that question, the House is inevitably going to be disorderly.",60
235,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat.,60
236,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: this is manifestly not the way a point of order is raised; this is a debate. The point he is making is simply a point for debate. A point of order is a narrow interpretation of the standing orders-an invitation to you to contemplate.",60
237,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already commented this afternoon on the issue which the Leader of the House has raised. I again appeal to members in this placeMr Costello-To tell the truth.,60
238,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is making a habit of that. I have warned him this afternoon. Under the provisions of standing order 304A, which honourable members in this place implore me to invoke from time to time, I require you to withdraw for a period of one hour and to not interject in the future when I am speaking. Whereupon the honourable member for Higgins withdrew from the chamber",60
239,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government made it clear where it stood on taxation policy. It introduced changes in the 1993 budget. They were introduced into parliament. They were voted on by the parliament. They were brought forward. They were paid. The second round was put back. The government very forthrightly said that it would consider these in the context of fiscal consolidation. The government will consider them as it quite forthrightly said it would. We hear all of these points about l-a-w, law and the rest, but the fact is that the change to the payment arrangements for the tax cuts was brought into the parliament, was voted on by the House of Representatives and the Senate and was passed in the case of the proposed changes which brought forward the tax cuts which were paid. All this confected indignation on the part of the Leader of the Opposition only goes to the point I made earlier, which the Times put very well: 'Thin times for Australia's Billy Bunter'. Child-Care Payments",60
240,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House whether a single child-care payment for children under six years old, as recommended by the International Year of the Family National Council, would benefit single income families?",61
241,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the main recommendations of the IYF National Council in its report is a universal payment of $30 a week for children under six. Contrary to claims from some quarters, particularly the opposition, this is not a measure that the IYF council even suggested would be of benefit to single income families. In fact, it will direct no more assistance to single income families since these families already receive $30 a week by way of the home child-care allowance. The major beneficiaries would be twoincome families with relatively modest childcare costs. Families spending over $117 per week on child-care costs would be worse off. The opposition wants to provide assistance via the taxation system. The IYF report explicitly opposes such a proposition, saying that the social security system is the appropriate place for such support. The report states: ... all those components of the Australian system of family payments which are directed to low income families . .. are much more effectively and efficiently direc-ed through the benefits than through the tax system. Low income families can derive either no or very little benefit from rebates, concessions or income-splitting mechanisms in the tax system. In addition, there is no assurance that the parent with major responsibility for childcare would receive the increased assistance which is directed through the tax system. Further, for parents not in the PAYE tax system, eg rural families and small business peopleMr MCGauran-What about the runway?",61
242,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for pippsland.,61
243,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"there is no tax mechanism for ensuring that family benefits are received regularly and on a recurrent basis. The final difference between the IYF council and the opposition relates to the council's view that 'priority in Australian family policies be accorded to redistributing income, resources and opportunities to low income families' . The reality, as I have said a number of times, is that every proposition of the opposition relating to the structure of family payments has been united in one respect. All the propositions, whether you are talking about the income splitting of the honourable member for Bennelong, the plan of the honourable member for Warringah to spend $7 billion in order to give handouts to high income families or Senator Minchin's plan to take $70 a week off low income families to give $50 more a week to high income families, are extremely regressive. The very same people have the hide to come in here and talk about growing inequality in Australia. Every facet of their social policy would have the effect of exacerbating inequalities. They are hypocrites of the worse kind and should be seen as such. Company Tax",61
244,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. On 9 February 1993, and ahead of fuel excise tax increases in that year's budget, you made an election promise to reduce the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, saying: We'll give Australian companies the tax break they need to compete with the people they'll compete with in the Asia-Pacific area. system Will you give a commitment not to reverse your company tax cuts or is international competitiveness no longer truly important?",61
245,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This comes from a leader-talk about hypocrisy-who campaigned at the last election to put the corporate tax rate up to 42 per cent. You actually went through an election seeking to put the corporate tax rate up to 42 per cent. Mr Tim Fischer-And abolish payroll tax.,61
246,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party! It is not a debate.,61
247,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was your concern for corporate Australia. The rest of the world was in the 30s. Is it any wonder that the business community and the farm leaders regard this guy as a joke. He is out there barracking for a 42 per cent corporate rate and then asks the government about its policies. I will tell you what else we have done. We have reduced the business tax rate to 33 per cent, we have introduced a system of full dividend imputation, we have also allowed forMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",62
248,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is this a point of order relating to relevance? Mr Reith-Yes, it is, understanding order 145.",62
249,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is being entirely relevant to the question that was asked of him. Resume your seat! Mr Reith-I want to put a point of order to you, Mr Speaker. The fact is that the Prime Minister's first response was an outrage. It is no wonder you have trouble with order when you put up with that sort of response.",62
250,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! I call the Prime Minister.,62
251,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was going over the points. When the government came to office the corporate rate was 46 per cent and dividends were taxed twice. Seventy-six cents in every dollar of company income went in tax and companies were allowed to keep 14 per cent. The government did a number of things.,62
252,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,62
253,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right.,62
254,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We reduced the corporate rate to 33 per cent, we introduced a system of full dividend imputation, removing the double tax on dividends, and we removed division 7 tax, which means that after the corporate tax of 33 per cent has been paid 66 per cent can be kept in the company. This compares with 14 per cent when the government was elected to office. This came from this supposedly probusiness opposition. We have also dramatically accelerated depreciation so that 40-year assets are now depreciated in 15 years, 20year assets in seven years and seven-year assets in three years. On top of those changes we have also seen changes to the operation of the tax system to make it more efficient. When the government came to office, 14c in every dollar was kept by a shareholder. Now, with the removal of division 7 tax and a 33 per cent tax rate, 66c can be kept by a shareholder. How do you even have the temerity to ask the question? You know the old saying 'Where there is no sense there is no feeling.' The Leader of the National Party trots up and asks the question oblivious to the fact that those opposite let shareholders keep 14c in the dollar of company income. Under the government's policy, 66 per cent can be retained in the company coffers. Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order relating to standing order 145. The question was: will the Prime Minister give a commitment not to reverse the company tax cuts? We have heard nothing that answers that simple and plain, straightforward question. If that is not relevant, what is?",62
255,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. You have made your point of order. The Prime Minister is responding to the question and is in order.,62
256,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question feigns some concern for shareholders when you have taxed the hell out of them. You frauds over there left them with 14c in the dollar. Do not get up asking us questions about the tax rate of companies. Regional Development,62
257,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Can the minister advise the House of the response from regional leaders to the government's regional development program?,62
258,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. I will mention briefly the comments of two people who represent different interests and who certainly have an interest in and view about regional Australia. When speaking of regional development, Sir Donald Eckersley, the Chairman of the South West Development Authority and inaugural chairman of the National Farmers Federation, said: The government's approach heralded a new era in regional development in Australia. The convenor of the regional Australia Now campaign wrote to me this week and described the government's efforts in regional development as the most significant outcome for regions since federation. On Thursday of last week I announced in Warmambool the formation of a green triangle region in western Victoria and the eastern part of South Australia, and the Prime Minister announced a region in lllawarra. The region in western Victoria has extremely strong support. That support includes both the South Australian and Victorian governments, a large number of local councils, local business as well as rural leaders. The reason is that, in the approach to regional development, we have sought to consult very widely. I say a word of congratulations to those involved, particularly to Deakin University and the role played by Gordon Forth in encouraging the widest possible consultations and in encouraging a consensus for the development of that so-called green triangle region. The green triangle region will allow for the development of a strong regional development organisation and a mobilisation of the economic resources in that region, which are considerable. It will mean that the population there of a little less than a quarter of a million will, through that regional development organisation, be able to build on the very considerable resource base-whether it is the wool industry, the port or the forestry resources that exist in that area. There is considerable potential for the tourism industry. Over and against the government's approach, which is to consult widely-it is very much a bottom-up approach and an attempt to develop regions that have got some economic significance and value-the opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, suggests that somehow the government's approach is not bottom up and that somehow the approach is one that is imposing an approach from Canberra. Clearly, we are working in partnership with these regions in , regional development. Over the next few months we will see a further series of regional development organisations announced. They will all be broadly based, they will represent different but significant economic regions in Australia, they will be supported by local government and they will be supported by the activists and the leaders in those areas. Our approach coming out of Working Nation is considered and policy based. It is an approach of working with people and is one that, in terms of regional development, will represent-as has been suggested-the first occasion on which the Commonwealth has effectively worked with regional leadership throughout Australia to make those regional economic units the basis of significant economic progress. I thank the honourable member for his question. Regional development is going to be one of the strengths of this government These first two regions represent the first of many examples of where regional development will take off under the government's policy as enunciated in Working Nation. Taxation  the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, will you unequivocally rule out the introduction of new taxes on services in the life. of this parliament?",62
259,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will rule all the things in the world out when the opposition rules in the $12 billion spending cuts that it says it is going to introduce.

It does not matter whether it be a backbencher or the Prime Minister. He has raised a point of order in respect of standing order 145 in this case. I say to all members in this place, relevant to the point of order the Prime Minister made, that standing order 145 on relevance-I again ask you to look at the very thick book House of Representatives Practice-makes it difficult for all Speakers and all chairs to adjudicate on the issues contained in answers.

268,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You want a response to the member for Mitchell-I have given it to you. As far as taking points of order are concerned, the Prime Minister has raised a valid point, as have others. If members raise points of order constantly when I have already ruled on them they cease to be relevant any longer. I caution members about that. We can shorten members' responses by there being limited points of order. I call Prime Minister.",64

275,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is his response.,64
276,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is now saying it will cut $12 billion out of the budget deficit but does not say what the cuts in spending would be or what the tax changes would be. Then, with a series of pathetic little questions, it asks the government about every industry in the tax system and asks us to comment on them. The people on the other side of the House will get no sense in the public debate here until they own up to the things they would cut. Tell people that you will cut payments to families. Tell people that you will cut payments to schools. Tell people that you will cut back Medicare. Tell people that you will charge them full fees in universities. Tell them these things. When we have a public debate with that kind of definition, then you are entitled to probe the various things about the tax system. But in the meantime you should go home with your tails between your legs for Christmas. Australian Defence Force",64
277,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Dethe fence Science and Personnel seen recent comment to suggest the Australian Defence Force capabilities are about to be compromised by an exodus of people from the ADF? What strategies have been put in place to ensure that this does not occur?  The reality is that in good economic times separations from the ADF increase,and that is what we are seeing now. Added to this we are seeing societal change, which I am sure will manifest itself on all of us in here at one stage or another-people do not stay in the one job all their lives; they are interested in changing jobs some three to four times during their career. These trends mean that we have to be, in terms of the ADF, ahead of the game and prepared for events such as the increased separations so that we do not suffer holes further down the track in our needs for personnel. When shortfalls do occur in the broad numbers in the ADF, this does not necessarily translate into an immediate reduction in overall ADF operational capabilities or preparedness. Capabilities are covered by ensuring that staffing in essential operational areas is always maintained at appropriate levels; in other words, people are moved over. The ADF is, I believe, positioning itself ahead of the game on these issues and both long-term and short-term strategies have been put in place on these matters. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member that the Vice Chief of the Defence Force has confirmed with me today an additional $2.04 million for the recruiting advertising budget for triservice advertising, with an amount for both navy and ADFA advertising. This is in addition to specific area targeting such as the navy, where we are increasing the proportional intake of womeri, relaxing the minimum entry age for most areas and giving more discretion to recruiting officers in assessing individual applications. The air force has put in a number of strategies to cope with the outflow of air traffic controllers and pilots such as occurred in previous times and which we expect may increase next year. Having said that, I think it is important to note that the air force is not, contrary to some beliefs, experiencing operational restrictions due to staffing or recruitment shortfalls. I am pleased to inform the honourable member that the RAAF-she has a big interest in the RAAF, with Richmond in her electorate-has increased substantially its training pipelines for both air traffic controllers arid pilots in expectation of any potential poaching campaign from civilian organisations. For instance, the training pipeline for air traffic controllers has been boosted from 18 to 40 in the current year, with 44 planned for 1995-96. Pilot training has increased from 45 to 55 per year. In addition, the air force is-at my request-looking at options for lateral recruitment from overseas of both pilots and air traffic controllers. In terms of recruiting for future needs, we ¥e currently conducting one of the largest ever recruiting campaign drives. Some 7,000 people in both the permanent and ready reserve forces are to be recruited over the next year. The floodgates on recruiting are open. Of course, this is in addition to our long term targeted campaigns-the special packages and campaigns targeted at those in school years seven to 10 to increase that pool of people who potentially could consider a career in the ADF. In further pursuit of the long-term strategy for our recruitment, we are looking at Defence Force recruiting by way of review by an external consultant. The first phase of that will go to the chiefs of staff on Wednesday and I will be looking at some of the results of that with General Baker on Thursday. In short, I can assure the honourable member that the ADF is being pro-active . on this issue. We are, as I say, opening the floodgates for recruitment to good jobs, jobs with excellent training that will stand young people in good stead for the rest of their l\ves. Taxation",64
278,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of the interview of 19 November 1992 with Mr O'Brien of the ABC, in which the Prime Minister said, 'In other words, what I am promising is not to put up tax.' I refer the Prime Minister to his defence of this remark to the effect that he also spoke of maintaining the tax to GDP ratios as the way he would extricate himself from this commitment. Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to the budget papers, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has actually increased from 1992-93 to 1994-95 arid, therefore, he has by any standard increased taxes and breached that commitment to the electorate? Further, will the Prime Minister answer the simple question: are taxes going to increase over and above the increases that have already been delivered dishonestly by the government?",65
279,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The party to which the now Leader of the Opposition belonged at the last election promised tax cuts completely unfunded or funded only by cuts of $10,000 million to outlays. They are tax cuts that could never have been delivered. It was the height of hypocrisy and dishonesty. The electorate caught up with opposition members in the course of the campaign. There was no slick talking at the door stop by the honourable member for Flinders. He said a few words at the door stop and he got the glib reply on election night in 1993. Mr Reith-At least I won't go down with political cowardice around my neck.",65
280,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders wants to be careful.,66
281,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I first had responsibilities for the finances and the budget of this country, we had outlays of 30Y:z per cent of GDP and tax at a very high level. We brought tax down to the lowest level as a proportion of GDP that it has probably ever been, certainly its lowest level since the 1960s. I said that it would be the government's intention not to lift tax back to the sorts of levels that we inherited from the coalition. Mr Downer-It doesn't say that in here.",66
282,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said that therefore we were keeping it within that range. The question was a generic question about the tax burden compared to GDP, and I gave a generic answer about the ratio of tax to GDP being kept within those sorts of regions. It was said on the basis that the government would not be into a whole set of wholesale net tax changes. Need I say that is how it turned out. We gave those huge tax cuts at the end of 1993. They were actually paid. It galls the opposition to think that tax cuts could be paid by the government when the opposition promised tax cuts that it knew it could not deliver. The Leader of the Opposition is now using university debating tactics, half quoting sentences and the rest. It does not mean a thing. The high taxing, high spending party in this place is the coalition. Here are the facts. The coalition had outlays of 30.5 per cent of GDP in 1983-84 and a revenue share of between 26 and 27 per cent of GDP, with the rest basically being in the deficit. You were the high tax, high spending party. When I became Treasurer, the top marginal tax rate was 60 per cent. The company rate was 46 per cent and the government was doubletaxing dividends. This crowd has never known anything but high taxation. Until the Turkish government revised its GDP, Australia was the lowest taxed country in the Western world. If we were comparing apples with apples, Australia would still be the lowest taxed country in the Western world. Where do those opposite get off?",66

293,Mr HAVILAND,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the New South Wales parliament last Thursday, 1 December, the Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, made a number of outrageous and false accusations under parliamentary privilege against several people, including  general meeting of the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre on 12 November, I had threatened to defund the centre unless I got my way; that is, unless the meeting was deferred. This claim is a malicious lie. He also claimed that I had demanded that the meeting be deferred because I had realised  attempt to take over the centre' by stacking it with members of the Labor Party had been unsuccessful. All of these claims ly untrue and without foundation, and represent a grievous and irresponsible abuse of parliamentary privilege. I made no threat to anyone at the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre, and certainly I would never threaten any community organisation in my electorate with withdrawal of government funding. Furthermore, I have no involvement whatsoever in the internal affairs of the organisation and certainly was not involved in, or aware of, any attempt by the Labor Party or anyone else to stack the organisation. The reason I was at the meeting was that· I had been invited by the current president of the management committee, Sergeant Jeff Trichter, to attend the meeting as a keynote speaker.

302,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Correct.,",67
303,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have here a list of a number of rulings by previous speakers where questions and answers have been ruled out of order because the question or the answer related to a dissertation upon opposition policy. Today in question time, we heard nothing from the government by way of its policy, only dissertation on opposition policy. My questions for you, Mr Speaker, are: when will you uphold previous rulings; what are the guidelines that you require in order that they be upheld; or have you taken a determination that you are going to ignore previous rulings and, if that is the case, could you explain to the parliament why?",67
304,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Regrettably, she' was not in this chamber when, on 26 May 1993, I made a statement to this House relevant to the issue she raised, that is, reference to opposition attitude. For her benefit, because she was in the other place at the time, I .' suggest that she get the Hansard of that date at page 931 and read that statement in full. If she does so she will have a better understanding, given that the statement that I made was based on my understanding of rulings handed down by other people. While she has brought to my attention yet again concerns that she and-legitimately, I am sure-other people in this House have about rules of debate and privilege, I would remind honourable members that at page 19 of the revised standing and sessional orders, there are a number of relevant standing orders which I think honourable members should make themselves acquainted with yet again. Standing order 55 requires that, when a member is speaking, no member may converse aloud or make any noise or disturbance to interrupt the member. For the benefit of the member for Mackellar, in the course of today, members in this place-people in leadership positions too-were not helping by constantly interjecting when·,ministers were attempting to respond. I also say for the member's benefit, because she has not been in this chamber all that long-but I am sure many others will back this up-that it is often very difficult for the chair, because of the reasons I have outlined, where no guidance has been chosen to be given by the members themselves on what defines relevance, or what ministers will say in their answers, or indeed lengths of time that ministers may respond. It is difficult not just for me but for anybody else who' has occupied the chair. I have listened with great interest to the honourable member's points. I would be more than happy to discuss those with her at some time, and would look forward to that opportunity. Standing Orders",67

Would you not agree that it might improve the mood and the temper of this place if the admonitions that you deliver to our side about constant interjections were matched by admonitions whenever the Prime Minister jumps up and instructs you to name people on our side? If you did that occasionally, you might have a more cooperative spirit from our side.",68

308,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Mifepristone To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned showeth: (1) That the trials of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone (RU486) are against the public interest in that they use women as guinea pigs for trials of a drug which causes death to the unborn future citizens and adds undue risk to the health of women. (2) That when RU486 is used with a prostaglandin it exposes women to a disproportionate risk of pain, bleeding and more serious complications. (3) That when RU486 is used as a 'morning after pill' its effect is abortifacient in that it stops implantation of a human embryo, a future citizen, in the womb. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will legislate to ban the importation and use of RU486 in Australia. by Mr Abbott (from 78 citizens), Mr Cadman (from 127 citizens), Mr Cobb (from 57 citizens), Mrs Easson (from 27 citizens), Mr Elliott (from 56 citizens), Mr Fitzgibbon (from 132 citizens), Mr Hicks (from 170 citizens), Mr Howard (from 278 citizens), Mr Ruddock (from 67 citizens) and Mr Snow (from 35 citizens). Family Law Act To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4.· That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Andrews (from 382 citizens), Mr Griffin (from 296 citizens), Ms Henzell (from 1,003 citizens), Mr Allan Morris (from 850 citizens) and Mr Slipper (from 444 citizens).

Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calIon the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1994/95 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Dr Lawrence (from 1,577 citizens) Mr Sinclair (from 15 citizens) and Ms Worth (from 250 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: World-wide, people are concerned that vital natural resources, such as trees, soil, pure air, water and our earth's protective ozone layer-all essential for sustaining life-have been dangerously depleted. We the undersigned endorse the Earth Repair Charter, and pray that the Australian Parliament will: ; Legislate to implement the charter's objectives to help end humanity's environmental, social and economic imbalances, so that Australia can lead the way globally towards achieving just, sustainable and cooperative local and national communities. The objectives of the Earth Repair Charter are to: Unite nations in earth repair action Protect natural heritage and biodiversity Respect indigenous peoples of the world Acknowledge earth,and life as sacred Resolve conflict by peaceful mediation Use permaculture to end world hunger Practise composting to restore soils Acquire health and immunity efficiency Promote sustainable living by example Join with others in a common purpose by Mr Baldwin (from 16 citizens). Asian Dog Exports To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. , The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that over 7,000 puppies were exported from Australia to Hong Kong last year. It is further brought to the attention of the House that these Australian-bred dogs are being condemned to lives of misery in cramped apartment buildings. It is finally brought to the attention of the House that the dogs are treated cruelly, are not cared for and that the dogs should not be brought up in such an environment. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to introduce greater restrictions on the export of dogs to Asia, and ensure that if any dogs are exported, proof is provided that they are satisfactorily looked after, and that if there is a breach of such restrictions, severe fines be introduced. by Mr Cameron (from 67 citizens). The Earth Constitutional Monarchy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned shows: We, the undersigned citizens, respectfully submit that Australia, under its constitutional system based clean on the Monarchy, is one of the world's most successful democracies. The petitioners note particularly that: Australia is one of the world's oldest democracies Australia has led the world in many democratic reforms Our constitution, based on the Monarchy, has: ensured national independence maintained national unity in a federation provided constitutional stability protected our liberties and freedoms produced·a tolerant society Your petitioners therefore request the House that: Australia should remain a democratic constitutional Monarchy with Her Majesty, the Queen of Australia as our Head of State and represented in Australia by a Governor General. by Mr Downer (from 132 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of certain secondary school students in Adelaide draws to the attention of the House the plight of the people of Rwanda. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to vote for an increase in foreign aid that Australia makes available to Rwanda. by Mr Duncan,(from 1,468 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Hono-r,!ble the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to effect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (d) notes that. extent of research funding expenditure on other medical conditions with significantly lower mortality rates such as the HIV virus; (e) calls on the Federal Government to provide more funds for breast cancer research; and, (0 recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150% to encourage community support to help eliminate this disease and to increase the availability of research funds. We therefore pray that the Parliament take steps to ensure that greater resources are made available for research into breast cancer. by Mr Richard Evans (from 48 citizens). International Conventions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australia is now a signatory to more than 2100 international treaties, conventions and agreements, which, once ratified, bind Australia by international law to implement and to abide by them. While accepting that it i- necessary for Australia to subscribe to any of these agreements if it is to participate freely and effectively as a member of the international community, we are concemed that Rwanda such agreements are signed and ratified by the Executive Government without first being referred to the Australian Parliament for inquiry or debate. We are further concerned that there is no provision in the Australian Constitution for such a course of action to be followed by the Executive Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the . House will: 1. requestthe Executive Government to immediately place a moratorium on the signing and ratification of any further international treaties, conventions and agreements unless they have been examined by Parliament; 2. request that the moratorium remain in place until such time as the people of Australia have been asked, by way of a referendum, whether they will support an amendment to the Constitution to include a clause stating that all international treaties, conventions and agreements must be examined by the Parliament before they come into force in Australia. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 11 citizens). Forest Protection To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled: This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: There is a growing concern among the people of Australia that native forests, including areas that should be protected under national estate or world heritage classification, continue to be logged and woodchipped. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian parliament will: Implement an immediate and permanent moratorium on the logging of all native old growth and wilderness forests in Australia, and legislate for changes to existing forest management practices to: permanently protect all remaining old growth, wilderness and other high conservation value forests throughout Australia, in a secure reserve system adequate to protect in perpetuity biodiversity, water catchments, natural and cultural heritage; utilise existing extensive plantation timber for industry needs, and accelerate programs for treefarm timber and fibre plantations on existing cleared lands; create economic incentives for farm forestry, thereby generating employment for timber industry workers, youth and others in the propagation, establishment and management of sustainable permaculture style mixed-species timber plantations, inter-grown with a variety of annual crops for fibre and food production; encourage investment in the growing and marketing of indigenous, plantation based tree products such as wattle seed, eucalyptus and tea tree oils, and other medicinal and nutritional resources; develop educational eco-tourism as a sensitively managed major industry in appropriate forest areas; and further support the above initiatives by providing Commonwealth funding, including the progressive transfer of military spending to assist rural communities to implement sustainable plantation forestry practices. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Free (from 14 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of Australia points the House that the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 has legalised the screening of blasphemy, indecency, and obscenity. Because Parliament has traditionally respected the beliefs of its people, your petitioners therefore request that the House: 1. retain section 13 of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations as is; 2. control all censorship criteria and guidelines by substantive legislation; 3. give earnest consideration to these matters, in order that no Attorney-General shall ever again have the power to change our social and home environment for generations to come, without full and thorough debate in both Houses of Parliament. by Mr Johns (from 47 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: i The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that since the Beat Breast Cancer: Lobby for Life campaign was launched on 8th March 1994, 180 Australian women will have died each month from breast cancer; (b) finds it unacceptable that having lost 30,000 women to breast cancer in the last decade a substantial research effort has not been mounted to understand the causes of this disease; (c) recognises the fact that breast cancer is now a matter of widespread community concern as it has the potential to affect every Australian family; (d) recognises that there is a need for substantial long term funding for research to combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calls on the Government to: (a) increase substantially funding for breast cancer research in the 1995/96 budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations to breast cancer research. by Dr Lawrence (from 9,073 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Censorship House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: ,(a) deplores the fact that 180 Australian women out to die each month from breast cancer. (b) finds it unacceptable that having lost 30,000 women to breast cancer in the last decade a substantial research. effort has not been mounted to understand the causes of this disease; (c) recognises the fact that breast cancer is now a matter of widespread community concern as it has the potential to affect every Australian family; (d) recognises that there is a need for substantial long term funding for research to combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calion the Government to: (a) increase substantially funding for breast cancer research in the 1995/96 budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations to breast cancer research. by Dr Lawrence (from 910 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that since this campaign was launched on 8th March 1994, 180 Australian women will have died each month from, breast cancer; (b) finds it unacceptable that having lost 30,000 women to breast cancer in the last decade a substantial research effort has not been mounted to understand the causes of this disease; (c) recognises the fact that breast cancer is now a matter of widespread community concern as it has the potential to affect every Australian family; (d) recognises that there is a need for substantial long term funding for research to combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives calls on the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research to a minimum in the 1995/96 budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations to breast cancer research. by Dr Lawrence (from 730 citizens). Silver Chain Nursing Association To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Silver Chain Nursing Association in Western Australia is not funded under Medicare, and that this organisation is providing a vital service to sick people in their own homes, as well as reducing Government spending by eliminating the need for patients to be treated in hospitals, or admitted to hospitals for treatment. Your petitioners therefore request of the House to consider that the funding of the Silver Chain Nursing Association be covered by Medicare. by Dr Lawrence (from 204 citizens). Alternative Medicine To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives and to the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House and the Senate that patients wanting and/or requiring Complementary medical care and the doctors who provide that care are subject to discrimination due to: (1) the Health Insurance Commission's unsubstantiated and inappropriate conclusion that' Alternative Medicine' is not 'clinically relevant' (Medicare Forum 1'94) (2) Consumer input is denied in the definition of 'clinical relevance'. (3) Professional Services Review Committee assessment will deny doctors review by their peers if the reviewers do not share their Complementary expertise. By making it more difficult for doctors to practice and develop Complementary Medicine, the Government hinders the development of cost effective health care. Your petitioners therefore request the House AND the Senate to: (A) Review the Health Legislation (P.S.R.) Amendment Act 1994 to: (1) Guarantee that one Deputy Director, with open-mindedness toward Complementary Medicine, be appointed; and the other Panel members chosen for each doctor should have qualifications in the particular disciplines under investigation. (2) Appoint the Australian Complementary medical Association as a nominating body for P.S.R. Panel members. (B) Direct the Department of Human Services and Health to: (1) alter Medicare Benefits Schedule Par. 1.1.4 (defining 'clinical relevance') by adding at the end the following: ""and that appropriateness must necessarily be influenced by the patient's desires and the practitioner's expertise. "" (2) Include consumer input in decisions re provision of Medicare services. by Dr Lawrence (from 80 citizens). Aircraft Operations To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned residents and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Thousands of residents around Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport have been suffering many years of excessive noise levels classified as ""unacceptable"" by Australian Standards AS2021. As the community was established well before the airport, the intrusion of noise and pollution from aircraft operations represents a cost borne by the community. This cost has still not been repaid, and yet the Government is intending to further impose on the community north of the airport by transferring air traffic from the east-west to the north-south runway. Many people already seriously affected by present noise levels would become critically affected by such an increase. Your petitioners object in principle to any noise increase for communities where the noise limits recommended by Australian Standards have already been exceeded by the encroachment of federal airport operations. The Draft Noise Management Plan has recommended nothing for residents below the 30 ANEF zone even though 25 ANEF is ""unacceptable"" and 20 ANEF is ""conditional"" according to AS2021. The Draft Plan estimates that the implementation of what little it has to offer would take up to ten years. Meanwhile, the Government's redistribution of air traffic is planned for October 1st 1994. The affected community cannot be expected to shoulder such a heavy, unfair and unnecessary burden of increased noise with no measures in place to compensate. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will: Delay the transfer of air traffic from the eastwest to the north-south runway until an agreement has been reached between the affected community and the Government as to the terms upon which such increased impacts are acceptable. In the interim, allow Sydney Airport to continue its established preferential runway system, with movements on the new runway restricted to ensure that no residence will be newly exposed to greater than 20 ANEF. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Ms MCHugh (from 863 citizens). Pensions: Age for Women To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The petition of citizens and/or residents of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully show concern at the Commonwealth Government's intention to amend the Department of Social Security legislation to raise the age of women for pension eligibility from 60 to 65 because: The proposal is active economic discrimination against women Women have a shorter paid working life than men Women receive less than equal pay Women have less access to superannuation The proposal does not recognise the value of women's unpaid labour Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House intercede on behalf of the Petitioners to: Ensure that women remain eligible for age pension at the age of 60. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Melham (from 11 citizens). Medicare: IVF To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the inequities of the Medicare Health System and Health Funding relating to the 6 Medicare-assisted in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles per one's lifetime placed on infertile couples undertaking IVF and related treatment. In 1984 Prime Minister Hawke introduced Medicare saying the Government would provide affordable, universal Health Cover for all Australians. Conservatively, 12-15% of all couples in Australia experience infertility, yet during the 1992 Financial Year, Assisted Reproduction costs equated to $28.19 million, or less than 1% of the Medical Benefits Schedule. The Program Performance Statements for Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services Portfolio for 93-94 states that: ""In accordance with the Commonwealth Government's commitment to the active pursuit of social justice, HHLG&CS emphasises in the design and administration of its programs and services the principles of equity, access, equality and participation. This means that the department is striving to ensure that all clients receive fair treatment and a fair share of resources."" Despite this statement, couples suffering from infertility are the only group of Australians who have had restrictions placed on their access to the medical treatment which offers them the chance to have a child. Infertility is a medical condition which can often be effectively treated. The 6-limit severely restricts the opportunity for many couples to succeed in assisted reproduction. To single out infertile couples by restricting access to treatment through the Medicare support system is unfair and discriminating, especially when unrestricted funds are available for treating self inflicted diseases resulting from smoking, alcoholism and drug abuse. Couples affected by infertility .are already under enormous emotional and financial strain. Even with Medicare assistance and top Private Health Care cover, assisted reproduction is expensive for the couple affected. To know that they are currently restricted to 6 attempts at IVF/GIFf places ,them under significant added emotional stress. The 93-94 Program Strategies for HHLG&CS relating to Medicare.Benefits include the following: investigate and implement systematic reviews of the Medicare Benefits Schedule to enSure that it continues to reflect modem inedical practice initiate evaluation projects which address significant new and existing health technologies and health service issues. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to provide an unrestricted level of assistance by immediately removing the 6 Medicare-assisted IVF cycle limit per one's lifetime to more equitably share Medicare and health resources in view of the Government's commitment to provide Universal Health Cover for all Australians. by Mrs Moylan (from 1,1'20 citizens). Medicare: IVF To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the inequities of the Medicare Health System and Health Funding relating to the 6 Medicare-assisted in vitro fertilisation (lVF) cycles per one's lifetime limit placed on infertile couples undertaking IVF and related treatment. In 1984 Prime Minister Hawke introduced Medicare saying the Government would provide affordable, universal Health Cover for all Australians. As treatment for Infertility, IVF and related procedures are standard proven treatments. Infertility is not inflicted. Infertility is a treatable condition-there are Item Numbers in the Medicare Schedule. During the 1992 Financial Year, Assisted Reproduction costs equated to $28.19m. This is less than 1% of the Medical Benefits Schedule. Yet conservatively, between 12-15% of all couples in Australia experience infertility. The Program Performance Statements for Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services Portfolio for 93-94 states that: ""In accordance with the Commonwealth Government's commitment to the active pursuit of social justice, HHLG&CS emphasises in the design and administration of its programs and services the principles of equity, access, equality and participation. This means that the department is striving to ensure that all clients receive fair treatment and a fair share of resources."" Infertility is a medical condition. It is not self inflicted. Yet, the Government continues to: pay for self-inflicted Alcohol and Drug abuse; support people who put themselves at risk, et cetera Precious Health Dollars are currently being spent on drug addicts, alcoholics and smokers who damage their bodies and their health consciously and intentionally by the nature of their habits. To single out the infertile by restricting the Health Dollar is unfair and discriminatory when more of the Health Dollar is spent on prolonging the lives of for example: smokers who knowingly damage their bodies. The group of people affected .by Infertility are, by the very' nature of their condition under enormous stress privately and financially with the 6 Medicare assisted IVF cycles limit per one's lifetime. (Couples are also regularly out of pocket-approximately $1,200-$1,500 per cycle, even with Top Private Health Cover). All Infertile couples hope they will never need to attempt IVF or related procedures. Yet, when they do have to try these procedures, the costs are nearly prohibitive. Since some of the 93-94 Program Strategies for HHLG&CS relating to Medicare Benefits are to: investigate and implement systematic reviews of the Medicare Benefits Schedule to ensure that it continues to reflect modem medical practice initiate evaluation projects which address significant new and existing health technologies and health service issues. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to provide an unrestricted level of assistance by immediately removing the 6 Medicare-assisted IVF self cycle limit per one's lifetime to more equitably share Medicare and health resources in view of the Government's commitment to provide Universal Health Cover for all Australians. by Mrs Moylan (from 1,040 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the electors of the Division of Maranoa, draw to the attention of the House that Australia must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the Federation of its Sovereign States in 1901 and then being confirmed under the Flags Act (1953). We do so because: (a) It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language; (b) It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right; (c) It signifies the Christian ethic, friendliness, international goodwill; (d) It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen; (e) It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. Your petitioners therefore request the House that our present Australian Flag be not changed, replaced or diminished in. any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 29 citizens). Refugee Status To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Federal Parliament Assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia calIon the House to support the applications of Li Shi Ping and Liu Xiu Ling for refugee status. After fleeing persecution in their homeland of China these two young people have suffered greatly and have been held in custody in Western Australia for approximately two years. Liu Xiu Ling is a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair and it would be lacking greatly in compassion to send her back to China in this state. We, the undersigned, request the release of these two young people into the community where they will receive friendship and practical support. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 68 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return, but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to declare ANZAC day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no other day. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 44 citizens). Landcare: Increased Tax Deductibility To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of Australia in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House that great efforts are being made to attain sustainable land use through land care. At the present level of activity it will take in the order of 100 years to achieve a stable landscape Australia wide (based on an accepted level of necessary vegetation cover). Whereas environmental degradation on private land in Australia needs substantial expenditure to arrest and reverse trends such as increasing salinity brought about by traditional practices of land utilisation. Such expenditure requires encouragement and some degree of support from the general population and tax payers. ANZAC Day We request that assistance such as tax deductibility in the order of 150 per cent on approved landcare expenditure be granted. We believe this would result in a massive re-direction of available draws funds towards land care and subsequent improved sustainable land use, living standards and taxable income. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Thckey (from 4,210 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Unemployment Interest Rates",68
309,Mr MILES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today, in the House, question time was more active than it is normally on a Monday sitting day. I rise to speak in the grievance debate to cover three areas which I believe many people in Australia-certainly in my electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania-are deeply concerned about. Those three issues are unemployment, interest rates and taxes. Today's vigorous interchange at question time came about because we got on to the hard issues that are concerning people. Obviously, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a. little tetchy about the fact that these are the issues which are running out there in the Australian electorate. Let us look at unemployment. The Prime Minister desires to go back into history and quote what happened under other governments, particularly the Fraser government. This government under the present Prime Minister has never had as Iowan unemployment rate as Fraser's maximum rate. Under Fraser there were 624,700 people out of work at the highest time, at the peak. In Australia now there are over 800,000 people out of work. In this country we have a government which created dver one million unemployed people at one stage. It now tries to make a virtue out of the policies which are supposedlybringing down unemployment when in actual fact people are being taken out of unemployment and put into training programs and schemes for jobs for which there are already 100 or 200 people with qualifications who are already unemployed. The government has this notion that it is able to address unemployment, but out in the real world, particularly in regional Australia, which this government has ignored for 10 years, there are many people grappling to come to terms with not having a job. There are so many figures indicating the numbers of families which do not have an income earner; over 600,000 children live in homes in which there is no wage or income earner. That is a great tragedy for this country. It is time this government came to grips with changing its economic policy so that businesses and the people who create the real jobs.in this country Taxes can get under way, be competitive internationally and be able to sell products overseas and so that we can create jobs in this country. The second point I wanUo raise, which is a burning issue for many people' out there at this point,. is interest rates. We all know that in 1990-91 we had interest rates in housing and in small business of 16, 18 and 22 per cent. They came down, and now we see them going up. Many people have· gone into a housing market in the last couple of years because they were hopeful that irifla:tion and interest rates would stay down. The government gave all the indications, an,d there are plenty of quotes around that - ay, 'We will keep inflation down and we are going to pass on the beriefits to the Australian people.' Yet we now see the boom-bust cycle, which we have had under this government for over a decade, coming back into full swing with a vengeance. We are going to find hundreds of people, particularly young married couples, caught out with interest rates going up on their housing loans. An $80,000 loan will. go up $40 a month and $150,000 loans will go up $125 a month if interest rates go up by one per cent. There is every indication that interest rates are going to go up before Christmas-a ti-e when people desire to have some finanCIal capacity to spend on gifts for their children and for presents for others. This. government put economic poliCies into place in t-e - ast budget when it was. warned by orgamsatton after organisation I,tnd by the oppositi-n of the need to control its spending: It - aid, 'No, it's all right, it's no problem,' y-t within .six months we have seen the economyrunmng out of control. The people who are going to pay for it will be ordinary averag- A.ustr-l­ ians. Instead of this government gettmg Its policies correct and in order, it· is going to wham on interest rates to try to dampen down the economy. Instead of this government getting its policies and its programs in control-it does' not want to take the electoral burden of having to cut its budget-it is !, going to force Australian people to payout of their pockets. I grieve here today for the people in my electorate. This is a callous government. Today we saw the Prime Minister hypocritically come in here with all the rhetoric under the sun,· yet he has no understanding of the ordinary Australians who are faced with this increase in interest rates. To top it all off, we now have the government saying, 'We are going to put up taxes.' I go back to the first quote referred to today in the parliament when the Prime Minister was talking about tax cuts in which he says: . . . let me tell you something that I thought might have known-they've been legislated. They were not a promise, they are law-L-A-W-Iaw. We all know the quote l-a-w law. What it should have really been was l-i-e lie. That is what he should have told the Australian people before the last election. Yet we had the Prime Minister coming in here today backing off, indicating that he never said anything like this. This government was re-elected on the promise of tax cuts, yet what have we seen in every paper over the last two or three days? We have seen the government indicating that it is going to put up taxes: On Lateline on 19 November 1993, just over a year ago and just under 19 months after being elected, the Prime Minister said: What I am promising is not to put up tax. That was his promise as Prime Minister just over a year ago, and we now find the economy running out of control. The budget was brought in in May this year, off target, and now he is going to ask the Australian people to pay for the government's mistakes. It is going to be the ordinary workers out there, the people in the factories, the farmers and the people in small businesses who are going to pay for the mismanagement of this economy by the government. What have we heard from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) over the last few days, remembering the quote from the Prime Minister-'I promise I am not going to put up taxes' - just a year ago? On 26 October 1994 in a press release entitled 'Doorstop: September quarter CPI' on the need to increase taxes the Treasurer said: No, I don't think that that is so ... Now if you are going to put all of that together you are talking about very, very large cuts in the public sector. We are not talking in those terms, we are not talking about that kind of approach. Yet on 1 December, just a few days ago, on interest rate rises, we find the Treasurer saying: But certainly we have to assess whether anything more needs to be done and that is what we will do in the fullness of time. We will make that thorough examination and decide what the appropriate strategy is. you All the time we find the government backing away from its commitments either by putting up interest rates or by putting up taxes. Inst.ead of cutting taxes, the code words are out there already-'Taxes are going up.' Read the Prime Minister's lips, read the Treasurer's lips: they are going to go up. Interest rates are going to go up, taxes are going up and it is the ordinary Australians who are going to pay for the mismanagement of this government. States Rights: Victoria Grand Prix: Melbourne",76
310,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve for the citizens of Victoria, their democratic rights and the attacks continually being made upon their living conditions. Over the last 12 months, members of the coalition representing the people of Victoria have expressed their concern in this House on a variety of issues with one simple theme: the attack upon states rights and the power of the Commonwealth in respect of those rights. I am concerned about the rights of the people of Victoria. I refer now to recent legislation which has just proceeded through the Victorian Legislative Assembly. The government of the day has virtually· abandoned its responsibility in the critical area of health care in the management of nursing homes by introducing and passing legislation which basically abandons frail, older Victorians living in nursing homes and hostels. The legislation basically removes all state government responsibility for regulating nursing homes and hostels. Part of that is a requirement that poses no obligation on any manager of a nursing home to employ a fully qualified nurse. I do not know how members opposite feel, but the people who inhabit nursing homes in Australia are the generation that came through two world wars and the depression, reared their families and produced good Australians. When they reach the point of frailty, they are entitled to expect that if they go into a nursing home proper standards will be complied with. If the state government of Victoria does not want to apply those standards,in terms of much of the funding coming from .the Commonwealth, if it does not want to exercise its obligations to care for the frail aged, then it ought to come out honestly and say so. It ought to say to the Commonwealth, 'We don't want to discharge this responsibility: We are going to abandon it. Please take it over.' I am sick of hearing members of the coalition continually bleating in this place about the erosion of what they call states rights when not one of them would get up in this House and say that they would be prepared to put their aged parent into a nursing home that had no qualified nurse and no requirement from a Victorian conservative, reactionary government to ensure that the rights of patients are properly protected. The government has no capacity at all to stop somebody who is running a guest house or some kind of hostel to advertise it as a nursing home. Those sorts of standards are unacceptable and they should not be accepted by the Commonwealth. If the government of Victoria does not want to exercise its responsibilities in this area, let it say so and let it abandon the field. The other area of concern to me· is in respect of matters within my own electorate. Last week I received a phone call asking me to go down to Albert Park to see what was an orderly demonstration by citizens not merely from within my electorate but from all over Melbourne. They were protesting about the Grand Prix taking place in a people's park. They are not opposed to the Grand Prix as such. There have been reasonable alternative suggestions made as to where else it could take place. When I got there at about 9.30 a.m., many of the younger people had gone about their business, gone off to carry out their responsibilities as employers, managers or executives. Basically the people who were there were retired or housewives or elderly people. While they were there, a fence was put up around a fairly large section of the park. I was staggered to see some hour after I had arrived a series of police vans pull up and emerging from them, marching almost four abreast, were endless hoards of police. They were subsequently followed by police officers on mounted horses. The horses had shields over their faces and the riders had long riot batons hanging on the saddle. I do not know whether they were to control the horse or to control these demonstrators, the most orderly bunch of people I have ever seen. They had the most amicable relationships with the police on all of the occasions they exercised their fundamental right to protest. There was no suggestion at any stage of non-cooperation with the police. There had been no suggestion of any violence. At a time when there are serious problems with law enforcement and crime in Victoria, here were all these police with horses, paddy wagons-the full bit-and valuable police time being spent doing what? It was not their fault. What a rotten job for a law enforcement officer. On a guesstimate, I would say there were 2Y2 policemen to every elderly person and some of the younger people there. Some of them had elected, as a matter of principle, to volunteer to be arrested in order to maintain their protest. I would have suggested that half a dozen to a dozen policemen could have carried out this process instead of this incredible exercise in law and order. I do not think that is what my state is about and I do not think that is what my community is about. Many people were there because they believe a park is something which belongs to all the people. Many of the elderly people were there to ensure that right for their grandchildren. It is ironic that some years ago, in 1958 to be exact, the then Bolte government took all races out of the park. There was a proposal to have not a formula one race but a fairly moderate form of motor racing. The government of the day said no, parks were people, not for motor racing. That was decision by one of the strongest, and I might say one of the ablest, Liberal leaders this nation has produced and it was loudly applauded. The editorial in the Sun of 6 November 1958 stated that the people should have full, free and safe access to their parks at all It is pity that there seems to' have been change of management at the Sun because that is not what it is saying now. I would have thought that, if that were the principle that provoked editorial columns then, the same principle should apply now. I grieve for my state when I see law-abiding citizens being confronted by overwhelming numbers. of police officers with paddy wagons when they were trying to exercise a democratthe ic concern about the future of public property, a public park. This is not what good governtragedy ment is about. This is not what I believe is the best interests of the state of Victoria certainly not in the best interests of those people who believe that parks belong to disabled. people. I condemn the abuse of precious police time and resources. I condemn the with government of Victoria for its approach to all of these matters. (Time expired) Attention Deficit Disorder",77
311,Mr RICHARD EVANS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for many young Aussuicide tralians-many who fidget, are irritable, tralia overactive, have poor listening skills, impulsive, break things and are interruptive. I also grieve for those children who may appear lazy, listless or forgetful, who somebecause times can sit for long periods without movemay ment and who are generally considered to be quiet children. I grieve for those children might at times say, 'Mummy, I wish I was dead. Mummy, nothing goes right for me. Stop yelling at me, I'll remember in a minute.' Today I grieve for the Australian children and, in some cases, the adults who suffer from ADD, commonly called attention deficit disorder; Attention deficit disorder is nostic label which is used to describe significant group of children who have experiabsenteeism. ; for enced learning and temperament problems. a The label changes over the years and has done for many years, yet the weaknesses and behaviour of these children remain constant. It is my view that the community should acknowledge the condition of attention deficit disorder and begin to prioritise planning for the improved management of the condition. times. The core characteristics of this disorder a include inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity, which are exhibited by most children some of the time to some degree. The distinguishing feature of ADD children is the magnitude of the symptoms most of the time in most situations. ADD children are not necessarily of below average intelligencequite the contrary-with some evidence indicating that the majority of children with condition have average or well above average intelligence. It seems that the great for some of the children with ADD is in that they may be doubly disabled by not only and having the condition but also being gifted. This creates a novel concept: the gifted In Australia ADD children are included all children with learning disabilities and are therefore not helped by current programs. ADD kids have behavioural problems which can lead to petty crime, drug abuse, motor vehicle offences, violence, and often gaol. may suicide. With the very high rate of for under 25-year-old males in Austhe highest in the world, it would appear are that we should address this issue and its relationship to ADD children. ADD sufferers may leave school early of their learning disability, which be undiagnosed, and therefore they are denied participation in further learning experiwho ences. They may take jobs beneath their potential, which may make them bitter with their life and with the community. They may, in fact, get into trouble with the police. Current correctional programs do not address diagnosis of ADD; therefore, their continued offending may be contributing to their condition. There is strong evidence of chronic a diagalcoholism and drug abuse amongst ADD a sufferers. There is also evidence of work Based on this evidence, we as a community would do well to address the still needs of ADD children and the social probor lems they, their families and the community all suffer through lack of attention to the problem. What is this thing called attention deficit disorder? ADD is misunderstood by many. It is not a behavioural problem, but it is a ties behavioural expression of a problem defined in different ways. It is a neurobiological disorder or imbalance. The incidence rate is fields. not clear because of the continued lack of clear and accurate data. However, depending on the source of information, the disorder affects between five and 20 per cent of the child population. That basically means that 3.4 million Australians suffer or have suffered from attention deficit disorder. Surely that a statistic that should be of concern to all Australians. ADD is more common in boys than in girls. Recent studies suggest that girls are less identified because they exhibit fewer aggressive hyperactive characteristics and do not come to the attention of teachers. It has been thought that, by the age of puberty, children grow out of the condition. However, the recent evidence shows that ADD may be a life disorder, with many children learning control their problems during their teen years. For about 50 to 70 per cent of children with ADD, some of the problems will continue into adulthood. How does this condition happen? It is clear from research that ADD happens through immaturity of the brain chemistry in some affected areas of the brain so the brain is not effective. Treatment with drug therapy is at once the most controversial and also the most successful form of management for children and adults with ADD problems. Ritalin, for instance, increases the level of the neurotransmitter substances in the gap between the nerve cells, acting as a neurotransmitter. It eliminated from the system within four hours and is non-addictive, which is contrary recent publicity. All but a small percentage children and adults with ADD respond to medication. The bottom line is that children with learnment ing difficulties and learning disabilities not formally recognised in the education disability fields. What can we do about this? Education and support services must be directed at those in need of education and support and not on a category based determinant. A decision must be made to recognise specific learning difficulties, learning difficuland learning disabilities, and a definition of these three must be made and accepted within the education, medicine and disability Teachers must be given some recognition for the advanced skills they obtain in the area of learning difficulties and should be recognised as specialist teachers. Provision should be made for a specialist resource person from existing staff at each school to act as a reis source for all staff in catering for students with learning difficulties and disabilities. More specific and detailed attention must be obtained from the field to encompass all the solutions for these children. The above items are essential prerequisites for services for and recognition of the associated problems. I hope that my short address contributes to raising concerns about ADD, attention deficit most disorder, within the wider community and raises public awareness and debate. I foreto shadow that I will be presenting a motion to the parliament this week and, hopefully, I will get it on the agenda for discussion next year. I think this is an important issue. With an average of 15 per cent of the population suffering from ADD, we cannot continue to ignore this particular condition. We should at least address it in some way but specifically through education and awareness. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you and the honourable members in the chamber that I shall continue to raise this issue in the parliament. International Monetary Fund",79
312,Mr LANGMORE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have great delight in reporting to the House is a successful initiative by this parliament. an initiative relating to the scrutiny of the Interto national Monetary Fund and the World Bank. of About three years ago the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-of which the Minister for DevelopCooperation and Pacific Island Affairs are (Mr Bilney), at the table, was the distin), guished chair before he became a ministertook on an inquiry into the bank and the fund, considering that they needed additional scrutiny and that they were inadequately studied by parliaments. We undertook an inquiry that lasted about 18 months and which was quite extensive in its coverage. One of our recommendations in the report that· was tabled about 15 months ago was that there should be an international parliamentary assembly to monitor and scrutinise what the bank and fund are doing. The present position is that the bank and fund are unable, or regard· themselves as unable, to appear before parliamentary committees because, they say, they relate to governments and that, if they appeared before parliamentary committees, that might compromise them in some way. But one way around that problem, it seemed to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, would be to hold an international parliamentary assembly and then get the bank and the fund to appear. So the Speaker of this House and the President of the Senate wrote to the speaker of the US House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader proposing that an international parliamentary assembly be held to which the parliamentarians from each of the countries at present providing the executive directors of the bank and the fund would be invited and at which the fund and the bank would be invited to appear. This suggestion was taken up by the US House Banking Committee. It organised a hearing which was held in Washington, in the banking committee room, on 21 November. I represented Australia. Parliamentarians from 18 countries. attended. The seminar was chaired by representative Barney Frank, who chairs the House Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Monetary Policy. The chief economists from each of the bank and the fund appeared and made statements, and then we asked them questions. As well, we were assisted by an eminent panel of four advisers who themselves made statements commenting on the work of the bank and the fund. This was really a major breakthrough because it was the first time in J the 50-year history of the bank and the fund that they have appeared officially and formally before a parliamentary committee. The parliamentarians taking part asked them questions. Several themes were taken up by a lot of parliamentarians; others were taken up by only one or two. The main themes were accountability, transparency and a critique of the fund and bank policies. In relation to transparency, it was pointed out by Geoffrey Sachs, a very eminent Harvard professor, that the fund is a more secretive organisation than the CIA. The CIA releases its records after 50 years; the IMF never releases its records of its relationship between itself and governments. It regards them as so secret that they are never made available for study. That means that the wider public has no way of knowing what the fund is saying to countries as a result of its annual visits. Since those annual visits are undoubtedly influential in the development of economic policy in member countries, this really is a very unsatisfactory situation. A lot of parliaments are very keen to have those articles for consultations made public. There is a willingness to do that to a degree within the fund but the fund is concerned that, if all its advice were made public, its effectiveness would be reduced. There is some room for debate there, but it is very important that, as with the OECD which makes public its advice to governments, the fund's advice should also be made public. It is important to recognise that there is a habitual bias in the advice the fund gives. The fund is preoccupied with reducing and controlling inflation. It has very little concern with the level of economic activity, with the rate of economic development, with the level of unemployment or with the rate of employment growth, let alone with issues like equity or the reduction of poverty. That means that the advice it gives is skewed. Cumulatively, the advice it gives globally has a deflationary effect on the global economy. The fund, by its preoccupation with inflation, is always arguing for reductions in the level of economic activity. It commonly appears to recommend increases in interest rates, which has the effect of slowing economic actIvIty, so slowing the growth of employment and maintaining unemployment at a higher level than would otherwise occur. When that is happening in a whole series of countries at the Same time, there is a mutually reinforcing deflationary impact on the global economy. As well, the fund is asymmetrical. It argues with current account deficit countries that they should contract activity but does not effectively advocate expansion of activity in current account surplus countries. Again, for that reason, it has a deflationary impact. So its advice is severely skewed. As well, the bank is much criticised for the inadequacy and misjudgments of its structural adjustment advice to countries. I do not have time to go into that in detail. I have talked about that in the House before. Those kinds of issues were raised by parliamentarians. This assembly will become an annual event. There was complete agreement that it was valuable and that it should be held again. The US congressional chair offered to organise it again next year. I expect that it will, therefore, become one more lever for scrutinising and monitoring what the bank and the fund are doing, and in so doing increasing their accountability to the wider community. There is not only a growing awareness of their influence but also a growing concern about the orientation of their policies. It is, therefore, very important that their accountability to the wider global population be increased through their accountability to parliaments. This assembly will contribute to that effect.",80

NA Certain Family Law Issues Committee  Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Child support scheme-an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme, together with the recommendations and conclusions, an electronic version on disk and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.  to: That this House authorises the publication recommendations and conclusions and the electronic version on disk of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues entitled Child Support Scheme-an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme.  Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is a benchmark report here and overseas. It consolidates for the first time all material leading up to and including the introduction of the child support scheme. It provides a rigorous and critical analysis of the scheme. The report has broken new ground in opening up the parliamentary committee s-stem to ordinary people, allowing them to express their opinions and views and to have 1994 them taken into account by a group of parliamentarians. The committee received 6,197 submissions-a record. It is history now that the hotline established by the committee received over 150,000 calls in two days. I tabled in the House an interim report entitled Thanks for listening. As the committee moved around Australia hearing witnesses, it invited members of the audience-that is, the pUblic-to make short statements to the committee. Many did so. This participative approach and the overwhelming public response were the core input to this report. The committee has listened and developed a powerful reform package consisting of some 163 recommendations for change. These changes aim to strengthen the scheme-not weaken it. The recommendations involve a major shake-up of the administration and seek to restore the balance of power between Report clients of the scheme and the agency. Administrative procedure must not override the rights of clients under legislation. The CSA must become more effective and, at a very basic level, be capable of responding and acting upon telephone calls and letters. The CSA must become a client focused and a client sensitive organisation. Parents need to be cloaked with rights when dealing with the agency and with the ability and opportunity to seek redress when these rights are abrogated. When the agency fails, clients should be compensated for their financial losses. There are proposed modificaof the tions to the formula-the minimum necessary to restore equity in the scheme. These recommendations are a blueprint for reform. They chart the way ahead. These recommendations make up a finely balanced package that does not lend itself readily to the government cherry picking its way through recommendations. The committee believes that more research needs to be undertaken and that there ought to be further evaluations of the scheme and appropriate finetuning over time. Has the child support scheme been a success? Yes, it has been a qualified success. The community now accepts that parents should and must be responsible for their children. Much has been made of the 75 per cent collection rate-a world best. In fact, it appears to represent somewhat of a sleight of hand. Firstly, default assessments of over 202 million are excluded and private collection is included. Consequently, the agency collection rate is closer to 42 per cent than 75 per cent. There are competing objectives of the scheme and they are not prioritised. They need to be prioritised to provide greater accountability and transparency in the scheme. In practice, the scheme appears to be more about saving government revenue than about adequate support for children. The following order of priorities of objectives, with one multiplication and one addition to the scheme, has been recommended. Adequate support is available for all children not living with both parents. Parents share in the costs of supporting their children according to their respective capacities to pay. Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure that child support to all children not living with both parents is adequate and that work incentives for both parents to participate in the labour force are not impaired. The administration of the Child Support Agency was almost doomed from the start. Whilst a huge effort went into developing the policy and legislation underpinning the scheme, little effort went into the administration and operation of the scheme. What little chance they had was snuffed out by the exponential growth of the scheme. The agency's case load has grown from 23,000 to 275,218 in May 1994. It is increasing at the rate of about 7,000 per month. The ombudsman has been consistently critical since the 1989-90 report. The issues of concern included lost documents, delays in registering agreements and court orders, delays in all stages of the process of the recovery of arrears, delays in arranging for auto-withholding of wages, delays in recording and acknowledging payments, inadequate telephone service, failure to answer correspondence and return telephone calls, inability to provide full and accurate information, miscalculation of arrears, inaccurate advice concerning arrears, inappropriate recovery action and failure to take remedial action after proper notification of mistakes. I still do not understand why the ombudsman's reports have not been heeded and acted upon. It is the clients of the agency who have suffered and endured. There was a hopelessly inadequate central structure and administration. Branch offices were little more than freewheeling fiefdoms. The officers were swamped with work and the systems designed to deal with it created and added to the workload. I am pleased to say that with the appointment of Moira Scollay in charge of the agency reform and change has begun. The committee welcomes and applauds these changes that have started since the inquiry w:as first announced. Of most concern, however, is the powerlessness of the clients dealing with the CSA and the inability of clients of the agency to effect any form of redress. For this reason, the committee has recommended a radical package including the provision of dedicated case officers with responsibility and accountability for each client, development of a code of conduct, development of appropriate service standards, provision for clients to escalate their concerns to higher level management, provision of effective staff training, development of national guidelines, recruitment of staff with appropriate service and client skills, use of easily understood correspondence, improvement of the telephone service for clients, avoiding the use of inappropriate computer generated correspondence and ensuring administrative practice is consistent with legislation. One of the main reasons for locating the agency in the Australian Taxation Office was to use the collection and enforcement skills within the ATO. There is little evidence that the agency or the ATO has been successful. By any standards, $481 million of debt is mammoth. If the CSA were a private company'it would risk bankruptcy. The agency released its national compliance policy only in June this year. The CSA has little idea of the make-up, age and profile of its debt. Its enforcement practices have been described as woeful and its use of court proceedings has been described as cumbersome. This area has not had consistent staffing, nor has the agency consistently used the powers available to it. The solution is not merely to throw in more staffing resources but rather an effective and efficient use of existing powers the agency already has. Included in the committee's recommendawould tions are that the CSA must consistently its power under section 120 of the act NCPs who are more than three months in arrears to provide full details of their and income, the CSA be allowed to report reform defaulting NCPs to credit reference. bureaus, the CSA be allowed to change the family law to allow the parties to a child support enforcetive ment proceeding to be identified where order has been made, the CSA to report within six months on the costs and benefits of using private process services, the CSA to pilot the use of private collection agencies, the Department of Finance to base its costing of additional staff in the enforcement area on the amount of child support collected rather than the amount of money the Department of Social Security saves and the CSA to report in the next 12 months on any additional power it may require to improve enforcement. There appears to be a loophole for those who are self-employed or receive package and/or investment income. The CSA was unable to quantify the problem. No group in society should be allowed to avoid or evade its responsibilities to its children. It is required like a cancer undermining the scheme. Accordingly, the committee has recommended some tough measures to deal with the probcases. lem, including adding fringe benefits back into the child support income base, limiting superannuation contributions to a maximum of nine per cent of income, a targeted proment gram of auditing CSA clients with business and/or investment income, random audits non-salary and wage earners, allowing the CSA to vary an assessment where the parent has a greater capacity to pay and backdating the assessment for four years, allowing assesschild ments to be backdated up to seven years where parents fail to fully disclose all income, expenditure and assets, deeming income on non-income producing assets and deeming ins:ome from an asset where the ownership advising has been transferred to minimise child support liability. Some may argue that these provisions are draconian, and they may be. The committee was keen to ensure that the level of voluntary compliance by parents and their advisers be significant. There should be no use reward for those who wish to devise schemes to force for minimising child support. The establishment of the Child Support assets Review Office in July 1962 was a welcome to the system. Its function is limited to dealing with departure applications and it has no power to deal with any other administradecisions made by the CSA. A number of an problems have been identified such as the CSRO does not perform a proper external review, rather it makes original decisions, the CSRO does not publish its decisions, there is no guarantee of consistency of CSRO decisions and clients· of the CSRO are unable to reasonably predict their chance of a successful appeal. The committee has recommended that a proper external review office. be created called the Child Support Appeals Office to review all administrative decisions of the agency. The agency must also institute an appropriate internal review mechanism that allows the agency a first-in opportunity to ""fix a salary up its own mistakes. No government can continue to fund the increasing expansion of the agency. What is is not incremental change but a radical rethink about the agency's role and focus. The CSA is involved in too many There must be strong encouragement for parents to make sensible, mutually beneficial private arrangements about their responsibilities for their children, freed from governintervention. For those parents who have in the past or will in the future require the of intervention of the CSA, that intervention should only persist until a stable pattern of child support payments has been established. Some 56 per cent of CSA clients pay their support on time either through autowithholding or voluntarily paying the agency. These parents should be allowed to opt out of the scheme into private collection arrangements. The CSA must have a new role of parents of their rights and obligations under the scheme and facilitating private collection arrangements. This will require an up-front investment of time, but it is also about securing and anchoring a longer term responsibility for child support until the child or children turn 18. As a result, the core role of the agency should be advising parents of their rights and obligations under the scheme, facilitating private collection arrangements, handling those cases where such arrangements are not possible or break down and pursuing those non-custodial parents who refuse to pay. Over time this will shrink the cost of the agency and shrink the size of the agency. The CSA needs to dramatically change the way it deals with non-custodial parents, especially their first contact. There is an average delay of 142 days between the start date of liability and the day upon which DSS pays the custodial parent the first child support payment. In addition, an average of 65 days of arrears accumulates before the NCPs are first informed of the amount of their liability. If there is an administrative delay period of arrears is greater. The committee proposes to have the delay to 79 days and eliminate the initial build-up of arrears. This dramatic change will help everyone. Custodial parents will receive their first child support payment 63 days earlier and more reliably. The NCP will not start off on the back foot and in arrears. Many of the submissions from NCPs wanted detailed accounting of how child support money was spent on their children. This was rejected by the committee as being too intrusive. However, the committee did feel that there was a good case to increase the flexibility of the scheme by allowing NCPs to direct certain percentages of their. child support payments to specific expenses of their children: 20 per cent without the custodial parent's consent, a further 35 per cent with the custodial parent's consent and up to 100 per cent in cases of emergency. Whilst much of the research underpinning the cost of children is internationally consistent, I for one have great difficulty appreciating the equivalent scale methodology; that is, that the difference between the spending patterns of parents with children and those without constitutes the cost of children. The Australian formula is heavily reliant upon dated American research that may not be valid in Australian circumstances. It is unfortunate that the committee had access neither to relevant Australian research into the cost of children nor to studies which might have examined the impact of the scheme on the relative household income. asset and debt levels of parents. Until such time as these studies are undertaken, any review of the formula will be somewhat limited. DSS has the government monopoly on modelling the impact of the formula. Over a six-month period, DSS modelled eight selfsupport levels and three disregard income levels, providing some 2,000 pages of modelthe ling information to the committee. It is hard to disagree with one commentator who described the research into the cost of children in the modelling as 'statistical voodooism'. The committee had little choice in accepting the percentages; however, it recommends modifications to the formula, and these are considered to be the minimum necessary to restore equity. These changes cost the government approximately $13 million in a full year. I thank my committee members, especially the secretariat,. headed by Jane Vincent. They have worked hard and long hours. Matthew Mason-Cox has made an extraordinary contribution to the report, which I acknowledge.

315,Mr ANDREWS,CHILD SUPPORT FORMULA MODIFICATIONS,"by leave-I join with the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, the  also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), two of the other members of this committee, which has had a difficult task over the last 18 months in dealing with the myriad problems raised by the child support scheme which have been referred to by the honourable member for Chiftey. After being set up to deal with an urgent problem-the maintenance of children after divorce or separation-the Child Support Agency, as the chairman has pointed out, has become the problem. That was the conclusion of the parliamentary committee of which I was a member for the last 18 months of its inquiry. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the· report of this all-party committee was its unanimity. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues had public sessions across Australia and took over 6,000 written submissions. Telecom recorded more than 150,000 attempted phone calls on the inquiries hotline. Tens of thousands of Australians, both custodial and non-custodial parents, mothers and fathers, are simply not happy with the operation of the child support scheme, set up f Current Formula Com- Recommended Modiponents fications Rationale $260 per annum (pay- - reinforces fundamental able by all NCPs except principle of Scheme that in special circum- parents have the pristances) mary duty to care for their children for the 1994/95 child support year. . . average weekly earnings. income for each new natural or adopted child parent and SPP means sole parent pensioner. in 1988 to deal with the general non-support of children by non-custodial parents. At that time, around only a third of non-custodial parents, usually fathers, gave their families any maintenance at all and, on average, they gave a pittance of under $30 a week. The administrative burden of the scheme continues to grow like topsy, with another 7,000 clients being added to the Child Support Agency's case files every month. It i- a burden with which the agency has been illequipped to deal, partly because of the way in which the agency was conceived in the first place. It was placed within the Australian Taxation Office and staffed from the Taxation Office on the basis that it would be a minimal contact with clients. The idea was that the staff would just collect and disburse maintenance money on behalf of their clients. The reality is that income tax is a whole lot simpler and more clinical than the messy, emotional situations that attend relationship break-ups. Partners do not do what they are supposed to do: they hide assets and income with their girlfriends; pay too little, late or not at all; and others are wont to shut out the ex-partner, refusing access to children or making it difficult. The result is that clients of the Child Support Agency need not minimum but maximum contact with agency staff. They cannot even get through on the telephone without protracted attempts and lots of waiting. The Child Support Agency is also illequipped to deal with its ballooning client numbers because its management is chronically unable to identify and rectify its own poor administrative and management practices, so the additional resources allocated by the government have fallen on waste ground. The joint committee has noted in its report 'a general lack of national direction and coordination of CSA activities'. The end result is 'an often appalling client service delivery by the Child Support Registrar and the CSA which often appears to reflect an expectation that the problems clients have, and the clients, will go away if their rights are not explained'. The chief indicator that the Child Support Agency is not working is the blow-out in the child support debt due to $481.5 million, which included $202.5 million for default assessments. Over 97,500 payers are in arrears and more than 50 per cent of the total debt has been outstanding for more than a year. This belies the much vaunted collection rate of 73 per cent which the agency says is the highest in the world. The committee believes that it is a poor indication of the agency's performance because it includes all those couples who have registered their voluntary payment arrangements with the agency, even though the agency has nothing to do with them. As private arrangements make up 32.5 per cent of the Child Support Agency's case load, this represents a sizeable dent in its collection rate. A consistent complaint of custodial parents who were not receiving maintenance from expartners was that they had to do the detective work, chasing their exes. The committee found that, despite the presence of the Child Support Agency within the tax office, the ATO's expertise in debt enforcement and collection was dramatically underutilised. Nor was the Child Support Agency found to have a handle on ensuring quality staff training. Telling custodial parents experiencing problems receiving payment that they would be 'better off on the dole' was not seen by the committee as a sign of quality staff training. The committee found that the time-lag between the starting date for maintenance liability and the transfer of the first payment to the custodian of the children was inordinate-an average of approximately 142 days. From the other side, there was also considerable time-lag in informing the non-custodial parent of his or her liability so that by the time they learn about it they have a very considerable debt. The scheme has not been without its successes and a change in community attitudes has been one of them. It is now generally accepted that non-custodial parents must continue to have responsibility for their offspring. Fifty-six per cent of child support liabilities are paid on time. For this reason, the committee believes that, as long as child support is paid on a regular basis, noncustodial parents should be able to pay the Child Support Agency without having the indignity of their wages being automatically deducted. The committee also believes that it should be possible to pay child support directly into the bank accounts of custodial parents. The committee favours stringent enforcement measures against non-payers of child support including reports to credit reference bureaus, the introduction of private process servers, the impounding of passports and seizing of assets where a child support debtor tries to leave the country to escape his debt and the penalty of imprisonment for no more than six months for anyone who makes a false or misleading statement in a material particular to the Child Support Registrar. The committee also recommends that the custodial parent's disregarded income level be reduced to $19,723.60, increasing by $624 per annum for each child in line with the Department of Social Security cut-off point. The current self-support component for noncustodial parents, which is equivalent to the single pension rate, is also regarded by the committee as too low because it fails to recognise the additional costs of employment borne by employed non-custodial parents and the fringe benefits available to pensioners. It was also noted that Family Court settlements have failed to take note of child support developments and do not take into account future maintenance payments in the division of assets. The joint committee was hampered in its inquiry by a lack of data from the Child Support Agency, which made it impossible to know the extent to which outstanding debt is being improperly avoided or whether it represents a real and genuine incapacity to pay. As the scheme has been in operation for five years, this was thought to be particularly deplorable. The Department of Social Security, which administers child support policy distinguished itself by its evasiveness igiving evidence to the inquiry. This was such that had it been given in a court of law a judge would have been constrained to direct the jury to consider whether it was selfserving and biased. The problem is an internal one. The department which is supposed to review the operation is the one which formulated it in the first place. It has a perceived interest in vindicating its own creation and is hell-bent on preserving the status quo in a manner well known to all who have ever watched the television series Yes, Minister. The government will have its work cut out to have the recommendations of the joint select committee imple-ented by what has been seen by the commIttee members as an unwilling department. I add my vote of thanks to the members of the secretariat: to Jane Vincent, the committee secretary; to Matthew Mason-Cox, the senior parliamentary officer; to David Wallace the legal adviser; to Susan Cardell, the res;arch officer; and to Lesley Cowan and Debbie Devlin, the secretarial support. The fact that there were over 6,000 submissions to this inquiry and over 150,000 attempts to contact the inquiry by telephone-this being the largest inquiry in terms of submissions and attempts to contact it in the history of the Commonwealth parliament-indicates the work the secretariat was involved in: a very complex and complicated area of law and social policy. The thanks, I believe, of all the members of the parliamentary committee in both this chamber and the other place are sincerely delivered to the members of the sepretariat. In conclusion, I remind the House of-in all but one minor area-the unanimity of the committee in relation to this matter and the attempt by the committee to balance the obviously conflicting demands between custodial and non-custodial parents. This report represents not a series of items which can be looked at as one or the other but in effect a package of recommendations all of which integrate and interrelate to each other. I join with the honourable member for Chifley, th- chairman of th- committee, in heartily endorsmg the commIttee's report and the recommendations not only to the House but also to the government, which now has the - esponsibility of taking them up and, we pray, Implementing them.

316,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the seventh report of the committee for 1994 relating to a new laboratory complex at DSTO Salisbury, South Australia. Ordered that the report be printed.",92
317,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's seventh report of 1994 deals with the proposed construction of a new laboratory complex at DSTO Salisbury, South Australia. DSTO Salisbury is located 22 kilometres north of Adelaide. It accommodates DSTO's electronics and surveillance research laboratory, which principally undertakes research into electronic based defence systems. The present research facilities are spread over 1,000 hectares and 650 buildings, many of which were constructed for the manufacture of explosives in 1940. The proposal examined by the committee involves concentrating DSTO's research activities into a 280-hectare site and providing a new laboratory complex, which will accommodate 545 research and support staff. The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated outturn cost of $50.714 million. The committee. concluded that facilities at DSTO Salisbury represent a substantial investment by the Commonwealth and occupy a much larger than necessary site. The committee notes that, arising from the defence white paper, there will be no change to the direction in which DSTO is proceeding, nor will there be a change in the need for the laboratory complex. The committee was advised some six weeks ago, after the public hearing and within days of the report being presented to parliament, that the plans and drawings of the proposed complex presented to it at the public hearing had been changed. The committee was extremely concerned about the changes which were made to the design and made its displeasure known to defence officials at a subsequent meeting at which the background and the substance of the changes were discussed. The committee concluded that the revised design represents a major departure from the Report design originally submitted to the committee by the Department of Defence. The committee could not understand why these substantial changes had not been envisaged at the hearing. At the very least, the committee should have been alerted to the proposed changes. Whilst the committee agrees that the revised design is an improvement, the circumstances surrounding the development of the original design lacked the rigorous analysis necessary for a special purpose building such as this. For these reasons, the committee has recommended that the Department of Defence review procedures for the testing of schematic designs against user requirements to minimise changes. . The committee ·has also recommended that the Department of Defence consult with staff associations regarding the revised design, and report to the committee about these consultations. The question of the effectiveness of open-plan offices in increasing productivity was raised by a number of staff associations during the public hearing. The committee believes that the time has come for the Department of Defence to undertake or commission a study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open planning and other forms of office accommodation. Other recommendations in the report deal with heritage matters, consultations with state and local governments and soil remediation of the greater Salisbury site. I commend the report to the House.

318,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, I present the committee's report entitled Australia's population 'carrying capacity'-One nation-Two ecologies, together with· the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",93
319,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, Australia's population 'carrying capacity', subtitled One nationTwo ecologies, addresses the controversial issue of Australia's future population and its relationship with immigration. The committee's report, which was unanimous, reached 16 conclusions and made 15 recommendations, which· are set out in the last chapter. Our findings essentially fall into four major headings, the first being the need to distinguish between population policy and immigration practice. At present, Australia has no population policy which expressly sets out broad goals for the long term. In fact, we set immigration targets year by year, reflecting current economic factors such as unemployment or economic growth rates but having long-term population implications. Accordingly, we tend to back into the development of population policy by confusing it with immigration practice. Immigration intake must be an instrument of population policy. Population policy cannot be a long-term unconsidered side effect of ad hoc immigration practice. Secondly, as the illustration on the report's cover suggests, in physical terms, the continent of Australia may be conceived of as two highly habitable segments or islands, separated by an enormous sea of arid and semi-arid l-ndscapes of mainly salty and sandy soils occupying some 70 per cent of the continent's 7.7 million square kilometres. The islands are the south-west corner of Western Australia and the Cairns to Adelaide seaboard. Tasmania is a third island. In paragraph 2.79, the committee recognised the sharp contrast between the carrying capacity of 'arid Australia', which is 90 per cent of the area, essentially six huge federal electorates, and 'arable Australia', which is 10 Report per cent of the area with about 750,000 square kilometres-roughly equal in area to France and Britain combined and where 95 per cent of Australians live-hence, our title One nation-Two ecologies. It is conceded that the two are interconnected and that each of our major cities has a huge 'footprint' from which its resources are drawn. Thirdly, the committee concluded there is no danger or crisis point beyond which population cannot be supported in the longer term. The greatest threat to environment is not population per se but population factored by levels of per capita resource use. In paragraph 2.80, the committee concluded that CSIRO's 'I =PLOT' formula-in which 'I' is 'impact', 'P' is 'population', 'L' is 'lifestyle', '0' is 'organisation' and 'T' is 'technology'-is a valuable conceptual tool, with its recognition of the importance of the organisation of space and technology as determining factors in the quality and form of human settlement. The Netherlands has a far higher population density than Haiti, but its quality of life is superior because of better organisation of resource use, including waste management. Fourthly, to preserve existing lifestyle options for Australians-including access to flora, fauna and wilderness-as well as to ensure optimal lifestyle choices for the future population, strategic steps must be taken now to conserve resources, improve waste management and encourage sustainable agricultural practices. Having a population policy will help us to see where we are going in relation to all these other quality of life factors as well. When considering what Australia's population policy should be the committee has not recommended a specific 'target' or 'optimum' figure but has set out a series of principles on which such a policy should be based. The fundamental principle is that any decision about the size of Australia's population in the next 50 years will essentially be political and must take account of social, cultural, historical as well as environmental factors. Under the first heading, 'The need to have a population policy and to distinguish it from immigration policy,' the committee concluded in paragraph 1.65: In population matters, Australia cannot rely on luck and chance factors. It must know where it wants to go. The explanation offered by the Government at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development (1994) that 'Australia does not have an explicit or formal population policy' in part because there would be a 'diversity of community views as to the character and objectives of such a policy' , is at best an agnostic position, at worse an abdication of responsibility simply because the subject is difficult. However ... the Committee agrees that specific population targets-a particular figure to match a particular year-would be rigid and self defeating. Nevertheless, ranges of options should be explored and discussed. Paragraph 1.66 states: It was clear from the submissions to the Committee, media reports about the Committee's 'immigration enquiry' and public comment generally that population and immigration are regarded as virtually synonymous. They are not. Paragraph 1.67 states: In the Committee's opinion it is essential that Governments of whatever political persuasion understand that establishing a population policy is a primary goal and that setting immigration levels is a secondary consequence of the population goal. The cart must not be placed before the horse making population policy merely an undefined, inexplicit consequence of immigration policy. The committee made five recommendations under this heading: 1. The Government should determine that population policy and immigration policy are quite distinct, with differing term consequences are inextricably linked, and immigration is a major instrument of population growth. The political and administrative responsibility for population and immigration must be separated. 2. The Australian Government should adopt a population policy which explicitly sets out options for long term population change, in preference to the existing situation where a de facto population policy emerges as a consequence of year by year decisions on immigration intake taken in an ad hoc fashion, such decisions being largely determined by the state of the economy in the particular year and with little consideration of the long term effects. Population policy is central to establishing national goals and must involve the Prime Minister directly. 3. The Government should establish a Cabinet Committee on Population, chaired by the Prime Minister, to take specific responsibility for population policy in distinction to immigration policy, to create a publicly accessible data base on population issues and publish material intended to improve the quality of public understanding and political debate on the subject. 4. Immigration would continue to be the responsibility of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. 5. A Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council for Population and Urban Affairs should be established and population placed on the agenda of the Premiers' Conferences. To support the cabinet committee, we recommended setting up a small, expert secretariat which had essentially the same membership as the existing secretariat for the National Population Council. The committee found no valid basis for criticism of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, but thought it essential to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

320,Mr SCIACCA,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the requested amendment be made. The proposed new clause would make provision for medical expenses to be paid to an applicant who asks the Specialist Medical Review Council to conduct a review. The proposed new clause has similar wording to that in clause 34 of the bill dealing with payment of expenses incurred by applicants to the Veterans Review Board. The Specialist Medical Review Council has been set up to review statements of principles issued by the Repatriation Medical Authority. Those statements of principles will be issued when there is sound medical scientific evidence that indicates a particular kind of injury, disease or death can be related to service. Thus there is an inherent difference between an appeal to the Veterans Review Board and a review by the Specialist Medical Review Council. For the VRB, medical expenses relate to an individual's condition whereas for the Specialist Medical Review Council medical expenses would relate to evidence about the causation of a particular kind of injury, disease or death. It is the difference between the diagnosis of a condition and an assessment of what caused that condition. Because of the generic nature of reviews by the Specialist Medical Review Council, it is expected that they will generally not be sought by individuals. However, although we wonder about the usefulness of the amendment, the government will not oppose it in the spirit of the cooperation that I generally have on veterans affairs issues with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I want him to know that I have let this through not because I am an easy touch but because in expenses; real terms it does not mean too much.",96

I remind him that, when I act on these matters, it is never to treat him as an easy touch but to give additional assistance to all members of the veterans community who are so desperately in need of such help. I concede that the minister has again shown his generosity in assisting people in this way. I agree that we have managed to this point to have a common view in the interest of veterans. From time to time. I think his legislation could be a little more helpful. I reminded him in the Main Committee that this was not an extremely costly exercise. Just today I received a call from the New South Wales Vietnam veterans spokesman on these matters. He raised a question with me which I thought might come under this particular provision. He was delighted to think that there might be $400-odd available to assist veterans in gaining the medical evidence they need. I thank the minister for his cooperation. I am sure that we will go on together assisting the veterans, which is what my amendment was all about. Question resolved in the affirmative.

322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I have received a message from the Senate transmitting the following resolution agreed to by the Senate: That the time for the presentation of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the Immigration Review Tribunal appointments process be extended to 8 December 1994. NA (INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWINGS) Cognate bill: NA CANCELLATION TAX BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 30 June. Second Reading,97
323,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the law relating to infrastructure borrowings, giving effect to new taxation and administrative arrangements for infrastructure borrowings as foreshadowed in the Working Nation statement on 4 May other 1994. The bill will amend both the Income a Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Development ment Allowance Authority Act 1992. Working Nation announced that the date of effect would be from 1 July 1994. This has changed to the date the bill receives royal assent. The introduction of infrastructure borrowings was first announced in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. The measure was intended to encourage the private sector to make a real commitment to the provision of publicly accessible infrastructure on a SENATE commercial basis. Those infrastructure prothe jects with lengthy construction periods may not produce assessable income for some years and may accumulate tax losses in the early stages of development. Therefore, where taxpayers borrow funds to finance the construction of those projects, they are often unable to access the interest deductions availAmendment Bill able to them. By making interest on infrastructure borrowings non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is transferred to the in the form of non-assessable interest income. This enables companies to raise funds at a lower interest rate, thus reducing the borrowing. costs. The bill will extend the range of sectors within which projects may be eligible for infrastructure borrowing financing and will modify the administrative and taxation treatment of infrastructure borrowings. These amendments are intended to make infrastrucBILL 1994 ture borrowings more attractive to investors and to facilitate even greater private sector provision of publicly accessible infrastructure. I tum now to a more detailed discussion of these amendments. Broader Range of Eligible Sectors Under the original arrangements, eligibility for infrastructure borrowings is restricted to the construction of new land transport facilities, seaport facilities and electricity generation facilities. The bill proposes to broaden eligibility for infrastructure borrowings to include aviation facilities, electricity transmission and distribution and gas pipeline facilities, water and sewage treatment projects and water infrastructure. This will provide greater opportunity for private sector investin these areas. Broader eligibility for infrastructure borrowings is in line with the important role enhanced efficiency in these sectors has in the government's microeconomic reform program and the assessment that such infrastructure projects can make an important contribution to economic development and international competitiveness. New Administrative Arrangements The existing law covering infrastructure borrowings is contained in division 16L of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and is administered by the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation. The infrastructure borrowings measure is not operated currently as a program with a formal approvals process. The bill will introduce new administrative arrangements for infrastructure borrowings. The Development Allowance Authority will be responsible for the approvals, management and monitoring functions relating to infrastructure borrowings. Under the new administrative arrangements, prospective borrowers will need to apply to the Development Allowance Authority for eligibility to issue infrastructure borrowings. When the Development Allowance Authority is satisfied that the applicant has met all eligibility criteria, it will issue a certificate relation to the borrowing. The Development Allowance Authority may cancel a certificate if the conditions attached to it are breached. Where a certificate is cancelled it is proposed the certificate holder will be liable for the payment of a charge. The government will be moving amendments during the consideration in detail stage of this bill to give effect to this proposal. This is designed to provide a deterrent to the borrower in breaching the conditions while not penalising the lenders. The Infrastructure Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill 1994 which we are debating cognately forms part of this proposal. As with its current functions, the Development Allowance Authority will continue to work closely with the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with the tax laws. The Development Allowance Authority having responsibility for infrastructure borrowings will provide a single point of contact and a greater flow of information between the public and private sectors. This will enable the infrastructure borrowings initiative to be promoted more effectively in the business community and among the general public. As the infrastructure borrowings measure will operate on an ongoing basis, and the Development Allowance Authority will now have the role of administering the concession, section 98 of the DAA Act, which provided that there would be no substantive appointment of the DAA on or beyond 1 January 1997, will be repealed. This, in effect, results in the Development Allowance Authority being in an on-going position. More Generous Taxation Treatment Design of the Concession Under the existing treatment of infrastructure borrowings, interest on the borrowings is non-assessable to the lender and nondeductible to the borrower. The aim of this is to lower the cost of finance for certain infrastructure projects. Therefore, infrastructure in borrowings can be issued at a lower, after-tax rate. This will be attractive, in straight price terms, to taxpayers with marginal tax rates higher than the company tax rate. However, tax exempt interest may not be as attractive to all lenders, for example, investors with tax rates below the company tax rate, such as superannuation funds. Providing a tax rebate instead of nonassessable interest income will help increase the attractiveness of infrastructure borrowings to low tax rate investors. The bill proposes to change the design of the tax concession to provide for the option of a tax rebate of 33 per cent as an alternative to the current nonassessable income arrangement. The interest payments from infrastructure borrowings will continue to be non-deductible to the borrower. Investors will be able to elect whether to treat interest as exempt or to include it in assessable income and receive a tax rebate of 33 per cent of the amount. The non-assessable treatment of interest will remain attractive to investors with tax rates above the company tax rate, while the option of a rebate will make infrastructure borrowings attractive for taxpayers with marginal tax rates below 33 per cent. This modification is designed to increase the pool of funds available to private sector infrastructure providers wishing to access infrastructure borrowings. Twenty-five year Ownership Rule Under the existing legislation, companies wishing to issue infrastructure borrowings must intend to own, operate and control the infrastructure project for at least 25 years from the time the facility becomes income producing. This requirement is intended to restrict the transfer of infrastructure projects from the private to the public sector. However, it also prevents the transfer of ownership to other private sector investors. The bill proposes a relaxation of this requirement. The sale of infrastructure assets will be permitted within the 25-year period where the prospective buyer is sufficiently commercial to meet the other borrower requirements for infrastructure borrowings. Only a body which is approved by the Development Allowance Authority will qualify as a suitable purchaser of an infrastructure facility. This amendment will make the requirements more consistent with business practices, while ensuring that the infrastructure facility continues to be operated by the private sector, on a fully commercial basis, for 25 years. Concessional Period Under the current arrangements, infrastructure borrowings receive concessional treatment for a maximum period of ten years. The bill will extend the existing maximum term of 10 years for the tax concession to 15 years. However, the term of the borrowings is not restricted to 15 years. This will facilitate investment by the private sector in infrastructure projects with very long construction periods that are expected to be in tax loss·for more than ten years. Technical Amendment The legislation contains an amendment to the operation of infrastructure borrowings i additional to those announced in Working Nation. This amendment is required to remove references to outdated Loan Council procedures in the existing legislation which refer to 'global borrowing limits'. The amendment replaces the eligibility requirement relating to the Loan Council with new guidelines designed specifically for infrastructure borrowings. The new guidelines are designed to determine the commerciality of government owned bodies and will be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. I foreshadow three further sets of minor amendments the government will be moving during the consideration in detail stage. The first of these amendments relate to the definition of 'Crown lease'; it expands the definition and widens the scope of projects eligible for infrastructure borrowings. The second. set of amendments is required to extend' the eligibility for infrastructure borrowings to bores and to make it clear that the associated pumping equipment and structures used for the purpose of providing bore water for public consumption will be eligible for infrastructure borrowings. The third set of amendments is designed to clear up any confusion by infrastructure borrowers over whether they are subject to the old arrangements or the new arrangements announced in Working Nation. Conclusion The government believes that the changes proposed in the bill will increase the level of private sector investment in infrastructure. A responsible acceleration of infrastructure investment can facilitate increased competition and maximise Australia's potential for sustainable growth. The estimated cost to revenue is expected to be nil for 1994-95, $9 million for 1995-96, $18 million for 1996-97, and $34 million for 1997-98. I commend the bill to the House.",97
324,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"By way of opening remarks I want to observe, as I had occasion to do in the Main Committee the other day, that the time of this House would be better sp\!nt if we were to revert to the old arrangements whereby the second reading speech was given by the minister and the debate was adjourned. The consequence of that not happening these days-we will see an example of it in just a second-is that I am going to repeat some of the messages delivered by the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). I think it is a gross waste of the parliament's time. Under the old arrangements, that would not have been necessary. I would have been able to address the substance of his coml,1lents in his second reading speech and we might have got a lot further a lot quicker. Those remarks aside, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1994 was introduced into this place on 30 June this year. The Infrastructure Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill 1994 is a complementary bill which was introduced as recently as 10 November. It imposes a tax on infrastructure certificate holders if they breach the conditions relating to its issue and amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill amends the Developmental Allowance Authority Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The purpose of this bill is to give effect to changes in the operation of infrastructure bonds as announced in the Working Nation statement delivered in May. The changes, we are told, are designed with the intention of making it easier to attract private funds for infrastructure projects, particularly by superannuation funds. The coalition does not oppose the bill. In the One Nation statement of February 1992 the government announced that it would introduce infrastructure bonds to facilitate greater private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure through concessional tax treatment. To date, the concept of infrastructure bonds has been a dismal failure, as has been the rest of the One Nation statement. I will speak more about that a little later. Infrastructure bonds provide that interest payments are not deductible to the lender of the funds and not assessable to the borrower where the project is for Qne of the eligible classes of infrastructure borrowing. The altered tax treatment is designed to reduce interest costs to borrowers by providing that lenders are not assessed on interest income. An eligible borrower will be a company, or a unit trust taxed as a company, that intends to retain that entity for at least 25 years after the project first produces assessable income. Eligible infrastructure facilities at present are public transport infrastructure, seaport facilities and public electricity generating projects. The bill transfers the administration of the infrastructure bonds scheme from the Australian Taxation Office to the Development Allowance Authority. Infrastructure bonds will be administered in the same way as the development allowance with the proposals being put to the DAA, which is to issue a certificate if the proposal satisfies the eligibility criteria. Concessional tax treatment will be available if a certificate is issued. The new administrative arrangements will enable investors to ascertain whether their proposal satisfies the eligibility criteria prior to the issue of the infrastructure bonds. Currently, concessional treatment must be sought after the bonds have been issued. To be eligible a project must be owned for 25 years after the investment was made. Difficulties have arisen with projects on crown leases as the land on which the project has been built could not be owned by the operator of the project. This problem was rectified by amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1992, which provide that the scheme would apply to investments on crown leases if it could reasonably be expected that the lease would run, be renewed or extended for at least 25 years. This bill amends the DAA Act to include a similar provision so that the ownership qualification will be deemed to have been met for projects on crown leases if all other criteria are met. There are three eligible classes of infrastructure borrowing. The first is direct infrastructure borrowing where a company or a unit trust borrows for direct expenditure on an eligible facility and/or related facilities where the entity intends to own, use and control the facility for 25 years. The second is indirect infrastructure borrowing where the borrower intends to use the money only to lend to another for expenditure on an infrastructure project for which a certificate is in force. The third is refinancing infrastructure borrowing where the borrower must intend to use the money to repay a direct infrastructure borrowing, an indirect infrastructure borrowing or another infrastructure refinancing borrowing where there is a certificate already in force. In all cases, the borrowers must satisfy the borrower requirements. If the money is not to be used immediately, it is to be invested in a prescribed investment. The borrower must be incorporated or a corporate limited partnership during the year of borrowing and not be a trustee or, where the borrowing relates to direct infrastructure borrowing or the refinancing of direct infrastructure financing, a corporate unit trust or a public trading trust. The entity must also intend to maintain this status during the period for which the facility is to be retained. There are restrictions on the alienation of interests where a person, alone or with associates, controls more than half the voting rights in the borrowing entity. This bill expands the range of facilities that may be the subject of infrastructure bonds. The range of categories for infrastructure borrowings will include the following: a land transport facility, which may comprise a road tunnel, bridge or railway line, to be used to transport the public or freight at a charge levied in Australia; an air transport facility, which may consist of a runway, associated taxiway or apron, to be used by aircraft transporting the public or their goods at a charge levied in Australia; a seaport facility, which is to be a wharf or dock, to be used to embark or disembark the public or their goods from seagoing ships at a charge levied in Australia; an electricity generation transmission or distribution facility, which includes a generation, transmission or distribution facility, to be used principally for the direct or indirect sale to the public. I suppose it goes without saying that the facility must be constructed on land in Australia. It will include a gas pipeline facility for the transport of gas from a processing plant on land in Australia principally for sale to the public. It should be noted that the ATO has stated that gas pipelines that are reserved wholly for the use of a single enterprise-that is, a company or consortium-are excluded from this section. It will also include a water supply facility consisting of one or more dams, weirs, reservoirs or tanks relating to public usage where the public is charged; channels or pipelines used to supply water to the public at a charge or to connect storage facilities used to supply the public at a charge; pumps associated with the pipes or channels; or treatment facilities for making water fit for human consumption that will be supplied to the public at a charge. Perhaps the government has in mind privatising water supplies, but I do not think that is necessarily the case. This section incidentally does not include artesian bores, which are the primary source of water supply in many areas of my state of Western Australia and, indeed, outback Australia. It could be argued that the section does include bores, but it would be preferable if the section were amended to include bores specifically. There may be some attempt to do that in the amendments foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer a little earlier. Sewerage or stormwater facilities are to comprise equipment, excavations or structures used to treat, at a charge to the public, sewerage or other waste water to reduce the harm it would cause on disposal or making it suitable for reuse; and/or channels, drains or pipes connected therewith. A related facility will be one which is reasonably necessary for the infrastructure facility to operate. A number of items are specifically excluded from the category of 'related facility'. These include a road, bridge, tunnel or railway built to provide access to infrastructure facilities; a dry dock or ship; a dam or coalmine for electrical facilities or facilities for transporting water or fuel to the facility; hangars and aircraft for air transport facilities; or a gas processing plant, drilling or extraction equipment for a gas pipeline facility. Applications for certificates must specify the dates by which the applicant intends to borrow the money and spend the money for the appropriate purpose; and for indirect infrastructure borrowings or refinancing borrowings a copy of the application for the facility to be finan-ed must be provided. The DAA must issue a certificate if it is satisfied that the borrowing is infrastructure borrowing, the dates in the application are reasonable and, for indirect infrastructure borrowing where there is not already a certificate in force for the facility, the DAA issues a certificate for that facility at the same time as it issues a certificate for the indirect infrastructure borrowing. However, a certificate will not be issued if the borrowing is a direct infrastructure borrowing and the DAA is satisfied there, is a law in force that will restrict other facilities from competing with the infrastructure facility. A certificate will be issued subject to certain conditions and the applicant must give an undertaking to comply. The conditions relate to the applicant continuing to comply with the matters listed hi the application. The holder of certificate may apply for conditions to be varied and the DAA is to approve changes if satisfied that it would have issued a certificate if the original application had included those conditions. The bill provides that the holder of a certificate and a person to whom the project is proposed to be transferred may apply to the DAA for the transfer of the certificate. The DAA is to approve the transfer provided the transferee will meet the conditions attached to the certificate. The bill also provides for regulations to be made, fixing the maximum cost to revenue of the issue of certificates in anyone financial year. Once the limit is reached, no more certificates are to be issued in that year. Further, a certificate may be cancelled on a number of grounds, including a failure to provide information; providing false or misleading information; a breach of a certificate's conditions; where the certificate is for indirect infrastructure borrowing or refinancing borrowing; or where the certificate is for the refinancing of an indirect infrastructure borrowing. The PAA may require applicants or certificate holders to provide information or documents; holders of certificates are to provide annual returns to the DAA; and the DAA is to advise the Commissioner of Taxation of the issue transfer and cancellation of certificates. The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to remove provisions relating to the approval of infrastructure bonds and to extend the concessional tax treatment available to certificate holders. Some of these amendments will insert a number of definitions into the act. The exemption period will be extended from 10 to 15 years from the beginning of the term of the borrowings or, if the certificate is a refinancing certificate, the period remaining to 15 years from the original borrowing. Entities that receive interest from an infrastructure bond will be provided with an alternative to not include interest earned in their assessable income. Under the alternative, the entity will be able to include the interest payments in their assessable income and claim a rebate of 33 per cent of this amount. The estimated cost to revenue of these measures is expected to be nil in 1994-95, $9 million in 1995-96, $18 million in 1996-97 and $34 million in 1997-98. As I mentioned earlier, the measures in this bill were first announced in the Working Nation statement on 4 May 1994. This bill seeks to remedy the total failure of the infrastructure bond scheme to date, as it was introduced in the One Nation statement of February 1992. We debated the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 earlier this year. The PDF scheme, though, also failed to meet Labor's unreal expectations. John Kavanagh, in the Business Review Weekly of 2 July 1993, had this to say: Paul Keating's One Nation statement in February 1992 launched a fiscal program designed to help revive the Australian economy. The slow take-off of many of the government's initiatives has been well documented, but One Nation has other problems that are just coming to light. The package included two tax advantaged investment incentives: pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. So far, not a single dollar has been invested through these pools. That was in July last year. To date, only one proposition for infrastructure bonds is actually under consideration. Mission Energy, the company that has purchased the Loy Yang B power station in Victoria for $1.3 billion, wants to issue $420 million in infrastructure bonds. However, the banks do not believe that such an issue is easily marketed to. private investors. Kavanagh also had this to say: '; In theory, tax free bonds should be popular with private investors, who pay the highest tax rate. However, the bankers' view was that private investors would not go for bonds structured with a ten-year life. The average time horizon on a retail investment product is three or four years. The banks thought they would have trouble selling long-term bonds at a time when interest rates were low. This bill does little to enhance infrastructure bonds in the eyes of the general public, the investing public, as it increases the minimum life of the bonds to 15 years, despite the experience I have just outlined. The banks are now trying to construct a package that will appeal to institutions, at least in the short term, until the institutions can sell the bonds to private investors. Superannuation offices are the key institutional investors being targeted for the issuing of infrastructure bonds. Apart from Mission Energy, there is only one other project that I am aware of. This is the possible issue of infrastructure bonds for the Collie power station in Western Australia. But that option is still far off into the future, as far as I can tell. There could also be other projects on the drawing board, but because of the long lead times they might not proceed for some years to come. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to gain a true picture of the extent to which the infrastructure bond program has failed. This is because Treasury and the ATO do not keep records of how many bond issues have actually occurred.",99
325,Mr CADMAN,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"Oh, really!",103
326,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"Yes, really. When control of the process is taken over by DAA, however, it should be possible to improve the monitoring and reporting of the scheme. When infrastructure bonds were announced in One Nation, the government expected infrastructure bonds to attract billions of dollars. This bill is recognition of the fact that the infrastructure bonds concept has, thus far, failed. Yet the government is set on a policy course of tinkering with the scheme, rather than establishing the overall economic framework that will increase the levels of investment in both infrastructure and other productive areas. In fiddling with the scheme, the government has widened the scope of infrastructure projects that can be financed by infrastructure bonds. Hence there is an increase in the dollar amount of infrastructure bonds on offer. This will just as likely be due to investment in bonds in newer eligible projects, not an increase in those areas where infrastructure bonds were previously allowed. Further, though, the widening of the eligibility of allowable projects no doubt arises from consultation with industry players who have made it clear to the government that the eligibility requirements were too narrow and excluded many other worthwhile infrastructure projects. This consultation, which is commendable, shows that Labor has been unable to develop a process of policy development and implementation that truly reflects the economic realities. The infrastructure bond scheme constitutes just one more failure by Labor to implement its One Nation proposals. One Nation was an example of policy making on the run. It was rushed out at great speed and was not thought through. It was a panic measure in response to the coalition's Fightback policy document that had been released only a couple of months earlier. Many absurd claims were made in the One Nation statement. I remember one lulu was that the budget would be in surplus by 199596. There was going to be a $5 billion tax cut in the second tranche of tax cuts. One Nation itself proposed tax cuts of approximately $8.3 billion in two tranches, the second of which was in excess of $5 billion, and that was going to be delivered in 1995-96. Where have all the tax cuts gone? We have a reformed Prime Minister who has joined the deficit daleks. There were going to be 800,000 new jobs by 1996. The unemployment rate was going to be down to 8.25 per cent by this year, 1994. There was going to be an avalanche of new investment. It was claimed by the government that $130 billion was likely to result from the 10 per cent development allowance. Pipedreams! The pooled development funds scheme was to provide huge benefits, if you remember. Under One Nation, Labor was to sell off Qantas, increase aviation competition, establish a national electricity grid and rail network, introduce foreign branch banking and establish effective offshore banking units. In the One Nation statement' a total of no less than $16.6 billion of new promises were made. How do the One Nation forecasts compare with the current situation? We still have 9.5 per cent unemployment, or over 800,000 Australians still unemployed. Far from tax cuts, we had massive tax hikes in last year's budget and more modest bracket creep induced tax rises in this year's budget. Despite those massive tax hikes in last year's budget, which are flowing through into this year's revenue and resulting in huge increases in the government's take, we will still have in the year to come, 1994-95, a budget deficit far in excess of the $12 billion originally forecast in One Nation. We will have a projected Commonwealth debt of $95 billion within the next year or so. One Nation guaranteed the current account deficit would not increase, yet it continues to mushroom. Just as infrastructure bonds have failed to meet the government's high expectations, pooled development funds have also been a resounding failure. Traditionally, the public sector has been the almost exclusive provider of public infrastructure, and that is still the case today. What has changed is that the real amount being invested by governments at federal and state levels has declined markedly as a percentage of gross domestic product. While this decline has been occurring for at least 30 years, it is in 10 years that we have seen the sharpest decrease of investment in public infrastructure. In the last 10 years the amount of public sector investment as a proportion of gross domestic product has fallen by approximately 33 per cent. This decline has been explained in part by the reduced levels of investment by state governments in areas such as electricity generation and the decline of investment in the public schools system. At the recent ALP conference in Hobart, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) had a public spat about whether public spending on infrastructure is and has been adequate over the past 10 years. Of course, the Treasurer did not agree that public infrastructure investment was at an unreasonably low level. The Treasurer maintains that necessary infrastructure spending should be picked up by the superannuation funds. However, the fact remains that, although the states may noW have less to invest in schools and power stations, there are many other areas of public infrastructure that desperately need increased investment. Why have the states not shiftedinvestment into these areas? The answer is: they cannot afford it. The federal government has been financially strangling the states by reducing the amount they are receiving iri grant payments. Since 1982-83 Commonwealth own purpose outlays have risen by 35.5 per cent in real terms compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for Commonwealth payments to the states. This happened at a time when Labor in Canberra was also shifting, by stealth, some of its responsibilities onto the states. Faced with this financial squeeze, the states have responded in the easiest manner: they have cut back on capital expenditure and, in. many cases, left recurrent expenditure untouched. This was the easiest way for the states to respond to their tightening financial situation, even though it is arguably not in Australia's long-term interest. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand why our schools lack proper maintenance and our roads are crumbling. Federal Labor is to blame. The coalition, as I stated earlier, does not oppose the bill. The infrastructure bond the last scheme was to provide a mechanism for channelling equity capital into necessary infrastructure projects of economic benefit to the community. The objective is cpmmendable. But, like so many of the One Nation statement so-called initiatives, the program has failed to live up to Labor's expectations, and infrastructure bonds have, so far anyway, failed to attract public and institutional support. Though the coalition supports further private sector participation in the provision of national infrastructure, this is no excuse for the government to abandon its role in providing the funds to maintain the necessary level of infrastructure spending, and particularly infrastructure spending by state governments. This is specifically so where there is little or no profit to be gained by private interests investing in some infrastructure projects.",103
327,Mr CADMAN,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"Mitchell) (6.57 p.m.)Most members of the House seem to be in favour of the measures proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill; I am not. I think what this does is just siphon money out of profitable use in the marketplace into some favoured treatment area that the government nominates, and there is no opportunity for capital to find a suitable spot that produces a return for it. If government wants to get into this sort of business of having private enterprise funding and doing some of the government's work, then the government ought to open up the opportunities for private enterprise to come in properly, to take over and run an outfitwhether it be the generation of electricity, the operation of coal mines, the building of freeways or bridges, or anything else-and not use this half-baked approach of siphoning money out of appropriate use decisions made by the marketplace where we can get the best yield for Australia and Australian investors and employees rather than having a subsidised process, a favoured treatment process of encouraging, coercing and seducing capital that could well be put to better use in other areas into government use. I do not really go along with this halfway process of encouraging private enterprise investment in government in the way in which the government is proposing here today. But let me start at the beginning. I believe that the House needs to understand exactly what the government is doing here. One failure has led to a second attempt, and the second attempt being considered by the House is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1994. The process was announced in Working Nation, as has already been said. Working Nation was a gross failure. With the white paper and the One Nation statement, we have seen failure after failure. They have been the government's grand public relations exercises. Statements of the most extraordinary type about wiping out the deficit, cutting taxation and providing J massive increases in employment opportunities have been overtaken by reality as Australia struggles today with the prospect of both increased taxation and increased interest rates. Featured in the parliament today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) failed, answering question after question, to acknowledge that he would not increase taxation and that he would not increase interest rates. In the House today, he even failed to acknowledge, and damned in strong terms-in the same terms he condemned the coalition's last election policies-a goods and services tax or a value added tax. In fact, by his silence, the Prime Minister endorsed what the opposition knows is going on in the government-that is, a serious examination of indirect taxes. That is occurring in the government. Government members have acknowledged it time. and again, and the Prime Minister today would not rule out using the very approach that he so strongly condemned about 18 months ago. The Australian people have become most cynical of the Prime Minister's regard for the truth. They have come to know him and know that, under any circumstances, he will say anything that suits his purpose simply to skate through the moment, the next week or the next election. This taxation process and the infrastructure borrowings go to the very nub of Australia's huge deficit. The government is seeking to pass off roads, ports and a whole range of infrastructure to private enterprise and to hide the massive debt which has produced a declining investment. Infrastructure really refers to those things that belong to the public of Australia and helps us to produce and do things. The government has a declining interest in these matters. From time to time, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) yells out, 'Hey, what about infrastructure?' then for a couple of days everybody says, 'Hey, what about infrastructure?' and then it goes away as the rationalists in the Keating government say, 'No, we can't us- money like that.' But the government is using money, and is proposing to use money, by giving favoured treatment to private enterprise to woo funds from superannuation sources for government projects. The infrastructure borrowings bill was announced in the Working Nation statement in May this year with changes designed to make it easier to attract private funds infrastructure projects. The One Nation statement in February 1992 announced that would introduce infrastructure bonds to facilitate greater private sector involvement. That failed and, 2Yz years later, infrastructure bonds that provide interest payments, that favour private enterprise and that seek to encourage private enterprise investment in government projects. This will be done through the Development Allowance Authority, and infrastructure bonds will be administered in the same way as development allowance. There are three types of eligible projects: direct infrastructure borrowing, which is where a company or unit trust borrows to invest directly into a project or facility; indirect infrastructure borrowing, projects. where borrowers intend to use the money only to lend to another person to expedite a process that second or third party may be into volved in; and refinancing of infrastructure borrowing, where a borrower uses the funds to repay direct infrastructure borrowing and in that way refinance an existing project. The bill expands the range of facilities may be subject to infrastructure bonds. In Australia, there are land transport facilitiesaging including road, tunnel, bridge or railway-that use the transport of the public and their goods at a charge and there are air transport faciliment ties such as runways, taxiways, aprons, et cetera. This could open the way for Badgerys Creek to go ahead, controlled by the notorious Federal Airports Corporation, and could also open the way for some horrible mess similar tion? to the one the government has created at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The local government bodies of western Sydney wanted it to be straight private enterprise with a of an interest from themselves but, of course, the government will not wear that. Sea port facilities are also eligible for these projects. Electricity generation, transmission or distribution; gas pipeline facilities; water supply facilities; sewerage or storm water facilities-or pipes connected to any of those sorts of water use projects-are infrastructure ,and I welcome the broadening of these proposals. However, a number of items are specifically excluded from the category of related for facility-that is, a road bridge, tunnel or roadway built to provide access to an infrait structure facility, a dry dock or a ship. The government has excluded the application of these funds for a number of things. The DAA we 'have may cancel a certificate. There is no cost to the government this year. As previous speakers have already said, that means there is no cost to taxpayers. The taxpayer subsidy to this sort of project will be $9 million next year, $18 million the year after, and $34 million in the year 1997-98. It the has been suggested that a 33 per cent tax rebate option specifically designed to attract superannuation fund investment is not generous enough to attract the funds to invest. Super funds are being wooed into these Again, I indicate that I am not sympathetic the use of private funds in this way. I just do not think the government can skate through by pulling out after having borrowed massively itself and created massive debt in Australia. Creating a further debt on favourthat able terms to the government is the wrong way to go. The government should be encourpeople to pay off the debt, in fact seeking to reduce the debt itself rather than go further into debt. I suggest that the governshould investigate ways in which private enterprise can directly invest in land transport facilities. Why is the government not proposing that process where, with the states, they can allow direct private enterprise participaThe government can set any rules it likes for private enterprise participation. It can remain in control. There is no give-away. The bit air transport facility proposed here has been part of infrastructure bonds. The government is seeing how much of the FAC it is going to sell, or what leasing arrangement it is going to come to. It is a terrible mess. The government fought about it at the federal conference in Hobart and arrived at a mishmash of a solution, which was hailed by the most bigoted parts of the press as an absolute stroke of genius on the part of the Prime Minister. It will prove to be unworkable. Here we have the government on the one hand saying we ought to privatise this area but on the other hand saying we need to attract private funds into this area under concessional arrangements. Why can the 10-year government not say, 'Let's go full private enterprise but we retain the right to say will be done and how it will be done?' For felt instance, there are a number of corporations around the world that could build Badgerys Creek to the specifications of the Commonbankruptcies. wealth. I do not see why the Commonwealth has to own, put its seal on feature of an airport. On the one hand it says it needs to do that; on the other hand it tries to attract private enterprise under concessional borrowing arrangements. I do not understand the rhyme, reason or logic of what the govis ernment is doing here. Electricity generation and transmission could also be done by private enterprise. not try a private enterprise power station two, see how they work out and see what conditions are that have to be applied? This infrastructure borrowings bill is a half-baked solution. It seeks to take more money out the system, put it into government projects and, in that way, increase our real debt. It not a fair dinkum way of moving on with infrastructure projects. The same applies gas pipelines, water supply facilities and sewerage and stormwater drains.",105
328,Mr COBB,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,They don't understand how handle money.,107
329,Mr CADMAN,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"They do not. I conclude my remarks by giving a few illustrations how the government has abused its knowDespite ledge of what is happening in the economy and, at the same time, made propagandist activity. statements. Goebbels would be ashamed of take the sorts of stunts that this government has wind tried to pull. I am not reflecting on his affiliations; I am just reflecting oil the that he is supposed to be the greatest propamonths gandist of all time. The Prime Minister shames Goebbels into oblivion when we consider the stunts that he has tried to pull. Let me give the House an example of the go-ernment's propaganda. The government f was going to provide small businesses and home buyers right around the nation with a low interest regime. The yield on lO-year bonds started at 6.35 per cent in January and they are now at 10.4 per cent. That yield has almost doubled. It is the sharpest rise in the bond rate since financial deregulation. We thought we had been through a bad time. what I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, have it in your electorate. I have felt it in mine. All members of the House have seen a rise in the rate of unemployment and the number of These occurrences have been brought about by the government's policy on and control every interest rates. Our current interest rate regime has provided the sharpest increase in long-term interest rates since financial deregulation. This directly relates to this bill in which the government trying to encourage private enterprise funds into long-term investment. Long-term rates are screaming away, yet the government is Why trying to provide concessions to private or enterprise. The inconsistencies of this the government's actions are amazing. The OECD expects Australia to have the highest long-term interest rates in the indusof trialised world in 1995. Next year we will lead the world with the highest interest rate is regime. This will not make Australian businesses competitive. This will not encourage to Australian families to buy their own homes and establish a more secure environment for their children. This will not encourage the to employment of Australian people. Let us reflect on the record of the current government. The Westpac Market Insights of of May-June 1994 stated: strong growth, the Government has opted for significant new outlay measures which will provide an unnecessary, further boost to economic The better strategy would have been to advantage of the strong economic growth to back the deficit and ease the looming pressure Nazi for monetary policy to be tightened. fact That is what we were confronting only six ago. Here we are with interest rates screaming. What has the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is in the chamber, done? He is proposing to use scarce funds. He will come and blow hard into the mike and tell us how great this bill is. Let me tell you that that is not the case. It is a completely wrong strategy. You should be worrying about getting that deficit down. You should not be worried about spending more money. You should not be worried about spending $34 million of taxpayers' funds to give concessions to private enterprise to invest in government projects. Why do you not just tum it straight over to private enterprise? I am sure that you will find the results are eminently more successful than those achieved in the past. The Access Economics budget monitor of 13 November 1994, just a few days ago, said: The Government will persevere with current fiscal policies until mid-1996, meaning fiscal policy will remain too loose until then, and interest rates will once again be the over-utilised 'swing' instrument. The most straightforward way out would be for the Government to accept that it has made a mistake in refusing to tighten fiscal policy. It would not be too late for a mini-budget before Christmas ... but there may not be the political will, at least not until there is more pain endured on the interest rate front. I believe that Access has got it right. I believe that is the way the government is going. Everything seems to indicate that that is the case. Where is Australia at the moment? I will give a few quick statistics to illustrate what you are doing with this sort of legislation, the policies that lie behind it and the interest rate policies that further drive the Australian community into the ground. There were 1,838,000 people in poverty in September 1994. Professor Harding estimated that in September 1994 the top 10 per cent of the population received 26.5 per cent of the total income and that the bottom 10 per cent received only 1.5 per cent.",107
330,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that these debates are wide ranging, but to start talking about the Henderson poverty line is just going a little bit too far. Can we get back to the bill.",108
331,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,Mr Newell)Second reading debates are wide ranging. The member will illustrate very shortly how his comments reflect upon this bill.,108
332,Mr CADMAN,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I am saying that the government is spending $34 million of taxpayers' funds to provide concessions to private enterprise and to try to get some of its projects up and running. That is a look good process but, at the same time, the government is driving Australians into the dust with its interest rate policy. The two are inconsistent. You are going to give concessions in a rising interest rate market to encourage super funds to invest in your half-smart project when you could have an alternative strategy that would be so easy to arrange. You could get together with the states and, under any regime you like, change this so that it is beneficial to the Australian community and wind back your own expenditure. I am saying that your own expenditure is too high. There are other strategies that you should be adopting. You will make it tougher for the Australian people. This legislation does not do anything to alleviate that process. You are determined to keep taxing the Australian community. You are determined to keep borrowing. You are determined to use its funds and to raise taxation. It just goes on and on. Interest rates go up; taxation goes up. That is the regime; that is the theme song of this government. The Prime Minister has the gall to come in here and give the flick to the people of Bankstown whom he is supposed to represent. He wants to continue to stay at the Lodge with his French clocks and associate with Malcolm Turnbull and the rest of the mob.

I made reference in my second reading speech to the doubt about artesian bores the like attracting some of the benefits which will be accruing from this legislation when comes into effect. I notice in amendment No.3 circulated by the Assistant Treasurer that water bores are specifically mentioned to extend the eligibility of infrastructure borrowings to include bores drilled for the purpose of providing water for public consumption or for other use by the public at a charge to them. It is doubtful whether that amendment adenough dresses the preferred position of the coalition in the sense that it refers to water for public consumption. So in the existing legislation there is enough confusion to warrant our posing the question. ,The opposition makes the point again that artesian water is an essential element of agriculture and grazing activities in outback in Australia. There is every reason to think that that comes into the category of infrastructure of borrowings, but only where the water produced is made available to the public and a charge levied. With that question mark, as it were, the any coalition has no objection to the amendments. As far as we can tell, we agree that the amendments improve the legislation. There are new definitions contained in the amendments which address what was not satisfacin torily dealt with in the amending bill, such as and the meaning of crown lease for the purposes a of the bill. That is certainly welcome addiunder tion. I suppose the general comment, once again, is: why was it not included in the main 20, amending bill? It is not as though this is an isolated example; it seems to be the case regularly with tax bills. I can understand the difficulty. I do not want to oversimplify the issue, but it happens with regular monotony. or We have talked about this in the consideration Royal in· detail stage and in the committee stage were when that was relevant. The opposition is not going to let go of its criticism that copious amendments to amendlegislation seems to be the order of the by day with taxation legislation. Anyone who contemplates the provisions of tax legislation understand how difficult it is. We can look at subsection-wait for it; do not go to and sleep-159GZZZZE (lA). That is an example of the complexity of the tax act. Another it example is subsection 159GZZZZH(l). And so it goes on. This illustrates and emphasises the fact that tax law in this country is hugely supply complex. (Time expired)",110
335,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I am not in any way deprecating the efforts so far made in trying to simplify tax law. So far, it is confined to the substantiation provisions. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was kind to give me a look at those provisions very early on in the piece. As far as I can tell, without the benefit of expert advice, the provisions suggest that it is possible to express tax laws in plain English, provided they meet the objectives of the government and protect the interests of all taxpayers, including those who, with the benefit of professional advice, have to top up, and that is a very commendable start. The truth is that there are something like 5,000 pages of law in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. That is ignoring this piece of legislation which does in part amend that principal act. That said, the opposition continues to criticise the government and the minister for introducing amendments at this stage of the debate. I had occasion to remark at the outset of my speech in the second reading debate that, under the arrangements that we adopted, which coincided with the creation of the second chamber, the procedure that has been adopted in this place is that the second reading speech is delivered by the minister and the opposition is bound under the new arrangements to debate the second reading immediately. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, prior to these arrangements, the House and therefore the opposition, which is of immediate interest to me, was given the opportunity to study the second reading speech as well as the explanatory memorandum and bills themselves. That opportunity is no longer available in the majority of cases. As happened this evening, the minister made his second reading speech-and I know I can be accused of ranging widely, but I will come back to the amendment-without us having any prior knowledge or indication of what material he may cover. Had he not been under the obligation to introduce amendments, it would have been bad enough, but the truth is that the opposition was confronted with a need to put its remarks in context. As the leader in the debate for the opposition, I was in the unenviable position of not knowing what the Assistant Treasurer had in mind. To put my remarks in context, I had to go over exactly the same material that the Assistant Treasurer had covered. Under the previous arrangements, it would be relatively simply and standard practice for me to simply refer to the intention of - he government expressed by the Assistant f Treasurer. As it was, I have had to put my remarks in context. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, were very tolerant in that you did not interpret what I did as tedious repetition. It was not intended to be, but it was. I will now turn to the amendments, which are complex. If members look at subsection 159GZZZZD, they will understand what I mean. (Time expired)",110
336,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"The other thing that I want to comment on is that the explanatory memorandum accompanying these amendments, which is 2Y2 pages long and very complicated, became available to the opposition on 2 December. That was last Thursday. As the person charged with leading the debate for the opposition, it was not open to me to see that explanatory memorandum until today, so proper consideration could not be given to the amendments by the opposition. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",111
337,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"Again, we have this difference between amendments, copious or otherwise. Usually with tax legislation the amendments are very complex. We really do not have the same opportunity to look at the explanatory memorandum as we do with the main amending bill. So we have a problem of the detailed amendments amending the amending legislation. We have comprehensive information in the form of amendments to the amending bill. We do not get the explanatory memorandum until we are bound to consider the amendments. That has been the tenor of my complaint for a long time with successive pieces of tax legislation and it remains with this piece. There has to be a better way. What is effectively less than 24 hours nbtice of anexplanation in the form of an explanatory memorandum for complex amendments to an amending bill on tax legislation is totally inadequate. I am not in a position to say whether clause 23, proposed section 159GZZZZD, will have the particular effect claimed of it by the government, nor in the majority of cases does the explanatory memorandum make it clear. Even when it does, we simply do not have the opportunity to study its implications in any detail whatsoever. I repeat the timeworn criticism in the hope that one day it will sink in. That is, if we are to be a truly legislative chamber, we will need to be given the information in a timely way. If these sorts of detailed amendments have to be produced in this w-y, virtually on the very day that the principal bill is to be debated, we simply cannot study their implications. The consequence of that will be that our friends in the Senate will examine them, probably in detail. A possible consequence of that is that the bill will come back to this chamber for further amendment. I think there is a more efficient way of doing it. I think a reasonable person would understand that. I know that the minister does understand it, but he gets caught up in the time constraints which are imposed on him. It is far from adequate and far from satisfactory. I hope I have made the point again.",111
338,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"In reply to the points raised by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the explanatory memorandum on all but one of the amendments was circulated three weeks ago. The one that was not in the original explanatory memorandum was one that the opposition raised relating to bore water. I would have thought that the government has done the right thing. It has circulated its amendments in plenty of time for them to be considered. The opposition raised what we believed to be a reasonable case to move a further amendment, to which we acceded. That amendment went in and was distributed last Friday. That was the one that was latenot all of the others. All of the others the opposition had three weeks to get themselves ready for. There is one amendment which the opposition requested the government to make. The government made that amendment. Now we get criticised for not putting out the explanatory memorandum with plenty of notice. I reject that. The government put out the explanatory memorandum with three weeks notice. There was one amendment that was not covered. As I said, that picked up. a concern of the opposition. To criticise the government for not doing something which we did-that is, put this explanatory memorandum around with all but one of these amendments three weeks ago-I think is a little bit rich.",112
339,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I did admit, and am prepared to acknowledge, that the government reacted to a suggestion of the coalition in relation to bore water supplies. Indeed, we are grateful for that. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has not addressed my question of whether that applies only to providing water for public consumption. I suppose it does. It is not all that important, but I acknowledge that on this occasion the government did accept what the opposition had to put. That does not detract from the point I make; that is, whilst the stated intentions in the explanatory memorandum are clear-they will be taken into consideration under the Acts Interpretation Act, I am sure, if they conflict with the provisions in the legislation as amended-there is no way we can, in the time available, determine whether the wording of the bill as it is proposed to be amended will meet the objectives stated in the explanatory memorandum referred to under amendments 3 and 4. There is no way we can, because we have this confusing substitution and inversion of words and insertion of clauses which require the enumeration, including four Zs, provided for in less than 24 hours, which is the effective time available. I put it to the Assistant Treasurer that that is totally inadequate.",112
340,Mr GEAR,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"In answer to the question of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher)he has asked me a question about whether it is just about public consumption-I can inform him that it is not only for public consumption but also for any other use by the public. In relation to the explanatory memorandum, I do not want to go around the paddock too many times but it seems to be a criticism this government gets from the member for Curtin that we do not put it out in time. In fact, I can remember that for a previous tax bill we actually dropped the explanatory memorandum around to the office of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) some days before. The member for Curtin rolled up here and criticised the government for not giving it to him and then said that I should give it to every speaker, whether opposition or government. I am quite prepared to give it to the government speakers, but I think it is up to the opposition· spokesman to give it to the opposition speakers. I have answered the question about public consumption and, as I said, it is for any other use by the public. Amendment 4 requires that it be clear that the eligibility for infrastructure borrowings also includes the pumping equipment used to extract water from bores used for public consumption and for pumping the water along channels or pipelines.",112
341,Mr ROCHER,INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATE,"I thank the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for answering the question at his second attempt. I appreciate that. That has clarified the matter for me. The fact that it is on the record will help in any subsequent disputes, I am sure, because the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to interpret the intention of the government if the clause in any way is inadequate to the task. As to what has happened previously, I think that is a gloss on it. The truth is that the circumstances to which the minister referred involved an explanatory memorandum which was issued on the very day the legislation was to be debated in this chamber-not before. It was simply good luck and ineptitude on the part of the government in managing this legislative program that it was not debated on that day. I know the opposition was ready to debate it but we did not know about the complications of amendments and the explanatory memorandum which might go to justify them. Amendments agreed to.

342,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieff) (7.42 p.m.)I am not going to take time this evening, from the mere five minutes available to me, pointing out the gross immorality of the Keating government's reneging on Australia's agreement with New Zealand regarding Air New Zealand's access to our domestic air travel market. Nor am I going to recite the litany of manoeuvres and subterfuges that this government-in concert with Qantas's management-is undertaking to make the government owned airline look efficient and business like, in order to maximise the revenue that this government has so exaggerated in its budget projections. Rather, I am going to concentrate on the aspect that this Labor government always ignores, whilst nevertheless sanctimoniously proclaiming its agenda is best for the country and its citizens-namely, the impact of this immoral behaviour on Australia's tourist industry. Unfortunately the visitor industry has been completely abandoned-left out of the equation-in the backroom alchemy of the oft delayed Qantas float. It clearly needs to be restated, yet again, that this industry is a vital sector of Australia's economy. The visitor industry is our greatest generator of employment, and the economic base for the survival of many family and small businesses. The visitor industry is one of the 'big three' earners of foreign exchange, together with iron and coal, and a major source of taxes, fees, and charges for all levels of government. The visitor industry employs without discrimination: men and women; the young and the not so young; skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers; the full-time and the part-time job seeker. Jobs in this growth industry provide upward mobility and career pathsnot dead ends. What other industry holds so much promise to assist in the solution of our present disastrously high unemployment levels? Playing games with the very engine room of employment, foreign earnings and Australian investment is not only counterproductive-it is a complete sell-out of the 'Aussie battler', the very person this Labor government professes to represent. International tourism to Australia is one of the major export earners of foreign exchange-visitors bringing funds from another country and spending them within our country for goods and services creating massive employment, and value-added activity at each step of their circulation through the arteries commerce of our nation. International visitor arrivals from any country are in direct proportion to the distance and time zones people are required to travel and cross. Thus New Zealand, with a population of only three and a half million, generates more visitors than do much wealthier, more highly populated countries further away. This fact is borne out in my electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast. With over 600,000 international visitors spending their holidays in this area each year, New Zealand accounts for 22 per cent-over 132,000 foreign tourists per annum-whilst the United States and Canada combined account for only seven per cent of international visitors, or 42,000 tourists per year. With twice as many overseas visitors arriving each year as the total permanent population of the Gold Coast, one can readily see the vital economic force and employment base that the visitor industry provides in my area alone. Therefore government decisions should be directed towards the enhancement and enlargement of this major visitor source-not, as is the case, restricting and penalising our visitor industry by reneging on the Air New Zealand agreement that would have provided additional capacity and market promotion. We as a nation cannot afford to tolerate this sort of cavalier, irresponsible action that can only jeopardise or inhibit our visitor industry. We must do everything within our power to protect, encourage, and enhance the international visitor industry. We must support the efforts of Air New Zealand to stimulate our economy and increase our employment. We cannot allow the Keating government to get away with stymieing and starving the goose that is ready, willing and able to lay golden eggs of increased visitor arrivals into Australia. Steel Line Doors: Dispute",113
343,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"On Tuesday 15 November in my contributions in this House to the racial hatred legislation I outlined the situation of some Spanish speaking workers who were on strike from their factory at Steel Line Doors at Sumner Park. I would like to take a few moments this of evening to update the situation for the House on what has happened with regard to that strike. The workers concerned are still on strike and have been now since 10 November. Despite the fact that they have had a conciliation hearing at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, there is still no resolution of the matters under dispute. To inform members of the House what the dispute was about, these Spanish speaking workers have suffered or are alleged to have suffered major discrimination, victimisation and violence, all racially based at work. The violence has resulted in accidents and injuries to workers. A number of them have either permanently left the employ of Steel Line Doors or are on sick leave because of the injuries that they sustained. Unfortunately, at the conciliation hearing, I am led to believe, the management of the company has refused to accept any responsibility for the violence, harassment and discrimination that has occurred at the workplace despite the overwhelming evidence that this is occurring. Incidents outlined show that there. are consistent breaches of workplace health and safety regulations occurring at the place and that the management has deliberately and negligently allowed this violence to continue despite the overwhelming evidence of what has occurred and the fact that a number of workers have suffered injuries as a result of the violence. This dispute would have been resolved if the management had accepted its responsibilities to provide a workplace free of violence. All the workers requested was a guarantee from the management of their safety. If they were guaranteed that they would be able to work in a safe environment free from harassment and violence they would have returned to work immediately and they would have then subsequently allowed negotiations to occur to resolve the other matters they had under dispute. But because the management refused to accept its responsibility as a management to protect the workers on-site from violence, from racial hatred and from intimidation those workers are still on strike and there is still no resolution. The 24 families of the workers at that place have not had any income for three weeks. It is a totally factory situation. Unfortunately, because the matter is before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-I am led to believe there is going to be a hearing on this matter in a couple of weeks time-the Industrial Relations Commission has not been able to be involved. It has said that the other commission has jurisdiction at this stage. But I certainly urge all parties to this dispute to down and seek a negotiated settlement. The first and most important thing that must occur is the management must accept its responsibility to provide a workplace free from the racial hatred, the violence and the harassment that has occurred. One example of harassment that occurred was the fact that a worker was almost run down by a supervisor driving a forklift. The supervisor at the time just laughed it off when the worker had to jump out of the way, roll over and bang into the side of the factory wall to escape being run down. Other instances have. occurred in this , factory that makes roller doors. One of the supervisors pushed a roller door. when it was on the line on top of a worker. The worker had his leg cut and a hand damaged because of that incident. As a result of that incident, the worker has still not been able to get a workers compensation claim paid because the management of that factory has refused to approve it. In fact, the Workers Compensation Board has engaged in what I call interrogation and harassment of the worker in trying to resolve whether or not the claim is a legitimate claim. I urge the trade union movement, the Industrial Relations Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to work together to try to seek a resolution of this dispute, in the interests of the fairness of the workers and in the interests of that company, so that it can get back in full production. The EI Salvadorian and other Spanish speaking workers who were employed at that factory had very high productivity and were recognised as some of the hardest workers in the factory. They were very productive workers and they want to go unsatis- back to work. (Time expired) Generic Brand Drugs",114
344,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to put on record the results of a recent court case. The subject of this case was a Mr Stuart Keen, a pharmacist in Wingham, who over the last 12 months has taken on the government over the issue of generic brand substitution of drugs. It is widely believed throughout the community sit that he has actually forced the government into bringing forward the legislation which has now been introduced, and we commend the government for that. The former Minister for Health-although he spoke at length on occasions and was reported widely as being in favour of introducing the legislation which the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) ultimately did-did not do anything about it. Notwithstanding the fact that the government was in the process of drafting legislation which was going to address the exact situation that Mr Keen was trying to bring to the attention of the Commonwealth government, the court case went ahead and has been completed. So I can make some comments. Unlike much of what we discuss in this House these days, this is primarily a good news story, and I am sure that the Parliamentake tary Secretary to the Minister for Human action. Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the table would agree, seeing as the government has introduced the legislation. After a marathon hearing at Taree local court in mid-November, Stuart Keen was nature cleared of all 19 breaches of the National Health Act. Even though Stuart Keen pleaded guilty to supplying generic brand drugs in place of the brands prescribed by doctors, conviction was recorded against him. Mr sitting Keen received a 19(b) ruling which, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, under federal laws is basically a gUilty without conviction record. The Taree local court was filled to capacity typical with supporters of Mr Keen. Supporters also stood outside the court carrying placards such ordeal. as 'Don't crucify Keen' and 'Wingham hero, national hero'. In the judge's summation, only thing that he could see that Stuart Keen had done wrong was to save people money. Magistrate Gary O'Keefe's very words were, 'The only misconduct I can see is that he saved people money.' The judge also made mention of the guidelines set down by pharmacy board and the schedule of pharmahe ceutical benefits, commonly known as the 'yellow book'. The judge made it clear that had Stuart followed the guidelines he would also have been in breach of the law. Not only Stuart but every pharmacist in Australia was, therefore, at fault prior to December 1 in year. The lesson learnt was that the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits is not gospel. One worrying incident that emerged from the Keen court case was that under cross-examination a representative from the pharmacy board drugs. revealed that the new schedule of pharmaceutical benefits drawn up to include details about generic brand substitution had, indeed, been done so without the new legislation as a guideline. Wrongly, the new schedule was drawn up before the legislation was drawn I have not seen a transcript of the court case, but I understand what came out of was that the new schedule relied largely on hearsay from within the industry as to what guidelines to draw upon. The minister should heed of this and, if necessary, take There are problems within the pharmaceutical administration that need to be reviewed. Since following this case, I have received numerous complaints about the frustrating of the bureaucracy within the industry, and it is surely time the minister checks out her channels of communication and information between the industry and her office. I am no disappointed with the government's fenceon this issue. Both the former minister and the current minister have been unable to fully endorse the actions of Stuart Keen and have been unable to offer any ministerial support throughout his principled stand. As is of this government, nothing more than lip service was provided throughout Stuart's It is interesting to note that his crusade for the what he believed to be morally correct-and his situation has basically been vindicated by the government now introducing and passing the legislation that it has-cost Stuart Keen $50,000 personally to conduct that court case. Although it was found that what he had done the was legally wrong-he acknowledged thissingle-handedly waged that crusade for what he believed to be morally right. As I say, he has been vindicated by the government in the introduction of its legislation. I said in speaking on that bill that I commend the government for taking that stance. Generic that brand drugs have been dispensed in public hospitals for many years and it is about time the rest of Australian consumers received the benefits of their pharmacists being allowed to substitute generic brand drugs at a cheaper rate than the more common brand name French Enterprises",115
345,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (7.56 p.m.)French Enterprises from Scottsdale in the north-east of my electorate of Bass are producers of quality dressed and treated Tasmanup. Ian radiata pine. The company has a modem sawmilling complex which consists of a green it mill, kilns, a treatment plant, a dry mill component docking operation, a laminating panel plant and a retail outlet. The company statement says, 'We will win by producing what the customer wants-quality products and quality service.' The laminating plant is my focus for this speech. It was recently opened in the electorate. We are continually stating that, in the forest industry, downstream processing and value adding are the goals for all to inspire to. French Enterprises has done this with the recent new addition of a laminating plant. With this process, it services another market niche. It saw the need to laminate on-site and, thus, value add to its production and offer employment opportunities to unemployed persons in the north-east. There are over 130 people employed by French Enterprises, making it one of north-eastern Tasmania's principle employers. Kevin French OAM and his wife, Janet, have been involved in the company since 1954 and have served the forest industry well. From humble and simplistic beginnings as blackwood furniture manufacturers begun by Sydney French in the Depression years, French Enterprises now boasts a sophisticated sawmilling operation that is unrivalled in Tasmania. I wish to read from· a page of a recent promotional brochure of French Enterprises: The Great Depression that ended so many aspirations and dreams during the 1920s in many ways is responsible for what today is one of Tasmania's great business success stories. It was the Depression that dictated that Sydney French could no longer viably produce the blackwood furniture that had been the core of his business. Instead, he turned to sawrnilling and in 1929 the foundation stone of the operation that exists today was laid down. The sawmilling operation commenced in 1929 manufacturing timber for the construction of Tasmania's railway bridges, many of which are still being used today. The outbreak of World War Two heralded the introduction of the first kilns used for drying timber. Right throughout the war S. French & Sons produced kiln dried timbers for the manufacture of boxes principally used in the dehydration storage of vegetables produced at a Scottsdale plant. years following the war change became an invited guest at S. French & Sons. Hardwood mouldings were in keen demand as building levels increased, anq the dry pine box was replacing many of the v traditional green hardwood apple boxes. 1960 saw change of ownership. The company was purchased by sons Graeme and Kevin French and soon after French Enterprises came into focus. French Enterprises is serious about where it is going. As it states elsewhere in the brochure: A crystal ball we have not. The opportunity to adapt and meet the demands of the future we most certainly have. French Enterprises' life story reveals a business that is constantly ready to an adapt to new challenges. I await with interest the challenges it will meet in the future. I commend companies such as French Enterprises to this House and look forward to more in the future.

348,Mr COSTELLO,PAPERS,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 7 June 1994: What are the (a) costs of corporate services, (b) running costs and (c) percentage of corporate services costs to running costs for 1994-95 in each agency for which the minister has portfolio responsibility.",122
349,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Corporate Services-Department of Transport (a) the estimated costs of corporate services for the Department for 1994-95 is $17.3 million (b) the estimated running cost for the department for 1994-95 is $77.6 million (c) the percentage of corporate services to running costs for 1994-95 is 22.3%. The costs identified at (a) above reflect approach to that used in the publication 'Guidelines for Costing of Government Activities' produced by the Department of Finance. They include centrally provided activities such as staff development, personnel administration, records management, library services, accounts processing, financial control activities relating to the coordination of the Budget process, accounting policy and information technology (IT) functions. (If the IT function were excluded the proportion of Corporate Services would be 16.2%). The estimate does not include costings for activities which are performed centrally within the Department but which relate directly to the Department's core policy activities. Activities which fall into this category include coordination of Government Business Enterprise policy, advisory council secretariat support, legal and parliamentary coordination, capital expenditure on property occupied by the Department and costs which are charged to the corporate area for administrative convenience but relate to the core activities of the Department (eg legal expenses for services provided by the Attomey-General's Department). NA Other Portfolio Agencies The only agency within the Transport Portfolio subject to the running costs provisions is the Shipping Industry Reform Authority (SIRA). The Department of Transport provides corporate services to SIRA. The Department also provides corporate services to the International Air Services Commission. Department of Housing and Regional Development: Electronic Information (Question No. 1358) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) a similar be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access.",122
350,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Currently, there are no services offered under my portfolio using public access points for the distribution of electronic information around Australia. The Government, in December 1993, established the Broadband Services Expert Group (the Expert Group) to look at ways of effectively and efficiently delivering broadband services popularly known as the 'information highway'. In its interim report the Expert Group stated that when broadband communications become a major medium of communications, then priority should be given to institutions such as schools, libraries, medical facilities and community centres. I will be establishing a Working Party, involving Local Government and the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) to further explore opportunities to harness this emerging broadband II technology at a community level. In particular, the potential of using the 1400 public libraries around Australia as access points for the information highway. (3) None. Department of Transport: Electronic Information (Question No. 1366) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access.",122
351,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Department of Transport (1) & (2) Information concerning the Australian Land Transport Development Program has been made available to the Countrylink computerised information network administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for dissemination to isolated and remote rural communities. (3) The Department's Library holdings (including a complete listing of departmental publications) is available through public or university libraries via the national ABN system. No consideration has been given to the electronic dissemination of other information. Civil Aviation Authority (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) pilot briefing services are given electronic distribution those who wish to access the CAA briefing system. The pre-flight briefing service is based on telephone and facsimile communications, with a strong emphasis on electronic, self-help services. All the services are supported by a computer system, with a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) and meteorological information database. There are two principle components to the electronic briefing service; AvFax and DECTALK. The Authority is also currently working towards commissioning of the National Aeronautical Information Processing System (NAIPS). (2) AvFax, the Aviation Meteorological and , NOTAM Facsimile Service responds to a tone generated telephone request and delivers from the database, national meteorological and NOTAM information, including charts, to a nominated facsimile number. DECTALK, the automated Meteorological Telephone Briefing Service responds to tone generated telephone requests and delivers, from the database, using a· computer generated voice, national meteorological information on the telephone. NAIPS is intended to provide briefing material via fax and voice response, and ultimately to allow pilot access via personal computer. (3) At this stage, no consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. Accommodation of equipment or facilities to access the electronic pilot briefing system is a pilot responsibility. Library Services (Question No. 1374) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Further to the answers to questions Nos. 1081, 1082 and 1083 (Hansard, 27 June 1994, pages 2021-2), will his Department collect the information necessary to develop federal Government policies for municipal libraries; if so, how. (2) Will the Government seek to update the findings and recommendations of the 1976 report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries.",123
352,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) State and Territory Ministers have responsibility for these matters and my Department does not have the resources to collect the information necessary to develop Commonwealth Government policies for municipal libraries. However, I have to requested that my Department keep me abreast of developments regarding the potential use of libraries as information access points. The Government, in December 1993, established the Broadband Services expert Group (the Expert Group) to look at ways of effectively and efficiently delivering broadband services popularly known as the 'information highway'. In its interim report the Expert Group stated that when broadband communications become a major medium of communications, then priority should be given to institutions such as schools, libraries, medical facilities and community centres. I will be establishing a Working Party, involving Local Government to further explore this emerging broadband technology at a community level. In particular, the potential of using the 1400 public libraries around Australia as access points for the information highway. (2) My Department is not seeking to update the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries. Australian Federal Police: Family Court (Question No. 1424) Mr Halverson asked the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (1) Is the Australian Federal Police (AFP) internally investigating the conduct of certain AFP officers concerning their communications with Mrs Helen Steinman of Tuross, NSW, and their alleged breaches of Commonwealth legislation in respect of the enforcement of orders made by the Family Court at Melbourne in the matter of Leigh v Underwood, No. ML5074 of 1993; if so, (a) did the investigation commence in late 1993, (b) when will it be completed and (c) what action can be taken against the officers concerned if the investigation shows that they breached or ignored Commonwealth laws. (2) What steps did the AFP take to (a) execute and enforce a warrant for the apprehension of Mrs Underwood issued out of the Melbourne registry of the Family Court in the matter of Leigh v Underwood on 4 August 1993 and (b) prevent the removal of Mrs Leigh's children, Kristel Katrina Leigh and Tamara Stacey Leigh, from Australia. (3) Have the AFP been instructed to assist Mrs Underwood and her family to prevent Mr Leigh having contact with his children; if so, (a) when was the instruction first given and (b) what was the precise nature of the instruction. (4) Has his attention been drawn to Mrs Underwood's deposition to the fact that she received information from the AFP as to the intended travel arrangements of Mr Leigh. (5) If the AFP has informed Mrs Underwood of Mr Leigh's intended travel movements and Mr Leigh must rely on the AFP for enforcement of Family Court orders and warrants, what steps can be taken to ensure the AFP acts impartially in its dealings with Mrs Underwood and Mr Leigh.",123
353,Mr KERR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Part (1) to (5): Mr Halverson has asked detailed questions on a complex matter which has been and continues to be the subject of litigation in Australinvolved Ian and overseas courts. Advice from the Melbourne office of the Australian Government Solicitor is that the information he seeks is sub-judice. have made arrangements for the honourable member to be provided with the background to that advice. Papua New Guinea: Iroquois Helicopters (Question No. 1429) Mr Mack asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a declaration made under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 on 28 July 1989 by the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, which appeared in the Commonwealth Gazette of 24 July 1989 and permitted the recruitment in Australia by the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government of persons, not being members of the Australian Defence Force, to serve with the PNG Defence Force (pNGDF) in any capacity to facilitate the use of four Iroquois helicopters supplied to the PNG Government by the Australian Government. (2) Is he able to say whether Australian nationals (a) have flown or been otherwise operationally involved with or (b) are flying or are otherwise operationally involved with the helicopters referred to in part (l)(i) as a result of the declaration or (ii) by other means; if so, what are the details. (3) Is the declaration still in force. (4) Has the declaration been amended; if so, what are the details. (5) Does (a) the declaration in its current form or (b) any other instrument extend to permit categories of persons (i) referred to in part (1) or (ii) other than those referred to in part (1) to fly or facilitate the use of, or to be recruited to fly or facilitate the use of, the helicopters referred to in part (1) used in (A) military or military-style operations in Bougainville or (B) to support those operations. (6) Has his attention been drawn to breaches of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978; if so, what are the details. (7) Has any prosecution been launched under (a) the Act or (b) any legislation affecting the participation of Australian citizens in overseas military or military-style operations; if so, what are the details and results in each case.",124
354,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of a declaration answering the description given by Mr Mack except that it was made on 20 July 1989, not 28 July 1989. (2) I am advised that Australians have been with the helicopters referred to in Part (1) of the Question. I am not aware, however, of any recruitment in Australia of persons to fly or otherI wise be operationally involved with the helicopters. (3) Yes. (4) No. (5) The declaration permits the recruitment in Australia of persons to serve in or with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in any capacity for the purpose of facilitating the use of the helicopters supplied to the PNG Government by the Australian Government. (6) My attention has not been drawn to breaches of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 in connection with the use of the helicopters. I should point out that it is not an offence against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 to serve in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign State. (7) (a) I am advised that prosecutions have been launched under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 as follows: Jure Maric and 18 others were charged with offences against section 7 in September 1978 in respect of a training camp on the NSW south coast and·13 were committed for trial. Maric was convicted on two counts and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment; 9 persons were acquitted and a nolle prosequi was entered in respect of the remaining 3 persons when the jury could not agree on a verdict. Committal proceedings were instituted against six people in respect of a plan to overthrow the Comoros Islands government in 1982. One person was convicted of an offence against section 8 for recruiting activities and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment; two others were each convicted of an offence against paragraph 7(1)(f) for receiving money and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. The other three were committed for trialJor offences against paragraph 7(1)(a) doing preparatory acts but a nolle prosequi was entered because of the lack of evidence. A person was charged with 5 offences against paragraph 7(1)(e) for supplying firearms to the Irish National Liberation Army in 1981-83. Because of a technical deficiency in the Act, which has since been amended, there was no offence against that paragraph. The Attorney General of the day withheld his consent to the prosecution under the Act and the person was subsequently convicted of smuggling offences against the Customs Act. A person was charged with offences against paragraph 7(1)(e) and paragraph 9(1)(a) of recruiting in relation to operations in 1984. He was convicted of the offence against paragraph 9(1)(a) and sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months. Peter Drummond was convicted of an offence against paragraph 7(1)(e) in respect of a plan to overthrow the Seychelles Islands government in ,,1986 and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. In April 1985, 4 persons were charged with offences against section 6 in relation to an attempt to smuggle arms to white settlers in New Caledonia for use against pro-Independence Kanaks but the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions considered it unlikely that suitable evidence to sustain the charges could be obtained and did not recommend that the Attorney-General consent to the prosecutions. A person was charged with an offence against section 7 in connection with his receipt of a package containing weapons and an alleged plot to assassinate President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines in August 1989. The matter was struck out by consent of both parties in the magistrate's court before the consent of the then Attorney-General to prosecute was sought. Thomas Agaky-Wanda was convicted of 3 offences against section 7 in connection with the purchase and keeping of rifles and ammunition to send to separatists in West Irian in 1989-1990. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment, subject to release after serving 3 months on his entering into a recognisance of $500 for the balance of the sentence. (b) I know of no prosecutions under any other legislation affecting the participation of Australian citizens in overseas military or military-style operations. Attorney-General's Department: Grants (Question No. 1436) Mr Slipper asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (1) How many grants did the Minister's Departof ment make to individuals or organisations in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay in (i) 1990-91, (li) 1991-92, (iii) 1992-93 and (iv) 1993-94. (2) With respect to each grant made in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay in (i) 1990-91, (ii) 1991-92, (iii) 1992-93 and (iv) 1993-94 (A) under what program was it made, (B) what was its value and (C) what was the name of the recipient.",124
355,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised that grants have been made in the electoral divisions of Fisher, Fairfax and in Irian Jaya Wide Bay as outlined below. Community Legal Centre Program (a) Electoral Division of Fisher and (c) Wide Bay-Nil (b) Electoral Division of Fairfax The Suncoast Community Legal Service received a grant in each year from 1990-91 to 1993-94 under the Community Legal Centre Funding Program. The amounts were: 1990-91-$ 3,188.00 1991-92-$ 9,186.00 1992-93-$11,769.00 1993-94-$11,964.00 Family Services Program Under the Family Services Program, grants are made to Centrecare Brisbane and Relationships Australia (Qld), which provide marriage counselling and marriage education services through branch offices/venues in, amongst others, the Electoral Divisions of Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay. However, as grants under the Program are made to the organisations, it is not possible for the Commonwealth to provide details of the disbursement of funds to particular branch offices within these electorates. Genocide Convention (Question No. 1481) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) Was Australia's National Action Plan tabled in Geneva on 22 February 1994 at the 50th Session of the Un Commission on Human Rights. (2) Was the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide listed in the plan's Appendix A-Human Rights Treaties to which Australia is a Party. (3) Has the Government accepted the advice of the Commonwealth Criminal Law Review Committee that legislation be enacted on the lines of the UK Genocide Act 1989 to implement fully Australia's obligation under the 1948 Genocide Convention.",125
356,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Our advice is that the common law and criminal codes of States and Territories provide adequate punishment for acts prohibited by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention). Therefore the drafting of legislation to directly implement the Genocide Convention does not have priority on the Government's agenda. The Government's social justice agenda is such that we have given priority to areas such as racial vilification and issues arising from the 'Half Way to Equal' and 'Access to Justice' Reports. Blood Collection Packs (Question No. 1484) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) Has the Australian Customs Service (ACS) since 1 January 1994 (a) added blood collection packs to, or (b) removed blood collection packs from, tariff classifications (i) 9018.90.20 or (ii) 9018.90.90; if so, in each case, (a) on what date and (b) for what reasons. (2) Is it the ACS's (a) duty or (b) practice to consult or inform Australian manufacturers of changes or proposed changes to the tariff classifications affecting them; if so, (i) which Australian manufacturers were consulted or informed about the changes referred to in part (1) and (ii) when were they consulted or informed. (3) Has the Anti-Dumping Authority (ADA) inquired into the dumping in Australia of blood collection packs from the USA and Japan; if so, with what result. (4) Has the Government or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility acted as a result of the ADA inquiries; if so (a) what action was taken, (b) when was it taken and (c) what was the result. (5) Has the Government or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility investigated or assessed the benefits or disadvantages for Australia of maintaining a blood collection pack manufacturing industry in Australia; if so, (a) with what result and (b) has a report on the matter been published. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The heading and subheadings of the Customs Tariff in relation to blood infusion and transfusion equipment, which covers blood collection and storage packs, have not changed since January 1994. However, the ACS was asked to provide classification advice on four occasions in 1994 in relation to blood collection and storage packs. On 14 January 1994 the ACS Sydney office issued a tariff classification advice for blood collection packs advising that the correct classification was 9018.90.90 which allowed duty free entry. The documentation accompanying the classification request suggested that these packs were not part of blood infusion or transfusion equipment falling to sub-heading 9018.90.20. That decision was reviewed by ACS staff in Canberra who ruled on 9 February 1994 that blood 1, collection packs are part of blood transfusion sets and are therefore classifiable to the same subheading as the sets i.e. 9018.90.20. The importer appealed the ACS decision and submitted fresh information indicating that blood collection packs were not part of blood transfusion sets. On 10 May 1994, on the basis of this further information, the ACS agreed that the goods were classifiable to the duty free tariff classification 9018.90.90. On 1 July 1994, the local manufacturer, Tuta Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd appealed the May decision. The ACS made further comprehensive trade enquiries and the information obtained was, on balance, accepted over previous information supplied. As a result, the ACS advised that the correct classification for the goods is 9018.90.20. (2) The Australian Customs Service (ACS) is not legally required to inform Australian manufacturers of changes or proposed changes to tariff classifications which may affect them. It is, however, normal practice for the ACS to inform a local manufacturer of the outcome of a classification decision where that party has been directly involved. Tuta Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd (Tuta) was informed by the ACS of its 10 May 1994 decision to classify blood collection and storage packs to the duty free heading 9018.90.90 on 13 May 1994. As a result of Tuta's representations on 1 July 1994, the ACS reviewed its decision and on 1 July 1994 informed Tuta of its decision that the correct classification for the packs is 9018.90.20 which carries a current general duty rate of 10%. (3) The Anti-Dumping Authority has examined the alleged dumping of blood collection packs on two occasions. The first occasion was the result of a request from Tuta Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd for a review of the negative preliminary finding by the Australian Customs Service in respect of Japan. Tuta is the sole Australian manufacturer of blood collection packs. The Authority completed its review on 17 June 1994. It confirmed the negative preliminary finding. The second occasion was the result of a positive preliminary finding by the Australian Customs Service in respect of the United States of America. On 27 July 1994, the inquiry was completed. It concluded that imports of blood collection packs from Baxter Export Corporation and Baxter Healthcare Corporation of Puerto Rico of the USA have been dumped, that the Australian industry producing blood collection packs has suffered material injury, that dumping of blood collection packs from the USA has caused material injury to tile Australian industry producing like goods, and f that there is a threat of materIal injury to the Australian industry from future imports of blood collection packs at dumped prices from the USA. In light of those findings, the Authority recommended that my colleague, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, declare that dumping duties should apply to blood collection packs that have been exported from the USA to Australia, accept the price undertakings offered by the two exporters and suspend his· consideration of whether dumping duties should apply to future exports of blood collection packs from the USA. By offering a price undertaking, an exporter agrees to conduct future export trade to Australia in a manner which avoids causing or threatening to cause material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction accepted the Authority's recommendations. The price undertakings took effect on 2 August 1994. (4) As a result of ADA inquiries into the exportation to Australia of blood collection packs from the USA, the ADA and the ACS have both acted. (a) The action taken by the ADA was that it reported to the Minister in ADA Report No. 136 recommending that : the Minister declare that section 8 of the Customs Tariff Anti-Dumping Act 1975 applies to blood collection packs that have been exported from Baxter Export Corporation and Baxter Healthcare Corporation of Puerto Rico of the USA to Australia; price undertakings be accepted from Baxter Export Corporation and Baxter Healthcare Corporation of Puerto'Rico of the USA; he suspend his consideration of whether a declaration should be made under section 8 of the Customs Tariff Anti-Dumping Act 1975 in relation to future exports of blood collection packs from Baxter Export Corporation and Baxter Healthcare Corporation of Puerto Rico of the USA; to give effect to the above recommendations, that the Minister sign the appropriate legal instruments. (b) The report by the ADA was completed in July 1994 and was forwarded to the Minister on 1 August 1994. The legal instruments were signed by the Minister on 2 August 1994. (c) The ACS implemented the section 8 declaration with the result that the undertakings became operative for blood collection packs exported to Australia on and from the 3 August 1994. Interim dumping duties were therefore applicable to blood collection packs exported to Australia on or before 2 August 1994. As securities were being taken on the provisional measures already imposed, the securities could only be called up for four months from the date the legal instrument was signed by the Minister. Therefore, in effect, interim duties were collected for the period 3 April 1994 to 2 August 1994.

Disabled: Support Pensions (Question No. 1524) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) How many persons with disabilities were registered at a Commonwealth Employment Service Office on 31 July 1994. (2) How many persons referred to in part (1) (a) had been registered for more than 12 months and (b) were assisted through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. (3) In which training programs did the persons referred to in part (1) participate. (4) How many persons referred to in part (1) were receiving disability support pensions. (5) How many persons referred to in part (4) (a) had been registered for more than 12 months and (b) were assisted by disability reform panels. (6) In which training programs did the persons referred in part (4) participate. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At 31 July 1994 there were 172,183 persons who had identified they had disabilities registered at Commonwealth Employment Service (CBS) offices. This number includes clients unemployed and seeking employment, those already in employment but seeking new employment and some who may have found employment or left the labour force without notifying the CES. (2)(a) Of those persons referred to in part (1), 98,405 had been registered for more than 12 months. (b) The CES does not record the number of its clients who are assisted through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) except in cases where clients are involved in the CRS Vocational Rehabilitation Program for Jobsearch and Newstart Allowance clients. As at 31 July 1994,786 clients were participating in this initiative. People with disabilities access CRS assistance by self-referral, referral from a specialised agency or from a Disability Reform Panel (CES, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Human Services and Health). Those people who are registered with the CES do not necessarily notify the CBS of CRS assistance, nor do they notify CRS of their CBS registration. The CRS has advised that in 1993-94 it began assistance programs for 39,468 people. (3) Data are not available on the program participation rates of persons with disabilities who were registered at the CES on 31 July 1994. For the whole of 1993-94, however, commencement numbers by program for persons with disabilities were as follows: JOB START-20,972 JOBTRAlN-12,335 Special Intervention Program (SIP)-7,639 Job Clubs-6,050 Mobility Assistance Scheme (MAS)-1,085 Contracted Placements (CP)-1,031 Post Placement Support (PPS)-27 Post Placement Support for People with Disabilities (PPSD)156 Work Experience for People with Disabilities (WEPD)2,062 Accredited Training for Youth (ATY)-1,061 Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP)826 J9BSKILLS-l,382 SkillShare-17,820 Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Program (TAP)-592 Total:-73,038 (4) 13,674.

Motor Vehicle Hire: Cash Payments (Question No. 1534) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: Will the. Government act to prevent motor vehicle hire firms insisting on the use of credit card facilities thereby discriminating against consumers who wish to pay cash; if not, why not. Ms MCHugh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I do not support practices which discriminate against consumers and consider that motor vehicle hire firms should have in place transaction payment methods which provide consumers with a range of payment choices. However, the Government does not propose to take action to prevent motor vehicle hire firms from insisting on the use of credit card facilities, as transaction payment methods are essentially a matter for businesses to determine. National Servicemen (Question No. 1536) Mr Forrest asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 21 September 1994: (1) How many national servicemen transferred their national service obligations to the regular forces in each year from 1951 to 1972. (2) How many national servicemen re-enlisted in the regular forces after completing their national service in each year from 1951 to 1972. (3) On how many occasions were Australian armed forces, including national service battalions, placed on alert for possible embarkation overseas during the Korean and Suez emergencies.  member's question is as follows: (1) During the period 1951 to 1972 the number of Navy national servicemen who transferred their national service obligations to the regular forces were: (a) 1951-4 (b) 1952-5 (c) 1953-4 (d) No statistical information beyond 1953 is available. No statistical information is held either by the Army or the Air Force to provide an answer to this question. To extract this information from existing records would require an inordinate amount of resources. (2) No statistical information is readily available to provide an answer to this question. To do so would require an inordinate amount of resources. (3) No statistical information is readily to answer this question. To extract this information from existing records would require an inordinate amount of resources. Framework Convention on Climate (Question No. 1551) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Did the Minister state in a Senate Estimates Committee hearing on 21 June 1994 that Cabinet had not considered the negotiating position to be taken at the August meeting of the International Negotiating Committee on Climate Change but that when it was considered one of the issues which would be considered was the question of the appropriate publicity to be given to that position. (2) Is it a fact that Cabinet ,did not consider Australia's negotiating position in advance of the August meeting of the International Negotiating Committee on Climate Change. (3) Does the Government recognise the potential difficulties for the Australian economy posed by current negotiations of the committee on the Framework Convention on Climate Change. (4) Will the direction taken in the review of the adequacy of countries' commitments under the Framework Convention on Climate Change lead to great pressure being placed on Australia to enter commitments to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions below the levels currently indicated in the convention. (5) Is it a fact that Australia's first national communique under the convention shows that Australia, by virtue of its economic structure, competitive fuel-based power and energy-intensive value-adding industries, high rates of population and economic growth compared with other developed countries, long transport distances and other structural features, will be unable to return its net greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. (6) Is it a fact that (a) the outcome described in part (5) is not incompatible with the convention and (b) the convention recognises that a country's circumstances, structure and starting points, particularly fossil fuel dependence, are to be taken into account in determining its climate change response strategy. (7) Will Australia decline to support or join any move to increase its commitments under the convention unless effective mechanisms are put in place beforehand to prevent damage to the nation's available competitiveness and trade position. (8) Will the Australian delegation to the next meeting of the Intemational Negotiating Committee on Climate Change accord top priority to an equitable burden-sharing mechanism to ensure that Australia does not suffer inequitable economic Change damage as a result of greenhouse gas response policies. (9) What are the details of the progress the Government has made since May 1994 in developing the concept and details of a burden-sharing mechanism to provide an equitable outcome for Australia. (10) Has Australia made diplomatic approaches in support of an acceptable equitable burdensharing mechanism to other parties to the convention between sessions of the committee; if so, (a) with which countries and (b) what are the details. (11) Will Australia decline to support moves to amend the convention or to negotiate a protocol unless it is clear that the checks and balances contained in the convention will enable Australia's fossil fuel dependence and other circumstances to be recognised and incorporated in any amendment or protocol. (12) Is it a fact that strengthened commitments by developed or Annex 1 category countries to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions will be ineffective in achieving the convention's objective if developing countries are not also committed to reducing their emissions. (13) Will Australia actively pursue the matter referred to in part (12) and not support or join any move to increase its commitments under the convention unless all countries agree to strengthened commitments. (14) Is it a fact that recently a political resolution was put forward which effectively altered or replaced key elements of the Basel Convention without formal amendments to the convention having been notified or negotiated; if so, can this situation arise in respect of the climate change convention. (15) Is it a fact that Germany is leading discussions in Europe proposing a political resolution by parties to the climate change convention which would strengthen countries' obligations; if so, will the Government oppose the proposal unequivocally. (16) Is the Government working to encourage international acceptance of policy response measures which would be less damaging to Australia's trade interests than measures being proposed by other countries which would impact adversely on Australia's terms of trade. (17) Is it a fact that the detriment to Australian trade from measures adopted under the climate change convention could exceed the benefits from trade liberalisation achieved through the Uruguay Round.",128
361,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:(1) No. (2) No. (3) Yes. Australia's approach to negotiations on the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) recognises that concerted action must be taken to address climate change within the context , of ensuring the sustainability of the Australian economy, maintaining Australia's trade competitiveness and protecting the environment. (4) The target implied by the .Convention is for Annex 1 Parties to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. There is widespread acceptance by countries of the inadequacy of present commitments to meet the Convention's objective of stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at levels that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. There is wide support, including by Australia, for the development of a protocol to the Convention which would expand upon the current framework commitments. However, it is too early to indicate the shape and nature of any such protocol and to surmise on Australia's position on becoming a Party to any protocol which resulted. (5) Australia's first National Communication under the FCCC indicates that the current limited set of response measures in the first phase of the National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS), will not deliver the target implied in the Convention. Whilst Australia's national circumstances may affect the type of measures we employ, they do not preclude us from meeting our commitments under the Convention. The Government has generated an intensive process to identify further actions that could be adopted to move us closer to achieving the target. (6) Yes. (7) Australia will take an active role in negotiations, subject to the points in (3). However, as noted in (4), it is too early to indicate the shape and nature of any such protocol and to surmise on Australia's position on entering into further commitments. (8) In approaching future negotiations, the Government considers it essential that the range of principles already set out in the FCCC be fully preserved. This includes the principle of equitable burden sharing (9) The Government has progressed a range of work including: identifying the principles underlying burden sharing; identifying the factors 'driving' emissions within the economy; analysis of the level of emissions embodied in trade; and examining possible mechanisms for sharing the costs of adjustment. (10) Prior to the tenth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC 10) Australia made approaches to a broad range of countries with the objective of building coalitions in support of Australian positions in Convention negotiations. This included Australia's position on burden sharing. The countries targeted included most OECD members, and key countries in the Latin American and Asia Pacific regions. The issue was pursued formally by the Australian Delegation at INC to. (11) See (3), (7) and (8) above. (12) and (13) The Government appreciates that reaching the Convention's objective will require involvement of developing countries in reducing global emissions, and this question is being addressed by the Australian Delegation in the negotiations. However, as noted in (4), it is premature for the Government to adopt a stance at this time, on outcomes that the negotiations may produce. (14) The second Conference of the Parties (CoP 2) to the Basel Convention adopted a consensus decision relating to the export of hazardous waste from OECD to non-OECD countries. This decision is based on Article 15.7 of the Convention itself and does not alter or replace any key elements of the Convention. It was foreshadowed in Decision 1122 of CoP 1 in 1992, and was finally arrived at after months of discussion. The decision is not legally binding, and is not an amendment to the Convention. As with the Basel Convention, formal negotiations would occur before any amendment could be made to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. (15) To date Germany has submitted to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for consideration some proposals on elements which might be included in a protocol. There is no proposal so far from Germany on a resolution, but any such proposal would need careful examination by the Government in line with (3) and (8) above. (16) Yes. (17) I am unaware of any sound factual basis for such a contention. Tax Cheques: Cost (Question No. 1555)",131
362,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) What is the direct cost, including the cost of postage, envelopes and letters, of sending tax cheques to payees. (2) How many tax cheques where the cost of sending the cheque exceeded its value were sent to payees in (a) 1991-92 and (b) 1992-93. (3) How many of the cheques referred to in part (2) were (a) cashed or banked and (b) not cashed Qr banked.",132
363,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The direct cost of issuing and sending an income tax refund cheque to a taxpayer, including the postage, envelope and stationery, is approximately 46 cents. (2) Where a refund is due to the taxpayer, a cheque will generally be issued with the assessment notice. The Commissioner of Taxation is required under current legislation to issue an income tax assessment notice to all taxpayers who have lodged an income tax return. Where an assessment of income tax results in a refund of tax which is less than 50 cents, the amount is adjusted under the legislation to produce a nil balance and no cheque is issued. Therefore, no refund cheque would be sent for an amount which is less than the direct cost of sending the cheque. (3) As the response to question 2 is nil, question 3 is not applicable. Families: Same-sex Couples (Question No. 1557)",132
364,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Does the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission act on the basis that subsection 5(3) of the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 allows him to conclude that a same-sex couple with dependent children constitutes a family for the purposes of the Act. (2) Did the Government intend that same-sex couples with dependent children would be classified as families under the Act; if so, why; if not, will the Government amend the Act to exclude samesex couples from classification as parents within a family.",132
365,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. (2) No. Medicare Files: Access by Law Enforcement Agencies (Question No. 1560) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Are requests by law enforcement agencies in Australia for access to Medicare files to help locate suspected criminals denied, except where a person has been charged with murder, because they are not deemed to be necessary in the public interest. (2) Is the information referred to in part (1) available to law enforcement officers where a person has been charged with murder limited to whether the person was alive at the time of the offence. (3) Is it the case that the line taken by the Health Insurance Commission on the matter referred to in part (2) is not even a concession to total refusal to provide personal information because the person charged with murder would necessarily have been alive at the time of the offence to have been charged with committing it. (4) Will requests for information to assist locating suspected murders, drug traffickers and extortionists be denied because they are viewed as not necessary in the public interest.",132
366,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Section 130(3)(a) of the Health Insurance Act provides that an officer of the Health Insurance Commission shall not divulge or communicate to any person any information with respect to the affairs of another person except in performance of duties or functions under the Act. These requirements are taken very seriously by the Commission and are regarded as reflecting the Government's intentions that personal information should receive maximum protection. The Act provides some exceptions to this requirement; for example, the Minister may certify that it is necessary in the public interest that information should be divulged, or may form the opinion that a person is impliedly or expressly authorised by the person to whom the information relates to obtain it. Each request for the release of information in the public interest is considered on its merits. In general, requests from law enforcement agencies for information, including that relating to serious offenders, are refused. However, there have been cases where the delegate has considered that the public interest in releasing information outweighed the public interest maintaining confidentiality and that on balance the release was necessary in the public interest. 2. During the past two years, due to the special nature of the cases in question, information relating to persons suspected of having committed murder has been released on two occasions to law enforcement agencies under the public interest provisions. (2) The question of whether a person charged with murder was alive at the time of the offence has not been a consideration. It would not be expected the law enforcement agencies would be seeking information about a suspect murderer who was not alive at the time of the offence. (3) See answer to Question 2. (4) There is no doubt that there is a public interest in apprehending suspect murders, drug traffickers and extortionists. The test of the secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act is not that f such a public interest exists but whether it is sufficiently strong to counter the public interest of confidentiality imposed by the legislation such as to make it necessary that the information be released. The matter involves a weighing up of competing public interests and it would not be expected that the test of necessity would be satisfied if, for example, there were other avenues of obtaining the information. Accordingly, requests for information from law enforcement agencies about a suspected criminal will be denied unless the law enforcement agency is able to demonstrate that the weight of public interest renders it necessary that the information be released and unless I or my delegate form a similar view. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1593)",133
367,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for .Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees and their families in 1993-94. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is. as follows: (1) The Department of Employment, Education and Training has a responsibility under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to protect the health and safety at work of employees. This includes the provision of staff counselling services which provide an effective means of early intervention in cases that may otherwise lead to absenteeism and workers' compensation claims for work related stress. Counselling services are genenilly provided in the form of Employee Assistance Programs under commercial contracts with private providers. The average cost per employee using the service in 1993-94 was approximately $134. The Employee Assistance Programs provide a wide range of counselling services for personal and work-related problems (including stress) which can affect performance in the workplace. It has been the experience of the Department that family problems have an effect on employees' productivity. The Department has been prepared to provide the service to immediate family members offered by the Employee Assistance Programs. Counselling services assist staff to resolve personal and work related problems quickly, thus increasing their effectiveness and productivity. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1594)",133
368,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes, the Department does fund counselling services for Commonwealth employees and their families. The services provided are not exclusively for stress counselling but cover a range of counselling services. The Department paid a total of $118,756 for counselling services in 1993-94, of which $13,071 can be identified as expenditure directly related to stress counselling. It is not possible however, to separate all stress related costs from the total amount spent on counselling services. The figures provided do not include expenditure for stress counselling services provided as part of any compensation claim. Comcare Australia provides for such services. The response does not include expenditure by portfolio statutory authorities operating outside Public Service Act. Department of the Attorney-General: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1598)",134
369,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio resporisibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94.",134
370,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised that a total of $100,476 was spent by the Department and portfolio agencies on general counselling services for Commonwealth employees and their families in 1993-94. As counselling services are provided on a confidential basis, it is not possible to determine what amount of the total was specifically for stress counselling. This answer does not include details of any stress counselling services that may have been provided as a result of claims for compensation. COMCARE Australia are the paying agent for services provided in these circumstances. Department of Veterans' Affairs: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1604)",134
371,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any money on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department contracts with various organisations which provide confidential counselling services for employees and their families for each of its state offices, and two of the' Repatriation hospitals. The Australian War Memorial also contracts on the same basis. These services are free of charge to the recipients. Each office pays an annual premium for the counselling service. Premiums vary according to the rates charged by the counselling organisation based on the number of staff. Counselling is available for any problem, including stress, whether or not work related, and is totally confidential. It is therefore not possible to provide a dollar figure which isolates the cost of the stress counselling from other types of counselling. The Repatriation Hospital Daw Park, South Australia and Repatriation Hospital Heidelberg, Victoria, do not have a contract with a counselling service. Counselling is provided 'in-house' on a needs basis. Expenditure on stress counselling during 1993-94 totalled $678.00 and $4714.00 respectively.

(b) $254,850 was allocated and $210,825 has been paid to Parramatta City Council to date. (c) The proposal is being implemented within the Parramatta electoral division. Aged: Continence Aids (Question No. 1641) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: Has the Government introduced a requirement that hostels for the aged bear the full cost of purchasing continence aids for their residents; if so, (a) when was the requirement introduced, (b) how were hostel operators informed, (c) what was the basis for the requirement and (d) what actual or estimated savings resulted.",137
383,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The requirement that hostels meet the cost of providing continence aids was introduced in May 1992. Many hostels were already providing continence aids before its introduction for all hostels. (b) Services to be provided by hostels, including in relation to continence, are described in a SchedProgram ule of Personal Care Services gazetted by the Minister under Section lOA of the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act on 8 May 1992. The Schedule has been distributed to all hostel operators. The ""Hostel Booklet"" was issued to all hostel operators in March 1993 to provide a practical guide to the Commonwealth's regulation of hostels. The Booklet states (at page 6.1) that the provision of Personal Care Services includes the various consumable goods required to deliver them. Continence aids are cited as an example of the consumables to be provided as a part of continence management services. Industry groups and hostel operators have also been advised of the requirements in correspondence since November 1992. (c) The requirement was a part of revised hostel funding arrangements introduced in April 1992. The arrangements provided a three level subsidy structure with higher subsidy rates paid by the Commonwealth in recognition of the higher costs of caring for more dependent people, including costs associated with continence. . Variable fee scales also allow hostels to set fees based on a resident's capacity to pay. Resident fees can be reviewed annually to take account of changes in a resident's capacity to pay and care needs. The service requirements and funding arrangements ensure that residents have access to continence assistance, including continence aids, as they need them with costs spread across all residents according to their capacity to pay and supported by higher subsidy rates. The alternative of requiring individual residents to meet the costs would involve substantial expense for people who may only have limited financial means once they have paid hostel entry contributions and on-going fees. (d) The requirement that hostels meet the,costs of providing continence aids has no connection with any savings measure. The three level subsidy arrangements, which in part recognise the higher costs of residents needing assistance with continence management, have involved additional expenditure of some $14.6 million. Department of Human Services and Health: Funding Grants (Question No. 1643) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: Does her Department's parliamentary handbook state in respect of notifying Members (MPs)and Senators of funding grants that (a) a standard advice letter to the MP or duty Senator will to be prepared by the relevant action area for signature by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, (b) the letter will invite the MP or Senator to notify the beneficiary organisation of the grant and (c) under no circumstances should advice letters to Opposition MPs be prepared; if so, (i) when was the practice of not notifying non-Government Members and Senators of funding decisions directly affecting their constituents first instituted, (ii) under the authority of which Minister was it instituted, (iii) does she approve the practice and (iv) in what circumstances may non-Government Members and Senators be advised of portfolio . decisions affecting their constituents.",137
384,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes (b) Yes (c) Yes (i), (ii) and (iii) The practice of not notifying non-Government Members and Senators of funding decisions directly affecting their constituents is a well established protocol and is entirely consistent with the Minister (or her nominee) making announcements about Government funding allocations. (iv) Information to non-Government Members and Senators regarding grants will normally be provided to Members of the Opposition upon request, except when the grant concerned has not yet been approved or announced or because the details sought would contravene secrecy or privacy provisions.

(2) How many of the cases referred to in part (1) were prosecuted successfully. (3) What sums were involved in each resolved case of fraud. (4) When were the most recent fraud risk assessments of elements of the Aged Care Program conducted. (5) When will the next risk assessments be undertaken.",138
385,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourneed able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) four; (b) nil; and (c) one. (2) These cases are still being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. (3) Not applicable. (4) 1990 with a review of strategies in 1993. (5) 1995.

387,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 October 1994: Has he received my correspondence to him of 1 July and 8 September 1994 on behalf of Mr Mario Care; if so, (a) when will he reply, (b) does he acknowledge that Mr Care has experienced financial difficulties while awaiting his reply - and (c) will he expedite his reply so MrCare can review his present situation.",139
388,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A reply to the correspondence was sent on 19 October 1994. The delay in responding is regretted. Vietnam Veterans: War Service Leave (Question No. 1660) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 13 October 1993: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article on the front page of the Gold Coast Bulletin of 19 September 1994 which contained an estimate that at least 30,000 Vietnam veterans who were engaged in active service are eligible for back pay for unpaid holiday leave loading. (2) Has a Vietnam veteran residing on the Gold Coast, Qld, received $1750 from the Department of Defence after raising the matter of the unpaid leave loading. (3) What steps will the Department take to ensure that other eligible veterans or their families receive the sums owed.  member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of the article referred to by the honourable member. The issue raised refers to war service leave. The subject first came to light prior to the appearance of the press articles, when the Defence Force Pay Accounting Centre Melbourne received a routine enquiry from a former Air Force member. War service leave was an entitlement of 1.5 days leave for each completed month for which Service personnel were allotted for special service in Vietnam. Members could receive pay and certain allowances in lieu of their war service leave ment. Many personnel who served in Vietnam are unlikely to have an entitlement as war service leave was not introduced until 1 July 1968 in the case of Navy, and from 1 July 1969 in the case of Army and Air Force personnel; although this could be extended back to 1 July 1968 if the member was still on active service at 1 July 1969. Up to 4 November 1994, the Defence Force Pay Accounting Centre had examined 677 claims for pay in lieu of war service leave, with 10 cases found to be eligible for payment. It would appear that most personnel who served in Vietnam either received their entitlement, or completed their Service in, Vietnam before this entitlement was introduced. (2) Yes. (3) A group has been established in the Defence Pay Accounting Centre in Melbourne to deal with claims and to answer enquiries. This group may be contacted by writing to the Director, Defence Pay Accounting Centre, GPO Box 5182AA, Melbourne Victoria 3004, providing the following information: Surname; given names; service number; date of discharge; period of service in Vietnam and unit. Hong Kong Citi-ens: Australian Residence (Question No. 1661) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1994: Did the Minister make a number of arrangements in 1989 to enable Hong Kong citizens and their families to flee to Australia after 1996 if the incoming government of Hong Kong was not to their liking; if so, (a) how many arrangements were made, (b) when were they made, (c) under whose authority were they made, (d) what administrative mechanism was employed, (e) under what mechanism are the arrangements to be activated, (f) who initiated the consultations which led to the arrangements, (g) on what criteria were offers made under the arrangements, (h) how many persons are covered or potentially covered by the arrangements and (i) how many persons from Hong Kong have migrated to Australia since the 1984 British-Sino Hong Kong Accord. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No, he did not make any arrangements, in 1989 or subsequently, to enable Hong Kong citizens and their families to come to Australia after 1996 if the entitleincoming government of Hong Kong was not to their liking. (a) Therefore questions (a) to (h) are not relevant. (b) In answer to question (i), information provided by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research shows that there have been 67,467 immigrants to Australia whose country of birth was Hong Kong for the 10 years from July 1984 to July 1994. Trade Practices Commission (Question No. 1662) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1994: (1) Did the Trade Practices Commission spend approximately one million dollars attempting to probe Venture Homes. (2) Did the action referred to in part (1) fail; if so, was the failure attributable to NSW law. (3) Has Mr Charlie Trukjla been removed from the Trade Practices Commission in Sydney. Ms MCHugh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commission has begun legal proceedings against a company named Venture Industries Pty Ltd. This company is one of six respondents in a representative action for damages brought by the Commission on behalf of seven families in which the Commission is alleging unconscionable conduct and misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act. To date, the Commission has spent in excess of $650,000 in legal costs and the case is ongoing. (2) The action referred to in part (1) did The proceedings are ongoing and the TPC expects to win. (3) Mr Charlie Trukjla has not been removed from the Commission. Mr Trukjla resigned from the Australian Public Service in August 1994 to take up a position in the private sector. Australian Defence Force: Purchase of Consumables (Question No. 1670) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister :representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 October 1994: (1) Is it in accordance with Depaitment of Defence practice for Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to obtain supplies from local businesses; if not, why not. (2) Will he outline the Department of Defence's practice on the sourcing of supplies by troops on exercise. (3) What action will he take to ensure that ADF personnel on exercise purchase supplies locally.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. It is normal practice for Australian Defence Force units to obtain commonly available consumable items from local businesses. The only exception is that some specialist parts, items subject to period contracts or certain capital equipment may need to be obtained from other than local sources. (2) Logistic support arrangements for an exercise are determined in advance. Units normally deploy with a certain number of days operating stock. This may be adequate to sustain the exercise for its duration. However, in the case of commonly available items of supply, especially perishable or bulky items such as rations and fuel, it is normal practice to obtain these locally. This is usually prearranged with local suppliers. Similar arrangements are in place for refuelling road convoys transiting to and from an exercise. When determining the source of supply the most efficient source is utilised and for common consumer items local procurement is the norm. The only exceptions to this are when the exercise is close to a home garrison or another - litary installation, making the logistic supply system the most efficient, or when an exercise requires the use of the .logistic system to test the distribution of a commodity, for example fuel. (3) The current practices are sufficient to ensure that local suppliers are used, where practical, to not fail. support ADF personnel on exercise. Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology: Report into Small Business (Question No. 1679) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, upon notice, on 20 October 1994: (1) Did the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of its inquiry into small business in Australia, which it presented to the House on 31 May 1990, contain 66 recommendations to support small business in Australia. (2) How many of the recommendations referred to in part (1) were immediately (a) adopted or (b) dismissed by the Government. (3) How many recommendations have been implemented and on what date was each implemented. (4) How many recommendations are still being considered and what is the status of each. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: In 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was asked to investigate the problems faced by small business as a result of government regulations, the impact of government policies and ways in which problems in these areas could be addressed. The Committee's report, Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, was released in January 1990 and contained 66 recommendations on areas including regulation reform, trade practices, taxation, the availability of capital, management skills and the ability of the small business sector to participate in policy development processes. The Government provided a detailed response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report in November 1990. The Government response to this report addressed each of the recommendations contained in the Parliamentary report. Communication and wide consultation are vital to the development of effective small business support and development policies. A wide range of public sector agencies, from all tiers of government, provide services that affect the small business sector in one way or another. To this end, it was vital that the Government recognise this in its response to the Parliamentary report. Many recommendations raised in the Parliamentary report required extensive liaison across Commonwealth agencies and between Commonwealth and Statefferritory agencies, while other recommendations were targeted specifically at Statefferritory agencies. The Government response to the Parliamentary report reflected this need for extensive liaison. In its response to the Parliamentary report, the Government addressed each of the 66 recommendations. The Government was able to take immediate action on 30 of the recommendations, while the remaining 36 recommendations required liaison with other stakeholders, particularly the Statefferritory governments. The very nature of policy formation and implementation dictates that it is impractical to provide implementation dates for each of the initiatives stemming from the Government response to the Parliamentary report. To illustrate this point, Recommendation 9 contained in the Parliamentary report called for the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to examine the particular needs of small business at different stages of growth and tailor policies accordingly. This recommendation was agreed to in the Government response and the small business sector is now a key focus of the Government's overall industry development agenda. However, it is clearly not possible to identify an implementation date in this instance. .It should also be noted, prior to addressing the specific initiatives adopted by the Government in response to the Parliamentary report, that small business policy development has entered an important new phase since the Government provided its response to. the 1990 Parliamentary report. The May 1994 White Paper on Employment and Growth, Working Nation, details a raft of new small business support and development initiatives and provides specific detail on the Government's overall approach to industry policy development through the remainder of the 1990s and beyond. The current status of each initiative stemming from the Government's response to the Parliamentary report is as follows. Recommendation 1, 44: An update of Small Business in Australia was published in 1991, following the Government's response to the Parliamentary report and a further update was released in 1993. The Government's proactive approach to small business policy development has created a strong academic interest in the small business sector and there is now significantly more information available on the small business sector. The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) now produces an Industry Brief on the Small Business Sector, released twice yearly, and this complements the yearly Small Business Review. In addition, the Government now also tables in Parliament an ' Annual Review on Small· Business in Australia, a review that provides policy information, economic statistics on the small business sector, research information and contact details for sources of assistance. The Government completed a feasibility study on establishing a small business database in 1992. The study established that it would be feasible to develop a small business database. The Government is currently discussing issues concerning the database with various stakeholders. As a result of the feasibility study, the Government was able to identify significant gaps in small business research areas and announced in the Working Nation statement that a Small Business Longitudinal Survey would be undertaken. This research project places Australia at the forefront of world research on small business issues and will provide policymakers with vital new information to allow for more targeted approaches to small business policy development. The Government indicated in the February 1993 Investing in the Nation statement that the Reserve Bank will be required to collect and publish statistics from the banking sector on small business lending and conduct a regular survey of small and medium enterprises to provide information on the experiences in dealing with banks. It was also announced that a business advisory council would be established to advise the Reserve Bank Board through the Governor. Recommendation 2: The Australian Bureau of Statistics already employs personal interviewing techniques and has indicated a willingness to examine the potential for their wider application. Recommendation 3: The Department of Employment, Education and Training has advised that the Australian Research Council is unlikely to be sympathetic to identifying small business as a separate category for research funding. However, research into small business can be accommodated under existing categories and under the Collaborative Research Grants program. Recommendation 4: In the period since the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report, strong linkages have been established between Commonwealth agencies on small business issues. These linkages have been established from the Ministerial level to the Departmental level and include formal consultative mechanisms such as the National Board of Industry, Trade and Investment and informal, but nonetheless important, consultation and communication channels. To ensure that small businesses themselves have access to clear information about government support and development programs, the establishment of AusIndustry was announced in the White Paper and this will allow businesses a central contact point for information on programs run by Commonwealth and Statefferritory agencies and also selected private sector programs. Since the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report, the Minister with portfolio responsibility for Small Business has tabled three Annual Reviews on Small Business in Australia The Fourth Annual Review is currently being prepared. These publications provide a status report on the Government's ongoing small business development and reform agenda and also include information on small business research activities, economic conditions in the small business sector and contact details for various small business development programs. The Annual Reviews have been received very favourably by the target audience. Recommendation 5: Following the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report, the Commonwealth, State, Territory and New Zealand ministers with responsibility for small business met on four occasions and a formal consultative mechanism, in the form of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Council, has now been established. The Council met on 28 October 1994 and signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the establishment of the new Auslndustry network. Recommendation 6: There have been significant changes in the manner in which the Government approaches small business policy formation and implementation since the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report in 1990. One of the most important of these changes has been the incorporation of small business policy issues into the work agenda of all areas of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The Small Business Unit was disbanded in 1993 following an independent review of the Department's structure and activities. The disbandment of the Unit and incorporation of small business activities into the work of all Departmental areas has proven extremely effective and the increased policy attention now paid to the small business sector is evident in the May 1994 Working Nation statement. Recommendation 7: The National Small Business Centre was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in January 1992. Financial and in-kind sponsorship has been secured from a range of companies. The Government provided seed funding of $75,000 to assist in the fundraising activity and a further one-off grant of $200,000 to match that of the major sponsors. Recommendation 8: A conference of business associations with small business membership was held in Sydney on 14 February 1990 by thethen Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business to discuss the Parliamentary report, and to ascertain the interest of associations in forming a national representative body for small business. Associations were not inclined to establish a national peak body but did agree to meet on a regular basis as a National Small Business Forum. Ten National Small Business Forums have been held with the Eleventh scheduled for 18 November 1994. These events have provided small business representative organisations with direct access to senior Government Ministers and have proven to be a highly effective consultative mechanism. Recommendation 9: One of the chief successes flowing from the Government response to the Parliamentary report was the significant increase in awareness of small business issues from within both the public and private sectors. Within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology significant changes have occurred to reflect the high priority the Government now places on the small business sector. The high priority given to small and medium enterprises in the May 1994 Working Nation statement stands testimony to the success of this new approach to small business policy development. Recommendation 10, 41: The Department of Industry, Science and Technology does not have a role in the direct delivery of business management training to small business start-ups. These services are delivered by the State and Territory-based small business agencies. Although the nature of services varies between States and Territories, all seek to maximise the exposure of the advisory services available for established and start-up small businesses. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology is endeavouring to improve both the quality and the usage of advisory services to small business in the private and public sectors throughout Australia. At the meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for small business on 28 August 1992, Ministers wrote to two major accounting bodies asking them· to consider the mutual benefits, to both their members and small business clients, of a national system of training and accreditation for ""small business specialist"" accountants. The request has been actively pursued by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Delivery of localised management education services by industry associations has been a high priority of the Small Business Coalition. Industry associations are becoming increasingly aware of theif potential role in assisting small business to access training, particularly through the use of their extensive networks. These networks are being used to raise awareness of the benefits of developing management capabilities, to coordinate the delivery of a range of training and business advisory services and to disseminate information and promote initiatives. At their meeting on 28 August 1992, Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for small business agreed to write to the Treasurer supporting amendments to the taxation structure to encourage intending smaIl business owner/managers to undertake training prior to the establishment of their businesses. The Government, however, subsequently decided not to allow tax deductibility of business establishment costs. Recommendation 11, 12, 15,26: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been advised that the US Bureau of Census does not use time boxes on any of its forms, but has to inform the Office of Management and Budget of burden estimates as p- of a form approval process. i' The Government has placed considerable emphasis on identifying the nature and sources of paperwork burden. The ABS was commissioned in January 1992 to conduct 219 case studies of a wide range of small' businesses to document the areas where the burden of Commonwealth, StatelTerritory and Local government-imposed paperwork is most onerous. The study found that the level of government paperwork is not as high as anecdotal evidence might suggest. However, specific areas of concern were identified. For instance, it was found that a heavy paperwork burden fell on the building industry. As part of the Business Regulation Reform Package, announced in the Working Nation statement, the. Government announced the development of an interactive computer system that will allow for the formulation, lodgement and consideration of development and building applications on screen, thereby saving considerably on the time and paperwork necessary for building developments. A further study focussing specifically on tax compliance was jointly conducted by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The objective of this study was to identify areas where the compliance cost for small business taxpayers could be reduced and to explore potential solutions. The report did not confirm some of the popularly held views on the cost of taxation compliance, but did identify a number of problem areas. The ATO is taking steps to address cost of compliance issues and has established a Small Business Consultative Group, in conjunction with the Small Business Coalition, to assist in this process. The Assistant Treasurer, the Hon George Gear, MP, has announced a number of initiatives which impact on the small business sector, including a review of the Fringe Benefits Tax, a taxpayers' charter of rights, a tax ombudsman and an impact analysis prior to legislative changes. The Government has released the first Draft Bill on new substantiation rules produced by the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP). The TLIP was formed to address a Joint Committee on Public Accounts report which recommended the rewriting . of the income tax laws. The Draft Bill has clarified substantiation requirements covering travel expenses, receipts, written evidence, expense records and the treatment of partnerships. Recommendation 13: The CommonweaIth, State and Territory Governments signed the Mutual Recognition Agreement in May 1992 allowing for any good that can be legally sold in any other. The Agreement also allowed for similar mobility within occupations, allowing anyone registered to provide a service to carry out their occupation throughout Australia. The Agreement significantly reduced the regulatory barriers within Australia, better allowing firms to seek out new market opportunities. The benefits of mutual recognition are not necessarily limited to intra-Australian trade. At the February 1994 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), the Prime Minister gained agreement from Premiers and Chief Ministers for discussions to be held with New Zealand to expand the mutual recognition concept across the Tasman. These discussions are now well advanced, with a draft Agreement between Australia and New Zealand to be presented to COAG for consideration in August 1995. Recommendation 14: All States and Territories have established business licensing information centres that provide existing aild new businesses with a one-stop point of inquiry through which information and application forms for all Commonwealth and Statefferritory licences can be obtained. The Business Licence Information System (BLlS), a joint Commonwealth-Statefferritory initiative, provides an easily accessible electronic register of licence information for particular commercial activities. The Commonwealth Government announced a $2.9 million package in Working Nation to extend BLIS beyond June 1994 and to investigate its expansion to include local government licence requirements. The Commonwealth Government committed $2.2 million in Working Nation to develop and implement a strategy of local government business regulation reform. The program builds upon the successful Local Approvals Review Program (LARP), a joint Commonwealth, Statetrerritory and local government initiative which has significantly reduced the paperwork burden for businesses seeking development and building approvals. Recommendation 16: The Legislative Instruments Act 1994, currently before the Parliament, seeks to establish mandatory consultation requirements for delegated legislation. These consultation requirements will enable sectors of the community, including small business, affected by legislation, to comment on the potential impact before being passed into law. Recommendation 17: The Business Regulation Reform Package, announced in Working Nation, significantly enhanced the resources of the Office of Regulation Review (ORR). The additional funding will enable the ORR to respond to the increasing demand for regulation assessment. The $1.6 million package significantly increases the role that the ORR is expected to play in the portfolio reviews of existing regulation, announced in Working Nation. The Government is committed to formally include the ORR in the regulatory process. Regulatory impact statements, prepared by the ORR or other qualified agencies, will play an important role in the Government's consideration of new regulation, particularly that which impacts on business. Recommendation 18: The Commonwealth has implemented a number of initiatives to improve community awareness of regulation and increase the role that the community plays in new regulation. These initiatives include the Legislative Instruments Act currently being considered by the Parliament. Apart from the increased consultation requirements (see Recommendation 16), the Act establishes an electronic register of delegated instruments which will be available for public access. The Council of Business Representatives, announced in Working Nation, will provide the Government with business advice on regulation review and reform. When taken with other initiatives, the Government has established processes which subject regulation to a greater degree of public and Parliamentary scrutiny than ever before. The portfolio reviews of existing regulation, also announced in Working Nation, will review the body of regulatory instruments created by the Commonwealth Government. These reviews will, in many instances for the first time, subject Commonwealth regulation to scrutiny with regard to its impact on business. Much of this regulation predates the Government's policy of minimum effective regulation, announced in 1985, where the benefits of regulation must clearly outweigh the costs. Recommendation 19: The Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers (SCOCAM) is examining, among other matters, whether the prescribed amount in Section 4B of the Trade Practices Act should be increased. A report from the Working Party on Uniformity has been forwarded to SCOCAM members, recommending an increase from $40,000 to $60,000. This increase would reflect a consumer price index adjustment over the relevant period. Recommendation 20, 24: In July 1991, the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) presented a detailed report on unconscionable conduct to the Attorney General and the Minister responsible for small business. The TPC report concluded that the benefits outweighed the costs of regulating unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions. The TPC considered that the most appropriate means of regulating such conduct was to create a new part of the Trade Practices Act (TPA). The advantage of such an approach was increased certainty and predicability in the law and the development of greater business awareness of unconscionable conduct. The matter was subsequently referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report. The Committee recommended that Section 51AA of the TPA be repealed and that legislation be introduced giving the TPC the ability to bring proceedings on behalf of a person who has a right of action at common law arising from the unconscionable conduct of another. In June 1992, the Attorney-General announced that the Government had decided to introduce a new provision to the TPA prohibiting unconscionable conduct in the course of commercial transactions in trade and commerce. The amendments to the TPA were assented to in December 1992.' The amendments do not alter the law regarding consumer transactions. The advantage of incorporating the existing law in a Statute lies in the additional remedies the Act can provide and the scope for the TPC to take representative actions on behalf of small companies. Recommendation 21: Following the release of the Government's response to the Parliamentary report, the Trade Practices Commission has been allocated with additional resources. The implementation of a National Competition Policy, as recommended in the Hilmer Report and endorsed by all Australian governments at COAG in February and August 1994, will require a reassessment of resources to the Government's competition policy regulators. Recommendation 22, 23: At their meeting on 19 December 1990, Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for small business requested that State and Territory small business agencies establish a working party to report on the status of retail and commercial tenancy arrangements in States and Territories. The working party's report was considered by Small Business Ministers at their meeting in Darwin on 3 July 1991. The State and Territory Ministers asked the Commonwealth Minister to facilitate a study to examine whether non-uniformity between the States and Territories was an issue of concern and whether a set of common provisions in commercial tenancy regulations should be codified. The report, Common National Commercial and Retail Tenancy Issues 1991, detailed a set of minimum provisions for tenancy arrangements. Small Business Ministers considered the report at their subsequent meeting in Melbourne in March 1992. Ministers agreed to encourage the acceptance of the minimum common provisions outlined in the report in State based legislation or industry codes of conduct covering retail and commercial tenancy agreements. The lack of uniformity between the States and Territories did not emerge as a major issue during the study. Rather, the study found that the underlying areas of concern are a deficiency in landlord/tenancy awareness of contractual issues and in dispute resolution. Most State and Territory governments have passed new or amended legislation in keeping with the minimum provisions of the tenancy arrangements identified in the report. The Trade Practices Commission has also announced an inquiry into the leasing practices of the Westfield Group, partially in response to small business concerns in this area. Recommendation 25: The Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology commissioned a study of tax compliance obligations for small business. Conducted by Ian Wallschutzky and Brian Gibson of the University of Newcastle, the study, Small Business Costs of Compliance Project-Final Report, was submitted in 1992. The report found that many of the popular views of compliance costs for small business were unfounded. It did confirm a number of problem areas, and the ATO has taken steps to address compliance issues by forming extensive consultative mechanisms with small business. These include Small Business Liaison Groups in each State or Territory capital city, the Small Business Consultative Group, comprising 10 members of the Small Business Coalition, the Tax Liaison Group, comprising representatives from a range of firm sizes and conferences and seminars with small business representatives. Other areas in which the ATO has improved its advisory services to small business include Small Business Information Kits, pamphlets on tax requirements such as record keeping and TaxCourse which provides a grounding in tax and associated business methods for small business taxpayers so that small businesses can integrate their tax affairs into their wider business approaches. TaxCourse is now offered at over 120 Colleges of TAFE throughout Australia. Also a pilot Integrated Payments and Service System will streamline reporting requirements for taxpayers paying a number of taxes, such as PAYE, PPS, FBT and Sales Tax. Recommendation 27,28,31,32: A broad review of Wholesale Sales Tax (WST) was announced in the 1990 Budget. The review aimed to improve the efficiency of the system by reducing compliance costs for firms and the Australian Taxation Office. The WST legislation was amended to anow firms with a WST liability of less than $50,000 to lodge returns and payments quarterly rather than monthly from 1 August 1991. The $50,000 threshold is indexed at the beginning of each financial year in line with movements in the consumer price index. The system benefits over 80 per cent of taxpayers. In April 1992 the Government announced measures to simplify and streamline the operation of WST. Reporting requirements were reduced, and business people are no longer liable for sales tax if they accept in good faith a false or incorrect sales tax exemption certificate. In addition, the Government introduced a new WST concession for small business which gave taxpayers with an annual liability of less than $10,000 the option of remaining outside the sales tax system. Recommendation 29: The simplification of the Wholesale Sales Tax (WST) system and the change in WST remittance arrangements, which have reduced the burden of sales tax collection on small business, were considered adequate compensation for the cost of sales tax collection. Recommendation 30: The Government decided not to extend the period for Wholesale Sales Tax payments. It believes that extended settlement periods are an issue best dealt with between firms and their customers. Recommendation 33: The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) aims to respond to correspondence from businesses about the classification of goods within 28 days. It aims to determine 80 per cent of less complex objections about the classification of goods within 12 weeks and 65 per cent of more complex objections within 16 weeks. Cost sales tax objections involve complex issues. The ATO has advised that the adoption of the recommendation would deliver administrative problems because it would give paramountcy of sales tax income over income tax disputes, fast track relief is already available in the courts in relation to sales tax disputes and the sales tax review, by increasing the efficiency of the sales tax administration system, should reduce the number of disputes between businesses and the ATO. Recommendation 34: In the 1992 One Nation statement the Government announced that the exemption from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for 20 per cent of the goodwill realised on the sale of a small business would be increased to 50 per cent, while the ceiling on the net value of businesses owned by a taxpayer who is entitled to this relief would be increased from $1 million to $2 million. This ceiling is indexed annually against the consumer price index. Recommendation 35: Given the current low inflation rate and indications that low inflation is economically sustainable, this issue is not considered to be a high priority. A Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment (TSVA) scheme operated between 1976-77 and 1978-79 to provide partial compensation for businesses for the impact of inflation on trading stocks, but was rescinded due to its cost and the extent of abuse of the provision. In addition, a TSVA scheme would provide adjustment in respect of only one of the effects of inflation on business income. Recommendation 36: Income averaging is currently granted only to those categories of taxpayers whose incomes typically fluctuate markedly from year to year. The provision is available to primary producers, artists, composers, inventors, performers, production associates, sportspeople and writers. Extending the provision to small business in general would raise problems with regard to the equitable tax treatment of other taxpayers. Recommendation 37: The Parliamentary Committee did not find evidence to suggest that the majority of unincorporated businesses are greatly disadvantaged by the higher top rate of personal income tax. The average rate of tax for unincorporated businesses was reduced in 1993-94 and a further reduction will be introduced when fiscal conditions permit, probably in 1998. Recommendation 38: This year the Government reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. If a taxpayer expects that their income will be lower than in the previous year they may vary their provisional tax down. Generally, provisional tax is paid by the taxpayer in quarterly instalments if the taxpayer paid more than $8000 provisional tax in the previous year. Where a taxpayer paid less than $8000 provisional tax in the previous year, they pay in a lump sum no earlier than 31 March which is nine months after the start of the income tax year. Taxpayers can vary their provisional tax in each quarter. Recommendation 39: An Australian Taxation Office project team examined this issue in the context of an examination of penalties. Where provisional tax in respect of 1993-94 and any subsequent years remains unpaid after the due date the taxpayer will be liable to pay late payment penalty tax at a rate of 8 per cent and late payment penalty interest at a rate calculated by reference to the market rates. In October 1992, the rate oflate payment penalty tax payable on unpaid tax in respect of earlier income years was reduced from 20 per cent to 16 per cent per annum. Recommendation 40: The Australian Taxation Office has reviewed provisional tax penalties and cash flow problems and, as a result, has changed penalty rates, the timing of payments and the uplift factor. In 1993 the Government also reintroduced quarterly payments of company tax in response to widespread demand from small business. These measures are expected to help small firms in organising their cash flows. Recommendation 42: Since 1 July 1990 group employers with annual PAYE tax remittances of less than $10,000 have been allowed to send in quarterly, rather than monthly remittances. In I, addition, small firms no longer have to contact the Australian Taxation Office or send in a nil payment advice if they do not make any deductions from their employees during a payment period. These measures were introduced specifically to help very small firms, which studies have shown are most adversely affected by compliance costs and cash flow problems. Recommendation 43: On 1 April 1992 (the beginning of the 1992-93 Fringe Benefits Tax year) the upper limit for annual Fringe Benefits Tax payments was raised from $1,000 to $3,000. Recommendation 45, 47, 48, 49: The Parliamentary Committee's recommendations were incorporated in the terms of reference for the Industry Commission's Inquiry on the Availability of Capital which was announced by the Treasurer on 6 December 1990. The report was released in December 1991. The Martin Committee tabled its report, A Pocket Full of Change, in November 1991. This report was the result of an inquiry into the competiestablishment tiveness of the banking sector which was also asked to inquire into whether the benefits of competition were being passed on to different sectors of the economy, including small business. The February 1992 One Nation statement contained a number of initiatives to address the financial needs of the small business sector, including providing concessional taxation treatment for investment companies established as Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) to improve the availability of patient long term equity capital for small and medium sized firms with total assets of less than $30 million. The One Nation statement also announced the introduction of ""debt for equity"" swap provisions which allow banks to write off loans to troubled businesses trying to trade their way out of difficulties and which has also enabled banks to increase lending to small business. In 1993, the Government enhanced the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Changes included an augmentation to the CDB's capital base of $30 million, which has increased the bank's ability to lend to small business by around $250 million and a continuing subsidy of $20 million to the parent bank to support the CDB's lending activities. In the Working Nation statement, the Government implemented a raft of initiatives to further improve the level of small business access to finance. Initiatives announced included adjustments to the PDF program to increase their attractiveness in the marketplace, education initiatives forbusiness advisers, the establishment of a pilot Business Equity Information Program, the establishment of a model of best practice for a range of industry sectors to assist banks to understand and assess the future prospects of small businesses and to standardise loan application and approval processes. The Government has also taken important steps to increase the availability of capital for export and innovation activities within the small business sector. An important result of the Government's approach to addressing the issue of access to capital has been improved communication between the small business sector and the banking community. As a result of this, banking, accounting and industry bodies have released a number of guides for small business on how to prepare loan applications and how to strategically plan to meet the financing needs of their businesses. Recommendation 46: The Small to Medium Enterprise Development Program, announced in March 1991, outlined the initiatives the Government would take to assist small businesses in accessing international markets. Details on the and funding of the Export Access program were announced by the then Minister for Small Business in the 1991 Budget. The Export Access program is based upon similar principles to the French FONDEXPA model which entails the delivery of government funded export services for small businesses through private sector providers. This approach is aimed at providing an effective and enhanced delivery mechanism which makes use of existing international business networks and fosters significantly closer cooperation between Government and private sector providers. The success of the Export Access program has encouraged the Government to provide additional resources. In the February 1993 One Nation statement, the Government announced that an additional $12. million would be devoted to the program to help around 700 small firms access international markets. In response to the Australian Manufacturing Council's Emerging Exporters report, the Government further enhanced the Export Access program and various other export development programs were enhanced to improve small business access. Recommendation 50: Implementation of this recommendation is the responsibility of the State and Territory education authorities. The recommendation was strongly supported by Small Business Ministers and the National Small Business Forum. In Working Nation, the Government established a small business stream in the Australian Vocational Certificate Training System. In addition, the Industry Task Force on Leadership and Management Skills is to report to the Government late in 1994 on options for providing small business and entrepreneurial training at all levels of education. The Government will carefully consider the recommendations contained in the Task Force's final report. The Australian Quality Council initiated the ""E"" (for Enterprise) Team program in 1991 to enhance student learning, to assist them in the transition to the workforce, to develop entrepreneurial skills and foster an appreciation of continuous improvement through practical industry experience. AusIndustry has provided funding to allow the program to be field tested nationally during 1994-95. During 1994 the E Team program was implemented in all capital cities (except Darwin), with more than 300 teams participating in the program. A number of regional centres were also involved. Recommendation 51: As an integral part of the national move towards competency based training, competency standards are being developed for a range of vocations in most industry sectors. The standards are used as benchmarks for curriculum development, the delivery of training, assessment and the recognition of prior learning. They are developed and implemented by Competency Standards Bodies (CSBs), which are national industry bodies recognised by the National Training Board. In 1991 the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry formed the Small Business Management CSB, with industry, government and training authority representation. The Commonwealth Departments of Industry, Science and Technology and Employment, Education and Training each provided funding to support consultation by the CSB with relevant groups. Small Business Management Competency Standards were endorsed by the National Training Board in May 1993. The Standards will not only raise the quality and consistency of small business management training in Australia, but will be integrated into other industry specific standards. In May 1992, the Government announced the formation of an Industry Task Force on Leadership and Management Skills. The Task Force has three sub-committees, focusing on small business, management skills and higher education. The terms of reference require the Task Force to report on, among other matters, the management training and advisory needs of small and medium sized enterprises and to advise on strategies. to meet those needs. The final report of the Task Force is expected to be released in late 1994. Recommendation 52: A review of the National Information Awareness Program (NIAP), including an examination of Commonwealth funding arrangements, was undertaken by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology in 1991. The review found a lack of uniformity in the program between different States which prevented cumulative recognition and publicity benefits. In addition, there were varying levels of enthusiasm and participation in the program from professional bodies in the different States. The review found that while the program often resulted in a short term increase in the level of access to professional advice by small business, it was difficult to instil a long term attitudinal change to the access and quality of professional advice to small business. Commonwealth funding was progressively withdrawn from NIAP from 1991 onwards. However, the State small business development corporations still carry out activities to encourage small business to seek professional advice and improve the quality and relevance of that professional advice. A key initiative to come from the May 1994 Working Nation statement is the establishment of AusIndustry. This new body will improve the delivery of Commonwealth and State business improvement programs to enterprises. It will ensure that businesses throughout Australia have access to relevant, useful information about, and improved access to business improvement programs. AusIndustry will bring together under one umbrella a range of Commonwealth and State programs relevant to business. Further, the BizLink family of products will deliver timely and effective information to small businesses. The first product, to be delivered in late 1994, is BizHelp, an electronic directory of assistance programs and industry extension services. BizHelp quickly provides tailored information for individual firms, providing program and contact details. It provides eligibility criteria for the programs which will assist the user to decide whether to pursue an enquiry. BizHelp has been designed for use by private sector business advisers-including accountants, bankers, management consultants and solicitors. These people will be able to make use of BizHelp in a proactive manner to provide a more comprehensive and accurate package of information about assistance and development programs. Public sector clients will also be able to utilise BizHelp to provide accurate referrals between various agencies. BizHelp is the result of collaboration between the Commonwealth and State governments. State agencies collect and update information for BizHelp on a quarterly basis, ensuring that information held in the BizHelp database is accurate. Recommendation 53: In May 1994, as part of the Working Nation statement, the Government suspended the Training Guarantee Levy (TGL) for two years. Industry has responded positively to its training obligations since the introduction of the TGL and the Government will abolish the levy in two years time if there is clear evidence that business is continuing to meet its training obligations. In 1991 the Bureau of Industry Economics conducted a review of training needs in small business. More recent studies by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Industry Task Force on Leadership and agement Skills suggest a number of options improving existing training courses and when the final Industry Task Force report is submitted in 1994, the Government will carefully consider recommendations. Working Nation also contained a number of initiatives designed to improve training provision to both employers and employees in the small business sector. These initiatives include developing case studies and best practice material to support training and education programs, appointing additional facilitators and increasing national promotion for the Enterprise Workshop scheme, introducing a small business stream to the AustralCommonwealth Ian Vocational Certificate Training System, develcase oping pilots in open learning to provide a delivery framework for women in small business and addressing barriers to the take-up of labour market programs for self-employment by women. Recommendation 54: The Government nounced in December 1990 the formation of a Franchising Task Force to develop a code of self regulation. Membership of the Task Force was drawn predominantly from the private sector, balanced representation from franchisors, franchiConsumer sees and other interested parties. The Franchising Task Force provided a final report to the then Minister in December 1991, recommending that a self-regulatory Franchising Code of Practice was the most appropriate arrangeautomatic ment to address the problems of the franchising sector while stimulating the sector's growth. Code is essentially sector based and involves minimal Government intervention. This approach minimises regulatory costs and impediments growth of the franchising industry. Earlier in 1994 concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the Code and in August 1994 the Government announced a review of the Code. The review is being undertaken by an independent consultant, Mr Robert Gardini. An effective volunual tary Code will be the minimum acceptable outfinancial come. Recommendation 55, 56: The Attorney-General established the Corporations Law Simplification Task Force in October 1993. Numerous requests to consider the needs of small business led the Task Force to give an extremely high priority to small business structures. The first exposure draft Bill produced by the Corporations Law Simplification T- Force was released in July 1994. Previous proposals to ease the burden on small business (the Close Corporations Act 1989 and the private company structure proposed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities) have involved creating a new company structure additional to those already in the CorporaMantions Law. These proposals were criticised as for adding complexity and offering an alternative corporate structure of only limited benefit. The Bill late seeks to achieve the deregulatory aspects of those all earlier proposals, without the complexity and expense involved in conversion. In these circumstances the close corporations legislation (which was never brought into force because of constitutional difficulties) will be repealed by the Bill. Recommendation 57, 58, 59: As the Parliamentary report recognised, the law of business names in Australia is governed by State and Territory legislation. This significantly limits the ability of the Commonwealth to act in this area. Where the does have some power, as in the for companies, action is underway. Company names have been identified as an area for review in the Corporations Law Simplification Program. The Attorney-General announced, in August 1994, that company names will be one of eight areas of Corporation Law to be examined in Stage Two of anthe Simplification Program. Recommendation 60: Substantial amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 were tabled on 14 with November 1991 by the Minister for Justice and Affairs. The Amended Act received assent in January 1992 and its substantive provisions were proclaimed to come into effect from July 1992. The amendments remove difficulties, uncertainties and costs associated with the current early discharge and objections to the bankrupts' discharge after three years. The changes result in the period of bankruptcy being administraThe tively extended to eight years, they encourage cooperation in the administration of estates and remove the cost associated with discharge and to the annulment if debts are paid in full. The amendments have not directly addressed the concerns regarding restricting the application of Part X of the Bankruptcy Act. Part X are arrangements made between debtors and their creditors under the Bankruptcy Act. They allow an individin financial trouble to offer their creditors a deal which extinguishes creditor claims and avoids bankruptcy for the debtor. Recommendation 61: To increase the participation of small businesses in government purchasing opportunities, Meet the Buyers fairs have been held since 1990. At these events, major Commonwealth departments staff information stalls which assist small 'business people to meet with departmental purchasing officers and to understand their requirements. State governments now hold similar events in capital cities and regional areas. Commonwealth agencies have been regular participants in and supporters of these events. In January 1993, the Government announced, as part of a package of new initiatives in government purchasing, that the Meet the Buyers program would be developed into a coordinated national system of trade fairs, with a particular focus on the needs of small and medium sized businesses. Following the release of the Parliamentary report, Buying Our Future, the Government implemented a range of initiatives in the May 1994 Working Nation statement to improve small business access to government purchasing. These include the establishment of a Support for Australian Suppliers program. The Government has allocated $9.6 million over four years to educating industry on government purchasing needs and improving information on potential Australian suppliers. Purchasing officers will also be better trained and the introduction of electronic commerce for government purchasing will provide enhanced information about current purchasing needs. Recommendation 62: A working group of the Standing Committee on Attorneys-General (SCAG) considered the possibility of achieving uniformity in cooperatives legislation. The States and Territories indicated that there would be little support for Commonwealth legislation and that a State template legislation approach would provide the best option for achieving uniformity. Research into cooperative movements has revealed the potential for new organisational operating forms, such as enterprise networks and clusters. Enterprise networks allow groups of firms to combine to achieve outcomes, domestically and internationally, that would not otherwise be possible for individual enterprises to achieve. In this regard, networking offers small businesses the opportunity to enjoy the benefits that come with being small while avoiding some of the disadvantages. The Government is highly supportive of the networking and wider cooperative concepts and acted in the Working Nation statement to encourage greater networking among Australian small and medium enterprises. In Working Nation, the Government announced the new Business Networks Program involving $38 million in funding over four years. The program makes use of network brokers to prepare a feasibility plan for the network, then progress to a business plan and, finally, bring the network into effective operation. Recommendation 63: The superannuation regulatory regime has been significantly overhauled with the replacement of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. A Senate Select Committee has been established to examine general superannuation issues and particular issues related to award-based superannuation. The Committee is to report to the Senate at regular intervals. The Committee is also reviewing the Superannuation Guarantee Charge. Recommendation 64: No progress has been made on this recommendation. Recommendation 65: Business associations participating in the National Small Business Forum have indicated that they do not want any action taken on this recommendation. Recommendation 66: In the 1994 Budget the Government introduced changes to Employee Share schemes. Employees participating in schemes that offer shares in their employer's company are now able either to receive $500 per year in the form of tax exempt discounts on shares, or to defer tax for up to ten years on up to $1500 worth of shares. In both cases the shares must be held for at least five years. These changes formed part of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No.4 (1994), which is currently before Parliament. National Review of Education for . Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People: Report Launch (Question No. 1680) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 20 October 1994: (1) Did the Commonwealth pay for Yothu Yindi to appear at the launch of the report of the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; if so, what sum was paid. (2) Were other Aboriginal groups considered for appearance at the launch; if not, why not. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth met the costs incurred by Yothu Yindi in breaking their return journey from the United States of America to perform at the launch of the report of the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. These costs amounted to $39,120. (2) The Reference Group overseeing the review considered that the link between the Chair of the Group, Mandawuy Yunupingu, and Yothu Yindi should be highlighted to draw popular attention to this important report. Yothu Yindi's appearance at the launch was seen as a manifest demonstration of the Reference Group's and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' ownership of, and commitment to, the report. Mr Yunupingu donated his time. Carers' Pension (Question No. 1684) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 November 1994: (1) How many recipients of carers' pensions aged between 60 and 65 are (a) male and (b) female. (2) Are carers aged between 60 and 65 eligible for other benefits, such as the Mature Age Allowance, following the death of the person who received care. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) As at 17 June 1994, there were 255 male recipients of carer pension aged 60 to 64 years. (1) (b) As at 17 June 1994, there were 4 female recipients of carer pension aged 60 to 64 years. (2) Following the death of the person who received care, carer pensioners are entitled to continue to receive carer pension for a further 14 weeks. Former carer pensioners aged between 60 and 65 are eligible for other payments under the Social Security Act, subject to meeting the eligibility requirements. To receive Mature Age Allowance, a claimant must have received an income support payment for 12 months or more and been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for twelve months. Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme (Question No. 1687) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 7 November 1994: (1) Has the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme been extended to cover senior secondary boarding students free of an assets test; if so, (a) how many children will benefit, (b) what is the estimated breakdown by (i) age and (ii) State of the children who will benefit, and (c) is the change permanent; if not, why not. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Government extended access to AIC additional boarding allowance for secondary students aged 16 and over from 1 October 1994. Such students are now eligible for up to $3449 a year free of assets testing but subject to tests on parental income similar to those applying to AUSTUDY. (2) It was estimated that approximately 450 students would benefit from the change. To date, 155 families have applied and been assessed as eligible for the extra assistance. The Government's subsequent decision of 21 September 1994 to widen access to AUSTUDY for families in 'exceptional circumstance drought affected areas' has meant that some students who would potentially have benefited from the AIC change will be better off transferring to AUSTUDY. (3) (i) Students will be aged from 16 to 19 years. (ii) The estimated breakdown by Staterrerritory is: NSW/ACT-I25 VIC-9 QLD-I26 WA-I40 SA-I5 TAS-2I NT-I 5 (4) The change is permanent. It applies across the AIC Scheme, that is, it is not confined to families in drought affected areas. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Publications . (Question No. 1693) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 8 November 1994: (1) Do his Department and its agencies use Australian goods and services in producing their publications wherever possible. (2) Were an Australian photographer and Australian models used to produce the photograph on page 16 of the publication entitled Australian Training, Vol 1, Issue 1, August 1994, for the Australian National Training Authority; if not, why not. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Department of Employment, Education and Training recently let a contract for the production and distribution of forms and client information publications to an Australian consortium headed by the JS MCMillan Printing Group in Sydney. The consortium includes companies based in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide. The consortium uses Australian made paper wherever possible. (2) The photograph was provided to the Australian National Training Authority from a Brisbane graphic arts and photographic company, Art Projects, which is one of two Brisbane-based companies involved in . producing Australian Training. Castles, Professor S. (Question No. 1695) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 November 1994: Is it a fact that Professor Stephen Castles, director of the Centre for Multicultural Studies at Wollongong University, is simultaneously chair of the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research's Advisory Committee, a member of the Multicultural Advisory Committee and a member of the Steering Committee for the 1995 Global Diversity Conference; if so, (a) what sum is the commonwealth paying to Professor Castles in respect of each position, (b) why have so many positions been assigned to him and (c) what is the connection between each· position in terms of the integration of overall government immigration and multiculturalism policy. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Professor Stephen Castles is currently chair of the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research Advisory Committee (BIPRAC) and a member of the National Multicultural Advisory Council and of the Steering Committee of the 1995 Global Diversity Conference. (a) I am advised that membership of the above committees does not attract a fixed salary, but a daily sitting fee of $253 for BIPRAC and $276 for each of the other committees.
