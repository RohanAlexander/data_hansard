2,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of Australian delegation to the 91st Inter-Parliaoutlined mentary Union Conference held of the bilateral visit to Turkey, March to April 1994. The 91st Inter-Parliamentary Conference occurred at a time when the IPU wished to focus particular attention on the issues peacekeeping and the United Nations in a post Cold War era, and on !he preservati?n the environment. Accordmgly, these Items were scheduled as the principal agenda at the conference under the headings 'Prevention of conflicts, maintenance and consolidation of peace: role and means of the United Nations and regional organisations' and 'Waste management for a healthy environcharacterised ment'. The Australian delegation submitted a resolution on the first of these and expanded upon its themes during debate and discussion at the conference. The Australian approach focused on two issues: peace building and preventive diplomacy and the peaceful resolufruitful tion of disputes. In relation to peace building, the delegation stressed the need to accompany any strategy for peace with a strategy for development. International cooperation to strengthen socio-economic development must underpin efforts to build peace and security. On preventive diplomacy, the delegation recognised that effective dispute resolution and conflict prevention is preferable to delaysembly. ing action until armed conflict has begun. It called on governments to provide political practical assistance to the UN Secretaryleader· General in his efforts for peaceful settlement of disputes. In the context of consideration of this topic, the Australian delegation provided to each delegation in attendance at the Paris conferalism ence a copy of the book Cooperating for peace by Australia's foreign minister, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans. The book was well received by other delegations with some subsequently requesting further copies. The resolution ultimately adopted by the conference reflected the themes pursued by the Australian delegation. It stressed the importance of restructuring the United Nations organisation to enable it to meet the new the challenges of the post Cold War er- - d a range of approaches to assIst m in Paris and achieving this goal. Many other meetings were attended by - he delegation during the conference. They meluded the meeting of women parliamentarians, and meetings of the Asia-Pacific and of 12+ groups, the executive committee, the Inter-Parliamentary Council and the Commitof tee on Human Rights of Parliamentarians. Details of the deliberations of these groups items can be found in the report. On the completion of the IPU conference, the delegation travelled to Turkey to undertake a bilateral visit there. The visit was by great warmth and hospitality, which served to further strengthen the links between our countries. We would certainly draft like to thank our hosts for that visit. Because of local elections at the time, it was not possible for a visit to be made to Ankara, Turkey's capital and home of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. However, discussions on a range of issues were held in Istanbul with President Cindoruk and other assembly members. The delegation appreciated the willingness of our hosts to enter into frank discussion on topical issues at the time-the outcome of the local government elections, the Kurdish question, Cyprus, and the lifting of parliamentary immunity for certain members of the Grand National As I would like to thank the members of the and delegation-Senator Calvert, the deputy Senators Coates and Reid; and the honou-able member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-for their cooperation and support. I also thank the delegation secretary, Anne Hazelton, for her dedication, total professionand ever-cheerful assistance to us all, and also Ms Geraldine Skinner, my personal adviser. I also record the appreciation of assistance provided by Ambassadors Alan Brown and Geoffrey Price, the embassy staff of Paris and Turkey, the Parliamentary Library, and Can· berra based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the invaluable briefings they provided to the delegation. I commend the report to the House.",11
3,Mr LEO MCLEAY,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, I have great pleasure in supporting your remarks on the 91st IPU conference held in Paris. Once again, the Australian delegation was very active in the activities of the IPU. In recent years, we have taken a role which, I think, has added some considerable shine to Australia's reputation. We have also been able to ensure that we have had a disproportionate number of resolutions, particularly relating to trade issues, debated by the IPU where we have been able to put our position and have it supported across the conference. Australia was involved in a number of issues at the Paris conference. One that I would like to speak about in particular was the declaration adopted on free and fair elections. For some time in recent years the IPU has seen reflected in its membership the remarkable change that has swept across the world, with the resurgence of democracy in Europe, in parts of Africa and in Asia. The delegations that have attended the IPU have turned from those from the Eastern bloc that, in many instances, used to be mono-political to those that represent very vibrant democracies. The IPU has started to take a view that it will only accept as new members parliaments that are committed to democratic values. Part of the reinforcement of that was the declaration on the criteria for free and fair elections which was adopted on 26 March at the IPU conference in Paris. I had the honour to be the rapporteur for the committee that dealt with this declaration. I am very pleased to say that there was very little change to the text made at the committee stage. The text that was adopted by the IPU conference would reflect the way in which elections occur in democracies such as ours. The IPU executive has made that text the yardstick by which it would like to see new entrants considered. From our point of view, as a parliament that has participated in the IPU for many years, that mechanism which we have adopted is very useful. Members who attended those conferences in the 1960s, the 1970s and the early 1980s would have seen delegations that were representative of only one point of view; it was very difficult to get democratic proposals through the conference. The swing that has now occurred has made the IPU a lot more relevant to modern politics than it was in the 1970s and the early 1980s. The IPU has 129 countries represented in it. Parliamentarians from 112 countries attended the conference in Paris that adopted this proposal. Before I resume my seat I would like to say a couple of words on the role that Australian delegations have played in recent years at the IPU. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has taken a leading role in the women parliamentarians meeting, and she has also done a lot of work with the Asia-Pacific parliamentary group. It is of interest to recall that the Asia-Pacific parliamentary group was sponsored by the Australian delegation when Roger Shipton and Tom Uren were our two delegates. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has been a member of the Cyprus committee, which has played a role in the IPU. Senator Calvert was elected at the last conference to be the vice-chairman of one of the IPU's standing committees. At the last conference, I completed four years on the IPU executive, finishing my term as the deputy president. For a relatively small country, Australia has played a significant role over the years. All the members who will attend future IPU conferences can look at the work that their colleagues have done and feel that Australia is certainly held in high regard in that forum of international parliamentarians. With 129 countries being affiliated and usually 110 to 120 parliaments being represented at each conference, it is the oldest and the largest forum of politicians in the world. I am very pleased that the Australian parliament has been playing a role in it. The declaration on free and fair elections that we adopted at the last conference is a landmark decision for the IPU to have taken. (NA (STANDARDS OF SERVICE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Forrest.",12
4,Mr FORREST,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The aim of the Telecommunications (Standards of Service) Amendment Bill is to provide statutive tory provisions to prevent consumers in areas from falling even further behind the majority of Australian consumers with regard to the quality and quantity of new technology associated with the telecommunications ty services to which they have access. The substandard level of services in rural highlighted by a number of basic facts. The first of these is that fault clearance within one working day is deteriorating rapidly. Secondly, almost all rural consumers have a fault sufficient in severity to degrade their service, and many such faults are outside even the limits set by providers. The third and most telling point is that 74 per cent of rural and remote exchanges still remain to be upgraded to the point at which consumers are able to access detailed billing, carrier preselection, cal1 plan charging options, and IDD and STD ring-backs. In comparison, only one per cent of metropolitan exchanges are yet be so upgraded. My motivation in presenting this bill is driven by my frustration at the absence of decent mobile telephone network in my own part electorate. This is an area nearly one-quarter of the state of Victoria and of which less than 15 per cent is served by mobile telephone. This bill will amend the principal act, the Telecommunications Act 1991, to make the standard telephone definition more relevant current consumer needs and more responsive to future technological developments. The standard telephone service is to be renamed the 'standard telecommunications service', which al1 Australians should be entitled to access in order to conduct their businesses in a modern world's best practice manner. The bill will provide for the definition to be amended on the basis of recommendations made by Austel under section 40 of the principal act. This is a significant alteration as previously the standard telephone service definition was defined as only a basic handset facility unless otherwise prescribed by the minister by regulation. The bill provides that Austel's current responsibilities, defined in section 40 in relation to carrier performance and competisafeguards, is to be expanded to include rural consideration of the appropriateness and equity of the standard telecommunications service definition. Special regard is to be given to the service availability to the majoriof Australians, the implications of making such services available national1y and the areas is technical demands of consumers. As wel1 as reporting on the adequacy of the definition, Austel will also be empowered to recommend to the minister changes in that definition. It is likely then that the standard telecommunications service which consumers are entitled to access will continue to change in response to the advent of new technology. It may be mobile telephones today but video conferencing and other technologies in the future. If the minister accepts wholly or in part the recommendations of Austel, the change to the standard telecommunications service definito tion would be effected through regulation and then would be a disallowable instrument through either house of the parliament. also Austel's assessment of the standard telecoma munications service would be published as of the authority'S annual report on carrier performance. The biII complies with standing orders 292 and 293 and consequently requires no appropriation and imposes no tax or levy. One of the objectives of the Telecommunications Act 1991, which this bill amends, is to to ensure that the standard telephone service is supplied as efficiently and economically as practicable, on an equitable basis, to all people in Australia. The problem with this to objective lies with the definition of a 'standard' telephone service, which the 1991 act simply defines as nothing more than a telephone handset. The weakness of this definition is that it undermines the above mentioned objectives of the act by not incorporating provisions for new technologies. It is inflexible and outdated. The main purpose of this bill is to make the Telecommunications Act a much more powerful and compelling instrument. The bill also includes a number of specific practical considerations to provide protection against the likelihood of overzealous requirements being enforced on carriers. This is to ensure that carriers are not required to make all services - vailable everywhere the minute they become available to 50.1 per cent of the population. This bill overcomes such a situation and also provides the basis on which the public can be provided with a lot more information on the services which can be made available to all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",13
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! In accordance with standing order I04A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. MRS HARRY (LORES) BONNEY",14
6,Mrs SULLIVAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the pre-eminent pioneering role played by the late Mrs Harry (Lores) Bonney in the development of Australian and internain tional aviation; and (2) urges all Australian governments and relevant semi-government bodies to ensure that Mrs Bonney's contribution to the nation receive appropriate, continuing public recognition. The motion has two purposes. The first is to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of the Australian pioneer aviator Mrs Lores Bonney. The second is to attempt to ensure that Mrs Bonney's great achievements are never again allowed to slip into the obscurity with which Australia once mistreated her outstanding achievements. Born Maude Rose Rubens in South Africa on 20 November 1897, her family came to Australia in 1906 and settled in Melbourne. In 1917 she married Harry Bonney and moved to Brisbane, where she became a housewife and society figure. In 1928 Mrs Bonney met the man who was to change her life: her husband's cousin, Bert Hinkler. Hinkler took her for a joy-ride in an aeroplane and her great passion for flying was born. In those days women were not educated and they certainly did not fly aeroplanes. She secretly learnt how to fly. In due course she had to let her husband know what she was doing. However, when the day came that she had to tell him, to her surprise and joy, he not only encouraged her to get her pilot's licence but bought her her own aeroplane after she qualified. Her most outstanding achievements can be summarised briefly by three records. The first record she set was in August and September 1932 when she became the first woman to circumnavigate Australia by air. In 1933 she became the first women to fly from Australia to England. In 1937 she became the first person to fly from Australia to South Africa. Although these achievements can be stated very briefly, they represent fantastic episodes of courage and endurance. When I spoke on the adjournment debate on 1 March this year, following Lores Bonney's funeral on the Gold Coast, I had incorporated Hansard the flight logs of those three journeys. I shall seek leave to again incorporate these three pilot logbook extracts. I wish to refer to them briefly and, without their appearing as part of this speech, it would be very difficult indeed to understand the import of what I am saying here today. Therefore, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a document entitled 'Details taken from Mrs Bonney's pilot Log Book Round Australia Flight 1932'. Leave granted. The document read as followsDetails taken from Mrs Bonney's Aircraft Date Type Reg 15.8.32 DH60 VH-UPV 16.8.32 17.8.32 18.8.32 20.8.32 21.8.32 22.8.32 23.8.32 24.8.32 25.8.32 26.8.32 4.9.32 5.9.32 6.9.32 8.9.32 16.9.32 18.9.32 21.9.32 21.9.32 24.9.32 25.9.32 25.9.32 27.9.32 Mrs Bonney became the first woman to circumnavigate and 27 minutes on her 12800-kilometre flight.",14
7,Mrs SULLIVAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"To run your eye down the column headed 'Remarks' is to view a snapshot of what must surely have been the most extraordinary adventure. We are indebted to the author, Terry Gwynn-Jones, for his book entitled Pioneer Airwoman-The Story of Mrs Bonney, for a detailed explanation of what all those entries mean. Terry GwynnJones is himself a very well-known pilot and aviation writer. In 1979 he wrote Mrs Bonney's story, and I was honoured to launch that book in Brisbane. It is a most readable yarn; all the more remarkable for the true stories of incredible courage and achievement it so simply tells. Anyone who met Lores Bonney-as I was privileged to do-would realise that this simply told, understated account of her adventures is very much a reflection of the straightforward, matter-of-fact, humble lady she was.

She was airborne for 95 hours It needs to be borne in mind, when glancing at the extracts from her logbooks, that in the days when she and other pioneer aviators were flying they flew without the assistance of maps, radio or navigation aids; often without even the most rudimentary airstrips on which to land. That is difficult to imagine in today's Australia where we are so dependent upon air travel to carry out our business. Indeed, air travel has become absolutely vital to the conduct of the basics of the Australian economy. It is only thanks to people like Lores Bonney and their deeds that we are able to enjoy all the benefits that air transport and air travel bring to this vast country of ours. I now seek to have incorporated in Hansard a logbook extract entitled 'Details taken from Mrs Bonney's Pilot Log Book AustraliaEngland Flight 1933'. Leave granted. The document read as followsDetails taken from Mrs Bonney's Aircraft Journey Date Type Reg 10.4.33 DH60 VH - UPV Brisbane-Charleville 11.4.33 II II 12.4.33 Cloncurry-Camooweal 13.4.33 Camooweal-Darwin 15.4.33 Darwin-Kupang 16.4.33 II 17.4.33 Bali-Surabaya-Batavia 18.4.33 Batavia-Singapore 20.4.33 Singapore-Alor-Star25.5.33 Calcutta-A lahabad 26.5.33 Allahabad-Thansi27.5.33 Jodhpur-Karachi 2.6.33 Karachi-Jask-Bandar 3.6.33 B'Abbas-Bushire 4.6.33 Bushire-Basra-Baghdad 5.6.33 Baghdad-Aleppo-Adana 7.6.33 II 8.6.33 Constantinople-Plovdiv 10.6.33 11.6.33 12.6.33 Budapest-Gmund 13.6.33 II II 17.6.33 Linz-Wartzburg 18.6.33 II 20.6.33 Frankfurt-Cologne 21.6.33 Cologne-Croydon Mrs Bonney became the first woman to fly from and 20 minutes on her 2oooo-kilometre flight.",15
8,Mrs SULLIVAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"With today'sjumbo jet air travel, it is almost incomprehensible to imagine, looking at this logbook extract, the almost insuperable difficulties encountered by a sole person flying in an open cockpit aircraft at a maximum speed of probably 80 miles per hour. One can only marvel at the fact that there were people who wanted to undertake journeys such as these.

She was airborne for 157 hours those logbook entries reveal next to nothing of the extraordinary drama and near tragedy of this journey. Suffice to say that many pilots lost their lives at this stage of pioneering aviation; a substantial number of those who died simply disappeared, usually over the sea, never to be seen again. Lores Bonney set no speed records but she set high endurance records. She had her share of near misses but, because she was a sensible, intelligent and careful person, she survived to tell her extraordinary tales.

9,Mrs SULLIVAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"When Lores Bonney undertook this journey there was no information on the experiences of previous pilots from which she could benefit. She literally flew into the totally unknown when she undertook her Australia-South Africa journey-specifically as she traversed the length of the African continent. So far as is known, no other pilot has since attempted to equal this extraordinary feat. For most of her life she did not receive the recognition within Australia that she deserved. In 1933, when she became the first woman to fly from Australia to England, on her arrival King George V awarded her an MBE. However, it was not until 1991 that she received an Australian award-nearly 60 years after her achievements. With the making by Adrian Swanton of a television documentary for the ABC entitled Somehow We Almost Forgot Mrs Bonney and the publication in 1979 of the book Pioneer Airwoman by Terry Gwynn-Jones, Mrs Bonney came back to public attention. Terry Gwynn-Jones surmises that one of the reasons Mrs Bonney was never taken seriously-even when she was setting these extraordinary records and showing enormous courage and physical and aviation skills-was that she was a society woman. Unfortunately, the treatment of her achievements is all too typical of the previous treatment of many outstanding Australian women-save perhaps for some singers. Her achievements received public recognition in a number of ways, albeit principally outside Australia. For example, her name has been engraved in America's famous Fliers Time in Air Hrs Mins Remarks 2 35 Circled ruins 410 toria 25 300 6 20 Terrible over Hex Mountains and South Africa by air. She was airborne 210 Hall which honours the greats of aviation; a Bonney display is now mounted at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum; an annual Bonney trophy is awarded amongst British fliers; her achievements have been recognised by the Smithsonian Institution in the International Air and Space Museum in Washington DC; and in the 1980s the VIP room at Brisbane's international air terminal was named in her honour following the publication of Terry Gwynn-Jones's book and the subsequent publicity that the book and Mrs Bonney received in Queensland. On 3 March 1994, in the debate on the adjournment, I stated that I was disturbed to be told by a fellow mourner at her funeral that the Lores Bonney Room at the Brisbane international terminal no longer existed. The mural dedicated to her had been dismantled and the whereabouts of it, as well as a display of her flying memorabilia, were uncertain. After contacting the Brisbane office of the Federal Airports Corporation to make inquiries about this matter, I was assured that, as part of the internal expansion of the present temporary Brisbane international terminal, the VIP room had been done away with and that Mrs Bonney's memorabilia is now in a display case above the staircase at the Ansett international lounge. I was further informed that the plans for the new Brisbane international terminal, presently under construction and nearing completion, include a Lores Bonney Room-the equivalent of the previous VIP room-and a Lores Bonney display in a public area of the terminal so that this tribute to her aviation achievements may be seen by the general public. At the time of making that speech on the adjournment debate, I wrote to the Managing Director of the ABC, David Hill, asking that the ABC give consideration to reshowing the Lores Bonney documentary Australia-wide, not just in Queensland, at a time when people watched television, not late at night as it was the one time it has been shown. I have never received a reply to that letter. I also sought confirmation from the Federal Airports Corporation that the Lares Bonney Room, as detailed to me, will exist in the new international terminal when it is opened. I have not received that assurance. Therefore, in moving this motion today, I do so not in any complacent sense but with a feeling of urgency so that, as the terminal nears completion, we do not once again let Mrs Lares Bonney and her great achievements for the nation slip into obscurity.",18
10,Ms HENZELL,TELECOMMUNICATIONS," I have much pleasure in seconding the motion of my colleague the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). This motion has been in the pipeline for some time, so we are delighted to debate it today. Attempting to get to Canberra last evening by air indicated that, even in today's modern aviation world, the weather will sometimes be against us. Most of us had to be offloaded in Sydney and, in certain cases, undertake perilous journeys by car to arrive here today. The first time. I was aware of Mrs Lores Bonney's achievements was in viewing the ABC documentary by Adrienne Swanton, Somehow We Almost Forgot Mrs Bonney, which my colleague the member for Moncrieff referred to. I had much pleasure in reading the wonderful book by Terry GwynnJones, which I will refer to and provide extracts from in my contribution today. I think it is all too common for the achievements of women in our history to be thor-. oughly neglected. I remind the parliament that Australia needs its heroes, but it also needs its heroines. In looking at this remarkable woman, we need to pause and wonder how a woman who was part of a very strict social structure found the courage to undertake the sorts of feats referred to by my colleague. The interesting thing was that it showed up very strongly in her adolescence. After Lores Bonney's family moved to Australia from England, she was sent to school. As chapter 1 of Terry Gwynn-Jones's book states: As she developed, two traits became obvious to her parents and teachers: her love of music and hate of discipline. She was a rebel. This rebellious side of her nature led to her being moved to several schools in an attempt to instil her with more discipline. And further: At both schools her end of term reports consistently spoke of her artistic and musical ability, her dislike for scientific and mathematical subjects, and always of her independent nature. I think this is a wonderful example of the importance of fostering the rebellious and the independent in all our young people. I continue quoting from the book: As the daughter of a wealthy family in the Victorian era it was never considered that school should prepare Lores for any sort of career . . . However, in 1911 Lores' Australian music professor suggested that his talented pupil should receive further training in Europe. Her parents decided that a finishing school in Europe might well be the solution. A couple of years of gently administered lady-like spit and polish would curb her rebellious nature and extend her musical ability. This opportunity to travel overseas, to find herself alone, and to have to use her courage and determination to learn languages and to achieve by herself was excellent training for her future. As the member for Moncrieff indicated, her meeting with her husband's cousin, Bert Hinkler, and her first joy-flight, were the beginning of her love of aviation. They travelled from Eagle Farm airport to Yeerongpilly to deliver a bunch of roses to a good friend. One would be amazed even today that someone would take such a flight from Eagle Farm to Yeerongpilly. What did she experience as she made this first flight? I refer back to Terry Gwynn-Jones's account: Hinkler steadily opened the throttle, and keeping straight with a touch of the rudder, began the take off run across the tiny airport. Lores felt the seat boring into her back as the aircraft accelerated rapidly. The tail rose and a second later they were airborne. For Lores, the sensation was magnificent. He quotes her directly: 2620 It was the answer to my dreams. I had always adored birds for as long as I could remember. And there I was literally feeling like a bird. Anyone who saw the film Out of Africa, remembering the flight that Isak Dinesen takes, could perhaps share that sensation. The story continues: She never flew with her cousin again. He returned to England and was tragically killed attempting a record flight to Australia in 1933. But he had sown the seed of what was to become a lifelong passion. Life for Lores Bonney would never be quite the same again. She had flown. As the member for Moncrieff indicated, Lores undertook an incredible apprenticeship. Not being able to even drive a car, she learnt how to fly, she learnt the art and science of mechanical maintenance and then discovered that her husband was indeed incredibly supportive of her commitment. I want to refer to one of those exciting events on that trip to England from Australia to give some flavour to the real courage that she showed and that would be very difficult for most of us, in these days of comfortable aviation, to imagine. This event follows the emergency landing and the time she had to spend in places such as Malaysia and India. n refers to her trip from Constantinople to Sofia. I quote from page 103 of the book: The nightmare returned the next day, two hours after leaving Constantinople. Bound for Sofia, a little over an hour away she was flying high at 3500 metres to clear the mountains below, when threatening storms suddenly intensified and closed in around her. She turned quickly to head back to Plovdiv but it was too late. Another huge storm cloud had come up and now sat on the mountains barring her escape. She was trapped between layers of cloud, with storms forming a wall on all sides. For five hours she circled around and around in the cloud-enclosed 'room'. There was nowhere to go. She would have no chance if she attempted to penetrate the black walls of rain, hail and turbulence-filled cumulonimbus. Far below were the deadly cloud-covered mountains and here and there she could see the peaks pushing up through grey carpet of cloud. The white ceiling above was no escape either. It extended way above the limit that her aircraft could attain, and once in it, the airframe would pick up ice and the carburettor throat would slowly contract then close as the ice built up. When that happened the Gipsy engine would falter then stop for good. REPRESENTATIVES Monday, 7 November 1994 Even as she flew, more patches of cloud closed in around her and at times she was forced to fly 'blind'. The hours under the blind flying hood at Archerfield were again paying off. Things became even worse when her vital tum and balance indicator stopped working. She had great difficulty keeping the wings level in cloud. Turning became a chilling experience, and on one occasion she temporarily lost control and came diving out of cloud heading straight for the side of a mountain. She turned away just in time, but realised that the moment of reckoning had come. She would have to find a way down somehow. Her 'clear room' had finally disappeared. She was totally surrounded by cloud. She decided to follow the mountainside down. The account goes on to quote her: 'The ground at any price was my motto now. Feeling my way down carefully, almost at stalling point, several times I passed through clear patches and there would be a temporary easing of the strain. Then again, I would come into a dark patch, and tum away in fear that it might be the timbered side of the mountain showing through the cloud. It was a nightmare business, straining my eyes to penetrate the piled masses of opaque cloud, uncertain which might hide the danger of the mountain pressed in on either side. At last I came through a patch of filmy stuff, and with indescribable relief saw a railway line below.' This was only one of many incredible experiences that Mrs Harry Bonney experienced on that flight. When Terry Gwynn-Jones and Denys Dalton retraced her steps in 1976 they were truly amazed by what she had achieved, given that they had a much more modern and efficient aircraft with sophisticated radio navigation aids. Terry Gwynn-Jones concludes: That flight, plus my own recollection of training in Tiger Moths, direct descendants of her aircraft, made me better understand the magnitude of Mrs Bonney's achievements and her courage. I believe it is important that the new international airport at Brisbane be named the Lores Bonney airport so that we will not forget this the dull hero of our aviation history.",19
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Mr Newell)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA Privileges Committee  I move: (1) That the following amendment to standing order 26 (Committee of Privileges) be adopted for the remainder of this session: Omit ""to inquire into and report upon complaints of breach of privilege which may be referred to it"" and substitute ""to inquire into and report upon matters of contempt or breach of privilege which may be referred to it"". (2) That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges: The question of the level of protection or privilege which should apply to communications between Members of Parliament and Ministers. including communications by letter. facsimile or other electronic or automated means. The first part of the motion seeks to amend standing order No. 26. At the moment, at least in theory if not in practice, the Privileges Committee can only investigate complaints. I think it is important that the Privileges Committee be allowed, from time to time, to traverse and examine the broader issues surrounding privilege and, indeed, look at the effectiveness of some of the legislation. The effect of the first part of the motion is to give the Committee of Privileges that power. The second part refers to the Privileges Committee the question of the level of protection or privilege which should apply to communications between members of parliament and ministers, including communications by letter, facsimile or other electronic or automated means. My interest in this arose when my good friend the honourable member for Bowman, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), had a fax published in a paper. This matter was referred to the Privileges Committee. I want to draw to the attention of the House that, given the history of the way this place developed and bearing in mind that the founding fathers did not envisage members or senators having staff or electorate offices-it took many of them months and months just to come to this place, where they would stay for six months-it is true to say that what was said and done in here was of the utmost importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you were to survey all the members of this House, or if you were to ask their constituents what is important about a member of parliament, they would say that it is the way they service the electorate, not the way they speak here, not the way they do their committee work or operate in the party room. Probably the most fundamental thing a member can do is to handle problems on behalf of his constituents. What have we seen over time? The powers of members to represent their electors have diminished. They have been diminished by the Privacy Act. They have been diminished by the executive of the government, the ministers. I understand that and I do not expect them to fix it. The most privileged and precious role that members have is representing their constituents honestly, diligently and vigorously. I do not apologise to this House for wanting to do that in an unencumbered way. In wanting to represent those constituents, I might write to a minister in very fulsome language; I might even question his competence and the competence of his department. I would make no apology about that. That is what I believe I am elected for. When I was in my electorate office on Sunday going through some correspondence, I got a letter-and here is a fax of it. It is about someone who lives in housing department flats. What is she complaining of? She is concerned, she is suicidal; I think I would be too. She has been raped twice in these flats and robbed on seven occasions. Do ministers, members of the public, the press, the Privacy Commissioner, or whoever, expect me to sit down in a very unemotional way and say, 'This matter can be dealt with in the fullness of time. I do not want any urgency. I want you to overlook the fact that complaints have been made or that this woman has desperately tried to get a transfer. You shouldn't mention that at all'? Of course I will not, although in a cooler moment I might think that perhaps I could have rephrased things or said them better. But this woman expects me to do something about it, and quickly. If I have to offend a minister in a letter, if I have to offend a public servant in a letter, I will-and I am not apologising for it. But, under the current system of privileges, if I write a letter to the minister, if I fax it or E-mail it to him through the computer system-I would send a copy to my constituent because he or she would be entitled to know what I have done about it-and that somehow gets published or broadcast, I can be hauled before the courts because my actions are not covered by privilege. I think that they should be covered by privilege. I am not saying that this is an open and shut case. All I am asking is that the Privileges Committee look at the situation and bring the Privileges Act up to date. For goodness sake, we are facing the year 2000! We do not want to go back to the quill and ink stage, or to turbocharged pigeons. We are living in a modern era. Notwithstanding our low standing, people's expectations of their members of parliament are higher, are greater, and so they should be. Without fear of recrimination, without fear of a writ, without fear of unnecessary entanglement with the courts, we should be able to represent our constituents no matter how poor or how low, whether they are migrants or whether they are rich or poor. I do not resile from that, and that is what this motion is all about. It was brought about, as I mentioned, by the circumstances surrounding the honourable member for Bowman, and I felt for him in those circumstances. I do not think we handled it very well. I said then and I say now: every member of this House could be faced with the same situation. If you are not, maybe you are not doing your job; I do not know. If some letters that I have written to ministers were published, rebroadcast or one of my constituents decided to spread them around, they would get me into all sorts of trouble before the courts. But that is my job, that is why people come to me. They are dissatisfied, they cannot get anywhere and they see me as their last resort, their last avenue of hope. There is a contrary point of view which I respect; that is, we have to be careful that we are not disempowering citizens and that civil servants do not become second-class citizens. I say in response to that that I have a fundamental belief in the role of a member of parliament and believe members should not be challenged. Trying to stop me coming to this parliament to attend a session of parliament is a breach of privilege and if that occurred I would get all the support I needed from members of parliament, but if I vigorously pursue the interests of a constituent of mine and use some very forceful language that may be defamatory-it may be the truth, but it may be defamatory-I get no protection. That is clearly wrong. It is about time the Committee of Privileges-I have a lot of confidence in it-has a look at this situation and brings us up to date. If we want to enhance the position of members of parliament and the esteem in which they are held, it is important that we be given this opportunity. I mention another case, concerning civilian employees of the RAAF who have not been given access to superannuation. I have suggested politely to the minister that I think there is a cover-up operating. It was a very polite letter but I am getting nowhere. My next letter may very well be defamatory because I want some action on behalf of my constituent. I hope all members of parliament will think about, if not support, this motion. Let us not be shackled to the party room. Let us do something about it. (TIme expired)",20
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Les Scott-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,22
13,Mr ANDREWS,PRIVILEGES,"Menzies) (1.17 p.m.)I have pleasure in joining in the debate on the motion moved in passionate terms by the  in an attempt to update and clarify the privileges of the parliament in relation to communications between members of parliament and ministers. It is important for those of the general public who listen to such debates and who may be in the gallery today to understand that the privilege we talk about is not the privilege which is used popularly to indicate that an advantage flows to some particular member of a class or certain group within society-for example, when we talk in popular terms about a privileged class. Privilege in the parliamentary form is the special rights and immunities which belong primarily to the parliament itself but through that to its members also. Those rights and immunities are considered essential for the operation of the parliament. Privilege has a long history. It goes back to centuries past and the struggle in the United Kingdom between the parliament, as representatives of the people, and the monarch over sovereign parliamentary rights. Therefore, the privilege of parliament being referred to is that body of rights and immunities which enable the parliament, and the members thereof, to carry out its responsibilities and functions in a proper and rightful manner. These rights and immunities allow the parliament to meet and carry out its proper constitutional role in a democratic society. It allows members to discharge their responsibilities to their constituents and to be properly involved in the parliamentary process without fear of obstruction or prosecution. As the House of Commons has indicatedthe forms and procedures of this parliament are largely based on the parliament of the United Kingdom-the privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities. The House of Commons has said: In so far as the House claims and Members enjoy those rights and immunities which are grouped under the general description of ""privileges"", they are claimed and enjoyed by the House in its corporate capacity and by its Members on behalf of the citizens whom they represent. It flows from that that breaches of privilege and contempt of the parliament are punishable by the parliament itself. Whilst there are technical differences between privileges and contempts, generally they are matters which can be dealt with by the parliament itself. It is interesting that as long ago as 1704 the House of Lords and the House of Commons agreed: That neither House of Parliament hath any power, by any vote, or declaration, to create to themselves any new privilege, that is not warranted by the known laws and customs of Parliament. So it is important that for almost three centuries a condition has been established that, whilst there are certain privileges which are important to allow the parliament and members of parliament to carry out their responsibilities, the parliament does not have carte blanche to simply go out and create new privileges at any time. When one looks at the privileges which have been enumerated and created, one sees that probably the most important of those privileges, those rights and responsibilities, is the right of free speech in parliament without liability to action or impeachment for anything which is spoken in this place. So members may come into this chamber or the Senate and make statements which, outside those chambers, would be defamatory and would enable a citizen to take that member or senator to a court of law in a civil action for defamation. Those statements are privileged; that is, an action against the member or senator will not lie because members and senators are said to be subject to what is called absolute privilege. This flows from the ninth article of the Bill of Rights, which was enacted in 1688, which declared: That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. So there is a long history over a number of centuries in which the parliament has said that, in order for the democratic process to be carried forward in a way in which the parliament can retain the sovereignty of the people, what is said in this chamber and in the Senate ought to be subject to that privilege; that is, a member or senator should not be subject to a writ for defamation in the ordinary civil courts for whatever is raised in this place. The parliament has looked at this in Australia. In fact, the Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987 sought to clarify in some more detail what those privileges are. Section 16(2) of the act sets out what the proceedings in parliament are for the purposes of article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688. The section states: ... ""proceedings in Parliament"" means all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includesIt sets out four subsections of which, for present purposes, subsection (c) is important. Subsection (c) states: the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business; So the proceedings of parliament are subject to or covered by the privilege, and that has been clarified in the act of 1987 to include the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business. The question which was raised by the honourable member for Chifley then comes to this issue of whether a communication in written form between a member of parliament and a minister of the Crown is one which is covered by privilege, his assertion being that it ought to be looked at by the privileges committee to determine whether or not there ought to be an extension or a clarification of the privilege so that a member of parliament can write to a minister and that communication and the terms of the communication would not be subject to an action for defamation in the courts of law. That was made fairly clear by the member for Chifley in some of his examples. It seems clear-and this has been looked at a number of times over the years-that the scope of absolute privilege does not extend to normal communications between members and ministers. There may well be a qualified privilege, however, which applies to the communication between members of parliament and ministers. That is, if there is an obligational duty on the part of the member of parliament to communicate this information to a minister, that may well be covered by what is termed a 'qualified privilege'. If not attenuated by malice, then that qualified privilege would be a sufficient defence if an action for defamation were brought. But the member for Chifley is suggesting that qualified privilege is not perhaps certain enough and that there ought to be an absolute privilege in relation to these matters. This issue was looked at by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which reported to the parliament in October 1984. In that report the committee decided not to extend the privilege in the way that has been suggested today. The committee quoted the words of Mr Justice Evatt in the case of Gibbons and Duffell, which it said 'provide an eloquent and powerful caution against specific extensions of the defence of absolute immunity in defamation proceedings'. The paragraph by Mr Justice Evatt which was quoted says: Absolute immunity from the consequences of defamation . . . is so serious a derogation from the citizen's right to the State's protection of his good name that its existence at all can only be conceded in those few cases where overwhelmingly strong reasons of public policy of another kind cut across this elementary right to civic protection; and any extension of the area of immunity must be viewed with the most jealous suspicion, and resisted, unless its necessity is demonstrated. The report goes on: He went on to say that 'the extension of the privilege by reason of analogies to recognised cases is not justified'. It is clear, given what Mr Justice Evatt said in that case, that in the view of the joint committee at that stage it was not justified. However, as the honourable member points out, there has been the case involving the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) and an earlier case involving the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in which this matter arose. Whilst I do not come to any firm conclusion about whether we ought to extend the privilege in this way, I believe that the member is right and proper in raising the matter in this place and in indicating to the members of this House that there is a real issue that ought to be determined. I certainly support him in his motion to have the matter referred generally to the Privileges Committee.",22
14,Mr LES SCOTT,PRIVILEGES,"Oxley) (1.27 p.m.)I am pleased to have the opportunity to second this motion and speak in support of it. The presentation by the honourable member  feeling. I congratulate him on his presentation, which highlighted his concerns when it comes to privilege for members of parliament. This motion is one of the most important we will be debating in this place. It goes right to the heart of our duty as members of parliament to represent our constituents. When we represent the constituents in our electorates probably the most important thing we do is to represent individuals' rights. We can speak in this place as often as we like, and we probably do not get a lot of recognition for doing that, but the individuals in our electorates, the individual Australians out there, hope and expect that members of parliament will be able to make sincere representations to ministers from time to time. We are often called to act on behalf of those constituents in very sensitive matters, and the honourable member for Chifley mentioned a letter he received from one of his constituents. Often this involves communication with ministers' offices. On a lot of occasions we have to explain and put our views forward regarding the problems of people who have come to us, often as a last resort. Perhaps they should come to us first in some cases. So any move to strengthen the level of protection regarding inter-office communication, whether it be by letter, fax or any other means, must be applauded by members of parliament. For this reason I am pleased to support the motion in to to and in particular the second part of the motion, which refers those matters to the Committee of Privileges. When we act on behalf of the constituents in our electorates as members of parliament, we are subject to moral and ethical imperatives not to expose any information that is used of an extremely private and confidential nature. I am sure that we all respect that position. The right to do this without fear of persecution or incrimination by the media, the public generally or any other quarter is absolutely sacrosanct. I hope that it is a right which the majority of the media would respect. I think they do in most cases. Similarly, the media is under an obligation to respect the right to privacy of an individual who comes to us looking for assistance-and that is often the case. The communication between the office of a member of parliament and that of a minister should be given the utmost protection, and its confidentiality should be acknowledged and respected by third parties that may have some vested interest in exposing that communication. I would not want to give the impression that our friends in the media do not act professionally and ethically in this regard. I am sure that the overwhelming majority of them do, and I respect them for that. What should really be mentioned in this debate is a more common example of someone gaining some sort of benefit by having access to confidential material. I am speaking, of course, about the occasion when an employer might persecute an employee because that person has appealed to the federal member for assistance in an industrial relations matter, such as a case of unfair dismissal or a dispute over pay rates. That does unfortunately happen from time to time. I have had that experience in my own electorate. Several of my constituents have said to me that they approached me for assistance only as a last resort after they had exhausted all other avenues-various government departments and what have youbecause they were afraid that their boss might find out and, if not actually sack them, at least make life very difficult for them. I think that is very sad. I think this happens a lot particularly in government departments. I know that personnel at the air force base in my electorate would very reluctantly come to speak to their federal member because they believe that the processes within the defence department should be sufficient for them. Quite often they are not. It is important that we make sure that those people have the right to come to us without fear of persecution in any way. I believe that, by supporting this motion of the honourable member for Chifley, we would be going a long way to getting this before the Privileges Committee and working those issues through. If the communications that we have with ministers are exposed to the public, we should be covered under absolute privilege in protecting our rights as members of parliament to represent the rights of the electors in our various electorates. It is a very important matter and I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to support it. I congratulate the member for Chifley for bringing this motion forward in this place.",24
15,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVILEGES,"It is a pleasure to be able to make a brief contribution to the very passionate proposal made by  member of the Privileges Committee and as a former member of the committee on privileges in the Victorian parliament for eight years, many of the matters raised by the member for Chifley have struck a chord of interest and sympathy. A member of parliament faces great challenges and pressures in society. Generally speaking, there are signs in society that people are now more prone to issue a writ against members of parliament than before, although it has recently been the subject of interesting comment in the High Court, and we will see how that develops as time goes on. I do not want to be too definitive as to my attitude in this matter except to say that, in the interests of Australia, the community and democracy, I support the need for a further thorough inquiry into this issue. I do that not to sit on the fence, but I think as a member of the committee I should reserve my substantive view until such time as the matter is fully considered. I do support the idea of further work being done. The words expressed by Mr Justice Evatt in the case of Gibbons v. Duffell are words of warning. Any committee that examines this and any member of parliament interested in it will obviously have to bear in mind that, if absolute immunity is to be extended to written communications from a member to, say, a minister that have the effect of damaging the reputation of a citizen, that is a matter to be taken lightly. The rights of citizens and individuals are paramount and have to be absolutely respected. We should bear in mind that if a letter is written to a minister which does have absolute privilege the citizen may not know that the letter has been written about the citizen's behaviour or character, yet the minister will have read it, and it may well be that the minister's deliberation would lead the minister or the department to take certain steps to the detriment of the interests of that citizen. I pose the question: is it fair that a citizen should have an action taken against him to his detriment without his knowing that the action was based on an allegation which he knew nothing about and which he had no chance to rebut? That is a factor that has to be considered: if absolute privilege is to be extended, will we then have to ensure that the citizen is notified immediately of the communication from the member and given the opportunity to rebut? If that happens, a lot of areas for immediate consideration are opened up. To balance that, we do have freedom of information-the citizen's right to know about and access documents. Yet freedom of information is a procedure that is somewhat frightening to an ordinary citizen, to a lay person. I do not think we should rest content as members of parliament and simply say that a citizen's rights are protected if a member writes to a minister and says something detrimental about his or her character because after all, even though the citizen is not given notice of the letter having been sent to the minister or of the minister's consideration, the citizen has general rights of access to a file under freedom of information. I think it is too glib to say that, because citizens do not always take action under freedom of information. Sometimes they do not know. Why would they know? They need to seek it because they are not aware that the letter has been written. We can see there are great problems associated with that. The other point we have to bear in mind in a contemporary parliament, and particularly following the recent High Court decision, is not that the community is increasingly questioning the role of members of parliament and, unfortunately, adopting a cynical attitude to the actions of members, most of whom are hard working and trying to do their job in the interests of their constituencies. Nevertheless, the community is very wary of members of parliament seeking further protection apparently to make their job a little easier. Perhaps it is the community's view that it is not fair and that members of parliament should be brought more to account. (Time expired)",26
16,Mr SWAN,PRIVILEGES,"I would like to commence by referring to the point made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) regarding the recent High Court decision on defamation and how it affects politicians. It would now appear that for better or for worse there is almost an unfettered right for ordinary citizens to say what they like about a member of parliament. In the context of this debate today, that puts into new light the right of parliamentarians to say what they like about a particular matter to a member of the executive when they are forthrightly representing their constituents. It is the job of a member of parliament to forthrightly and vigorously represent his her constituents. In the process of doing that, members of parliament should-and must if they are to do the job properly-express themselves in a strong and forthright manner. The problem we have with the lack of clarifiit cation about the privileges of a parliamentarplace.' Ian making statements outside this chamber is that if parliamentarians choose to make strong statement which could be potentially held to be defamatory then they could be impeded from doing their job properly cause they could be sued in the courts of land. There is an enormous contradiction between that position and the position brought down recently by the High Court, which says that the citizens we represent have the right to make those strong statements about us and that we have no redress through the law of privilege. defamation. I would suggest that for that reason alone there needs to be a substantial relook at this issue of absolute privilege, or qualified privilege, for members of parliament in terms of their communications with a member of the executive. If the position that has been interpreted the Privileges Committee is to be upheld, we can no longer forthrightly represent a position to a minister of the Crown which is potentialthis ly defamatory of a member of the public more importantly I suppose, a member of the Public Service. In my view, we ought able to freely do that because the size and scope of modem government makes this contributions imperative. There are many departments state-social security, employment and educaPrice), tion, the Child Support Agency-and many areas of government which vitally affect lives of citizens where very important decisions affecting people's lives are effectively delegated to senior public servants. Yet we would be unable to claim privilege if through our communications with the minister we were to make a very strong and damning statement about the actions of an unelected official. In my short time in this House, I have already dealt with many constituents. I have written very strong words in communication with ministers of state. In fact, on one occaor sion I had a minister's staff member say to me that I should not have written the letter the way I did because it was so strong that it could not possibly be sent on to the department. Of course, I replied, 'I did not expect to be sent to the department in the first But that illustrates the point. A problem does not exist, given the size of a modem bureaucracy, unless it is in writing. We cannot communicate on the phone all our problems with the actions of unelected offibecials, because if we were to check in two the weeks we would find there to be no record. So we can do our job only through the written word. That is why it is essential that this question of privilege be cleared up. If our communications with ministers of the Crown are not granted absolute privilege, we should at least be accorded some form of qualified The scope of modem government is now so wide that we cannot effectively represent our constituents across the range of all those very important issues, unless we commit our strongest thoughts and strongest representations to paper. Therefore, I commend the via motion moved by the honourable member for  recent High Court decision that all of us in House have a responsibility to clarify the or, position of privilege so that we can more effectively represent the needs of our constituto be ents and do our job properly.",26
17,Mr SOMLYAY,PRIVILEGES,"The from the government side-from of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for the Lilley (Mr Swan)-and from the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) on my side clearly show to this House that we are not at odds on the purpose of the motion. The intent of the motion is to bring the Parliamentary Privileges Act and the practice of parliamentary privilege up to speed with new technology. At the moment, any statement made in parliament or during a parliamentary committee hearing enjoys absolute privilege. This fact has been covered by each of the previous speakers. The Privileges Committee can recommend that contempt of parliament proceedings can be invoked for matters other than privilege. The case of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) illustrates the problem of members writing letters to ministers on behalf of constituents. The honourable member for Bowman wrote to a minister on behalf of a constituent and sent his constituent a reply. The letter made remarks about a departmental officer. In the officer's opinion the remarks were derogatory and he issued a writ of defamation against honourable member for Bowman. The purpose of this motion is to extend parliamentary privilege to modern forms of communication such as fax and mail and, for that matter, electronic mail which we, as members of parliament, all use. We on this side of the House do not have much to argue about with that. We believe privilege should be extended. I hope the reference is made to the committee. However, I want to make one criticism. I believe that the diminishing role and the diminishing importance of parliament have emphasised the shortcomings of the Privileges Act in addressing new technology. The fact is that parliament is being used less and less for the purpose it was created for. Ministers no longer make policy statements in parliament. Rather, they issue policy statements at the Press Club, at a press conference or in a committee room. The parliament is not being used for the purpose it should be. How many times do we open the morning papers and find that a new policy has been announced? This place is the place in which to do that. This is also the place where private members should have the opportunity to stand up and make statements on behalf of their constituents. The fact is that we do not have the time because the government does not allow sufficient time. All members of parliament have constituents who write to them, asking that their cases be represented in parliament. But we cannot do it; the opportunity does not arise. We all have constituents who write to us and say, 'I want you to ask this question in parliament,' but we do not have the opportunity. Those of us who sit in this place know that the questions asked at question time are structured. They are asked on our side by the front bench and on the government side by arrangement with the minister-the dorothy dix questions. Question time is for entertainment rather than for seeking information. If parliament accepts this reference to the Privileges Committee, I suggest that the terms of reference be made much broader. We examined the role of the parliament. Are private members given sufficient opportunity the to raise matters of importance? I will be asking that the privilege be extended because there is insufficient opportunity in the parliament to do that. I suggest that adequate time be set aside in the second chamber which now operates in this parliament for private members' business and for members to raise queries on behalf of constituents and to put their cases on the parliamentary record.",27
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGES," The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. NA Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Mr Latham: That this House declares its support for: (1) federal funding of municipal libraries to promote quality, equity and access to those services in areas of greatest need; and (2) developing Australia's network of 1400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway.",28
19,Mr SLIPPER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"When I read the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I was particularly interested in what he was saying. I must say that people on this side of the House would agree with much that is included in the motion. Our problem is, however, that Labor members are once again resorting to the suggestion that, whenever we find a deficiency in some aspect of life or activity in Australia, it really is a requirement of the federal government and not the state or local government to remedy it. This particular motion says: That this House declares its support for: (1) federal funding of municipal libraries to promote quality, equity and access to those services in areas of greatest need; and (2) developing Australia's network of 1400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway. It is pretty clear and, I think, very common ground that municipal libraries, like other libraries in Australia, perform a very worthwhile and essential role, particularly given the decentralised nature of library facilities and the fact that municipal councils throughout Australia provide these facilities in regional areas. For many people, particularly those a long way from the capital cities, the local library is often the first and last port of call when information is required. It is interesting to note that in recent times there have been 100 million loans from Australian libraries and 10 million requests for information. That indicates that libraries are performing a worthwhile role and that they are an essential element in keeping the people of Australia informed. As technology becomes more widely available and more advanced, it is essential that library facilities in various parts of the country be enhanced and improved and continue to develop. I differ, however, from the honourable member for Werriwa because he says that these improved facilities should be brought about by the involvement of the federal government. In his speech he said: . . . the clever country has not been clever enough in its support of public libraries. The honourable member for Werriwa might be correct in so far as it could be said that enough money is not being spent in the support of public libraries. I differ from him here, because he would then go a step or two further and say that any deficiency should be remedied by the Commonwealth parliament, not by the state parliament or the local authority. I suppose his approach to the federal system is very similar to the approach that we have seen from the Labor Party over the last 11 years. Our side of politics accepts that in 1901 the people of Australia federated under a constitution which gave certain powers to the Commonwealth and retained the remnant powers in the hands of the states. Of course, the states have delegated some of those powers to local authorities. We believe that it is important to recognise that there are decentralised views within Australia. It is also important to realise that different regions and different states of Australia might have differing priorities in relation to various matters. I believe that a proper and vigorous federal system is an essential element in our democracy. I do not think the approach suggested by the honourable member for Werriwa is the right approach, because he suggests that a national set of standards should be imposed from the central or federal level. The honourable member for Werriwa also pointed out that the states have disparate guidelines in relation to libraries. The nature of federation indicates that, of course, that is natural and normal. If he is not happy in his own state with what the state government and its predecessors have achieved in the area of libraries, he should be vocal in criticising the priorities of New South Wales. My own view though is that it is very much the wrong approach to suggest that, just because some states might not do what the honourable member for Werriwa wants them to do, that is a reason for the federal government coming in, overriding the states yet again and dictating some form of national uniformity across the 809 local authorities in Australia. As I think may have been pointed out by an opposition speaker earlier, the honourable member for Werriwa is somewhat out of step with the general approach of his own government over the last couple of years. The honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), who was formerly a minister, differed quite substantially from the approach of the honourable member for Werriwa, because she accepted that libraries ought to be a state or local responsibility. I will quote from a speech she made at a gathering at the National Library only a couple of years ago when she was the Minister for Arts and Territories. She said: I appreciate that the funding issue is high on your agenda. Nevertheless Government policy since 1980 has been that responsibility for the direct funding of State and local libraries rests primarily with State and local governments. She went on to say: To change the status quo would require a rather massive shift in priorities and funding and the arguments would have to be most compelling. She concluded by saying: I am not convinced that there has been sufficient shift in argument nor has it changed from when the Commonwealth enunciated the current policy. So it is pretty clear that the honourable member for Werriwa is a voice in the wilderness on his side of politics. The government accepts-at least in relation to libraries, though not on all matters-that some issues should be handled at the local level. The honourable member for Werriwa is seeking to, in effect, overturn what has been a long standing government policy in relation to libraries. In the second part of his motion, the honourable member also suggests that there should be support for developing Australia's network of 1,400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway. This is absolutely vital. I give 100 per cent support to what he is suggesting in this area with one objection, which is that I believe it is up to state and local governments to put the facilities into this area when working out their own priorities. I call on the state parliaments and local authorities as much as possible to allocate resources to help this information superhighway. It is important in any fair and equitable society that there should be access to information for people regardless of the level of their income or their means. But the honourable member for Werriwa was a little precious in parading his credentials as a proponent of social equity when he is a back bench member of a government which, during its years in office, has presided over the greatest gap between the rich and poor of any country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Honourable members will recall that on 2 June I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whether he was aware that a UN report on human development revealed that Australia recorded the highest levels of income disparity of any OECD country. Of course the Prime Minister fudged the question and failed to answer. When the parliament broke up in uproar, I was suspended for 24 hours. I brought to the attention of the government and the people of Australia what a sham this government is as far as portraying itself as the champion of the underprivileged while it has presided over the greatest gap between the rich and poor of any country in the OECD. This government stands condemned by the people of Australia. The pious words of the honourable member for Werriwa do not in any way detract from this government's shocking record. I am not suggesting that the honourable member is in any way hypocritical-I accept that he genuinely believes the substance of this motion-but his approach is quite wrong. He should be lobbying state governments and local authorities for resources to be put into this very important area of public libraries. I support the principle of public libraries receiving the assistance they need so that they are able to perform this vital role which everyone in the country accepts they should be performing. But I disagree with the honourable member when he says that this omission in funding and these deficiencies should be met by the federal government. In a federal system of government, it is a state or local responsibility. (TIme expired)",28
20,Mr JENKINS,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"I have great pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) but have been quite dismayed by the attitudes adopted by the opposition. I am pleased that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is the opposition person on duty at the table, because I reviewed his speech with great interest when he led for the opposition the last time this debate was held. I must say that I am most disappointed in the attitude he adopted. I am not sure whether I should congratulate him or commiserate with him on his return to the front bench of the opposition. But, if he is going to do the nation of Australia a service in any capacity that he holds-it is likely to remain a position on that side of the House whilst he remains a member of the opposition-he should sit down and think through the issues that Australia as a federation confronts with an Australian government. Mr Ronaldson-Which part didn't you like?",30
21,Mr JENKINS,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,He should sift through and understand what people are saying when they ask for federal involvement in these areas. Mr Ronaldson-Which part didn't you like?,31
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,The honourable member will remain silent.,31
23,Mr JENKINS,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"The honourable member for Ballarat should just sit quietly. I know that he has had a stressful journey to Canberra. A road trip in the wind might have unsettled him a little. But when he interprets statements that are made by ministers and members, such as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), as indicating that they disagree with the approach adopted by the honourable member for Werriwa, he needs to look a little closer. In a previous speech on this debate, the honourable member for Ballarat quoted a former minister, the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), who said: Councils playa crucial role in delivering services to our community and they are best placed to determine local needs and priorities. What has the honourable member for Werriwa said in this place, either in the proposal he has put forward or in support of that proposal, that goes against those words of the former minister? The opposition has to understand that, if we are to have national approaches to things such as libraries and access to information, it will require under the constitution the cooperative effort of not only the federal government and the state governments but also local governments, which in this case are most important. In his speech, the honourable member for Ballarat also quoted the honourable member for Lalor, who said: . . . the expansion and extension of all library and information services should be achieved . . . with each service retaining its autonomy within the overall state plan for the development of these services. Again, there is no contradiction with the proposal before us today. For the honourable member for Ballarat to come in here, as have his colleagues the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), to try to make this a debate about some form of centralist government as opposed to the system that we have today is a nonsense. If the honourable member for Ballarat consulted with the libraries in his electorate, he would know that the type of cost shifting with respect to the provision of library services that has occurred in the state of Victoria is astounding. Mr Ronaldson-We just opened a new one in Ballarat; a brand new library.",31
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,The shadow minister will cease interjecting.,31
25,Mr JENKINS,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"If we look at regional library services in my electorate as they were eight or nine years ago, we see that there was about a fifty-fifty apportionment of resources by state and local governments. What is it now? Local governments have 65 per cent and the other 35 per cent is divided between the state governments. Another 12 per cent represents resources that the library services have to find from other avenues. So it is a nonsense just to sit back, throw our hands in the air and have the simplistic view of the honourable member for Fisher that we should race down to state governments and ask them to put back the resources. The motion reads: That this House declares its support for: (1) federal funding of municipal libraries to promote quality, equity and access to those services in areas of greatest need . . . I would be quite proud to be involved with a government that institutes that point because that is what is required; this is about access and equity. My colleagues who have spoken before in this debate have put forward statistics that indicate that certain sections of the community are better represented with respect to the percentage of people that use the service. The use of libraries by unemployed people is higher than that in the wider community. The number of books taken out by young and old people is higher in general than it is in any other of the age brackets that use libraries. They are indications of the good use that is made by members of the community who do not have as much access to the information that they require. It was claimed that in some way the honourable member for Werriwa is a lone voice on this side of the place. I again refer members to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which is chaired by the member for Lalor. I ask members to look at the report entitled The Role of Libraries/Information networks. This committee, which is clearly an all-party committee, made certain recommendations based on the work of the Horton committee back in 1976. Recommendation (a) states: the provision of public library and information services should be the collective responsibility the Commonwealth, State and local levels of government, funded in part by each of these levels of government . . . It should be a collective responsibility. Is that not what one can read into the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa? Why do members opposite try to read something different into this motion? If they look at the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies they will find that the motion is along the lines of that philosophy. I have one regret, which I raised in this place in October 1992-about 12 months after the report of the Jones committee was put before the House-and that is that there has not been a government response to the report. That presents me with a difficulty, but if a government needs criticism on something like this so be it. I would encourage those opposite to revisit some of the things raised in that report in the light of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced in Creative Nation which addressed the issues of information and what the federal government could do to ensure that that information is successful. Creative Nation stated: In particular, the 1,400 public library services points throughout Australia provide a major opportunity for linking communities to network services, such as those available through Internet. At least part 2 of the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa has been agreed to by both sides of the chamber in this debate. This is a very important aspect of municipal libraries. If we develop Australia's network of 1,400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway, that will be a most important effort towards ensuring that we do not see a disparity between the information rich and the information poor. This motion was moved on 17 October, which was the start of Australian Library Week. As part of the promotion of that week the Australian Library and Information Association produced a postcard which said, 'Don't get flattened on the information superhighway. Get your facts straight, ask your librarian.' This motion is about encourof aging the government to come to grips with technology which, as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said in his contribution when this motion was last debated, is changing at an excessively rapid rate, which makes it harder for even those who work directly with the types of technologies available to come with grips with. It certainly makes it harder for those in the community that are seeking information and can now have that information more readily available and at their fingertips-(TIme expired)  is set to be one of the leading commodities of the next century and the provision of information services, whether using methods which are centuries old or methods which are at the leading edge of technology, is becoming increasingly important to people. Today's debate tackles significant areas, but I am firmly of the view that there is room for some healthy scepticism. Reading the first part of this motion, one begins to wonder whether the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is already jotting down some funding ideas on a great big whiteboard. The second part seems to represent a wide-eyed leap into cyberspace. Libraries have always been vital sources of knowledge, whether things are written on papyrus or transmitted via fibre optic cable. They are also vital parts of our communities, used by almost 40 per cent of the population. One of the reasons municipal libraries are so popular is their responsiveness to local needs. This should come as no surprise. Councils are the closest level of government to people and are the best placed body to determine local needs and priorities. It makes me a little suspicious then of the merits of a proposal like this that would lead to more tied grants and more Commonwealth direction over what local governments should or should not do. We have a federal system and it makes sense for Canberra to regulate many things, but this is not one of them. Under this Labor government, federal programs that promote quality, equity and access in areas of need have all too often consisted largely of photo opportunities for its marginal members and candidates. If we really believe in our libraries, then I think they deserve better than this. It is also important not to look at informasuperhighway, tion technology in an equally superficial manner. Last year, in a speech at the Banquet Hall in Whitehall, Rupert Murdoch observed that technology has liberated people from the media barons of the past. A few weeks ago he told a meeting in Melbourne that Orwell was wrong-that technology, rather than enslaving us, will set us free. Orwell wrote in a world dominated by the intensive technology of the age of mass production. In an age where new technology and business tools-personal computers, desktop publishing, fax machines and cellular phones-are tools that give individuals flexibility, we have new ways to work and to express ourselves. Murdoch told his Melbourne audience that the next century will be one in which the tyranny of distance will be abolished. For Australia, it will be a century of networking, where we will profit from our strategic location. As a highly educated, English speaking society, technological change has integrated us into a global economy as much as any place on earth. Murdoch, of course, is absolutely right. The power and potential of the information superhighway is truly revolutionary. But its emergence is already creating new dilemmas for government. It will be an enormous task to decide how best to deal with the rapid convergence of various TV delivery systems; local, long-distance and mobile phone services; films; computers; and compact discs. On the same day that Murdoch was speaking in Melbourne, a smaller media player, Kerry Stokes, offered his views. Stokes warned that technology and profit were setting the communication policy agenda rather than broad social issues of national interest. As Britain slumped in the 1960s, Harold Wilson used to like to talk of forging a new nation in the white heat of new technology. It would be ironic if Labor in Australia, in its rush to embrace the whizzbangery of new technology, forgot the social dimension. The member for Werriwa has suggested that our municipal libraries provide, if you like, the public transport system of the information but he blithely fails to discuss some of the equally important other issues about the sort of information highway we should build, its ownership and whether or not it will pay for itself. The Broadband Services Expert Group has estimated the cost of providing an Australia wide fibre service as being around $10 billion. An investment of such size will need to deliver a genuine return that will benefit its owners and its users. We must make sure that the information superhighway does not bypass the poor but liberates them. Access through libraries will be vitally important. It will be even more important to decide what sort of information network we really need before we build it.",31
26,Mr DODD,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"I support the motion and congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for bringing this very important matter before the House. Municipal libraries have developed slowly and amazingly-even with conservative opposition over the last 20 or 30 yearsso that now almost all Australians have access to municipal libraries. I say almost all Australians because there are some in remote areas of Australia, like the Cape York Peninsula in the Torres Strait in my electorate, who have limited access to municipal libraries. I certainly support that part of the motion which funds the extension of municipal library services to those areas in need and those areas in greatest need. Remote shires in my electorate such as Cook, Torres, Aurukun and-to some extent, in terms of remoteness-Douglas and Mareeba all have low rate bases and would require additional assistance to extend services in both existing technology and certainly new technology. Access is often difficult in remote areas simply because of the lack of mains power supply. That is an additional problem. The second part of the motion is absolutely necessary if Australia is going to be a more equitable society in the next century than we have achieved in this century. Despite the promise of an eminent technological superhighway, half the world's population still does not have access to telephones. The statistic is higher in Australia, but not everyone has phones. Studies have shown the obvious: those in lower income brackets are less likely to own a computer, and more likely to have an outdated model if they have got one. They are less likely to own hardware such as modems and printers and to have access to advice and support. Libraries could also form an important part of open learning in external studies. Municipal libraries might be able to give access to teaching material to people in remote areas and people who, because of their work commitments or their caring commitments, cannot access the large educational institutions in the capital cities. Such people could also use interactive technology to interact with other students. Libraries of the past have had access to information and databases and now increasingly rely on electronic sources of information. However, if they are going to keep up to date with the information superhighway, they must link to networks. The best example at present is that all Australian connections to the worldwide Internet are through ARRNet, which is in tum restricted to the universities in Australia. Most members of the public, the business community, community groups, and the education sector outside universities have no access to Internet. The trend in access to technology has been largely in the direction of user pays. Pay TV is now the most obvious example of this. The coalition promises to sell Telecom; the British government only recently pulled back from privatising postal services. So it is essential that the second part of the honourable member's motion is carried out. It is worthwhile looking at a piece written by Margaret Colmer in The Australian Library Journal of May 1994. She postulates that it is possible in the information age that there will be three categories of citizen. The first is the information poor, who cannot afford to access any of the PC based information services and who become marginalised in society, excluded from participating altogether. The second is the information informed, who can afford basic cable television links to the world of information and who therefore have a token kind of consultative political participation.",33
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"Mr Hollis)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Mr Nehl: That this House condemns any acts of ecoterrorism in Australia, particularly those directed at the forest industries, with consequent danger to the lives of workers, and detrimental effects on families, small business and the community at large.",34
28,Mr VAILE,ECOTERRORISM,"I am pleased to be able to speak on this issue in the House today. It follows the debate that was instigated in the last sitting fortnight by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). His motion reads: That this House condemns any acts of ecoterrorism in Australia, particularly those directed at the forest industries, with consequent danger to the lives of workers, and detrimental effects on families, small business and the community at large. My electorate, as with the electorate of the honourable member for Cowper, is on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which is, and has been over the history of this nation, largely based on the timber industry. The people who operate within the timber industry are honest, hard working people. They are entitled to the protection of the law. They are entitled to conduct the activities that they are engaged in, which produce wealth for this nation and which generate employment for the people in our areas who need it. They should not be subject to the sorts of acts that we have seen occur in some areas across Australia-albeit not yet to the level that they may reach. There is quite a number of documented cases of ecoterrorism where expensive equipment has been damaged, costing the industry hundreds of thousands of dollars and where lives have been put in jeopardy because of the actions of these people. The conservation movement is done no favour by the people that are perpetrating these acts of ecoterrorism throughout the timber industry, particularly in northern New South Wales. It was interesting to note some comments that were made in the local newspaper in Coffs Harbour after the address by the member for Cowper a fortnight ago with regard to that debate and what should be happening. A Mr Ducamp said: If Mr Nehl wanted to see timber workers left alone, the government should stop old growth logging, stop the violence in the timber industry and grow hemp and eucalypt plantations. For goodness sake, what sort of responsible attitude is that! The important thing we have to highlight to the House and the people of Australia is that we cannot allow people to put themselves above the law. This is what a lot of these people are doing. In recent times in my electorate we have had a number of protests in the forest when people in the conservation movement have been putting at risk not only their own lives with their protests but also the lives of their children. The timber industry, as it stands today, goes through a very, very onerous process of getting approvals. There is the EIS process, the PIS process. There are full government inquiries set up by state governments. to establish the bona fides of the operation that is going to take place and its impact on the environment and the fauna in the area. Once an area has passed that process, it is legal for those contractors, those operators to go on and conduct their logging operations. They are bound by-and abide by-the law of the land. They are entitled to conduct those activities in those areas. They should be entitled to do that without being concerned about their equipment being damaged and spikes being driven into trees that one day will cost a life. One of the policemen in Tasmania said, 'It is an accident just waiting to happen. Terrorism of any kind cannot be acceptable in this country and we must, as a community and as a nation, reject acts of criminal vandalism that are affecting jobs and families. Above all we have to reject the life threatening acts of ecoterrorism. ' We must highlight this to the nation today, and also to the government. This government has a role to play in maintaining the balance and, probably, in providing a bit more incentive. The conservation movement is very keen to see the development of plantation forestsand I agree with that. That is the way of the future, but we have to encourage this development. We certainly have to lend our support to the people who are given the job of enforcingthe law. When these criminal acts take place, police should have the authority to act and we should support them in their actions. (1ime expired)",34
29,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ECOTERRORISM,"Bass) (2.22 p.m.)I rise to support the motion of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that condemns all acts of ecoterrorism in Australia and, in particular, those directed at the forest industries and which consequently endanger the lives of the workers or are extremely detrimental to the well-being of their families, small business and the community at large. In early September, a Dover sawmiller in southern Tasmania was struck in the chest by a log after the saw had hit a galvanised spike. This was the tenth such incident in the last two months. I ask: what has gone wrong? What has gone wrong with society when an individual or group, whichever the case may be, would stoop so low as to endanger another human being's life in such a manner as to secretly and deviously spike a tree deep in the forest? The man in this incident was an employee of Clennet Industries Pty Ltd, which is a Dover regrowth sawmill. Fortunately, he was only winded and not seriously injured. That is this time. What about the next time? Over the last few months several spikes have been found, mainly in the north Picton area of Tasmania's southern forests. The discovery of these spikes has enraged the forestry sector, the families of the workers and, indeed, the people of Tasmania. It has placed a large cost on the viability of sawmills that have encountered these spiked logs. All the logs that come from the coupes that are known to contain spiked logs are now having to be checked by a metal detector, and this is both expensive and time consuming. However, the question asked may be: what value a human life? I doubt that anyone would say that these extra precautions are not necessary. Even though the logs are checked, the tailor in, who is the man who feeds the logs onto the breaking down saw, must double-check them for his own safety and for that of his work mates who work nearby. Always in the back of their minds they are thinking, 'What if?' Is this a fair burden to place on the hard working man and his family? No, it is not. I know exactly what goes on in their minds. I spent all day last Monday visiting sawmills in Bass, and I can imagine what they are thinking as they feed logs into those saws in the south of Tasmania. The result for the Dover mill is obviously a drop in production levels, plus extra responsibilities for men because of their concerns for each other. The Forest Industries Association has offered a $25,000 reward to help catch those responsible for these potentially life threatenexamples ing acts of ecoterrorism. 'Will dad come home?' is often the question asked these days by the wives and families of those who go each day to their jobs in the mills. Who has the right to make these families live a day-today terror? Who has the right to put lives in jeopardy on a daily basis? Who dares to place a higher value on trees than a fellow human being? One thing we are sure of is that the conservationists are not to blame. It is for certain that it is someone with a lot of knowledge of the industry. Sooner or later they will be caught. One would dearly hope that happens before there is a fatality. Not only are metal detectors being used to eliminate some of the risks; the industry itself is undertaking other measures, which will not be made public, to limit the chances of any more incidents taking place. It is extremely frightening not only for the individual but also for the industry and for a way of life in Tasmania and other Australian forest areas. It could be anyone-someone with a grudge, someone with a distorted view of the industry and reality. I am concerned. Those from both sides of the House who speak to the motion today are concerned. The green movement is concerned. Those who live and work in the forest industry are concerned. The mothers, fathers, wives and children of the men are concerned. We must all work towards the goal of stopping this terror in our forest, stopping those who perpetrate these crimes. Let us work to bring back sanity to the forestry industry and allow those in the industry to go to work each day without the terrible thought that this may be the day their luck runs out. I commend the motion to the House.",35
30,Mr REID,ECOTERRORISM,"I am pleased to be able to support the motion of the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and I take on board the comments by, and support of, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith). It is good to see that this motion has attracted the the support of all parties in this House and that we are united on this motion. The motion specifically relates to the forest industry. I know that there have been some very bad of this type of terrorism in the forestry industry-the members for Cowper and Bass have mentioned them-but it also applies to another industry which is close to my electorate, and that is the mining industry. When the Western Mining Corporation was endeavouring to open up mining and effect a recovery of the goldmining industry in Bendigo, for many years it was subjected to a lot of undue and unnecessary acts of vandalism and terrorism with its equipment. Certainly, mining is a legal activity. In fact, it is part of the very reason for Bendigo's existence. It also contributed to the welfare and wealth of Victoria in the early days of gold discovery, with Bendigo and Ballarat leading the way. It is a legal activity, and the mining industry has changed its approach to it over the years. It has done some excellent work in reafforestation of mining areas which have been mined for gold. Certainly, over that period, the mining industry has been subjected to a lot of interference with its valuable equipment. When such equipment was vandalised, it could have resulted in a life threatening situation and caused damage not only to the workers but also to the other people involved in that mining pursuit. I condemn those acts of ecoterrorism, and I support the motion put forward by the member for Cowper. We must as a community and a nation reject any criminal acts of vandalism that affect jobs and families. There is an opportunity for a lot of the people undertaking those acts of vandalism to direct their energy into positive programs. Lord knows that in Australia we have enough other needs to be met in the ecological and environmental area, for example, in the improvement of soil quality. A global assessment of soil degradation in 1991 estimated that 11 per cent, 1.2 billion hectares, of the earth's vegetated surface is suffering from moderate to serious degradation, and that is increasing. If people want to become involved in and protect the environment, they can do so much to assist in that area. Improvement of water quality is another area where people could direct their energy. It is obvious that those people have plenty of energy to vandalise and destroy equipment, put people's lives at risk and put families and small business at risk. Why do they not get on and do something about the limited amounts of good quality water that are unevenly distributed throughout the world? There is a lot they can do in the area of catchment protection. They could become involved in anti-salinity measures and landcare issues. All of these people who are claiming to be involved and interested in the environment could direct their energies and attention to these areas and do something positive for Australia instead of having this negative attitude and vandalising equipment and placing people's lives at risk. Another area those people could direct their attention to is the improvement to green cover throughout Australia by tree planting exercises. There are many organisations throughout my electorate which conduct weekends when people go voluntarily and plant trees. They have the opportunity to go there and become involved in that. I think we as members of this House should encourage the people who are committing these acts of vandalism to become volunteers for the conservation and protection movements that exist and do something positive for the community. Instead of putting up with the constant vandalism and terrorism of the environment, let us do something positive-encourage these people to become involved in and get right behind proper conservation of soil, water and green cover in Australia.",36
31,Mr ADAMS,ECOTERRORISM,"I rise to speak on this motion because of the concerns I have for the safety of all individuals who work in the timber industry. I believe that we are dealing with only a looney ratbag fringe and not with any particular organisation or group from either side. But it is this sort of irresponsible group that believes that human life is expendable. This is quite a horrific thought. Anyone who puts lives at risk in trying to put forward a philosophy has to be condemned. We condemn this sort of behaviour in other parts of the world under the terms of human rights, yet these extremists, these so-called environmentalists, have no consideration for the safety of bush workers, their families or the communities in which they live. Those who take away workers' rights to work in a safe and reasonable environment can only be seen to be just as odious as those who deprive people of their freedom or who try to overcome their power problems with force. The green movement has played a useful role up to now. It has sensitised big business to the importance of environmental management; it has alerted politicians to take heed of communities that have' particular concerns about environmental degradation; and it has helped, along with others from all sides of parliament, to encourage a more responsible approach to issues about the environment. But some of its supporters have other agendas, and I do not believe it is able to control this lunatic fringe. There have been 10 incidents in the last few months in Tasmania. All of these have had the potential to kill someone. The latest round of incidents involved the spiking of trees in the forest with galvanised spikes. So, when the timber worker in the mill pushes a log towards the saw, he never knows whether he is going to have pieces of that saw flying around his head. This cannot be tolerated. Although the Greens have condemned the action, a lot of the focus of this activity has come from a very short-sighted view of forestry. A recent document circulated around parliament not long ago purported to represent the argument that if lobbying were stopped in the Huon and Meander areas in Tasmania the tourist industry would boom. The facts just do not back up the argument. By using these simplistic arguments, people who have little or no knowledge of the industry are encouraged to view forest workers as the enemy; thus guerilla tactics are somehow legitimised by these assumptions. We are in a situation now where ordinary forestry workers, going about their daily work, are having to defend their lives as well as their livelihood. They are patient people. They understand that getting angry does not assist anyone, but they are constantly fighting an uphill battle. The irresponsible paper circulated by the para-greens tried to argue that if forestry were discontinued in certain areas there would be a huge boom in tourism. This is simply not true. Recent survey work covering ecotourism and adventure holidays utilising state forests in Tasmania reveals that the industry currently employs 230 people-but only in peak season. This industry consists of owner operators providing guided operations into natural locations, with some offering a very basic interpretation of forest ecology. Most have been in operation for only three or four years and have only minimal skills in understanding forest ecology and dynamics. Only four or five Tasmanian ecotourism businesses are big enough to employ up to 15 guides in peak season. Only 25 per cent of the operators are able to survive on ecotourism as their sole income. Though there is a potential for growth, last weekend's Congress on World Ecotourism and Adventure Travel, held in Hobart, signalled that there was a limit to the number of tourists who could be catered for without spoiling the environment. One of the keynote speakers, Jerry Mallett, said that Tasmania could become a world model for ecotourism but that much care must be taken when we sell the very thing we are trying to protect. These comments were reiterated by the state and federal ministers for tourism. So the growth here should be in the skills, expertise and care for the natural environment that will allow outsiders to share the Tasmanian experience. It certainly does not bode well for a huge growth in jobs in this industry. By comparison, the forestry industry-including furniture manufacture and pulp and paper making-is the largest sector of the total Tasmanian economy. It contributes $1,000 million to the Tasmanian economy and directly and indirectly employs between 20,000 and 25,000 people. Forestry companies have become much more responsible in their activities and are actively seeking to incorporate tourism into their managed forestry sites. They are working within their boundaries and do not impinge on the current world heritage areas. This industry simply cannot be replaced in the economy-provided there are safeguards and standards there is no reason why it should be-yet we have a campaign to intimidate forestry workers, injure those who work in the mills and threaten the basic viability of forestry in Tasmania.

32,Mr NUGENT,ECOTERRORISM,"The word 'ecoterrorism' seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. The first part of that coining is from 'ecology' - the study of living organisms' habits and their modes of life and relation to their surroundings; in other words, the study of life and living. The second part is 'terrorism' - from the root word 'terror', meaning extreme fear, sometimes emanating from a policy or system of ruling seeking to obtain political demands by violence and intimidation. The motion from the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is very important. It is a statement that says we know there are those in Australia who think that any end justifies the means. In my view, that is not the case. I would repudiate and reject any form of violence and intimidation, whether it be for reasons of enforcing views on race, class, religion or the environment. Those who resort to these measures are acknowledging publicly their failure to win the argument by logical and fair means. They have lost the argument; they have lost the plot. I sometimes wonder what the mentality is behind this type of action. Have people lost sight of what it is they are actually seeking to do? A well publicised American ecoterrorist gave us some of his thoughts on the subject. He posed the questions: how do we fight tyranny without being tyrants; how do we fight hate without hating; how do we fight death without killing; how do we fight evil without being evil? To resort to those sorts of attitudes is to defeat the whole object of a very worthwhile cause that all of us would support-the preservation of our environment. We are talking about people putting the lives of forest and timber workers in danger. Through that repugnant practice of placing metal spikes in trees, they run the risk of causing very serious injury when those logs are put through timber yard saws. The spikes shear off or fragment and fly in all directions like bullets. We are examining the proposition that the end justifies the means. I do not believe that is acceptable, whether you are talking about those spikes or whether you are talking about polluting petrol in equipment or burning down mills, as has happened. There have been a growing number of instances recently. Just last week on television there was an item on how some families have been affected. It is not just the fear that individual forest workers suffer when they go to work each day; many have to camp out on site to protect their equipment. Families are being left on their own and suffer the stress and trauma that comes from that. It is an issue that increasingly we have to give some attention to. The attitude and the lengths to which some people will go have been clearly recorded. For example, David Foreman, from the group Earth First in America, says: If killing somebody would be the last course of action I had to take regarding the wilderness, would I take it? I don't know. A human life has no more intrinsic value than an individual grizzly bear life. If it came down to a confrontation between a grizzly and a friend, I'm not sure whose side I would be on. But I do know humans are a disease, a cancer on nature. And I also know I am far more interested in the plight of the spotted owl than I am in a logger in Oregon. I have a problem with glorifying the downtrodden worker. In his book Confessions of an Eco-warrior he wrote: Human suffering resulting from drought and famine in Ethiopia is tragic, yes, but the destruction there of other creatures and habitat is even more tragic. That is clearly not an acceptable form of behaviour in this country. It is very much something that is with us today. Honourable members only have to read the front page of today's Financial Review. An article written by Michael Dwyer contains examples of similar acts now taking place in this country. This motion is important. I am pleased to see that there is support from both sides of the House. We all respect the environment, but to what lengths would we allow people to protect it? Are killing and maiming acceptable? I believe the answer is clearly no. I would condemn ecoterrorists. All of us in this place condemn ecoterrorists. I urge the House to support the motion.",39
33,Mr CLEELAND,ECOTERRORISM,"MCEwen) (2.42 p.m.)There is probably no more important issue facing the world today than that which is occurring to the world environment-be it the destruction of tropical rainforests in Brazil, the pollution of the atmosphere by chemicals and other poisons, overpopulation of the world by humans, damage to our waterways or excess motor vehicles. Whichever way one looks at the problem, the damage to the world environment, to our own local environment, is an issue of prime and major importance. Change, of course, takes time. Over a number of years, those who have raised public awareness of these problems have done so, I believe, from a sound philosophical base and strong moral value. Indeed, because of environmental groups we now have changed our attitude to our logging and forestry practices. We now have very largely transferred much of our native forest logging into new plantations. In future years we all hope that new growth plantations will remove the necessity to log native forests, but at present there is little option. This country imports $1.8 billion of timber products. We generally import them from countries which have no control over their logging. Those honourable members who think we do damage to our own environment and our forests here should have a look at Brazil, Borneo and Papua New Guinea and they will see what real, devastating damage is being done. This society, among others, is buying the product. Hence the argument must come back to a balance of the need for this society to manage its resources properly and at the same time ensure that we as a country are not responsible",40
34,Mr SPEAKER,ECOTERRORISM,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted. In accordance with standing order 104A, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",40
35,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today I want to bring to the notice of the House an inexplisuch cable delay in applying some research, a delay that is costing the wool industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I want to talk about some research that can take wool and process it into wool of a superior quality, whether it be from strong to medium, medium to fine or fine to superfine. Obviously, doing that gives the wool superior qualities and far more desirable characteristics than it otherwise would have. This technique was first discovered seven years ago but it seems that neither the farmers, who have had to survive disastrous wool prices, nor the processors have yet used this new technique, a technique that is known as ultrafine or sometimes known as 'Skinny wool'. If these hundreds of millions of dollars could be added into the wool industry it would benefit not only the rural communities but Australia as a whole. Why has this information not been passed onto farmers? What factors have held up the application of this vital research? Who is responsible for this delay? When are wool growers going to see this new technology that could open up fantastic new opportunities for the wool industry? Paedophilia",40
36,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the member or senator in this parliament who is a paedophile to come forward. It was alleged on Radio 6PR in Perth that a member or senator of this parliament is a paedophile. As you know, Mr Speaker, I have asked you to investigate these claims but was told by you, quite rightly, that it was not within your jurisdiction. As you also know, Mr Speaker, the person making the allegations is a former member and deputy speaker of this place, Mr Ron Edwards. I know that Mr Edwards would not make such allegations lightly; I do not believe he would make up such allegations and I believe there could be some substance to them. There are few offences worse than paedophilia. It is a cruel offence committed against Wool defenceless children and if there is a member or senator in this place who has committed an offence he or she should not be here but should be in prison. I appeal to the innocent members of this House who are friends of Mr Edwards to ask him to whom he was referring when he said that a member of federal parliament is a paedophile so that his claims can be investigated and so that all other members and senators who have been tarnished by his suggestion are able to have the slur hanging over their heads erased. Wilson, Mr David",40
37,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak today about Mr David Wilson, who was taken hostage and murdered by the Khmer Rouge. Mr Wilson lived in my electorate, and on behalf of all in the Dunkley electorate I express sincere sympathy to his family and friends. They have gone through a terrible ordeal, something that no-one should have to endure. I make special mention of Mrs Jan Purcell, who is a school crossing supervisor for the local Frankston Primary School. She and her family have spoken out in our local paper and never gave up hope until definite and reliable information was obtained. The Khmer Rouge soldiers who murdered David Wilson must be brought to trial. I realise the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or other ministers would never say this but I feel that these murderers should somehow be given a free trip to Australia, like the trip the Israelis gave war criminals. Once here they should be tried and, if found guilty, punished. To kill a person who has no involvement in the Cambodian conflict is a heinous crime. David Wilson's murder should only strengthen our resolve to make certain that we do everything in our power to assist in bringing to an end this ongoing and terrible time for the majority of the Cambodian people. Army Bands",41
38,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am going to beg the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) to use his office to save the Australian Army Band, Perth, which is going to be fully disbanded and redeployed by January next year. We in Western Australia are going to be the only state without a regular army band. When we consider that next year we have the Australia Remembers commemoration-in which of course we are all participating in a bipartisan effort to ensure that many people, particularly the young, are aware of the importance of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War-it seems absolutely incredible that we will not have a full-time army band to perform at the commemorative services that have been planned for Perth and Western Australia. Mr Speaker, you may not be aware-but some may-that, when the West Coast Eagles returned to Western Australia with the trophy, victorious from the Australian Football League championship, the Australian Army Band played very well in the procession that triumphantly went through Perth. These are obviously high profile types of ceremonies for the Australian Army Band in Perth. I point out that for many Western Australian school children-bearing in mind that our state encompasses one-third of the continent-the only opportunity of hearing live band music has been when the full-time Australian Army Band in Perth has performed on its many tours throughout our state. It is absolutely diabolical that our state is going to lose its only full-time military band when there are nine bands in the eastern states and many of the musicians from the Perth band are being redeployed to bands in the eastern states. (TIme expired) Commonwealth-State Relations",41
39,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have often spoken in this House on federal-state relations and on our federal system. Generally, I have attacked the system on the basis that we have too many governments-15 houses of parliament-running this country. We also have too many members of parliament-well over 600, which is almost the number that Great Britain has. I have suggested a complete change so that we have a vastly strengthened local government. We should do away with state governments and have a federal government which coordinates activities. We should bring democracy back to the people by giving them the right to make some claim on government, preferably not through petitions but through other actions. Recently, Mr Harry Howell of Queanbeyan was fined $359 on the spot because he had a registered ACT trailer in Queanbeyan and he was waiting another month before he registered it in New South Wales. It is absolutely ridiculous that a person can bring a trailer over from one part of Australia to another-in this case, from the ACT to New South Wales-and be fined $359 just because he was waiting until 17 November to have the trailer registered in New South Wales. It is another example of the ridiculous situation in Australia where we do not have coordinated laws and, in particular, coordinated transport systems. Farmers: Taxation Concessions",41
40,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I recently had representations from a farmer who, in carrying out his farming activities, carries livestock, grain and other primary products to market. This man requires an endorsed licence to his drivers licence. Apparently, the Australian Taxation Office has now decided that a drivers licence is not a legitimate expense for taxation purposes and cannot be claimed by those in the farming community as a legitimate expense. I think that, under the present drought conditions we are going through in Australia, perhaps the Treasurer (Mr Willis) could again look at making a small concession. I note that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is at the table. Perhaps he will take this on board. It might be of assistance to farmers if a small concession were made and those expenses of obtaining a drivers licence and an endorsed licence were allowed to be a legitimate taxation claim, particularly whilst this drought is moving further and further south and is now affecting Queensland, New South Wales and many areas of Victoria. Liberal Party of Australia",42
41,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Charlton)Everyone will recall that just recently it was indicated that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) needed a big win in order to consolidate his position. He did get what was referred to as a big win at the federal council meeting in Albury. But I have evidence here as to how that win was achieved. First of all, everyone knows that, when Liberal Party members did not get the votes in the first place, the President of the Liberal Party, Tony Staley, said to everyone, 'Well look, we'l1 cancel that one. We'll have another vote.' So they went out and mustered people in. But I have a photograph of what happened in the process of that vote being taken. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition with one vote and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), with one vote. But Richard Alston has two! We do not even try to do that in the Labor Party. Look at the photograph. If both votes are put up like this, it becomes obvious that in his top pocket there is another spare vote if he wants it. In order to get it through, opposition members needed three-fifths of 64 votes. That is 38.4 votes. They actually got 39 votes, so they won by 0.6 of a vote. Mr Speaker, for your information, that is how they got it. Senator Richard Alston did not vote once but twice, and the honourable member for Higgins is looking at him as if to say, 'Good heavens, how did you do that? Why didn't I think of it?' Tullamarine Freeway",42
42,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today honourable members of the House attacked people engaged in what they described as acts of ecoterrorism. I want to follow suit and take the opportunity to attack another form of terrorism-that being the Victorian state government's commitment to the widening of the Tullamarine freeway between Brunswick and Coburg. Widening the Tullamarine freeway will add 80,000 cars per day to the freeway. It is something that I am sure members on this side of the House would not be happy about, given their great concern for children and the rest of it. We must act to stop it. I call on the federal government, including the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), to do everything in its power to prevent the widening of the freeway. It is totally wrong for the government to ride roughshod over the residents of Brunswick and Coburg. Unfortunately, we are getting too used to it. The widening of this freeway will do nothing to improve transport. It will divert resources away from the public sector, increase the emission of greenhouse gases and endanger the health of the residents. A much better solution would be for the government to upgrade the Upfield railway line. It is also imperative that the state opposition lift its game and offer us a serious alternative to jackboot government that we are experiencing in Victoria at the moment. Tourism",42
43,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In my 90-second statement, I have something positive to say about tourism in my area and the initiatives that have been made by me in getting people together to cooperate for the good of everyone. I do not ask people what their political background is; I ask them to cooperate for the benefit of the people in my area. On 11 November, we will be having a major seminar to talk about ecotourism, cultural tourism and relationships with local government. We will also be talking about on-selling, which is the process of tourist operators getting a mental map of all other operators within their area so that they can sell on to other operators and thereby the stake of our area. The year 2000 will be marked by the Olympic Games in Sydney. Apart from Sydney itself, three regions stand ready to take the best: the Hunter, the Blue Mountains and the Shoalhaven-Illawarra. We need to be ready. We will be going hard against my colleague from the Hunter, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), to get all the business we can. We will be trying our hardest to get business from the Blue Mountains area, which is represented by my friend the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). I am hoping that my people in the tourist industry will learn about cooperation in putting together a strategy that will enable us to get a bigger slice of the cake and more jobs for the people in my area. I am thankful for being able to make this statement in this parliament, because it is an important step and one of the initiatives in my electorate for which I am proud to say I have been responsible. Prime Minister",43
44,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I draw to the attention of this chamber a little book that has just been published called The little book of Aussie wisdom. I was fascinated when I the turned to page 18 of this book and found, under the heading 'Bummer', the quote that Australia is the 'a... end' of the world. It then says, 'Paul Keating, Prime Minister'. This raises three prospects. Firstly, does it confirm that the Prime Minister did use those words? Secondly, is the Prime Minister going to sue the publishers? Thirdly, Mr Speaker, do you think this might be Bob Hawke's revenge? Workplace Reform",43
45,Mr SWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to speak about a threat to our industrial peace and stability as well as to continued strong economic and productivity growth. That threat comes from some cynical and sly attempts by a few Australian companies to bypass our industrial relations legislation. Sadly, it is the action of a few renegade companies, such as CRA, that is clouding the achievements of the last increase decade in workplace reform. The CRA is attempting, through individual contracts, to undermine the collective bargaining power of workers in this country. The CRA is currently forcing upon workers in Bell Bay in Tasmania, as well as those in Weipa in Queensland, employment contracts which are unique in the employment history of this country in the absolute power that they give to employers over employees. These contracts give the employee no rights. These contracts are absolutely one-sided affairs straight out of the Liberal Party Jobsback policy.",43

Edward St John died on 24 October 1994. He represented the division of Warringah from 1966 to 1969. Alexander Lillico died on 3 November 1994. He represented the state of Tasmania from 1959 to 1974.

49,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES," I would like to say a few words about Peter Wilenski but, before doing so, I would like to pass on my condolences and those of the government to the relatives of the prementary viously mentioned Edward St John and former Senator Lillico. I never knew Mr St John; he left the parliament before I arrived. But I did know former Senator Lillico for a period institution. of time. I am sure everyone on the government side would like me to extend our syma pathy to the relatives of both former memrange bers. Peter Wilenski died on Thursday, 3 Novemance ber after a long illness at the age of 55. plenty in the parliament will know, he was born in Poland in 1939 and came to Australia in 1943. He was educated at Sydney High School and at the University of Sydney. He had a long and distinguished career in a number of different positions as public serthis vant, academic, ministerial adviser and diploalways mat. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia earlier this year in recognition his contribution to Australian public life. From 1972 to 1974 he was Gough Whitlam's principal private secretary; special adviser to the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1974; Foundation Professor of the Australian Graduate School of Management from 1977 to 1981; Chairman of the Public Service from 1983 to 1987; Secretary to the senaDepartment of Transport and Communications from 1987 to 1988; Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1989 to 1992; and Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade during 1992 and 1993. Peter Wilenski saw the necessity for change in Australia and was committed to bringing it about. Much of what he did, which seemed radical to some at the time, has now been integrated into Australian life, especially in the areas of social justice and access and equity in Australian public administration. He was instrumental in creating a public sector in which women could begin to have the same opportunities as men. He applied his management skills and social commitment to advance cause of reform in the United Nations and to focus the attention of the international community on the needs of women and human rights issues. In fact, his reputation in the United Nations still stands out very strongly, and I know any of our recent parliarepresentatives to the United Nations have found very favourable and generous references to Peter Wilenski's time as ambassador and his interest in the reform of that He was a person of many dimensions, with great love of art and an interest in a huge of issues as diverse as medicine, which was his first profession, development assistand higher education. As I said in a As statement on the day of his death, Australia has lost a national figure. All of us mourn that but, at the same time, he has left us much for which the government of the country can be deeply thankful. He was a public servant in the highest tradition of public service in country at a time of great change. He was a force for change and made a commitment which I think the government and of the parliament will long remember. I am sure that honourable members join me in passing our deep condolences to his wife Jill and his two young children Michael and Katie.",44
50,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"Firstly, with your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to add to the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I extend sympathy to the relatives of Edward St John and Alexander Lillico. Edward St John was the member for Warringah in New South Wales for some years and a member of my party. I wish also to join with the Prime Minister in recognising Dr Peter Wilenski's contribution to the process of public policy making in Australia. Dr Wilenski was a man of substantial intellect and drive. He had a very clear picture of the kind of Australia he wanted to contribute to and he worked in pursuit of what he believed. His career was remarkable in its breadth of interest and its high achieveapproach. ments. Whether in academia, diplomacy, public service or whatever Dr Wilenski turned his mind to, he built a formidable reputation both within and beyond Australia. Not all of us on this side of the House agreed with Peter Wilenski's views on the need for greater political responsiveness within the Public Service, but all of us appreciated the Public Service reform agenda he set himself and acknowledge many of the positive changes that he oversaw. Peter Wilenski devoted his enormous skills and talents to serving the community through public policy. He did so with great energy, drive and faith in what he believed. We on this side of House join today in recognising the scale of that contribution. Courage and optimism were two of the hallmarks of Dr Wilenski's career. They were two qualities supremely apparent over recent times as he fought the ravages of cancer. That final battle was one he fought in a brave, dignified and inspiring way. On behalf of the coalition parties, I join with the Prime Minister in conveying our deep regret to Dr Wilenski's wife, his family and his many friends.",44
51,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, by indulgence, on behalf of the National Party, I extend our sympathy to the family of Edward St John. I note that his maiden speech was famous and it is well worth checking Hansard to see the altercation that it brought forth with the Prime Minister of the day. I also extend my sympathy to the family of former Senator Alexander Lillico from Tasmania. Peter Wilenski served in New South Wales government circles when I was a member of the New South Wales parliament. I join with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in acknowledging the particularity of that service. When he took up a position as a senior public servant in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade he adopted a slightly different approach from that which was the rule of the day at the New South Wales level. I acknowledge that it was a more even-handed He made a magnificent and massive contribution to many aspects of reform in the public service, both at state and federal level. I extend my sympathy to the members of his family.",45
52,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to briefly add some remarks about Peter Wilenski, Edward St John and Alexander Lillico because, probably unlike most members of the House, I knew them all well. While I know that we now have two independents present in the House, I think Ted St John's term in this place shows that there can be independence within the party system. I think it is worthwhile for those without the system to recognise that there is another way to express their differences. As one who believes that the party system contributes significantly to the stability of government within the Westminster concept and its Australian adaptation, I think that Ted St John's term and the contribution he made serves as an excellent example. As a Tasmanian Senator, Alexander Lillico was one who both represented his state well and made a worthwhile contribution within the Senate. Although I disagreed with Peter Wilenski in many respects, I recognise that there are few who have served this nation with such devotion and personal ability. I first met Peter Wilenski through one of my former staffers, Adrian Lynch, who was at Sydney University with him. Peter Wilenski was as significant in university politics as he later became in the service of Australia and in the international field as ambassador for Australia in the United Nations. There are few who have contributed more to this nation than Peter Wilenski. To his relatives, as to those of both Ted St John and former Senator Lillico I extend my personal sympathy. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. NA Cambodia",45
53,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In view of recent murders of Australian citizens by the notorious Khmer Rouge, why is the government refusing to make a full statement to this parliament about the real situation in Cambodia and the future co-e of Australian policy, including military asslstance? Does the Prime Minister share the deep concerns which then Ambassador Holloway conveyed to the government some months ago in a leaked cable about the prospects for peace and stability in Cambodia?",46
54,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Right from the period - hen . Cambodia was left ravaged by the mcurslOns of other forces into that country after the Vietnam War it was always going to be - ifficult to put that country back together, particularly after the regime of Pol Pot and the legacy that that left and the murder and deprivation of the civilian population that c-me from that. .It was always a terribly dlfficult task. I thmk Australia has played a very strong role. Certainly my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has in terms of seeking to bring about a process where there could be some real authority brought to the government of Cambodia via a democratic election and the processes of democracy taking place. . For countries such as Cambodia it is very dlfficult to draw down any public authority when there is no recognised government and where only people who operate political factions or who have had power by virtue of their family position, such as the royal family, have governed. This has meant that managing Cambodia or trying to get some kind of consensus about how it is governed was a difficult thing to do. That is why the peace accords were pursued with such vigour by Australia and why as a consequence that election gave the opportunity to the elected representatives of the people of Cambodia to form a government and to operate that gov' e-ent in a manner conducive to progress, soclal development and human happiness in that country. As in any switch to a democracy or with any authority being vested in particular leaders, particularly where there are substantial .given general authority by the election, gettmg a coalescence of view about how the country should be governed has been difficult and I think the content and import of thcable which the Leader of the Opposition refers to reflect some of the disquiet by the then ambassador about the progress being made by the government of Cambodia in consolidating the country and improving progress. I think one thing is clear; that is, responsibility for the tragic death of David Wilson a-d his two travelling companions lies solely with the Khmer Rouge and its leaders, like Pol Pot and General Paet, who pursue power by terrorist tactics. That has been maintained as a policy by them despite the willingness of the international community to involve the Khmer Rouge in the processes of democracy. Indeed, in the visit I made to Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge was represented at a lunch with Prince Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge had every opportunity of being involved with the process and taking their chances in a democratic sense with support of themselves in the community. It has rejected that course and as a consequence pursued the sorts of tactics which it is currently pursuing. The government will shortly consider how Australia can best help prevent a repetition of the kind of tragedy we have just witnessed by helping to build the capacity of the Cambodian armed forces against the challenge from the Khmer Rouge. The alternative is to leave ordinary Cambodians to suffer at its hands. The government will make decisions on this within the next few weeks and after consultation with other relevant countries. Can I say on the tragedy itself that Senator Evans and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials in Cambodia and in Canberra put a determined and persistent effort into securing the release of the hostages. I do not think they could have done more. As a consequence, I would like to pay tribute to the work in arduous circumstances performed by the consular and other staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and by the Australian Federal Police throughout this period. This, of course, will not bring any comfort to the families of those bereaved by the deaths which occurred at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. But at least it should be known that, from our point of view, the government took this matter seriously and did everything it could to pursue the release of David Wilson and his colleagues. From the government's point of view, we will be considering how best we may support the process of democracy in Cambodia and the Cambodian government. Whether that goes to training of military personnel, we will be examining these issues in the next few weeks. One thing is for sure: as a relatively small group, which the Khmer Rouge representsMrs Bishop-Which you legitimised.",46

56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I beg your pardon?,47
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for MACKellar and the member for Mitchell.,47
58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which I legitimised? This group should not prosper, and the process of democracy which gave that country a chance it would not otherwise have had ought to be left to run to see how far economic and social consolidation can go. Let me conclude by further expressing my sincere condolences to the family of David Wilson and to the families of the other two young men who were murdered by the Khmer Rouge and assure them again that Australia did everything it could to secure their release. Cambodia",47
59,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs and it relates to the same issue that the Prime Minister has just spoken about. Should the Australian government continue to aid Cambodia when it is clear that the Cambodian government cannot protect the lives of foreign citizens when it appears to be having great difficulty in being effective? Mr BILNEYThe Prime Minister in his last answer dealt very effectively with the question of possible military aid to the Cambodian armed forces to assist them to combat the menace posed by the Khmer Rouge, and I have nothing to add on that aspect. At the same time, I emphasise that our program of civilian development assistance to Cambodia will not be and cannot be allowed to be derailed by this senseless and brutal murder. Over the past months, we have acknowledged in the civilian aid field the profound problems faced by the Cambodian government. It is quite unrealistic to expect that those problems will be solved in a fully functioning democracy after 20 years of war and genocide. We do not contemplate cancelling programs which bring basic health care and immunisation to children in a country which has an infant mortality rate of 117 per 1,000 and help to mothers, who die in childbirth at a rate of more than one in 100programs which provide the poorest communities with education, skills and credit in a country where the average annual income is $US2OO and the adult literacy rate is less than 20 per cent. We do not plan to reduce programs which rid the country of 10 million landmines which are waiting to cripple or kill farmers and their children, or programs which aim to improve the functioning and accountability of a fledgling government suffering from serious but predictable problems. If we do that, the murderers of David Wilson will have had their way; they will have won the day. In the last budget, Australian assistance to Cambodia was more than doubled to around $92 million over the next four years. Targeted areas of the grel!tesfneed are repairing bridges on the national roads; establishing a fair and equitable exam system in primary and secondary schoolS and upgrading the university; providing an agricultural extension system for poor farmers and their families, who still constitute 85 per cent of the population; immunisation programs; assistance, importantand ly, for the good work which Australian nongovernmental organisations are doing in Cambodia; and, very importantly, remaining a very large contributor to the demining operations which are essential to bring land back into production. So, to answer the honourable member, we have no intention of turning our back on Cambodia at this time. We intend to assist in its return to stability and security. Like the Prime Minister, may I too add my condolences to those already expressed to the Wilson family. All Australia shares their grief. Cambodia",47
60,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In his recent statements on Cambodia, Senator Gareth Evans has said that elements of the Thai military continue to support the Khmer Rouge and that the Khmer Rouge are able to seek sanctuary within Thailand with impunity. Given that easy access to such sanctuary clearly hampers the capacity of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to counter the Khmer Rouge, will the Prime Minister signify the importance with which he treats this matter, as he suggested in his answer to the first question, by taking the matter up with the Thai Prime Minister when he meets him next week at the APEC leaders meeting in Bugor. If not, why not?",48
61,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I took it up with the Thai Prime Minister when I visited Thailand on the last occasion, saying that the Australian government has been less than pleased by the commercial and logistical support given by some figures in the Thai armed forces and in commerce to elements connected with the Khmer Rouge along the border. I was assured by the Prime Minister that that support did not come from the government of Thailand. It is, I think, from his remarks, a bewildering problem for him and his government, as it has been for the community of the area, including Australia. I am quite happy to assure the honourable member that I will be taking the issue up again with the Thai Prime Minister when I see him at the APEC meeting next week. Given that this issue has received so much attention in recent weeks, not just in Australia but round the region, it is an opportunity to again reinforce the fact that the Khmer Rouge are getting support from external sources, some of them in Thailand. Without that support it would severely, or at least materially, curtail their activities. It is a great pity, I think, that this support has continued, particularly after the peace accords and the elections. No doubt a lot of it is simply corruption where there has been a trade in forest products and gems and, obviously, cabals of power within sections of the Thai military. At any rate, let me repeat that the Thai Prime Minister assured me that the government of Thailand supported our view that external support for the Khmer Rouge would leave them in a position where they have to fend for themselves and earn support within the Cambodian community and that there was no support for such activity by the Thai government. Drugs, Generic Brand",48
62,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. From 1 December 1994 pharmacists will be able to issue generic brand drugs. What has been the response of general practitioners to this development? Is the minister concerned that consumers may miss out on the benefits of this change? If so, what action is she taking to ensure that consumers do benefit?",48
63,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a very important program which enjoys bipartisan support and which is strongly supported by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The discussions I have had with the medical profession have been generally positive. It means that, at the pharmacy, on request or on the advice of the pharmacist, a generic brand can be substituted. But, if the doctor believes there are sound, clinical reasons for no substitution, he or she can write that on the prescription form, and the drug will be given according to the original prescription. This has the capacity to save a considerable amount of money. The out-ofpocket costs above and beyond those provided for in the pharmaceutical benefits schedule will be lower, and that is particularly beneficial to low income earners. I was mightily surprised when the President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, was apparently opposed to the scheme. At least two newspapers reported that with some confidence. As a result, a number of groups responded very angrily, including pensioners, because they are amongst those supporting it very strongly. I was surprised to see that Dr Nelson was alleged to have said that he and most other GPs would get 'no substitute' stamps-in other words, they would routinely stamp every prescription, thereby preventing the scheme from operating. 'Exceptions,' he said, 'would be made for needy people.' The response to that I think was appropriate. For example, the Council on the Ageing said that it was much offended by the view that the AMA would administer a 'new poor law'; that it would decide who was needy and who was not and would then, in a very patronising way, decide which prescriptions would be stamped 'no substitute' and which would not, rather than on the basis of clinical need. I think that is a most extraordinary outcome. I heard various statements during the week that members of the medical profession were worried about this measure because drug companies provided for their continuing education and their conferences. It seemed a very strange view that the less well-off in community, pensioners in particular, should be paying for medical conferences. I found that view extraordinary. I am pleased to say that the majority of practitioners who contacted me said just the opposite. They were very supportive of the scheme, and they were surprised at the apparent position of the AMA. It appears that the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra TImes got it wrong and that Dr Brendan Nelson was not saying that at all-at least that is the view that Brendan Nelson has put in his press release. Dr Nelson is now saying-I am pleased to announce this just in case it has not been generally noticed-that the AMA is not planning to undermine generic prescribing, that the AMA is not planning to tell doctors to prescribe only brand name drugs and that the AMA has not suggested that doctors order rubber stamps stating 'not for substitution' be placed on every script. I am very pleased at that. There appears to have been a misunderstanding. That is the kindest interpretation. If not, the President of the AMA has responded to his own members and to members of the community, and changed his mind. Poverty",48
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In her paper to the ACOSS conference 10 days ago, Professor Ann Harding estimated that in September this year 1,800,000 Australians were living in poverty.

71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No-because you have not got enough wit to be able to get one. These are the same people who wanted to tip unemployed people off unemployment benefit after nine months. These are the people crying about the poor. The callousness with which they pursued their policy approach in the last election was to say, 'After nine months, Dr you're on your own and you're down to the voluntary agencies.'

76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether the shadow Treasurer noticed a week or so ago when I said, in announcing the employment statistics, that for the first time Australia had more than eight million people employed. There were six million people employed",50
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That reflects the population growth.,50
78,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. It has to do with employment growth. The employment growth in the years of Labor is 21/2 to three times the employment growth in the years of the Fraser government. You had pathetic rates of employment growth. Is it any wonder? You had wage increases at the time of 20-plus per cent, a blowout in the inflation rate and a poor profit share of the economy. As a consequence, investment had been dashed and employment was running at about a third of the level of employment generated by this government. Mrs Bishop-The real problem is that you believe this stuff.",50

81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"in employment over the last decade. As the House knows, employment is now running at about four per cent growth a year, at about four times the European average and as fast as any other western economy. That is the primary driver of any remedial policy to deal with those who are in poverty. The other thing the government did over the period, and continues to do, was to concentrate on low income families and those who are unemployed by increasing benefits and providing a capacity to earn more while on benefits by taking part-time work, a reform announced in the white paper, and, of course, by providing huge transfers to families, about $6 billion in the period the government has been in office, via the family allowance supplement to low income families-the set of payments which direct payments now to the principal carer within the family. It is this level of payments which made an inordinate difference to the lot of those who are low paid or those formerly described as being below the poverty line. It is those kinds of changes, plus supplementary payments for low paid people in the 1980s and the tax cutsMr Downer-The rich are getting richer.",50

The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Downer-I rise on a point of order,50
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What point? Mr Downer-In terms of the order of the House, let me make this point to you. The question was why, under this government, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and the question is never answered. No attempt is made to answer the question. And you would have a lot more silence from my members if you only upheld the standing orders on these matters.",50

There is no-one to look after the Leader of the Opposition in here while he is sitting up the back sucking on tea and cream cakes. The fact of the matter-they may not like it over there-is that there has been a 26 per cent improvement in employment in this country thanks to the policies of this government. There have been huge transfer payments to the low paid and to families via the family allowance supplement by the recently announced changes to support for child care, that is, the generalised childcare rebate and the home child-care allowance. Mr Ruddock-Yes, they have cashed in the dependent spouse rebate.",50

95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I might draw the honourable member's attention to the taking of points of order which are not valid.,51
96,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All of my remarks have been directed to the principal issue of transfers to low income people. That is right on the line of the question. All these interjections and points of order are made simply to disrupt the parliament. Ten years ago the bottom rate of income tax was 30 per cent.,51
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Ergh!,51
98,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might go 'Ergh!' You were the Treasurer; you know all about it. Now the bottom rate is 20 per cent. The tax-free threshold is $5,400; it was $4,750. As a consequence, a great amount of the tax cuts went to low paid people. As a consequence of this election, the tax cuts delivered by the government for people on incomes of $20,500 upwards, the median incomes, again support this group of people; that is, the low paid and those on middle incomes will be assisted by the tax changes and the social security transfer payments. Over our period of time $6 billion has been transferred in family payments, particularly to low income families and to families on incomes up to the extension of the income test for the family allowance. There has been endless debate in this country about where a poverty line is these days. One thing is for sure-there would be a lot more people in poverty without two million jobs having been created and without these huge transfers in the budget having taken place, which the coalition is arraigned against. When the coalition talks about cuts to government spending, it is talking about cuts to the transfer payments to families. It did this in the last election by saying to anybody on unemployment benefits that nine months is the end and you then have to go out to a voluntary agency. That is the sort of decency with which the opposition views support for the low paid and those who have been in poverty. That is why the basis of the question has no integrity. Smart little questions from solicitors of no account will not alter the circumstances. Micro-Economic Reform",51
99,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports that micro-economic reform has stalled? Is there any substance to those reports? What progress is being made in this area?,51
100,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen a report by Professor Hilmer which criticises microeconomic reform and the progress of the implementation of recommendations made in his report. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting, the Commonwealth, states and territories reaffirmed their commitment to implementing a national competition policy. COAG has agreed to finalise a legislative package at its February 1995 meeting. Mr Speaker, you might recall that at that meeting I said, as I have said in the House and remarked in the past, it was unlikely that a Labor Prime Minister and a Labor Treasurer had to enjoin conservative premiers to agree to competition changes and to agree to competition policy in the context of COAG. As the House will know, one of the principal points of difference at that meeting was the objection raised by the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, with support in the main from the South Australian Premier, Mr Brown. It ill behoves Mr Hilmer to attack the Commonwealth government when in fact it was two conservative premiers who spragged the process in Darwin-only to have the Commonwealth press on and say that it would implement substantial parts of the reforms unless there was some sort of cooperative approach taken. As a consequence, it was agreed that there would be a reference to the Industry Commission. That reference has been agreed to with the states and has now gone. I notice that all these references to the states, to their competithere tion policies and their rights and prerogatives, were under attack today-it is one of the first times that I have seen them under attack-by the member for Wentworth. I agreed with his view wholeheartedly. He launched a fresh attack on his party's leadership, with the emphasis on defending states rights. He said: The Liberals should be redefining themselves not as a party of states rightsMr Tim Fischer-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing order 145 states: An answer shall be relevant to the question. Clearly, the Prime Minister has now moved on-not to a very indirectly related subject area but to a different subject area, and you should rule accordingly.",51
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is talking about states rights.,52
102,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: The Liberals should be redefining themselves not as a party of states rights but as a party for the supremacy of the individual. He went on to talk in the context of the Leader of the Opposition saying that he proposed, at his 50th anniversary conference, a new deal in federal-state relations to limit the Commonwealth's use of the external treaty power and also a new deal in terms of Commonwealth payments to the states. Mrs Bishop- Mr SPEAKER ",52
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Mackellar on a point of order that is relevant. Mrs Bishop-On two occasions a predecessor of yours as Speaker in 1978 and 1979 held that the person answering the question was not able to speak for and on behalf of a leader or member of another political party because he was not responsible for those utterances. I ask you to uphold those rulings, made on 16 March 1978 and 29 May 1979.",52
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I understand it, the Prime Minister is quoting from a newspaper article. I would hardly think he is speaking on behalf of someone in this place.",52
105,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The central point is that is all the time coming from the coalition this view that somehow the Commonwealth is illegitimate, that the fountainhead of power in this country comes with the states, that the whole process of federation, the carriage of the referendums and the giving of powers to the Commonwealth are somehow illegitimate, that what is legitimate is the states. And this does not come from the community. There is no polling which says that the federal government is centralist. Mr Downer-The Labor Party is opposed to it.",52
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition is not helping.,52
107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no polling which says that there is some sort of groundswell of community opinion against the aggregation of power by the Commonwealth to run a national economy, for instance. What we find in this doffmg of the hat to the states at Liberal conferences is simply the power of state branches of the Liberal Party-not states power versus Commonwealth power. There is no public issue here. There is no issue around the countryside that the pollsters are picking up, with people saying there is too much power to the national government and that it ought to be going back to the states. These state rumps of the Liberal Party want to protect all the time the power they have because the Liberal Party is not a national party; it is a collection of state parties. Twenty-five years after the Labor Party agreed to introduce powers for its national executive to intervene in its state processesMr Downer-On a point of order, Mr Speaker",52
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister might resume his seat for a moment. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order. Mr Downer-It is noteworthy that the Labor Party opposed Federation in the first place and thought it was a capitalist plot,53
109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,53
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Those on my right. Mr Downer-It's embarrassing, isn't it? My point of order is this: this House works effectively when the standing orders are properly upheld. In this particular instance you are simply allowing the Prime Minister to range inaccurately and dishonestly across a whole range of different issues without his being brought back to the question he was asked. I seem to recall-it was some minutes ago-that it was a question about micro-economic reform. It was presumably meant to lead to the Prime Minister attacking Professor Hilmer.",53
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is now debating the point. He has made his point of order. I thank him again for drawing the attention of the House to the standing orders. Mr Downer-And they apply to them as well as us.,53
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the Opposition would know, in terms of the content of answers, this subject matter has been the subject of some discussion over a long period. In at least two periods I can recall it was an issue that was considered by the procedures committee of this House. On all occasions, attempts to define limits in terms of relevance and so on foundered. In this case I have already ruled on two occasions, I think, that the Prime Minister is in order. The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Downer-He can talk about anything, can he? Mr Costello-He is always in order.",53
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already said that I have ruled twice on this matter. The Prime Minister is in order. I am sure that in bringing his answer to a conclusion the issues that have been raised in the question will be addressed again.,53
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The central point I am making is that the federal structure of the coalition is anti-nation; it is anti the sense of a nation. It is still a divided set of fractions, as the member for Wentworth has quite eloquently pointed out today, because there is no popular movement, no popular sentiment, which says the states are being denuded of power or there is too much power aggregated to the national government. This pandering to states interests is pandering to state branches of the Liberal Party because there is no national Liberal Party.",53
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,53
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do with it. I run into opposition from the Victorian Premier and from the South Australian Premier at the Council of Australian Governments because of notions of what are states rights and the rights of the Liberal Party to govern in the interests of itself with its view of the world. I do not want to be horrid, not even a teensy-weensy bit horrid, in saying that it is time the Leader of the Opposition stood up for the Commonwealth of Australia, the nation of Australia, and said that the process of federation is completely legitimate, said that the powers given to the national parliament via the constitution are completely legitimate and rejected the sectional interests of his own party, which is a collection of state parties and is not a national party. The problem with the Liberal Party in 1994 is that nearly 100 years after federation and years after it has been in office it has not changed. It has no organisation to reflect the aspirations of the nation. That is why we have this pathetic rubbish about appealing to state branches and states rights, about corporations power, the external affairs power or a better taxing deal for states. When are you going to stand up for Australia, for the nation and for the interests of the whole community instead of worrying about these petty sectional interests in your own party which have not changed since the day Bob Menzies formed it 50 years ago? That is your problem and nothing that happened in Albury changed it other than to point out the fact that you do not have a national party; all you have is a collection of state rumps with now a dubious power to intervene in federal preselection.",53
117,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the social welfare increments implemented by your government, and your condemnation of the coalition's credentials on the issue of social justice, there appears to be growing evidence that inequality in Australia is rising. Using income tax figures, Tim Colebatch in an article in the Age on 21 October argued that the gap between Melbourne's richest and poorest suburbs has widened. The same sentiments, I might add, are expressed by the honourable member for Fraser and academic John Quiggin on page 39 of their book Work for All. If you actually believe, as you claimed during an interview with Peter Ross on ABC TV yesterday, that the market cannot even produce architectural harmony, why do you continue to eschew interventionist economics in favour of the kinds of market driven policies-that is, reduced public outlays, regressive taxation, privatisation and labour market deregulation-which, as you correctly state, are an article of faith in the Liberal Party but, as I was brought up to believe, have no place in the party of true believers.",54
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think we are all agreed that is a fairly wide ranging question.,54
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am afraid that he is not a very true believer; otherwise he would not have ratted and run against a Labor candidate. There are always people invoking the Labor faith. The best place to start invoking the Labor faith is in the Labor Party. Mr Speaker, I will tell you the first thing the true believers believe: they believe in employment. They believe in growth. They believe in lifting the size of the national wealth and spreading it to people through employment. Employment has been the place where, traditionally, Australians have been able to secure their part of the national wealth. That is why I have said over and over again that, under the accord which the government entered into with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the trade unions of this country in 1983, the principal policy was to let the economy grow-not to see the proceeds frittered away in a price and wage round but to see the proceeds go to Economy employment. That is what has happened. As a consequence, we had an average of 41f2 per cent related GDP growth through the 1980s. We have had, as I said, 25 to 26 per cent employment growth and, as a consequence of that, we have seen a huge transfer of prosperity to those people via employment. Very few governments in the world have growth and employment as an express policy-very few indeed. We do and, as a consequence of that, there has been an increase in household disposable income in every year that theAn incident having occurred in the gallery",54
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister might just wait for a moment. It is hard enough down here without you lot. I will have the galleries cleared unless silence is maintained.,54
121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence, we have seen a tremendous improvement in the rate of household disposable income, which has risen every year-bar one-that the government has been in office. There has also been, as I said earlier, a huge transfer of outlays to families and particularly low paid people. The wage policy is focusing on benefits for those at the bottom end of the work force. The safety net for those unable to negotiate an enterprise bargain is being maintained and the tax cuts are being directed to those at the bottom end. All the analyses I have seen of the distribution of the wealth in Australia fail to take into account tax cuts and the extent of the transfer payments. That is basically why there has never been a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of wealth. That is not to say that the Australian economy is not much wealthier today than it was 10 years ago. With the internationalisation of the economy and the fact that we are seeing a removal of exchange controls and the free flow of funds coming to and going from Australia, we have had world price earnings ratios attached to Australian assets in the stock market. That has meant that people who have had assets and stocks have had their wealth appreciate substantially. That is true but what is also true is that, while there might have been a change in the relative positioning of the low paid and the supposedly wealthy, the low paid have come up enormously. Those in poverty and those who are low paid have come up enormously as a consequence of the government being in office. These are partial analyses which we see people on the Left take up-including in the Spencer Street sovietevery three months and six months and run their line. This does not alter by one jot the massive improvements which have gone across toMr Cleary interjecting",54
122,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jeff Kennett does not like them very much either. This does not alter by one jot the massive improvements which have gone across to those on low to middle incomes. There is all this sort of hankering after a bit of partial analysis which looks at one level of income or one stream of payments, but not looking at the totality of an accord with tax cuts, transfer payments and the rest is an analysis not really worth bothering with. That is why the government, when these things come along, basically flicks them, because everybody out there who is low paid or has been on the bottom end knows that the support which has come by way of this government in more employment, a rise in household disposable income, transfer payments, tax cuts, wage improvements and the safety net have all made a tremendous difference. An incident having occurred in the gallery",55
123,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the chainsaw brigade. As a consequence, I can assure the honourable member that everything which the Labor Party has stood for in terms of employment and equity for those on low to middle incomes, including such things as Medicare and increases in educational opportunities with massive participation rates in schoolsall of that-should go into the mix. That is why any analysis which is partial and not complete is really not analysis at all. I like to think that ticking away in the honourable member'S mind and heart is basically a lot of regard for what the government has done. I think that is basically true. It may suit him from time to time to camouflage it. But, even though he is an Independent and this question was not entirely complimentary, we do appreciate the compliments he has given the government from time to time. Women: Local Government",55
124,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. The latest Saulwick poll shows overwhelming support for the positive contribution that more women will make to the performance of government. Given this widespread community support, can the minister inform the House of progress in increasing the number of women in local government?",55

127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I would hate to have to remind people in this place of the warning I gave a moment ago.,55
128,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question raised by the honourable member for Gilmore is particularly timely because we are meeting at the time of the first assembly of local government in Australia. Representatives from local governments all over Australia will come together in the most representative meeting of local government at any time in our history. The poll that the honourable member refers to is a Saulwick poll, which indicates overwhelming support for greater participation by women in government, be it at the Commonwealth, state and, one would hope, local government levels. The record of local governmentAn incident having occurred in the gallery",55
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister.,56
130,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The representation of women in these various levels of government has not been strong. In local government, in overall terms, no more than 20 per cent of elected councillors are women. In some states, the record is below the average. For example, in New South Wales, only 13 per cent of local government representatives are women. In Tasmania, about 12 per cent are. One of the fundamental issues of equity in our community is the representation of men and women. That issue is quite fundamental. As honourable members would know, our party has made a very clear decision to move, in Commonwealth and state parliaments, towards the development of greater representation, particularly through quotas.",56

132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order!,56
133,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say to the baying members of the opposition that one of the reasons why they have been in opposition for more than 11 years is that they have often failed to anticipate issues and develop a policy on those issues. Take the question in point-the issue of quotas. The Leader of the Opposition described that approach as patronising.

136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,56
137,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question of quotas involved a clear policy. It was a decision made by the Australian Labor Party, which will over time and in the foreseeable futureover the period between now and 2002achieve much stronger representation. Some 35 per cent of members of Commonwealth and state parliaments will be women. This assembly will provide local government with the opportunity to look at this fundamental question of equity. It is true that one can achieve a great deal in public policy. This government has nothing to be ashamed of in terms of what it has achieved in social policy and policy that is particularly recognised by women as being of fundamental importance. The issue of Medicare was as fundamental as any other issue at the last election because women saw that issue as being a decisive question. The opposition may laugh, but the issue of quotas indicates that this party has made a decision which will ensure that, in terms of representation, we are strategically placed to ride with the Saul wick poll and with the opinions there",56
138,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,56
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,56
140,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Our decision will also ensure that recognition by the electorate of the fact that women should be much more strongly represented is not just a question of attitude or education over decades but one which changes the nature of the parliament. Local government should take account of that polling and recognise that it offers an opportunity at that most basic and most local level of representation to ensure that men and women are recognised much more equally. Household Income,56
141,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The next affirmative action action will be the honourable member for Fremantle replacing you, I assume Minister. My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that, in 1976, 65 per cent of all Australian households had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000 per annum in constant dollar terms, with 15 per cent earning less than $22,000 per annum. By 1992, the 65 per cent figure had collapsed to only 40 per cent and the number of households earning less than $22,000 per annum had doubled from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. Do not those figures show that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer? Why has your government pursued policies which have led to a more unequal Australia?",56
142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I made it clear in the last two answers on this subject that the place to start looking at poverty in this country is employment. You cannot go on pretending that we could have, as you had under the treasurership of the member for Bennelong, a low growth, inflation ridden, low profit, low employment economy, which we had right through the 1970s and early 1980s when he was the Treasurer. We have gone from an average rate of growth through the 1980s of 41f2 per cent GDP growth and now four per cent employment growth, with 26 per cent employment growth across the decade and two mi11ion more people in work. The Leader of the Opposition is giving me ics which obviously has been drafted for a parliamentary question. As I have said, the fact is that there are a lot of problems with that analysis. I can go through them if you wish. Mr Downer-Look at these figures.",57
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If you want to hear them, you will sit there and listen.",57
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The study used updated estimates of family income based on the 1989-90 income distribution survey and compared these with the so-called Henderson poverty line. This procedure results in a substantial upward bias to estimated poverty numbers. The Henderson poverty lines bears no relationship to current Australian society. It is based on the basic wage as of 1966 and equivalence scales derived from New York in 1954. Professor Harding has been one of the strongest critics of the Henderson measure and the government agrees that its use is very questionable. Studies such as these do not take into account important parts of the social wage such as Medicare, which I mentioned earlier. Also of great importance is the government's recent response to income inequality in the white paper, none of which has been taken into account. The initiatives that matter are the job compact, the single most important new feature for decreasing poverty. This provides training and/or employment for the long-term unemployed and is already working. I gave the figures the other day. A quarter or 90,000 jobs of the 400,000 job growth this year has been for the long-term unemployed. The policy basis of the compact is already proving to be propitious. The long-term unemployment decrease appears to be due at least in part to the big expansion in the targeted programs that will go to make up the compact when fully operational. Of the nearly 400,000 long-term unemployed people-that is, people unemployed for 12 months or more-290,000 are going to be individually case managed. We will be case managing 560,000 people over the coming year. They will be trained, given a job subsidy and put back into work. With the high retention rates a set of statistof those so trainedMr Richard Evans-What is the retention rate?",57
145,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I saw the other day in one of the programs a retention rate of 65 to 70 per cent. As a consequence, this is alleviating poverty at source for those who are not just unemployed but long-term unemployed. These are the very programs that those opposite would chop to pieces. They are the programs they want to hop into with cuts in government spending. What sort of front have those opposite got to be up here asking questions about the poverty line and poverty when unashamedly at the last election they were going to bump people off unemployment benefits after nine months and cut $10,000 million out of outlays to fund tax cuts. Every day at the front door of Parliament House we have the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition saying that the government should reduce the budget deficit by tackling government spending. What they mean is that they want to reduce government spending in areas of transfer payments, but particularly in the area of programs for the long-term unemployed. In another act of indecency they are trying to make a puny, lousy political point at the expense of those who are low paid or unemployed when they intend to actually hop into the programs that support these people. They will hop into them. They say every day that the government should be reducing the budget deficit. They do not say that the government should be lifting tax; they say that the government should be slashing spending. Ten years ago outlays were 30 112 per cent of gross domestic product. Today, if one looks at the underlying level of outlays, abstracting for unemployment benefits, one finds that they are around 24 per cent to 24112 per cent of GDP. They are down by six percentage points of GDP. Do you know what that is, John Howard? Twenty-four billion.",57
146,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know you are telling a Richardson. That is what I know about you.,58
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite these sorts of numbers, those opposite still want to cut outlays. What outlays are they? Payments to schools? Payments to the aged? Payments to the long-term unemployed? Of course they are. There is no other place to cut outlays. Do they want to cut payments to the states? No, they will not touch them. As a consequence, they want to hop into the long-term unemployed. Imagine those opposite representing themselves as having the interests of the low paid at heart when they have opposed every national wage increase since 1983 and when the member for Bennelong wants to put people on individual wage contracts to cut their wages further. They want flexibility downwards. They keep on attacking the safety net.",58
148,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I raise a point of order.,58
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If it is a point of order.,58
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a point of order, relating to standing order 145, so you sit down. The Leader of the Opposition asked a very concise, direct question unrelated to the Harding survey. It was based on figures from the ABS and sought an explanation from the Prime Minister about why it is that between 1976 and 1992 the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. For most of the answer the Prime Minister has totally ignored that. If standing order 145 means anything, you will require the Prime Minister to address the Leader of the Opposition's question.",58
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister also took up the challenge of an interjection from the Leader of the Opposition in respect of pointing out some substantive information. To that extent, the Prime Minister is in order.",58
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One could understand that if outlays of GDP were still around 30 per cent to 30 112 per cent of GDP. But down as they are, in the terms I mentioned, to around 24 per cent to 25 per cent of GDP, for you to be out there braying about public spendingknowing that that means cutting into transfer payments, payments to schools, payments under Medicare or payments to the aged-and then to be asking questions about the low paid and poverty is to be disingenuous in the extreme. This happens over and over again. Let me repeat a couple of important statistics in terms of social security payments. From March 1983 to September 1994 the following real increases were achieved: 14.6 per cent to single aged pensioners; 56.6 per cent-this is real and above the inflation rate-to single unemployed renting; and 36.5 per cent to sole parents renting.",58
153,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what Graham said to Bob.,58
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for Bennelong wants his personal explanation he better just be quiet.,58
155,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The other day we had the Leader of the Opposition talking about families and saying that it was the Fraser government that was paying family allowances directly to the mother. At the very same national conference where he made the remark, a resolution to develop policies and give families tax relief was put forward by the national executive and carried. We all know what tax relief means. It means payments generally to the husband. What that means is that those on the highest income get the greatest reward. Today the shadow minister for industrial relations gave us his views on family policy and called for a fresh start. He always gets a bit visionary when there is a whiff of mortality around the leadership. The thing about the member for Bennelong is that he hears voices and gets visionary. He gets on the radio always when there is a bit of mortality around the leadership. This was after he said-we heard it on the fourth episode of the program on the Liberals last week-that he was the most conservative leader the coalition had ever had. What would a country, with a massive transformation in its culture, which is embracing the Aboriginal community in a way it has never done and which is seeking to introduce these policies of change and seeking to clarify its identity to make the move into Asia, want or do with the most conservative leader the coalition has ever had? Mr Downer-This is outrageous.",58
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Opposition members-Sit down!,59
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,59
158,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What use would such a person be to Australia in 1994? Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 145, could you explain to the House and to the people of Australia who are listening how this is in any way relevant to the question which was asked?",59
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Menzies has raised a concern. I invite the Prime Minister to wind his answer up.,59
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude on this point. Disingenuous questions by people who have slavishly barracked for the rich and the rich only-this lot over here-against the low paid, who have opposed every wage increase since 1983, who want to put people on individual wage contracts and who want to rip away the social wage via the transfer payments need to be met with the utter contempt that they deserve. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the long answer from the Prime Minister he quoted extensively from a document on at least two occasions. Pursuant to section 321, I ask that it be tabled.",59
161,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are my notes and you cannot have them. How about that?,59
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Prime Minister been quoting from private documents? I think, from his comments, they were. Women",59
163,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that people are trying to cause divisions between women at home and women in the paid work force? What action is the government taking to assist Australian women? Is it intended that more will be done for Australian women?,59
164,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In his speech to the Liberal women's conference, the Leader of the Opposition said that Labor was biased in favour of working women and that the government has sought to drive a wedge between women in the home and those who work outside of it. But not everyone agrees with the Leader of the Opposition, including his shadow minister responsible for the status of women. The honourable member for Pearce is concerned that it is not the government which is being divisive but rather the Leader of the Opposition. Immediately after Mr Downer's address, the Sydney Morning Herald carried the following report: Mrs Moylan had warned that the coalition not cause divisions among women through policies dumping on women wanting a career. Good on you! Not only is Mr Downer divisive on this, he is wrong. It is not true that the government is biased in a favour of working women, but it is true that the government is biased in favour of low income families, as I have been saying over and over again today. Eligibility for government assistance is largely determined by the level of family income, irrespective of whether that income is earned by one or two parents. In the same speech on the status of women, the Leader of the Opposition reiterated his view that the ALP's decision to ensure that we have women candidates in 35 per cent of winnable seats by the year 2002 is discriminatory and patronising. According to a Saulwick poll this morning, 60 per cent of women do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition. What it is patronising to assume is that only 10 per cent of the women members of this House are members on the basis of merit: that is, the others had not enough merit to warrant membership of the House of Representatives. I made reference to the fact that, at his conference the other day, the Leader of the Opposition was out talking about the reform of the Fraser government, while we support paying family allowances directly to the mother. But then he is adopting motions to go back to the tax system for payments to families. The tax system invariably gives the greatest benefit to the highest taxpayer who is, in the main, the person who earns the income. Certainly in single income families, this is more often than not the male. The coalition would be back to the old days when family assistance went to the male earner in the work force, rather than directly rent-usually the mother-caring for children at home. Again we see this dichotomy of view about the interests of women. The government has extended the number of child-care places from 40,000 to well over a quarter of a million. We have also introduced a generalised child-care rebate. This sort of notion that the way to advance the interests of women in society is to adopt a political bias in favour of rhetoric which says that the policies of the government are biased in favour of working women is cynical in the extreme. The member for Bennelong is out there talking about his brand of tax policies when in fact, as we know, his policies-by his own self-admission-came from the most conservative leader the coalition has ever had. He wants to go back to that same sort of single notion of the nuclear family, with payments to the breadwinner-usually the husband. The utterances of the member for Pearce were correct. I compliment her on her forthright denunciation of the divisive views of the Leader of the Opposition.",59
165,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. Has the minister received any advice concerning the potential impact of the implementation of a single domestic aviation market with New Zealand on the earning capacity and profitability of Qantas? If so, does this advice indicate that a decision to honour the agreement with the New Zealand government would have undermined the price received for the Commonwealth's forthcoming Qantas float? Given the material nature of the effect of these matters on the value of Qantas, will the minister provide potential investors with a firm indication of the government's commitment to its 'open skies' policy prior to the issue of the prospectus for the forthcoming float?",60
166,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr Tim Fischer-Tell us about competition now.,60
167,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is from the two-airline policy specialists, who legislated for two to the pa- airlines. You were around then.",60
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,60
169,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The performance of those opposite on this question of the transTasmanian aviation arrangements could not have been better or put more strongly if they had been paid lobbyists for Air New Zealand. That is the truth of it. You performed one after another, particularly the Leader of the National Party, in there saying, 'What about New Zealand?' Let me say this: this government makes no apology for insisting that all the provisions under the memorandum of understanding are fully and completely complied with. The fact is that this does have some implications for Qantas. It does have some implications for Ansett. It has some real implications which are perhaps best reflected in looking at the future profitability projections of Air New Zealand. It is quite fair to say that Air New Zealand expected to do very handsomely as a result of the memorandum of understanding-not by competing equally with Qantas but, instead, by taking maximum advantage of on-flying ability; that is, carrying passengers to and from Australia internationally as well Qantas as cherry picking our Australian domestic routes. The fact is that all of the conditions of the MOU have not been complied with. We do not have the one aviation market that was envisaged in the MOU, nor do we have any real progress towards one market by way of airline equity between our two countries. Mr Tim Fischer-Ansett is flying domestically in New Zealand.",60
170,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here is the discovery award! This is what the Leader of the National Party had to say, and he has just repeated it here. In his press release last week, the Leader of the National Party said: Keating's underann will backfire. Mr Tim Fischer-That is right.",61
171,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the National Party made what I call an incredible statement: . . . both Qantas and Ansett have New Zealand domestic access and a fair amount of cherry picking of the New Zealand market which will be placed in jeopardy in any tit for tat. Mr Tim Fischer-Absolutely.,61
172,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely; you have heard him repeat it. The trouble with you is that you cannot tell the difference between a cherry and a lemon; that is the truth of the matter-and you are the Leader of the National Party. You have not realised that ours is a domestic market of 18 million people and theirs is 3'/2 million. You have not realised that, in all the years that Ansett has competed over there, it has yet to make a dollar. There you are talking about cherry picking in New Zealand! When will you get off? Let me say this: we will never be embarrassed nor will we resile from ensuring that Australia's interests are fully and completely protected, whether they be in bilateral relations or multilateral relations. In respect of this agreement, at the meeting this week the New Zealand Minister for Transport and I will be working to see if we cannot resolve this matter. But, as far as the impact on Qantas is concerned, clearly there will be some impact and clearly we are keen to see that the value of Qantas is not undermined, particularly in respect of the Australian mums and dads who will be investing in the Qantas float. The honourable member can rest assured that all of these matters will be fully considered and will be signed off in the public memorandum that will accompany the float of Qantas. National Training System",61
173,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of progress in achieving a national training system for Australia?",61
174,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I am pleased to say that there has been a huge breakthrough in developing a national training system for this country. At meetings that were held last week with state and territory education ministers, the Commonwealth secured agreement to implement, from 1 January next year, a single national system for training. It is called the Australian vocational training system. As a consequence of this, for the first time school leavers and industry will have a comprehensive structured national system of entry level training; and for the first time people undergoing training will get a nationally recognised certificate. Under one umbrella, as a result of this agreement, the new system consolidates and opens new pathways by which skills and competencies can be developed through education, training and workplace experience. The agreement involves new areas of opportunity between school and work, but it also allows people to continue learning throughout their working lives. I am pleased to say that industry is fully supportive of this agreement, which is based on nationally endorsed industry and enterprise standards. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia and the Metal Trades Industry Association have all given this initiative their strong backing. The agreement goes further because it will cut out duplication in course accreditation. As a result of this, standards and curriculum developed in one state can now be recognised and applied nationally. It will also assist the major expansion of places announced in the government's Working Nation statement. This agreement is a clear example of further progress on micro-economic reform. It shows that government is willing and able to respond to the needs of industry. It gives practical effect to the principle of mutual recognition, and it creates a national approach to skill formation across government and across education and training sectors. I commend the detail of the agreement to the House and hope that we do not see any silly statements coming from the other side. Yanda Airlines",61
175,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Why was the Scone Shire Council assured on 20 June of this year that the flying operations and airterm, worthiness of Yanda did not justify suspenCivil sion or cancellation of its air operation cate, yet on 31 October that airline's AOC was not renewed? Is it not a fact that the thing that changed was that the minister forced by the opposition's revelations about air safety chaos in Australia and the death of a number of people to finally put the safety of travellers above the commercial interests operators?",62
176,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This was a matter raised by the honourable member in this House back in May, and a matter which at that time. I referred to the Civil Aviation Authority for its consideration. As this House well knows, on not one or two but three separate occasions the honourable member refused to bring forward evidence when invited to do so. Mr Sharp-I tabled the documents in the parliament.",62
177,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not in respect of this. The only thing that you tabled was your accusations in respect of Airlink. Mr Sharp-No, I tabled the documents Yanda.",62
178,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I referred those documents immediately, and they are the subject of investigation right now. When the honourable member raised this matter in the House in May, Yanda was already under investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority. I am able to inform the House that the Civil AviaSydney tion Authority had identified deficiencies relation to aspects of the Yanda operation, including a maintenance control manual and the operations manual. I am further advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that individual deficiencies such as this rarely lead to a situation that would warrant suspension or cancellation of the air operator's certificate. Usually education and counselling are sufficient to eliminate less serious deficiencies. In the case of Yanda, the Civil Aviation Authority initiated action plans to eliminate the deficiencies, and the CAA allowed Yanda a short period to rectify the deficiencies. The company was given a deadline of 31 October 1994 when its AOC expired. The Civil Aviation Authority considered that, in the short safety levels were not jeopardised. The Aviation Authority advises that it had certifihoped Yanda would have been able to demonstrate a sustained period of compliance. only However, the Civil Aviation Authority conwas cluded that maintenance control, check and training regulatory breaches had continued. In the circumstances the Civil Aviation of Authority was not satisfied that Yanda had complied with the civil aviation regulations relating to safety. The CAA, in these circumstances, decided not to issue Yanda a new AOC. Yanda has a 28-day period in which to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision. I suggest to the honourable member and anyone else who has some problem with this process that they take it up with the parliamentary inquiry which I authorised to pursue all such allegations.",62

The remarks attributed to me in the article are themselves unexceptionable and quite accurate.What the article did was to infer very clearly that I had made the remarks in the wake of the outcome of the Liberal Party preselection for the federal seat of Boothby in South Australia. The truth is that the interview I had with the Herald reporter on which the story was based took place three weeks before the Boothby preselection. It was in no way related to the Boothby preselection, and the inference in the story that I had made these comments because of the outcome of the Boothby preselection was therefore not only totally incorrect but also deliberately vous and completely misrepresented my motives both as to timing and intent in making those remarks.",62

197,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! I think you are now debating the issue. You have shown mischie- where you have been misrepresented. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,63
198,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the conclusion of the grievance debate at 5.30 p.m. today. In so doing, I suggest, Mr Speaker, that you or your representative might like to contemplate at S.30 tonight further indulgence to members who want to speak about Dr Wilenski, Mr St John and Mr Lillico. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",63
199,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Mifepristone To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned showeth: (1) That the trials of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone (RU486) are against the public interest in that they use women as guinea pigs for trials of a drug which causes death to the unborn future citizens and adds undue risk to the health of women. (2) That when RU486 is used with a prostaglandin it exposes women to a disproportionate risk of pain, bleeding and more serious complications. (3) That when RU486 is used as a 'morning after pill' its effect is abortifacient in that it stops implantation of a human embryo, a future citizen, in the womb. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will legislate to ban the importation and use of RU486 in Australia. by Mr Brereton (from 86 citizens), Mr Tim Fischer (from 289 citizens) and Mr Ruddock (from 333 citizens). Family Law Act To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: I. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Beale (from 584 citizens) and Mr Neville (from 1,102 citizens). Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives call on the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1994/95 citizens of Australia Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mr Anderson (from 11 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the Australian Flag, also known as the ""Flag of Stars"", should: 1. not be changed without the consultation of the people of Australia through a Referendum 2. continue to portray Australia's heritage by displaying the Union Jack in the upper left hand comer which itself portrays the red cross of Saint George of England, the white diagonal cross of Saint Andrew of Scotland and the red diagonal of Saint Patrick of Ireland. 3. continue to portray our religion and our democratic system of government by retaining the Union Jack 4. continue to display the Southern Cross under which we live as it is only visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is believed to shine brightest over Australian night skies 5. continue to depict the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the large star at the bottom, each point of which represents the States and Territories of Australia. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: 1. By Act, Parliament ensure that the Prime Minister of Australia cannot change the Flag of Australia without the majority consent of the people of Australia. by Mr Cadman (from 49 citizens). Constitutional Monarchy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that they object to: The appointment of a committee to enable the establishment of a republic without any consultation with the people of Australia as to whether: (a) it was their preference to dispense with the Constitutional Monarchy; and (b) the composition of the committee should be evenly balanced in out look and not overwhelmingly biased towards a republic Your petitioners therefore pray that the House request the Government to desist from any action which is capable of deeply dividing the people of Australia. by Mr Cadman (from 11 citizens). Citrus Industry To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of certain Citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to our concerns regarding the : urgency to exempt from sales tax products containing 100% not from concentrate orange juice. In doing so your petitioners bring to your attention the devastation of the citrus industry caused by Government decisions to almost abolish (to 5%) the tariff applied to imported frozen concentrated orange juice, and to remove the sales tax concession from Australian orange juice content. The current return to growers from the sale of oranges for processing to concentrates is $10.00 per tonne, and this is and the effect it has on fresh fruit marketing, is destroying the viability of the industry creating both financial and social hardship not only for growers, but for surrounding communities. Your petitioners therefore respectfully urge that the House consider taking the necessary actions as listed to urgently improve the extremely poor financial position of citrus growers, and, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Forrest (from 1,614 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the House that the Federal Government and the Sate governments (except Tasmania) signed the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) in December 1992. The policy states: 'until assessments are completed, forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.' (NFPS. page 11) This obligation is being totally ignored by the NSW Government. A prime example is in the high conservation value Deua Wilderness in southern NSW. Despite the NFPS obligation, logging activities are continuing in both the Eastern and Western Deua Wilderness before the required assessments. This reckless approach to forest management threatens endangered species known to exist in the area. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to force the NSW Government to cease logging in the Deua Wilderness, and all other areas of high conservation value forest in the state. This will then allow assessments to be undertaken as required by the NFPS. by Mr Langmore (from 155 citizens). Cyprus The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: This petition of Australian citizens expresses its concern at the passing of 20 years since Turkey invaded and continues to occupy Cyprus. The world community has not shown a serious cornmitment resolving the occupation. The Turkish side according to the UN Secretary General's most recent report has shown 'lack of political will' to settle the issue. Your petitioners pray that the House will urge the Australian Government to: Call for an International Conference (comprising the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the special representative of the UN Secretary General, Republic of Cyprus (both Greek-Cypriots and TurkishCypriots), the guarantor powers of Cyprus (Britain, Greece and Turkey) and the European Union) to seek a settlement on the continued occupation of Cyprus. The Conference to deal with such areas as the demilitarisation of the island, guarantees on future security, reconfirmation that the UN recognises a single soverForests eignty, single citizenship and single international personality for Cyprus, demographic changes as a result of the 'settlers', removal of Turkish troops, hand over of Famagusta to the UN; and Call for the implementation of economic sanctions against Turkey for contemptuously ignoring the world community for 20 years in order to create a climate of political will; and Provide assistance to Australian citizens who are being denied access to their properties in the occupied area which constitutes an appropriation by Turkey of an Australian overseas investment-would Australia accept a similar situation were a large Australian enterprise involved; and Proscribe any request to have a representative office open in Australia for the illegal pseudo state of the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus; and Direct Government Business Enterprises of the Federal, State and Local Governments and recommend to Private sector enterprises to not undertake any trade with, or provide any assistance to, the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus, in accordance with UN resolutions and the recent European Court of Justice ruling. by Mr Leo MCLeay (from 956 citizens). Homeless Rate Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless allowance without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless allowance is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With the number of young people receiving youth homeless allowance increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless allowance and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Moore (from 92 citizens). Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of Australia points out to the House that the Government's family payments discriminate against single-income families: The Home Child Care Allowance is paid at a rate up to $30 per week to single-income families, whereas the Child Care Cash Rebate pays up to $62 per week for two-income families, The HCCA is subject to an income test from $5/week, whereas the CCCR has no income test, single-income families pay more income tax than do two-income families on the same income, and two-income families are generally better off financially than single-income families, and the impact of tax and social security increases the gap between single-income families and twoincome families; and that, in discriminating against single-income families, the Parliament is not recognising the value of work of full-time carers in the home and community. Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discrimination against single-income families in the tax and social security systems. by Mr Neville (from 231 citizens). Unemployed: Long Term To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: A petition organised by the Central Queensland Job Creation Association (Inc) draws the attention of the House to the unacceptable treatment of the long termed unemployed. Your petitioners therefore request the House to:Consider the millions of dollars being spent, importing forest products into this country. A tremendous amount of labour could be used in the state forests and all in the national interest, because forests improve soil fertility, water quality and the purity of our air. This available work would be a real boost to employment. We need to give our people an opportunity to earn a living and develop their potential, please change your attitude to those being displaced by mechanisation and technology. by Mr Neville (from 30 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the electors of the Division of Maranoa, draw to the attention of the House that Australia must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the Federation of its Sovereign States in 1901 and then being confirmed under the Flags Act (1953). We do so because: (a) It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language; (b) It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right; (c) It signifies the Christian ethic, friendliness, international goodwill; (d) It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen; (e) It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. Your petitioners therefore request the House that our present Australian Flag be not changed, replaced or diminished in any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 60 citizens). Austudy scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain Citizens of AustraliaDraws to the attention of the House the deficiencies in the current Austudy scheme. Your petitioners therefore request the House to, Address the inequities students of rural backgrounds face in the present Higher Education System. by Mr Sinclair (from 33 citizens). Refugee Status To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of House of Representatives in the Federal Parliament Assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia call on the House to support the applications of Li Shi Ping and Liu Xiu Ling for refugee status. After fleeing persecution in their homeland these two young people have suffered greatly and have been held in custody in Western Australia for approximately two years. Liu Xiu Ling is a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair and it would lacking greatly in compassion to send her back China in this state. We, the undersigned, request the release of two young people into the community where will receive friendship and practical support. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that will give this matter earnest consideration and petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 338 citizens). Austudy scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Citizens of Australiadraws to the attention of the House the deficienresult cies in the current Austudy scheme. Your petitioners therefore request the House Increase the rates of AustudY/Abstudy to levels comparative to social security benefits. by Mr Wakelin (from 76 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Aged Care",63
200,Mr LIEBERMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"lndi) (4.37 p.m.)I have been looking forward to raising this the matter concerning the crisis in aged care in Australia, the problems with people and relatives affected by dementia and also the plight of the unsung heroes in Australia-that is, those people who are caring for the ill, the aged and the disabled in their own homes. By way of brief background, 11.1 per cent of Australia's population is over 65 years of age. That represents 1.8 million Australians. Of those, about 75,000 Australians are currently in nursing homes. Those nursing homes are not able to provide the care that is needed the in every case, especially for those who suffer from the tragedy of dementia and associated problems. Nursing homes in my state of Victoria are currently being forced to take more and more patients with dementia but do not have the funds or the physical facilities to of China adequately care for them. It is also a tragedy that in Australia a large number of patients who are suffering from be dementia are at present being cared for into psychiatric institutions or organisations and many of them, regretfully, are being drugged these in order to control them when they should be they in an environment where they are given proper care and encouragement. In many you cases it is well documented that dementia your sufferers can live a reasonably happy and active life without being restrained or drugged if given the proper care. The other frightening element that I want to highlight today is the tragic error of this the government in the way it is approaching the provision of care for the aged and the disabled and the inequities that are arising as a of that. Mr Deputy Speaker, did you know that, if you stay at home and look after to, your aged mother or demented spouse or disabled or chronically ill child yourself, the government pays about $26.60 a week in domiciliary nursing care benefits plus a means tested carers pension of $159 a week? That is only if the person being cared for is over the age of 16 in certain circumstances. There are anomalies I will not have time to go into in that regard. If the relative or disabled person is placed in a nursing home, the government becomes financially involved to the extent of between $382 and $700 per week-that is taxpayers' money-in subsidies for the care and maintenance of the relative, friend or child involved. In some cases, if the relative is in receipt of a pension he or she can pay 87 per cent of that pension towards the costs of the nursing home. As you will see from those figures, there is an astronomical additional cost to the government in caring for people in nursing homes and institutions compared with the cost of providing some assistance to families and relatives for caring for their relatives at home. This leaves a very heavy burden of care on the invisible army of 1.5 million devoted relatives and friends in Australia who give their time and make many sacrifices to care for the chronically ill, the aged and the disabled persons in their own homes. Seventy per cent of the 1.5 million Australians in this invisible army are women. Tragically, research indicates that many of those carersthe unsung heroes, the invisible army-are themselves subjected to poverty, isolation and failing health because of the task they take unto themselves. It is true that some of those carers have contemplated suicide because of the pressure on them. Carers are the poorest and most ignored section of our community, yet they are doing a marvellous job for the people who cannot care for themselves, whether they be relatives or friends. I find it rather worrying to say the least this government, in developing policies for the care of the aged, people with dementia and disabled people, is steering the ship towards establishing provision of care that is far more expensive than the provision of care by carers in their own homes. I believe this is an urgent issue and the government is overdue in addressing it. Is this nation going to continue to provide financial incentives for people to put a relative or friend into a nursing home? The cost to the Commonwealth and the taxpayer is far greater if that happens. Or is it going to reexamine the ways in which it helps carers to stay at home and look after people at home? I believe it should. After all, it is true that most elderly and disabled people are far happier if they are able to spend their time with their relatives and friends at home. I know that in some cases it is not possible to continue to care for these people at home and when that happens the bullet has to be bitten and additional care in a hostel, nursing home or other type of facility must be provided. We have to have a dual system. It alarms me to look at the figures and see that the taxpayer through this government is being asked to support a system that encourages people to be placed in nursing homes rather than one that provides incentive and assistance to families to persevere for longer with their disabled or aged relative in their homes. What sort of a society are we if we provide a financial disincentive for home carers and a financial incentive for the transfer of aged people to institutions? I do not believe the Australian community wants to see that model develop, but it is the course this government is allowing health care and the provision of planning for aged and disabled people to take. I know of a family in Wodonga with a severely disabled daughter under the age of 16. Both mother and father have given up their work to care for their little daughter, who is very ill. It is only as a result of the 24-hour care provided by the mother and father that this little girl is still alive. The sacrifices this family is making to support their child at home are worth observing and certainly deserve commendation. These people that are being penalised by a too rigid system of allowances for parents with disabled children. Even their pensions or support allowances are means tested, so if they have a bit of money in the bank the interest on that is counted against their income. Yet ifthese parents give up the care of this child and the child goes into a hospital or institution, the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week cost of caring for this child in the institution would be, in my estimate, 10 to 15 times more than the pitiful amount now being paid to these parents to help them exist-to feed themselves and their other children, and to care for this little girl. I believe the government must urgently reexamine its policies in these areas and provide a much more flexible system of enabling parents and relatives to cope in a dignified way with looking after a child who, as I said, in any other circumstance would have to be placed in a much more expensive environment of care, fully paid for by the taxpayerand perhaps up to 15 times more expensive. (TIme expired) Hunter Electorate",67
201,Mr FITZGIBBON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hunter) (4.47 p.m.)As the coal grievances have been settled, and settled fairly I hope, and it appears that a victory has been achieved in the retention of the CIT, I ask myself: how can a federal member express a grievance when this Labor government is pouring millions of dollars into the Hunter Valley to improve the quality of life of its people? The minehunter project and other huge federal government projects in Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Port Stephens and Maitland will benefit the whole Hunter region and provide jobs. My own electorate of Hunter will benefit hugely from federal government funding designed specifically to provide care and improved opportunities for the people I am so very proud to represent in this national parliament. The level of funding my electorate has been receiving is not unprecedented. It has received a constant flood of dollars since this Labor government came to office and since I became the member. But the level of federal government funding is unprecedented when it is contrasted with the starvation funds the people of the Hunter electorate received during Liberal-National Party regimes. I hope every member and senator will visit the Main Committee room during the next couple of days to make themselves aware, through viewing the Hunter Challenge exhibition, of the new and strong developments, innovative and progressive developments, which are taking place in the Hunter. I refer briefly to a few of the wonderful improvements the federal government has provided for the people of my electorate during recent years. Merriwa, Murrurundi, Singleton, Kurri and Cessnock residents will benefit from eight new aged care hostels, all funded by the federal government. The federal government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the national highway through my electorate. Cessnock, Kurri, Maitland, Lochinvar, Greta, Branxton, Muswellbrook, Aberdeen, Scone, Quirindi and all other Hunter Valley towns are champing at the bit in anticipation of the benefits that the completed national highway will bring. Like all other areas of Australia, my electorate has its problems. Employment is a major problem. Unemployment is far too high, though falling. But unemployment is global, worldwide. This government leads the word with its sensible policies to destroy the blight of unemployment. While unemployment continues, the people of Australia can be certain of one thing: they will be cared for far more compassionately by this government than they would by those who sit opposite, should they ever manage to find their way by some misfortune back into government. The great Australian Labor Party will continue to act compassionately and provide fair welfare assistance and fair skills training to help the unemployed to get back into work. Another tragic problem that has my electorate and most other electorates in a terrifying vice is the harshest drought that has occurred in the lifetime of most of us. Every thinking Australian shares part of the agony our farmers are experiencing. But no farmer in Australia would be silly enough to blame a particular government for lack of rain. Despite the pain that rural Australia is reeling from, rural Australia gave unrestrained acclaim to the government's drought assistance package. It was recognised as the largest and most generous package ever given by any government in Australia's history. I return to the wonderful projects the government is funding not only in my electorate but in every electorate throughout Australia. In recent months I have visited numerous primary schools in my electorate. These schools were opened by a National Party figure or a Liberal figure because schools remain the prerogative of the state governments, but most of the money that went into those school upgradings was provided by the Labor government at the Commonwealth level. In regard to TAFE colleges, more than $4 million has been provided for an equine research centre in Scone in my electorate. All this money came from. the federal government. It was agreed just last week that the federal government will give $249 million for vocational training in New South Wales-not over five or 10 years but next year. Of that money, three quarters of a million dollars will go to Kurri TAPE for a rural skills centre on the campus of the Newcastle institute of technology. Last Friday in Cessnock I had the pleasure of opening a new $1 million CES office. Within a couple of months, also within Cessnock, we will be opening a $1 million plus new social security office. These developments have not just been confined to Cessnock. Muswellbrook has a new CES office and a new social security office. Recently I had the pleasure of attending a women's meeting, at which I enjoyed myself very much. They were delightful women and they made some fine speeches, although they came up with a couple of ideas which were not quite thought through. One woman said that all people should get the pension. Another woman said, 'We have been collecting to assist people affected by the drought and we have a huge stack of shoes down the back of the room.' She looked at me-I was sitting next to Senator David Brownhill-and said, 'Bureaucracy does not hold sway here. There is no income test here. There is no assets test here. So, if you need a pair of shoes, go and pick them up.' When it was my turn to speak I thanked the women for their ideas but pointed out that had Senator David Brownhill and member Eric Fitzgibbon quietly tiptoed down to the back of the room, gone through all the shoes, picked out a good pair each and trotted off into the day they would have said, 'Look at those two bloody greedy politicians' - and they would have been totally justified. Any thinking Australian realises the necessity for an income test, an assets test. No Australian believes that we should be giving the pension to millionaires. I think I managed to make that point quite well. However, that is not Tim Fischer's view. Up in Quirindi they are saying that the pension should be given to everyone, but what is Tim Fischer saying? The Leader of the National Party is saying that the pension should be given to no-one; that we should go down the Asian track, where the nuclear family looks after the extended family. A husband and wife are supposed not only to look after their own kids but also to look after grandma and grandpa as well. So there we have it; some people up in my electorate who would normally vote National Party want the pension for everyone and the Leader of the National Party wants the pension for no-one. In conclusion, I want to say thank you very much to Senator Nick Bolkus, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, who came up to my electorate on Sunday and made a very proud day for Greta, a small town in my electorate, when he officially commemorated the fact that for many years the former army camp at Greta was a migrant centre. We appreciate his visit very much-(TIme expired) Question Time",69
202,Mrs BISHOP,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance is the way question time is conducted and allowed to take place in this chamber. Today we saw the most disgraceful abuse of question time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and by others. We also saw the paucity of the answers. I would like to take them one by one. I would like to begin with the Prime Minister's answer on Cambodia and his comments on the Khmer Rouge when I interjected that it was this government that legitimised the Khmer Rouge. I would like to expand on that comment and on that interjection. I understand that the government is trying to push the line around the gallery at the moment that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) asked me to stop interjecting. He did no such thing. We had a conference about the way in which the debate was conducted when that sanitising process took place. I do not often find myself in agreement with a correspondent from London called Alex Mitchell who writes in the Sun-Herald, but on this occasion he has some worthwhile comments to make. He writes as follows: In the wake of the cold-blooded murder of Australian David Wilson and his friends in Cambodia, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans is calling for the trial and punishment of those responsible. Alex Mitchell's words are: Excuse me while I vomit. He continues: Wilson's killers are members of the Khmer Rouge which seized power in 1975 and murdered more than one million people. The United Nations Human Rights Commission reported that the Khmer Rouge regime had carried out lithe worse (genocidal crimes) to have occurred anywhere in the world since Nazism."" But in the late 1980s, Evans embarked on a Cambodian ""peace process"". Central to this initiative was the re-invention Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge as a legitimate ""faction"" in the Cambodian politics. Thus yesterday's mass murderers were transformed into diplomatic players, if not honourable then at least tolerated. The UN peace plan, supported by Australia, dropped all references to Khmer Rouge ""genocide"" and merely referred to ""policies and practices of the recent past"". Those of us who protested about the sanitising of the Khmer Rouge were ridiculed by the pathetic bunch of sycophants who pose as foreign relations experts. When we said peace could only be guaranteed in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge was defeated militarily, there was further hilarity from the foreign relations lobby. If the resurgent Khmer Rouge is prepared to execute westerners while under the fun glare of international publicity, what do you think they will do to democratic opponents who live in areas facing their creeping control? One lasting image of this whole gruesome business is Evans visiting a Khmer Rouge base two years ago and pinning a gold kangaroo badge on a Khmer soldier's uniform. Journalist John Pilger records in his book, Distant Voices, that Evans was questioned about the incident and replied: ""The young Khmer Rouge cannot be blamed for what happened in the mid1970s."" I wonder if the Wilson family-or other Australians for that matter-agree. I still stand by what I wrote a week prior: it is the business of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to look after the interests of Australians first and foremost. I first made that comment in relation to the way in which the plight of the Gillespie children was dealt with. This is a very different circumstance but the duty of the foreign affairs minister is still to look after the interests of Australians first. There were many of us in the opposition at the time the plan was floated, with all the aggrandisement and all the claims that this could end up with a Nobel prize, who disagreed with the policy of in any way, shape or form legitimising the Khmer Rouge. I stand by my interjection today. We heard the diatribe, fantasy and fairy tales of the Prime Minister as he told the people of Australia that they had never had it so good and how successful his policies had been. Tell that to struggling workers who are trying to meet the new mortgage repayments on their of houses since their interest rates have gone up. Tell that to people who are in small business struggling to stay in existence. It is a funny thing, is it not, that the Australian people do not understand how Bob Menzies, whom the Prime Minister likes to deride-and perhaps we are starting to see the real reason-who gave great service to this country retired unable to buy a house that his constituents thought was decent for a former Prime Minister to live in. They put together and bought him a house which he then put in trust when he and Dame Pattie had finished living in it so it would be given to institutions. How different is that from a Prime Minister who has mismanaged this economy to make the Australian worker pay? But the Prime Minister is rich. He is rich enough to buy a mansion worth $2.2 million. There are no concerns for the rich Prime Minister, just lots of problems for the working poor. He had the hide to get up here today and talk about the irrelevance of the poverty test and the poverty line. We also heard from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who tried to tell us that the entire fault of the fiasco that we are having in civil aviation lies with the opposition. He is the minister. Being the minister means you are in control, you are the person who is able to control the authority that safeguards our air safety. Do not say you are at arms length, Minister, because you have already managed to stand down the Chief Executive Officer. It is rather like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. But to stand there and say that no action was taken against Yanda Airlines between May and October because a member of the opposition did not give you access to material that he had when you, as the minister, could get it from your authority any day or hour you wished simply will not wash. Being minister under a Westminster system means you are responsible. All the braying in the world that it was somebody else's fault simply will not wash. We then heard from the Minister for Human Services and Health, Carmen Lawrence, who will not have a debate and will not enter into a debate any time or anywhere. Let us look at her record and at what passes for policy making. Carmen Lawrence's idea",70
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to the minister by her correct title.,72
204,Mrs BISHOP,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"What passes for policy making for the Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), is to call a press conference and issue some sort of wish list about changes she wants to make in the health insurance area. Will she be tested on them? Will she be questioned about them? Will she debate them? No - The substance Did I bring in an MPI into this chamber in order to debate the issue? Yes. Did the Minister for Finance and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) stand up and call on government business so she did not have to debate it? Yes. Did I bring in an MPI the next day in an attempt to have a debate brought on? Yes. Did the government that day bring in one of its own motions and-surprise, surprise!-did the Speaker prefer the government's to mine? Yes. Have I been scheduled to speak on the same platform at various conferences, the latest of which was the Private Hospitals Association conference? Yes. Were we then to have been on a forum where questions and answers could have taken place? Yes. Did she accept that invitation? Yes. Did she pull out the week before? Yes. Have there been opportunities for her to be invited onto television and debate the questions? Yes. As late as yesterday on Meet the Press she was invited to debate her changes. Did she accept? No. We will see. We will persevere and try to offer opportunities for the minister to attempt to justify her so-called package of reforms which are still to be negotiated. Her department is busy telling the world that we will see the legislation before Christmas and we will debate it next year. The funny thing is that it is not on the list of legislation we can expect in this session. We need to have much more accountability of this government. What passes for question time with the failure to uphold decent points of order, to have decorum and to have proper answering of questions is not the way in which our system is supposed to answer. Until such time as we get some accountability, until such time as ministers are held accountable in this chamber by those who are the critics, they should not be cowered into submission by a Prime Minister who uses abuse instead of logic. It is a sad day when we have to use grievance time to make a point that the way in which this place is conducted is simply not good enough. National Identity",72
205,Mr SAWFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"port Adelaide) (5.07 p.m.) of my grievance today is the building of a national identity and the identification of the particular national policies that will contribute most strongly to the building of that national identity. With the year 2001 and the centenary of Federation only seven years away, it is I believe timely to debate these matters and bring them onto the national agenda. To develop a national identity, national policies require coherence and inclusion and a theoretical framework that actually works. Labor governments in the past have attempted, not always deliberately so, to build a national identity. It happened in the period of reconstruction after the Second World War. The Snowy Mountains scheme is a resultant major icon of that reconstruction. It happened again in 1983 when Hawke in the election speech spoke about national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction. It happened with One Nation in 1992 focusing on national infrastructure and again in 1994 with Working Nation focusing on the long-term unemployed. Intertwined with One Nation and Working Nation, there has been debate on the republic, the flag, native title and the preparations for the centenary of Federation. There is no doubt that those four issues are certainly important in the evolving development of an Australian national identity. It is therefore pertinent to ask the fundamental question as to whether the majority of the Australian people consider those four issues as the unifying themes necessary to build a national identity. My short answer is yes, no and maybe. In other words, the response is somewhat confused. However, I do believe there are logical reasons why this is the case. Human beings, such as all of us in here and outside, crave vision and consistent and coherent behaviour. All human behaviour can be described within a trinity of ideas, strategies and outcomes. Of course, the words 'ideas', 'strategies' and 'outcomes' can be substituted with other words. 'Ideas' can be 'rationale', 'policies', 'philosophy', 'vision' or 'goals'. 'Strategies' can be 'procedures' or 'process', and 'outcomes' can be 'programs' or 'tasks'. Human endeavour will not be as successful if part of the trinity is missing or if the trinity is not coherent. Coherent policy development demands vision and ideas. To make sense of any vision, a translation process to coherent strategies and procedures needs to occur. Then and only then can identifiable outcomes be spelled out. We can all learn from the past to more effectively plan for the future and, in the process, include the overwhelming majority of Australians. In terms of postwar reconstruction, national identity was a side issue. Basically, the whole program was outcome driven. Ideas and strategies were not the main game. However, it did leave a great legacy and icon in the Snowy Mountains scheme. I contend that Hawke's election speech in 1983 was not ideas driven. Reconciliation and recovery are strategies and, obviously, reconstruction is an outcome. That is why, although initially very attractive, it was never going to be sustained as the basis for developing a national identity. One Nation in 1992 was certainly ideas driven. Unfortunately, in my view, it lacked coherent strategies that could be understood by the nation. This inevitably led to what was perceived as a confused set of outcomes. Working Nation in 1994 was a response to long-term unemployment. It was certainly coherent in terms of ideas, strategies and outcomes. It could have been about building a national identity but it was not. The approach taken with Working Nation was one of synthesis rather than analysis. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with taking a synthesis approach, but there is a very big difference if you are trying to promote a national identity. Synthesis, by its very nature, excludes. Analysis includes. Synthesis is identifying a part of an idea and then maybe or maybe not working towards a bigger picture, but without knowing what the big picture really is. As an approach, that is its great weakness. By contrast, analysis is identifying the whole idea and then identifying the parts that make up the whole. In other words, whatever is being discussed is always related to the bigger picture. To conceive a national identity, the theoretical framework must be by analysis. It must be ideas driven, it must have strategies coherent with the vision and it must have identifiable outcomes. The next question to ask is: where do you apply the focus for identifying unifying themes that will build a national identity? I believe that that focus is fairly straightforward. It should focus on the Australian people, the Australian national assets and a productive future for all Australians. The next question to ask is: what are the national portfolio areas to best address that focus? Again, I believe they are fairly straightforward. If we are talking about the Australian people, it will be education; if we are talking about the Australian national assets, we are talking about the environment; and, if we are talking about a productive future for all Australians, we are talking about the economy-in particular, transport and communications. As I see it, Australians want a coherent view of the future-one in which they can participate. The year 200 1 can be the most significant celebration in our history. Symbols are certainly important but they are only part of the story. I am quite confident that Australians will respond to a long-term vision for this country. As a nation, we need to initiate a major visionary, technological, scientific venture. The project should unify and more than likely will be pretty basic, concentrating on water, energy, waste, urban and regional development, transport, environmental management and technology, and food production. For example, if we could invent a sewerage system that did not use water and could be applied to an urban environment, we would become the richest people on earth. Australians will respond enthusiastically to a vision of future icons. That scientific advance would focus not only on research and development but also on manufacturing and marketing on a global scale. There has been a revolution in education in the last 11 years under this Labor government. There are 533,000 students in higher education and 1.8 million students in further education and TAFE, and year 12 retention rates are near 80 per cent. But one group-the fiveto 15-year-old age group-could rightly be described as the forgotten people in the Australian community. The expenditure on that group-which is mainly the responsibility of the states-has fallen dramatically, particularly in the last five or six years. That makes the education area weak. It is perhaps a poor investment in the future in terms of federal investment in higher and TAFE education. In terms of the environment, environmental technology and management is regarded to be worth a world market of $US400 billion by the end of this decade. The current value is $US200 billion. Australia's share of that is that it produces some $US200 million and imports $US800 million. The Japanese have a program called new earth 21. They hope to be the world leaders in environmental management and technology by the year 2000. It is an area in which Australia should play a strong role. Germany and the United States are big players in that area and Australia should be a strong player, too. When you look at transport in this country, you sometimes wonder why we, as a trading nation, carry only 71/2 per cent of our own trade and why our international carrier, ANL-the only participant in international containerisationcarries 3112 per cent. They are issues that, along with transport, need to be addressed. To conclude, I repeat the main points I have made. Australia needs, wants and is ripe to build its own unique national identity. The approach must be by analysis, not synthesis. There must be a vision. The strategies that evolve need to be congruent with the vision, and the outcomes must be identifiable and congruent with the vision and strategies. The focus should be on the Australian people, the Australian national assets and the Australian view of the future. The policy areas that will best assist the building of a national identity are education, the environment and the economy-in particular, transport and communications. I thank the House. Cranbourne: Telephone Services",72
206,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Isaacs) (5.17 p.m.)I would like to grieve today about many of the disadvantages facing Cranbourne residents and businesses in their use of Australia's telephone system. For many years, there has been both an actual cost and a perceived disadvantage in locating a business in Cranbourne, since the area is partially in the 059 and the 03 telephone zones. Many of Cranbourne's residents are young and first home buyers. They might have previously lived with their parents in suburbs like Sunshine or Eltham and now be faced with additional telephone costs to contact their families in the Melbourne telephone zone. Given that the latest Department of Social Security figures show that there are at least 3,500 newstart and jobsearch beneficiaries in a labour force of 40,000, any disincentive to firms locating within the city of Cranbourne means that employees or job seekers incur high transport costs, often having to travel to distant suburbs of Melbourne for employment. As a result, many Cranbourne households must have two cars. This problem will be only partly resolved with the late December opening of the electrified rail link, because not all transport needs can be met by the public transport system. When phone calls made using Telecom as the carrier go beyond the area covered by the Clayton, Croydon and Dandenong exchanges, they are charged at community call or STD rates. I note that Optus is now planning to offer timed local calls, which may be of some use to local businesses or residents if they typically make many short calls. Optus has stated that its rates will be less than 25c a call when available from 1996 or thereabouts. However, this particular Optus initiative will not really solve the problem of Cranbourne businesses and residents making lengthy calls into, say, the centre of Melbourne. My office recently had some discussions with Telecom. It may commence trials of what it calls its Reachout 100 plan this month. This plan, if approved by Austel after Telecom has submitted it, will allow customers to pay 25c per call for a local call and a flat rate of $1 for a call within 100 kilometres of the customer's home exchange. Telecom tells me that it is considering introducing a new plan more relevant to Cranbourne and similar outer suburban areas called Reachout 75. It will again be a mix of a fixed local call fee of 25c, together with a fee of perhaps 50c or 55c for calls beyond the local area and up to 75 kilometres away from the Cranbourne exchange. Last financial year, the government creamed off $834 million in tax receipts from Telecom and $738 million in dividend payments, or almost half the amount of the second round of supposed tax cuts proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that were put on the never-never. The cost to Telecom of these new tariffs is a lot less than the yearly payments the government receives from Telecom. On 30 August, Austel disallowed a previous effort by Telecom to introduce what it also called a Reachout 75 tariff, which was then structured on the basis in effect of a flat untimed 37c charge for every call within 75 kilometres. Effective competition must occur among Australia's telecommunications providers. The second carrier, Optus, is not yet profitable, although that is in line with its business plan. Vodafone and resellers such as AAP Telecommunications are growing quickly but are still only tiny by comparison with Telecom. An umpire like Austel has to be vigilant to ensure that Telecom does not abuse its still very large amount of power over both residential and business markets. However, I was a little intrigued to see that on 30 August Austel issued a media release after disallowing Telecom's first attempt at introducing a Reachout 75 service. Just over 30 per cent of the customers surveyed by Telecom in Cranbourne had expressed interest in taking up this proposed tariff option, as it was then known. In that release, Austel's acting chairman, Neil Tuckwell, said that one of the reasons Austel disallowed Reachout 75 was that it placed a constraint on the consumer's choice of preferred long distance carrier. But he also said that Austel's decision did not preclude further tariffs which may have some of the features of Reachout 75. My discussions with Austel since then indicate that there is a pretty good chance that it will allow this new Reachout 75 tariff under the Telecommunications Act 1991. Austel must make a decision on a tariff within 15 working days of a carrier's submitting a suggestion, although another phone company can object. I commend Telecom for being innovative in developing this new proposal to bring down the cost of calls for Cranbourne residents and Cranbourne businesses. Together with some of the good deals on offer from Optus, Vodafone and others, it will help to reduce Cranbourne residents' cost disadvantage. I am still concerned that Cranbourne cannot enjoy complete local call access to the rest of the Melbourne metropolitan area. I understand Telecom's argument that existing boundaries for local calls are allegedly only exceeded in terms of areas covered by those in Greater London. Telecom also says-and probably rightly-that, if it were to extend local call boundaries in Melbourne, it would have to do so in Brisbane and Sydney. Australia's population density is much lower than London's. Perhaps it is time for the government to somehow require Telecom to provide a local call area where populations expand quickly to outer suburbia as part of a community service obligation for which a specific budget payment could be made. The shadow minister for communications and the arts has said that, whatever form telephone ownership takes under a coalition government, existing community service obligations will be maintained. At present, though, the question still remains why Cranbourne's 45 rail kilometres from Melbourne is not wholly within the Melbourne 03 zone when Berwick's 44.5 kilometres from the city is. Half a kilometre can certainly mean a lot of difference in telephone call costs. On 19 October, I drew the attention of members to the discriminatory price increases by Yellow Pages for areas where it faces telephone book competition, such as Melbourne, and areas where it does not, such as the 059 area, of which most of Cranbourne forms a part. I placed an order for Yellow Pages telephone directories for the 059 area in April 1994. When I had to look up a particular name in these Yellow Pages, I noticed that after page 192 my copy suddenly jumped to page 321. After continuing in order to page 384, page 257 suddenly appeared until page 560 at the end. It would have been bad luck if a consumer were trying to find gates, fencing materials or safety glasses or a business wanted to clean its grease traps, because these 64 pages were missing. On many occasions, printing or binding errors would be picked up by the printers, proofreaders or quality control officers. Generally, Telecom's printers, Wilke Directories of Clayton, do a good job. Mr Kerry Kinnane, Telecom's directories manager at Box Hill, has been courteous in trying to track down just how many books have been affected. It is one more reason for businesses in Cranbourne to be a little annoyed. Some of these potential customers who receive a particular book might look up another category that has not been omitted or use an alternative way of finding a business or service. So companies advertising in the Yellow Pages lose the effective chance to service those customers. In the worse cases, as Mr Wally Rothwell of the Australian Telecommunication Users Group says, firms that are omitted from the Yellow Pages go out of business, so it really does not matter if Yellow Pages offers them free TV or radio advertising. While I grieve for the problem Cranbourne residents and businesses face with the extra costs incurred in their telephone bills, I hope that these differentials will reduce over the next year as new tariffs are gradually introduced by Telecom, Optus and other service providers. Law and Order",74
207,Mr QUICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the short time left to me, I would like to raise the issue of crime in the community. For too long, a concern for law and order in the community has been considered a concern of the conservative side of politics. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was lampooned as the province of retired colonels urging a good thrashing for the young scoundrels. Then, despite the manifest failure of Australian governments to prepare this country for its future, it could at least be said that this was a peaceable and law abiding nation. As a result, progressive opinion gave little weight to calls for greater police powers or for tougher judicial action against offenders. We in this place can no longer justify the luxury of this prejudice against crusaders against crime. Indeed, the wider community has long abandoned it. The recent nationwide Bulletin AGB MCNair poll in early September showed that crime is the single greatest anxiety of ordinary Australians. It is of real concern to 72 per cent of Australians, which is a rise of 20 points since 1986 and seven points in the last 18 months. It is the issue of main concern to 21 per cent of Australians, which is a figure that is up by half since 1992. In my own research in my electorate, constituents have nominated as their leading concern not health, employment, education, housing or the environment but crime. Their fear is not merely a general uneasiness, and it is not merely based on media exposure of the issue; it is coming from personal experiday ence. In fact, I can speak from a recent encounter with crime in my suburb. Only a few Saturday nights ago, I witnessed an attempted break-in at a house opposite mine. Even worse was the use of a lO-year-old boy to check if the house was empty. This occurfollowing red close to 11 0' clock at night. Calls detailing crimes against my constitudents, ents come into my office on what has become virtually a daily basis. Anecdotes abound. Residents who have been burglarised while at a mother's funeral have been hit again within a week as soon as replacement goods are acquired. The result is that the victims are now uninsured and have been forced to sell their home and move to a less threatening suburb. One resident realised that two doors down was mowing the lawn with a mower which had been stolen along with $3,000 worth of goods only two days earlier. Having called the police to attend, he discovwas ered that the culprit was alerted via a police scanner and disposed of the incriminating evidence before the police arrived. These are not urban myths. These are two of many experiences of my constituents whom I have spoken to and whose fear is real. The life. suburb of Rokeby in my electorate, which is on Hobart's eastern shore, has 1,300 resiequality. dences. In September of this year there were 90 burglaries. At this rate, every houseused (Time expired)",76
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," where Order! It being 5.30 p.m., in accordance the resolution of the House earlier today, debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA St John, Mr Edward Henry, QC Lillico, Mr Alexander Elliot Davidson Wilenski, Dr Peter, AC, AO Debate resumed.",77
209,Mr BILNEY,CONDOLENCES,"Kingston-Minister for health. Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)-It is with great sadness that I rise to speak, on indulgence, on the death on Thurslast of an extraordinary man, Dr Peter Wilenski AC. I first knew Peter in the days when we were student politicians together. He was the President of the Sydney University Students Representative Council and I was the president of the same body in Adelaide. In the year, he went on to head the National Union of Australian University StuNUAUS. He was the president and I was the international vice-president. I mention these matters because I believe it was in those very early days that one saw the great themes and the great passions which would come to dominate Peter's life and to which he devoted his life, to the extraordinary benefit of this country and to the foundation and enhancement of many aspects of our contemporary the man Australian civilisation. Of those themes, perhaps the most striking to me at that time, being an Adelaide boy who had really never moved out of Adelaide, Peter's internationalism. He was deeply committed to the idea of international cooperation to solve problems in the world. He was deeply active in those causes and in enlisting others to them. I was so enlisted and to him I really owe much of what I have done in my Peter was deeply committed to the idea of He was of course Jewish and came to Australia at the age of about four. He often to tell the story of how at the age of two he took his parents from Lodz in Poland, the pogroms were well and truly on, with and brought them through China and India, the finally ending up in Australia. He believed in equality between races. We both joined the Labor Party at about the same time. Why? Because the Labor Party had a plank of White Australia. We joined it in order to amend that plank, which we, along with a great number of other people, succeeded in doing in the fullness of time. Peter's views about women were very much too feminist for those days of machismo amongst students, of which we were all guilty but he less than most. Peter was also committed to He graduated in medicine and I graduated in dentistry. We both had similar views about a society in which access to health services was effectively restricted by one's wealth. That was a cause to which he devoted time as well. The third great thing which dominated his life was the idea of public service. It never really occurred to him that he should go out into the world of business or the profession of medicine, in which he graduated first. He saw government and public service as a way of changing lives of disadvantaged people and of creating opportunities. I am sad to say that this concept has been lost in some ways in the Public Service. But he devoted his life to making the Public Service that relevant engine of reform and innovation. Peter pursued these themes not with bitterness or invective but as a gentle man whose main weapons were reasoned argument, research, writing and a devastating wit. He had a sense of humour which I found enchanting and which was often a better weapon than anything I could have thought of. Quite soon after I met him we were elected by this fine body the National Union of Australian University Students to be delegates of a body called NYCA, the National Youth Council of Australia, which had a membership with an average age of about 60, I dare say. I remember the Boy Scouts' representative was certainly over 70. The membership was more or less equally divided between, on the one hand, bodies of the persuasion of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)that is, the Boys Brigade, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides and so forth, who believed in a monarchy forever-and, on the other hand, those who were of a religious bent, such as the Student Christian Movement and the Young Catholic Workers. The proceedings at this meeting began with a very long debate on how proceedings at the meeting should begin. One camp said that we should begin with the playing of the national anthem, which at that time was God Save the Queen. Another camp believed that there should be a prayer, but that camp split into two over whether the prayer should be a silent prayer or a prayer that everybody said. After this had gone on for about three-quarters of an hour, Peter got up and said, 'Look, the students of Australia have a compromise to suggest. We suggest that there should be a prayer, but it should be a silent prayer and, while the silent prayer is on, you can play God Save the Queen.' Naturally, this turned everybody into passionate opponents of the National Union of Australian University Students, but it certainly exposed the pomposity that had gone on. Peter devoted his life to pricking pomposity and cant with that dry humour and wit. I will not speak about his subsequent career to any great extent because I am sure others will. He went on to become the Chairman of the Public Service Board, a key adviser in the reform of the New South Wales, and not least the Tasmanian, public service. He was the Ambassador to the United Nations where he established the Wilenski Group, which set about to reform that Augean stable of an institution. Peter became the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I joined that department in 1966 and he joined it in 1967. I remember him remarking to me at that time that he did not believe that a Jewish refugee whose name ended in 's-k-i' would ever get far in such an Anglo-Celtic institution, as it was then. In the end, he became the secretary to that department. It is a matter of the most extraordinary sadness that his illness prevented him from running it and changing it in a way that would make it ever more relevant. That is not to suggest that I do not think that has not happened already. He was a Sydney person first, last and always. He was elected on his sick bed with a record vote to the Sydney University Senate, something that gave him great pleasure, just as his elevation to be a Companion of the Order of Australia gave him great pleasure. The one thing at which he was not successful was acting. I remember he was in Adelaide at a time when the Adelaide University's Footlights Club put on a very expensive production of Hamlet, with which I was associated. The entire cast managed to get the flu on the night before opening night, so we had people reading parts. Dr Wilenski, who was staying with me at that time, was obliged to be a soldier to come on carrying a spear. He did that badly. I recall that one of his duties was to come on at the death of Hamlet and be one of those people who call1lied Hamlet off. If ever there were an epitaph that I would like to read into the parliamentary records, it is the lines that Horatio speaks on the death of Hamlet: Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing the to thy rest! My deepest sympathies to Jill, Katy and Michael.",77
210,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES,"I rise-in a very small way, amongst other things-to echo the comments of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). The obvious sincerity of his comments about Peter Wilenski reflects great credit on both of them. I knew Peter Wilenski extremely slightly when we both served on the university Senate-he in an august position; I as a mere student representative. I have to say that, while I did not always agree with him-in fact I nearly always disagreed with him-his contributions were remarkable for their intellect and for their verve. Obviously, Australia has lost a very significant human being with his passing. In particular, I wish to pay tribute to a predecessor of mine as member for Warringah, Mr Ted St John, who held the seat between 1966 and 1969. In a short but remarkable career he made quite an impact on public life. There were two issues which, I guess, live at this distance. The first was his championing of the cause of the victims of the Voyager disaster. He believed that an injustice had been done to those people. He proclaimed that injustice loudly, and for proclaiming that injustice he was widely reviled. Yet, in the end, injustice it turned to have been. Ted St John deserves the gratitude of all those people, but really he deserves the gratitude of all Australians because the ultimate function of this place is to ensure, in so far as we are able, that justice is done to all our fellow Australians. There was another matter for which he entered the headlines and that was in respect of the standards of personal behaviour of the then Prime Minister. While by today's lights his strictures seem somewhat puritanical, by the same token it is very important that we maintain the highest standards of decorum in the highest offices of the land. It is as relevant today as it was then that we have the very best possible behaviour from our Prime Minister. On leaving public life he did not lose interest in public affairs. In 1975 and 1976 he engaged in lively public debate on certain constitutional events that took place on 11 November 1975. He maintained an interest in public affairs up to the last months of his life. I recall reading in the Manly Daily a letter from Ted St John in which, amongst other things, he remarked on the importance of remedying an act of great environmental vandalism, that is, draining Lake Pedder. He was a maverick. He was a noteworthy maverick. We cannot have too many mavericks in public life, but we certainly need a few. Ted St John was one. I think we need more blithe spirits in this House in order to maintain its dynamism and its humanity.",79
211,Mr LANGMORE,CONDOLENCES,"I rise in this condolence debate to honour Peter Wilenski. It is very unusual for the House to have condolence motions for public servants, but both Peter Wilenski and Sir Geoffrey Yeend were public servants of outstanding quality. Peter Wilenski was a particularly outstanding public-spirited Australian. He worked with dedication and determination for the common good. No higher praise can be given to anyone in public life. One of the outstanding things about Peter was his capacity to move between sectors. A number of people have remarked on that fact. It is worth noting again that he began in medicine, he was active in student politicsout this is where I, like the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), first knew of him-he was a fine scholar, he was an absolutely outstanding public servant, he made a very major mark in international relations and, if circumstances had been different, he would have been a member of this House. He was a polymath, a renaissance man. He was a natural intellectual. He was thoughtful, creative, original, and one of the few people whom one could continually read with and learn new insights. Some of his contributions have been mentioned by others, but one of those that has not been mentioned was his contribution to the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which was perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous study of the Australian Public Service that has ever been made. He was an outstandingly fine professional public administrator-a calling which does not receive the same affirmation now as it once used to. It is important to reassert its importance. It was impressive to hear praise from members of the opposition earlier. That indicates that, while having strong commitments, he was also perceived as having the capacity to be a dispassionate public administrator. He was the only Companion of the Order of Australia that I know of who received the award for work for social justice. I think that demonstrates that the people who nominated him understood well the contribution he made. His national contributions in employment whilst chair of the Public Service Commission were tremendous. One notable point that has been made and which is worth emphasising again was his commitment to gender equity. This was a very important contribution. One contribution he made to international relations which has not been mentioned is that he was one of the founders of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. He did some of the original work in 1974 and 1975 when AIDAB was being set up. He was also behind the establishment of the National Centre for Development Studies at the ANU. The minister who just spoke knows well that contribution. I was reading a report yesterday on the need to reform the United Nations. An important part of that report was quotations from a report of a committee that Peter Wilenski chaired whilst Australian ambassador to the United Nations. He is remembered at the United Nations as a major innovator and for the quality of his work. He was highly regarded there and by his own department. When talking recently about an issue with members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, they said, 'We should ask Peter about that.' Even knowing how sick he was, they were still seeking his advice. He was a very cultured man. He may not have been able to act, but he had a fine and deep appreciation of the arts. One of my memories of him was going with him in New York one afternoon to see a marvellous exhibition of Velazquez at the Metropolitan and of Edward Hopper at the Guggenheim. He was a very warm man, shy in some ways, but he had a great range of friends. I think some of these condolence speeches demonstrate that well. He was a man of great dignity. The dignity and courage he showed during his terrible and long sickness is a clear indication of that. I join with others in sending my wholehearted sympathy to Jill and their children. I conclude by saying that his inspiration will live on in those who knew and admired him.",79
212,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to say a few words about Ted St John and then a few more words about Peter Wilenski. I came to know Ted St John in the 1960s because he was very interested in a number of causes that I was involved in. He was very concerned about the question of civil liberties and censorship. He was also very concerned about the death penalty and was a strong campaigner in the Liberal Party for its abolition. As was quite correctly said by the present honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Ted St John was a maverick in this House. He inflicted very great harm on John Gorton, the then Prime Minister. Temperamentally, they were so dramatically different. There was a puritanical streak in Ted St John which made it very difficult for him to understand what made John Gorton tick. I was surprised by a newspaper comment at the end of the week that said that virtually no politician had attended his funeral service. If I had been in Australia last week, I certainly would have attended. I had a high regard for his tremendous integrity. He was one Liberal, like Malcolm Fraser, who first took up the whole question of South Africa and the appalling abuse of human rights there. He was involved in that from the 1960s. He was president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists from 1961 to 1973. He was a remarkable man, a frequent correspondent of mine with a fierce independence of mind in a variety of areas. I think the parliament misses that; we ought to have more people of his quality. I should, in passing, make reference to Sir Geoffrey Yeend who, again, was a very distinguished public servant and made a large contribution to this nation-not just as the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but also because of his interest in education. He became the chancellor of the Australian National University. He had not been involved in that for very long before he had to give it up because of his ill health. I want to say something about Peter Wilenski that other members have not mentioned. Last Friday in Paris, UNESCO's executive board heard a tribute from the Director-General and a response from Australia's ambassador to France and to UNESCO, Alan Brown, followed by a minute's silence. The fact that an international tribunal with 51 people from around the world wanted to pay tribute to this Australian public servant demonstrated very dramatically that he was a genuine international figure. UNESCO was very much concerned because Peter Wilenski was chairman of the panel of international advisers on the reform of its structure. Although he was busily involved in other things as ambassador to the United Nations, he nevertheless flung himself with his customary energy and intellectual penetration into changing the whole nature of UNESCO's secretariat. It is a good illustration of his capacity to tackle complex problems and to find solutions. His extraordinary record is illustrated by having been the only person to have headed four distinct Commonwealth departmentsEducation, the Public Service Board, Transport and Communications, Foreign Affairs and Trade. I think that is an unprecedented record. We should consider not only his role in the Coombs report, as the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) pointed out but also, talking about Augean stables, his extraordinary transformation of the government of New South Wales when he did the report for Neville Wran. It would be fair to say-and I am sure the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) would agree-that whatever reforms were achieved by Nick Greiner were very much based on the reforms initiated by Peter Wilenski. As was mentioned before, he was born in Lodz in Poland, and he became part of what Gough Whitlam used to call his Polish corridor, including Jim Spigelman and Jerzy Toeplitz. Strangely, Toeplitz, who became the first director of the Australian Film and Television School-I have got to get this into the Hansard somehow-as a younger man used to baby-sit the young Peter Wilenski in Poland, not, I hasten to add, in Australia. It is one of those ironies. He was brilliant, he was dedicated and he was diverse. He made an extraordinary contribution to public life. It is a tragedy that he should have left us at the early age of 55.",80
213,Mr DOBIE,CONDOLENCES,"I shall speak only briefly about both men being honoured today. Ted St John and I shared an office when we were both first elected to parliament in 1966. We were very close friends for a period of three years. He was indeed an independent person. He was once accused at a Liberal Party meeting of being too independent to be a party member, and I think that describes Ted St John to me. He was a man of real conviction. He was not scared by anybody in a senior position. He was not angered by Harold Holt's interjection during his maiden speech; he was annoyed by it-and so he should have been. He had a lot of tragedy in his personal life. He had three disabled children, which is more his than most people have to face. He faced that, particularly with his second wife, Val, with great courage and great strength. It did not affect his professionalism at all. He was able to do it all. He was proud of his achievements in the law. He was very proud of his family's historical connections which went way back into English history. I was very sorry that I was unable, for various reasons, to attend his funeral in Sydney. I apologise to Val and his sons now for not having been there. He did not last as long in politics as he should have done. That is strange coming from me. Ted St John applied himself very strongly. He entered politics late in life and he stayed a brief while. He is going to be remembered, sadly, for his involvement in the Voyager incident. That was his grand political involvement. However, he contributed more to the Liberal Party than the Voyager debate. I would like to put on record that what he did was well regarded; but, unfortunately, politics being politics, people allowed his reputation to be sullied by his decision that the Voyager had to be investigated. I do not know whether it helped me politically, but I was very sympathetic to his case as I had several friends who went down when the Melbourne crashed into the Voyager. We did not just share a room but also shared a deep sympathy and concern for the people who had been involved in the incident which he said was caused by a drunken captain on the Melbourne. This was never denied by anybody. It was never confirmed, but it was never denied. The navy should be very grateful for what Ted St John said in the federal parliament. If only all of us had done things like this. We are not all built to do it, but Ted St John was and he did it well. I did not see much of him when he left the parliament. He was very firm with his views, and that is what perhaps killed his political career. I send my sympathy to Val and to the boys and I trust that they are doing well. I would also like to say a few words about Peter Wilenski, which is strange. But, having been here such a long time, I recall Peter Wilenski when he was the young officer in the trade department whom the senior people in that department used to send to us backbenchers to tell us about the bills. He was patient-brilliant, of course-with all of us. He persevered with idiots like me who did not really understand half the things he was talking about. He was bright and was a great help to everyone irrespective of his politics. I was very pleased to hear the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) say that Greiner in New South Wales owed a lot to Wilenski for what Wilenski had done during Wran's term of office. I pay tribute to him and share the sentiments that have been expressed today, particularly by those on the government side of the House, that it was wrong that a man of his young age, with so much to give to Australia, died. I give my sympathies and my regrets to his wife and family.",81
214,Mr HOLDING,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to pay a very short tribute to the life and commitment of Peter Wilenski. I do so because from time to time in this parliament and in other parts of Australia there are people who believe that the Public Service and public servants are legitimate targets for condemnation and criticism. There is almost an implied assumption that, if you work in the private sector, it is because you are smarter and brighter and more able to make lucrative returns. Those who knew and worked with Peter Wilenski know that he brought to every segment of his service life an intellectual capacity that was combined with a sense of compassion. That produced a very rare combination which endowed and enlarged the vision and the concepts of public service in this nation which, in so many areas, he not merely served but led. There is no member of this parliament, as there is no member of the Australian Public Service, who is not diminished by his tragic passing. I, along with my colleagues, express my sympathy to his wife and his children. His loss will not be easily borne, but his memory will sustain all of us who see duty to the broader Australian community and the building of our public institutions as a commitment which all of us in this House must be prepared to accept responsibility for. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",82

217,Mr ELLIOTT,AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL,"in reply-A fortnight ago the House had a second reading debate on the provisions relating to this particular bill and, in response, I just want to make a couple of brief remarks in summing up. At the outset I particularly thank the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who contributed constructively to the debate and, as a member of parliament, outlined, I think, very reasonable and legitimate concerns relating to this particular establishment. The concerns on which he indicated he had made concerted representations to the government over time related to staff and the ongoing operation of the facility and, in particular, a concern to ensure that the needs of staff for the future were properly taken account of. BILL 1994 I indicate, as I did in my second reading speech, that the government has been very conscious of the concerns that were felt in the Geelong area about the timing of the proposal and, indeed, about the sale process in itself. I am confident the arrangements that have been outlined following those extensive consultations will ensure that the Geelong community and all those associated with ASTA are well served in the new arrangements. It has been made clear, indeed, in terms of the facility'S operations in recent times, notwithstanding the difficult economic conditions and state of the industry that has been experienced over the last few years, that the board has made significant strides forward. We would be confident that, with the sale process proceeding, we would be in a position to ensure this important industry is able to be carried forward. I will just make a couple of other comments in relation to the contribution of the member for Ryan (Mr Moore). What has happened 1994 here, I think, is a good illustration of the way you can go about examining each of the business enterprises the government has in the different industries, trying to ensure that they are placed, in the first place, on proper commercial terms prior to any sale process proceeding, and then ensuring certainty and clarity about that process from that time onwards. That, exactly, has been the approach the government has followed in relation to ASTA. I think the net result will be a good one for the Australian taxpayers, first of all, the Australian people; and I think it can be positive for this industry as well. I feel very confident the measures that have been outlined and adopted in relation to the rights of employees, both now and in the future organisation, can be well served. I commend the member for Corio for his contribution in helping to ensure that that process has been proceeded with smoothly and, I think, with a strong degree of fairness to all concerned in the Geelong community. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott) read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY (PARENTING NA MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 13 October. Second Reading",84
218,Mrs CROSIO,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.17 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill continues the major reform of Australia's income support system for unemployed people arising from the government's white paper, Working Nation. The measures provide increased incentives under the income test for unemployed people to take up low paid work. They also include the introduction of parenting allowance. The bill also continues the strategy of phasing out payments based on a dependent relationship between people in the social security system, with individuals needing to establish a personal entitlement to a social security payment. From 1 July 1995 there will be an important new non-activity tested, independent payment for families. This new payment, to be known as parenting allowance, will be available to the partners of income support recipients who have dependent children under 16. It will also be available to the partners of low income earners, and to partners who have low personal income who have dependent children under 16. It will incorporate and go beyond the home child-care allowance currently being paid to Australian families. It will, however, preserve the major elements of the home child-care allowance. The maximum rate of parenting allowance will be the same as the rate paid to each member of a pensioner or allowance couplecurrently $268.20 a fortnight. Generally, parenting allowance will be income and assets tested. Income of both members of a couple will be taken into account. However, as home child-care allowance will be merged into parenting allowance, an amount of parenting allowance of up to $61 a fortnight, a basic parenting allowance component, will be available regardless of income received by the recipient's partner. The amount of up to $61 represents an estimated maximum rate of the home child-care allowance that will apply from 1 January 1995. This amount may be reduced only by personal income of a parenting allowance recipient. Both the maximum parenting allowance rate, $268.20 a fortnight, and the maximum rate of basic component, $61 a fortnight, will be indexed twice a year in March and September. Although parenting allowance will generally be taxable, any amount paid up to $61 a fortnight will be free of tax. Generally, only people receiving parenting allowance at a higher rate than the $61 basic parenting allowance component will automatically be entitled to additional family payment and health care card concessions. Parenting allowance has been carefully designed to improve full-time work incentives for unemployed couples with children. It will also make sure that low income couples with children will continue to be financially better off with one partner in full-time work rather than both being on income support. A further feature of the new allowance is that low income families will have a greater degree of choice about whether one partner will stay at home and care for their children, a choice generally available up to now only to those on higher incomes. At the same time, the entitlement of most higher income families to the basic parenting allowance component that was formerly home child-care allowance will be maintained. Around 260,000 families will receive more than $61 a fortnight. Overall, some 117,000 families are expected to gain around $59 a week from parenting allowance. Announced and introduced into parliament in the International Year of the Family, the parenting allowance initiative will give the partner caring for the children an independent source of income, recognising financially the valuable work of the carer. This bill makes strategic changes to the income test for unemployed people to make sure that they will always be financially better off by increasing their work earnings. Under the current arrangements, every dollar of income earned above a modest amount causes the loss of a dollar of income support. This seriously diminishes the incentives for people to increase their earnings since they will generally be no better off overall unless the increase in their income is so substantial that they have no further need for income support. From 1 July 1995, all unemployed people will be able to earn $60 a fortnight before losing any income support. They will lose 50c for each dollar of extra income between $60 and $140 a fortnight, and 70c for each dollar beyond that point. The new rule will apply to single unemployed persons and to couples unless one member of the couple is a pensioner. The new rule will generally replace the joint income test that has tended to discourage both partners from seeking work. The income of one member of a couple will start to affect the other partner's allowance only when the first partner loses entitlement to a social security benefit altogether. Based on current rates, the first partner will be able to earn $466 a fortnight before the other partner's payment will start to reduce. The reduction will then be 70c for each dollar of earnings. The existing joint income rules will continue to apply where one member of a couple is a pensioner. This bill continues the elimination of social security payments based on dependence on another person that started with the withdrawal of the partner add-on rate component earlier this year. Payments are being redirected to individuals based on need in their own right. This bill also recognises the desirability for equity between social security clients, some of whom have to undertake activity testing to qualify for income support and some of whom do not. Wife pension is currently available to a woman whose partner is receiving either age or disability support pension, disability wage supplement or rehabilitation allowance in certain circumstances. Mature age partner allowance is available to the partner of a mature age allowance recipient. Special needs wife pension is paid to a woman whose partner is receiving either special needs age or special needs disability support pension. All three payments are available without activity testing. There will be no new grants of any of these payments on or after 1 July 1995. However, people who claim and qualify for one of the payments on or before 30 June 1995 will have their entitlement 'saved'. Most people affected by this proposal will qualify for another form of income support. Those with dependent children under 16 may claim the new parenting allowance. The full range of principal income support payments such as jobsearch allowance or the various pensions will be available. Carer pension may be paid to those caring for an aged or disabled person. Partners aged 40 or more without recent labour force experience may claim the non-activity tested partner allowance. Partner allowance itself is being refined in line with other changes made by this bill. People currently on partner allowance who have dependent children under 16 are expected to move to the new parenting allowance. Partner allowance will continue to be available to the partners of recipients of jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit. It will also become available to the partners of recipients of age or disability support pension, rehabilitation or mature age allowance or disability wage supplement. However, it will be restricted to partners who are aged 40 or more with no recent work force experience and no dependent children under 16. Current clients who do not fall into this category will need to claim income support in their own right, with most expected to move to jobsearch allowance. If the client has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, CES, for the 12 months prior to 1 July 1995, newstart allowance will be available. Clients at risk of long-term unemployment will be taken to have the same history of CES registration as their jobsearch or newstart allowance partners so that they will have access to the same programs and job compacts as their partners. The bill also provides that a parenting allowance and a partner allowance will generally remain payable to a qualified person even if the person's partner is subject to a non-payment period and even if the partner's payment ceases, subject to meeting the income and assets tests. In a further amendment, parenting and partner allowance recipients will be entitled to health care cards in their own right. A new widow allowance is being introduced by this bill. Since July 1987, there have been no new grants of widow B pension to women under age 50 at that date or to those under age 45 if they had previously been sole parent pensioners. This has been part of a strategy to remove from the social security program gender specific and non-activity tested payments for people of work force age. Many women who would have qualified for widow B pension previously have moved onto other payments such as jobsearch allowance and have had to undertake the usual jobsearch activities to be able to get income support. However, many of these women grew up in an era when it was not expected that they would ever work outside the home after marriage and have no recent work force experience with which to confront the harsh realities of the job market. The new widow allowance is being introduced to ease the transition between the current provisions and the eventual phase out of the types of payment mentioned. From 1 January 1995, widow allowance will be available to women who are widowed, divorced or separated who become so after turning 50 and who have no recent work force experience. The new allowance will be paid at the same rate and under the same income and assets tests as jobsearch and newstart allowances, but it will not be activity tested. Widow allowance will carry an entitlement to a health care card. Women receiving another payment immediately before 1 January 1995 may transfer to widow allowance without having to satisfy the recent work force experience requirement. Women who have turned 60 and who have been beneficiaries for 12 months or more will be entitled to a pensioner concession card. There will be no new grants of widow allowance on or after 1 July 2005, except to women born before 1 July 1955. To avoid confusion, the current widowed person allowance will now be called bereavement allowance but will not otherwise be changed. The other measures in this bill relate to advance pharmaceutical allowance and education entry payment. Advance pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990, originally to operate until the end of 1991. The success of the scheme has resulted in its extension year by year. It is now to be extended indefinitely by the removal by this bill of the sunset clause. Education entry payment is currently available to recipients of certain social security payments to ease the costs associated with taking up study which may in turn improve the person's chances of finding work. The $200 payment is now being extended to recipients of partner allowance, wife pension and mature age partner allowance, and to recipients of the new parenting and widow allowances. I commend the bill to the House.",85
219,Mr RUDDOCK,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"Berowra) (6.30 p.m.)On behalf of the opposition, I will address my comments to the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I am glad, in a sense, that the new procedures allow us to follow the second reading speech because we can pick up, I think with a greater sense of clarity, the issues that are involved. The issues are not always simple. This legislation runs to 169 pages; the explanatory memorandum 137 pages. As I listened to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), I tried to follows those matters about which I have been briefed comprehensively, and I looked around at the gallery to see whether there were any nodding heads. I looked at the advisers and noted that they were very carefully following the parliamentary secretary's every word. I thought it may make it easier for them to understand what they were actually doing. I looked at the clerks-I am always glad to look at the clerks because I find they have a great deal to occupy them. To listen to these matters, as some people would be for the first time as they heard the parliamentary secretary, one could be forgiven for asking what it is we are doing to our Social Security Act with the myriad of new allowances paid on a whole range of different conditions and criteria which require explanation of the sort that we heard here tonight. I understand this bill is to give legislative effect to measures that were first announced in the budget this year and also in the white paper on employment and growth. The explanatory memorandum says it is also to give effect to one non-budget measure. There was apparently a mistake in the sense that the government, by oversight, had forgotten to include it in some earlier legislation. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to put certain matters clearly at issue. It is more important to try to get an overview of what the legislation is about and how effectively it is going to achieve its objectives and to use some of the material from those who are in a position to analyse these matters to better understand what is happening. It is my intention to move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its inability to solve the unemployment crisis; (2) the continued failure to provide adequate assistance to low income families; (3) its harsh treatment of older single women with limited employment experience, including the abolition of the widow B pension; (4) financially disadvantaging groups of unemployed low income earners by way of changes to the job search/newstart allowance income tests; (5) the public confusion created by the introducin tion of the home child care allowance regime, and the subsequent confusion which will result from the parenting allowance, partner allowance and wife pension changes; and (6) its failure to provide additional home child care support to low income families, principally the unemployed"". I note that this is the government's major reform bill in this area. In other words, it is the bill that implements its policy to deal with issues that are relevant to the people who are on the lowest income support levels in our community. It is to put in place the regime that will address those sorts of problems. It is interesting today that we heard a number of questions about the recent ACOSS inquiry and particularly about the poverty and inequality paper prepared by Professor Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. Professor Harding went behind all the rhetoric that is involved in this matter and made it clear, laid it out, what the government is achieving through this myriad of name changes and alterations of conditions upon which benefits are paid. What she made clear, and what we all ought to understand, is that those people in our community who are worse off are not seeing their position improve under this government; they are seeing it worsen in comparison to the most wealthy. I think the government ought to be sensitive to this matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated enormous sensitivity to this matter. He challenged the data. He challenged the way in which information is dealt with. He challenged the Henderson poverty line. He argued that there may be ways of explaining this away. Even Professor Harding in her own paper acknowledged that poverty is a very difficult matter to address and that the estimates may have some variations, but the major trends are nevertheless sound. I can understand why the government is sensitive, but Professor Harding had this to say, and I refer to page 3 of her paper: Sole parents continue to be the group most likely to be in poverty, although they are now closely followed by non-elderly single people. About one every five sole parents or younger singles are in poverty. Couples with children are the third most 'at-risk' group, with 12 per cent being below the HPL. This is notwithstanding all of the changes that have been introduced. I suspect that, notwithstanding the cashing out of benefits again and renaming them, which is essentially what we are involved in in this legislation, Professor Harding will be able to produce another paper in 12 months time which will reveal that the circumstances have not changed. Professor Harding went on to say: The risk of being in poverty rises of children in the family (Table 2). For married couples, poverty rates for those with one to three children are reasonably similar, at 10-11 per cent . (Figure 2). Only for large families with four more children does the risk rise sharply, to 22 cent. For sole parents, the likelihood of being poverty increases steadily with the number children, from 17 per cent for those with one to 31 per cent for those with three or more children. She went to deal with each of those groupsgovernment's couples with children in poverty, sole parents in poverty, younger single people in poverty, to the inequality estimates. She says: After ranking all Australians by the equivalent income of their family, and then dividing them 10 equally sized groups called 'deciles', it possible to estimate the share of total income received by each group. The top 10 per cent of population received an estimated 26.5 per cent total equivalent income in September 1994 (ie. adjusting income for the different needs of different types of families, using the Henderson equivalence scale). As Figure 6 shows, the bottom 10 per received a 1.5 per cent share of total income. richest 30 per cent of Australians received more than half of total income, while the poorest 30 per cent received a 10 per cent slice of the income cake. It is possible to calculate the average needs-adjustextent ed income received by each decile group. The poorest 10 per cent of Australians received an equivalent income of $85 a week, while the richest 10 per cent received an equivalent income of $1500 a week. In other words, the top 10 per cent received almost 18 times as much as the bottom 10 per cent. It is not me saying that; it is Professor Harding whom the government pays to undertake original research of this type. That makes it abundantly clear that notwithstanding all of the changes, all of the rhetoric, not only have things not got better; they have got worse. That brings us to the changes that are involved in this legislation. The bill introduces a number of new measures, some of which are interrelated and some of which are consequential on other elements of the bill. Amendments to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, the National Health Act and the Veterans Entitlements Act are purely consequential and the coalition will not be opposing them. That brings me to the issue of the with the number parenting allowance. The parenting allowance is one of the major components of this legislation and the governor ment plans to introduce it on 1 July next year. per Despite the rhetoric, it is not a new payment. in It is a replacement for other social security of payments, including the home child-care child allowance, which the government introduced on 29 September 1994, and the wife pension, which this legislation will also abolish. The explanations for introducing a parent allowance is essentially that it is cashing out other benefits and paying it in the form of a new allowance. There will not be a substantial amount of new money involved into in the payment of this. We have to ask ouris selves whether this is a good idea. It might be the good to use more politically correct language of to describe an allowance. It is dreadful to after have something called a wife pension; it is better to call it a parent allowance. But what often happens when we change benefits and cent the titles by which they are known is that we The have a whole lot of unforeseen consequences. One consequence I recently learnt about, and which I have emphasised in this parliament on one or two occasions before, is the to which assurances of support, which are given on behalf of new arrivals by relatives who are here, are often found to be ineffective because the form of benefit for which the assurance was given had a name change. Therefore, if you promise to pay any unemployment benefits-now called a jobsearch or newstart allowance-the person is able to walk away from the agreement. That is pretty clever politics in using taxpayers' funds. It is perhaps indicative of this government's legislative performance that it has introduced this legislation to effectively subsume the home child-care allowance into another payment before the legislation to fully implement the home child-care allowance has been passed through the parliament. We are not even up to that yet. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), which we debated when we were last here, seeks to abolish the with-child dependent spouse rebate-the payment which the home child-care allowance is replacing. The home child-care allowance is still in the Senate awaiting resolution. Given the government's current refusal to support opposition and Democrat amendments-it seems to find them difficult to understand or suggests that they will be difficult to administer-which would ensure that persons who currently receive the withchild dependent spouse rebate and do not qualify for the home child-care allowance will continue to get support-one would not have thought that that would not be unreasonable in relation to children-it is quite possible this bill will pass through the parliament before the taxation changes do. The parenting allowance will be an income and assets tested payment payable to partnered persons who have dependent children under the age of 16 years. It will be subject to a new income test for allowees. That will also be introduced in this bill. I will comment on that later. The parenting allowance will doubtless continue the farce which has resulted since the introduction of the home childcare allowance. I will not go through all my press releases in relation to these matters but I will outline some of the issues that have arisen. Currently, due to the government's inability to get legislation through the parliato ment in a timely fashion, the home child-care allowance, which came into existence on 29 September, is now being paid, but the payment it is meant to abolish has not yet been abolished. That is pretty smart politics on the government's part. One wonders why, when the government introduced legislation that could deal with these matters contemporaneously, it was not able to do that. The home child-care allowance was introduced to the Australian people as a new $30 a week payment. The Prime Minister was up here today in question time railing on the government's record in relation to poverty and telling us that there was this new home child-care allowance, $30 a week in people's pockets, but the reality is that once we cash out the dependent spouse rebate families will receive only $2.65 extra a week. Is it any wonder that the payment has not addressed the issue of poverty? The Department of Social Security has a computer system which has been beset by problems following the introduction of this new allowance. The system has been unable to cope with the vast amount of information required to be processed. That has had quite significant consequences so far as other beneficiaries are concerned. It has caused payments to be delayed. It has meant that, at times, departmental staff had little or no access to departmental files or other computer records. The government thought it was pretty smart. It introduced a new allowance but the computer system went down-the unemployed could not get their cheques and others could not get cash payments because the computer was down. All of this has to be seen in the context of a government anxious to make changes. The introduction of the parenting allowance, combined with the other changes to this bill, will in my judgment cause problems of the same nature. I would like to know whether the parliamentary secretary is prepared to put her name on the line and give us an assurance that the computer will not break down when they have to feed in the new information. I would like to know whether she is prepared put her reputation on the line in relation to these new changes and have me come back to this matter at a later date. Currently, unemployed couples cannot get the home child-care allowance. They are some of the worse off people in terms of the poverty line. This is despite the government's rhetoric that the new payment was to benefit low income families. The situation arises where couples, or both partners in a relationship, are unemployed, have a reasonable expectation that they or their partner will be able to get this new benefit. But, no, what has the government done? Because the new home child-care allowance is means tested on the carer's income, it has set an income limit of $250 per fortnight. The introduction of the partner allowance on 20 September, which was not an additional payment but was the splitting of the income that the unemployed partners now receive, meant that the carer was now assessed as having an income of approximately $265 per week, making them ineligible for this new payment. In the time that I have been shadow spokesman for social security, I have had more complaints from the partner/spouse in an unemployed couple about this issue than almost any other social security issue. ACOSS has raised the concern-and quite legitimately-that where both partners are not able to get into the work force they are also not able to benefit from the home child-care allowance. I am sure there is a rationalisation. The benefit that was being cashed out did not provide for it. This is the government that is supposed to be addressing the problem of poverty. The government had different commencement dates for the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance. That meant that some people were told they were going to receive this benefit. A letter came out one week saying that they have the benefit-they had won lotto-and the next week they get a letter saying, 'Terribly sorry; you are getting the partner allowance and you will no longer be eligible.' That is great politics. I can see the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) nodding. He must have had a few complaints in his electorate as well. The fact is that the government could not coordinate it in such a way as to ensure that people were not put in that situation. The coalition will not be opposing the introduction of the parenting allowance, as it is a payment which will provide some additional support to certain low income families-people who were previously denied access to the home child-care allowance. But I wish to emphasise that, despite the government's claims, it is not a new payment of $132.65 a week. It is just like HCCA-it was not a new payment but in fact the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate. Some low income families will receive an additional payment as a result of this change, but relatively few will be eligible to receive the maximum rate of parenting allowance. In relation to the amendments on income tests for jobsearch, newstart, sickness, partner and widow's allowances, this measure will introduce a new taper for the income tests for these allowees. It will remove the earnings disregard-a very clear statement of policy if you are unfamiliar with these matters-and abolish the joint income test for benefit couples. The government has stated that these amendments are part of a package of measures to encourage unemployed persons to obtain work. Currently the income test for unemployed people should mean that for every dollar of income earned over the income threshold, including the earnings disregard, $1 of income support is lost. The new taper will provide a standard $60 a fortnight taper-free area, a 50 per cent taper between $60 and $140 and a 70 per cent taper for any income over $140. The coalition will not be opposing these amendments. However, it needs to be understood that the only unemployed people who will benefit from these changes are those who have been able to find substantial full-time or part-time work. In fact, a large number of unemployed persons, those who have been unable to find extra work, will have their incomes savaged because of the new taper system. Not so long ago I put out a detailed paper identifying who some of those people would be. Homeless persons on jobsearch and newstart aged under 18 with an earned income of between $40 and $11 0 a week will be worse off. Single persons between 18 and 20 years on jobsearch and newstart not living at home with an earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be worse off. Single people aged 18 to 20 on jobsearch and newstart living at home with an earned income of between $40 and $11 0 will be worse off. Single persons aged 21 and over on jobsearch and newstart with earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be in the same position-worse off. Couples with no children on jobsearch and newstart in which one partner has earned income of between $40 and $150 a week will be in the same position, as are couples with no children on jobsearch and newstart. I produced detailed tables outlining the impact. So, again, the people on the lowest income are going to be put in a worse position. Sure, the bill addresses one of the poverty traps, but we had to lower the standard of living of some of the poorest in order to address the poverty trap. That is the outcome. These amendments will substantially alter the qualifications for the partner allowance. Currently the partner allowance is payable only to partners of jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and special benefits recipients. The bill will modify the partner allowance to provide that partner allowance is payable to persons who have an age pension, disability wage supplement, a disability support pension, mature age allowance pension partner or a partner in receipt of a rehabilitation allowance. This is a consequence of abolishing the wife pension and the mature age partner allowance. It is not because we are paying new benefits; they get a new name. It is not additional income; it is abolishing other payments and, in a sense, cashing out the benefit into a new form of payment. The bill will restrict the partner allowance to recipients with little or no recent work force experience who are over 40 years of age, without dependent children under the age of 16 years. All persons who are over 40 and without dependent children under 16 will remain on partner allowance regardless of recent work force experience. All persons who have children under 16 may be qualified for a parenting allowance. The bill will provide that persons who no longer qualify for a partner allowance after 1 July will be granted access to newstart programs if they are at risk of long-term unemployment. It will be based on their partner's unemployment duration. It will provide that the partner allowance is payable to a person where a jobsearch or newstart allowance non-payment period has been imposed on the person's partner and subject to the income and assets test provided that a person can remain qualified for a partner allowance after the person's partner ceases to receive a social security payment or pension. These changes will mean that a younger woman who is the partner of a social security recipient and who does not have children will have to qualify for income support in her own right. Younger women who have children and who currently receive the partner allowance will now have to transfer over to a parenting allowance. The partner allowance was only introduced in September this year and already the government is making substantial changes to it, which is typical of the government's piecemeal approach to social security issues. Whilst not opposing this measure, the opposition is concerned about the confusion the government will generate by making these changes. There still exists considerable confusion in the community resulting from the introduction of the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance and the proposed abolition of the with-child dependent spouse rebate. The further changes to the partner allowance and parenting allowance amendments will only exacerbate this problem. The government appears to be going out of its way to ensure that the welfare system in Australia is as complex and as user-unfriendly as is possible. If this indeed is its objective, then the government has gone a long way to achieving its goal. The government is also introducing legislation through this bill which phases out the wife pension, and mature age partner allowance. The wife pension is currently available to a woman whose partner is receiving the age pension, disability support pension, disability wage supplement or, in certain circumstances, the rehabilitation allowance. The mature age partner allowance is available to a person whose partner is receiving the mature age allowance. The special needs wife pension is available to a woman who has a partner who is receiving the special needs allowance or special needs disability support pension. There will be no new grants of any of these payments after 1 July. However, women who qualify in claiming these payments before June 1995 will have their entitlements 'saved'. Wives of people granted a pension after 1 July 1995 or partners of allowance recipients will now be forced to apply for parental allowance, jobsearch allowance, disability support or carer pension depending on their circumstances. The measure will affect approximately 137,652 women over the next three years. I admire the government's estimating skills. The coalition will not oppose this measure. We are not opposing the education entry payment. The sunset clause relating to the advance pharmaceutical allowance is repealed. Those amendments which repeal the sunset clause and allow for the advance pharmaceutical allowance to continue on an indefinite basis are not opposed. I conclude by discussing the changes relating to the introduction of the widow allowance and the renaming of the widowed person's allowance. The widow allowance was announced by the government less than one month ago, after the release of the white paper and three weeks after the 1994 budget. The introduction of this allowance is an attempt to rectify a major policy deficiency that became very clear with a number of public campaigns that were being waged on this matter, that is, politics which relate to older single women with limited employment experience. Contrary to the government's claims, it was the coalition that first raised this anomaly after the release of the white paper. Since 1987, when the government decided to phase out the widow B pension over a 15year program, Labor's policies have discriminated against single older women. The white paper changes further extended this discrimination against older women who were either divorced, separated or widowed. When the abolition of the widow B pension was debated in the House of Representatives in 1987, James Porter, who was then my predecessor, outlined our concern on this measure: Again the government is acting against the woman who marries young, raises her children and stays home to care for those children. Once the mother reaches the age of 50 to 55 and has little or no income, the children have grown older and the husband has died, the government says that she should not receive a pension. She is expected to back into the work force and, of course, she will have few skills to enable her to go back into the work force and, if she does not, she will have to go on the dole. The widow allowance is not a new initiative; it is just a poor imitation of the widow B pension. If the government had really intended to remedy the matter and put those women back in the same position they would have been in as widows, it could have extended the widow B pension. But the government made changes to it to effect budgetary savings. The widow allowance is paid at lower rates than the widow B pension. I took out a comparison upon which they were paid. If you were receiving a widow B pension fortnightly, when I prepared this table it was $318.10 per fortnight. If you receive the widow allowance and you have no children, it is $294.10. It is the same rate if you have children. The income tests are different. For the full rate it is up to $90, if you have no children. It is up to $114 if you have one child and you add $24 for every extra child. But, if you are getting a widow allowance, the income test is up to $60. Part rate changes are similar. The assets test is similar in relation to full rate beneficiaries but in relation to those who are on the part rate it is imposed on a different basis. We are not opposing the changes, but it ought to be clearly understood that the government, in addressing this matter by paying an allowance, is not remedying the fundamental problem but ensuring that those people do not receive any additional payments as a result of their circumstances. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its inability to solve the unemployment crisis; (2) the continued failure to provide adequate assistance to low income families; (3) its harsh treatment of older single women with limited employment experience, including the abolition of the widow B pension; at (4) financially disadvantaging groups of unemployed low income earners by way of changes to the job searchfnewstart allowance income tests; go (5) the public confusion created by the introduction of the home child care allowance regime, and the subsequent confusion which will result from the parenting allowance, partner allowance and wife pension changes; and (6) its failure to provide additional home child care support to low income families, principally the unemployed"".

220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCLachlan-1 second the amendment.,94
221,Mr GIBSON,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill, and also to follow once more the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I am pleased to do so because I hope to achieve an effective contrast between the empty rhetoric that we have come to expect, know and love from the honourable member for Berowra and the actual facts of what this legislation is all about. It is interesting that when the opposition spokesperson on social security matters rails against us for being a government daring to spend an extra $350 million a year supporting families in this country, when he says how dreadful the way we are doing that is, he never in fact uses the opportunity that a good, effective opposition member would to say what the opposition would do if it were in power? Did anybody actually hear one word from the opposition spokesperson on social security about what his party would do? No. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) is shaking her head, and well she should because she sat here for half an hour listening to the honourable member for Berowra telling us how bad we are because we dared put in place additional payments, new support payments for families and for unemployed people, new opportunities for them to earn money through part-time employment and therefore increase their effective income. All of these things, we are told, are bad because we are introducing all these new measures, but there was not one word about what the opposition would do. The main reason it cannot is that it has no policies. The opposition has a few empty words in that little flat book that disappeared without a trace called The Things That Matter. It said very little indeed about social security. We do not really know what it would do but we do know that it would be prepared, and is arguing very forcefully and very strongly, for cuts in government expenditure. The empty rhetoric we heard today was particularly shallow because the opposition was pinned right against the wall in question time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said that the opposition has the gall to get up in this House and talk about how dreadful poverty is, how the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, yet it is not prepared to actually contrast that with the fact that its members are the ones who want to cut the incomes and the support programs that this government has put in place for the lowest income families in this country. It has been a consistent part of the opposition's policy platform since it has been in opposition to slash social security expenditure. In its last policy manifesto, Fightback, the opposition intended to slash some $10 billion from social security payments. It would have been the unemployed who would have suffered, the very people whom the honourable member for Berowra was claiming to be so concerned about. It would have been the unemployed, the low income families, the most defenceless groups in our society who would have borne the major brunt of the opposition's slash to social security expenditure. Let us put the rhetoric aside and look at the performance compared with the rhetoric. This opposition does not have one ounce of concern for the unemployed, not one ounce of credibility for talking about poverty traps in this country, whereas the government, through this legislation, is in fact proposing to aid those very groups by giving an additional $347.2 million in the next financial year to families who are the lowest income earners in this country. That is the contrast between the empty words of the opposition and the performance of the government. We have consistently put in place programs that have boosted the incomes and boosted the earning capacity of the lowest income people in this society, and this legislation will continue with that process. The Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 implements a range of important initiatives announced in the federal government's white paper, such as the parenting allowance, and other key initiatives revealed following the publication of the Working Nation document in May. Before outlining some of the main elements of this bill, it is important to place in context Australia's system of income support measures. Effectively, our nation's social security arrangements for unemployed people still largely reflect the unemployment benefit system that was introduced by the Labor governments of the 1940s. Australia's labour market has undergone a somewhat radical facelift since that decade from when only the male of a couple was looking for work to today's situation which is witnessing a massive participation in the labour force by women. Naturally, these have not been the only differences. An increase in part-time employment and a decline in full-time jobs, particularly for young Australians, is a trend that was not encountered in the 1940s when it was natural for unemployed people to gain full-time jobs. A further changing characteristic of our labour market has been the very large increase in long-term unemployment-a factor that did not have to be contended with 50 years ago. It must be pointed out that, as was the case half a century ago, today only a Labor government has the vision, the inspiration and drive to introduce a broad range of initiatives to support those in our community who have fallen on hard times. Many in the opposition, such as the honourable member for Berowra, poured scorn on the Prime Minister when he made his statement, following the success of the election in 1993, that he would not leave the unemployed people of Australia behind. The policies and programs contained in the white paper-some of which we are debating today-deliver on that commitment. That is another contrast: we deliver on our commitments. As we are debating this legislation, let us not forget these important facts. Only the socially progressive and community responsive programs of Labor governments can deliver a balanced income support system for Australia. The white paper programs which are contained in this bill include, firstly, replacing the 100 per cent taper in the income test for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances with a 70 per cent taper. This change, in particular, is a significant incentive to unemployed people, and their partners, to work additional part-time hours. At present, a single unemployed person loses $1 in allowance for each additional income earned between $85 and $214 per week. Importantly, without any doubt, this measure will ensure all unemployed people will gain financially from working additional hours. Secondly, the legislation replaces the joint income test in these allowances for couples with a separate partner income test. The existing disincentive applies to both members of a couple as the present income test operates on a joint family basis, even since the introduction of the partner allowance in September 1994. This current disincentive is highlighted by the fact that wives of unemployed men have a significantly lower labour force participation rate and higher unemployment rate than the wives of employed men. This bill changes this situation by introducing a new partner income test. From 1 July 1995 the payment received by each member of a couple will be unaffected until the partner's payment is exhausted under the income testthat is, at $233 per week-and the reduction the will then be 70c for each dollar of income. Once again, both members of an unemployed couple will gain financially from working additional hours. Thirdly, this legislation introduces a new parenting allowance available to low income families where one partner receives a social security payment or is in low income employment and the other parent cares for the children. The parenting allowance, which is the crux of this bill, will be introduced on 1 July next year. It will incorporate the recently introduced home child-care allowance and will be payable to partnered persons who have dependent children under the age of 16 years. This process of supplementing incomes of low paid families began with family payment supplements in the 1980s and their integration into a single payment in January 1993. This had the effect of paying low income families the same amount in family payments, regardless of whether they were unemployed. Despite the existence of family payments, around 2.5 per cent of families still gain no financial benefit from taking a full-time job. The introduction of the parenting allowance will overcome this problem. It will not be subject to an activity test and will be paid at the same rates and subject to the same personal income, partner income and assets test as the jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. Importantly, all unemployed persons will now gain financially from taking full-time work. An additional $350 million-or, to be completely accurate, $347.2 million-will be channelled to low income working families in 1995-96. That will increase to $366.7 million in 1996-97 and $393.3 million in 1997-98. Yet the honourable member for Berowra claims that the parenting allowance will do nothing to assist low income families. It is a significant payment which will have an enormous benefit to those families, and it is something that the opposition should be applauding rather than criticising. I have a few examples of the exact impact of these three measures on families. The first example is that of a single unemployed person taking up part-time work which pays $200 per week before tax. Under the current system, this person's jobsearch or newstart allowance payment would be reduced to $12 per week, giving a total gross income of $212. When the new system is introduced, this person's total jobsearch or newstart entitlement will be $36 a week, making him $24 a week better off. Another example is that of an unemployed person with a partner and two dependent children under 13 years of age who receives $200 per week from part-time work. Currently, the family would receive an additional $140 per week jobsearch or newstart married rate allowance and an $86 per week family payment-a total family income of $426 per week. Under the new income test, the family will receive $22 in jobsearch or newstart allowance, $133 in parenting allowance and $86 in family payments per week-a total of $441, leaving it $15 per week better off. The family's income will increase further if the partner receiving the parenting allowance obtains some part-time work. A third example is that of a partner from a couple with no dependent children who works full time and gets a gross wage of $342 per week. Under the current income support system, this person's partner is not eligible for income support so the couple's total income is $342 per week. Under the new system, the partner without earnings will receive $55 per week in jobsearch or newstart allowance. The couple's total weekly income will increase to $397 a week and their income will increase further if the second partner obtains some part-time work. None of the above examples include rent assistance, which currently provides additional maximum support of between $32.20 and $42.90 per week, depending on the amount of rent paid, marital status and the number of children in a family. Honourable members can see from those examples that the measures in this legislation are going to have a very direct and very beneficial impact on the incomes and living standards of unemployed people. It is very clear that the measures to be put in place from 1 July 1995 will benefit unemployed couples who were not eligible for the home child-care allowance when it was introduced on 29 September this year. Generally, unemployed families will be much better off with this new system. I think they will appreciate these new benefits the government is introducing. Measures other than those in the white paper which are contained in the bill pertain to the changing role of women in Australia's labour market. Over half of all women of work force age now participate in the labour force. On the basis of this statistic, it is no longer appropriate to make payments to women on the basis of an assumption of dependency. In this respect, there will be a phasing out over a significant period of the partner allowance and the gender based wives pension. There will be no new grants of wives pension from 1 July 1995, but existing recipients will be protected. Further, in future years, the partner allowance will be paid only to people aged 40 years or more as at 1 July 1995 with little or no recent work force experience. Existing recipients will transfer to the parenting allowance or jobsearch allowance. Since the phasing out of the widows B pension in 1987, the importance of recognising the many older women who have had little or no recent work force experience and have never had an expectation that they would need to rejoin the work force has grown. With this in mind, there will be a widows allowance from 1 January 1995. This payment will be at jobsearch allowance rates; however, it will not have an activity test attached to its payment. It will be available to women over the age of 50 whose widowhood, divorce or separation occurred after they turned 50. It will phase out in line with the partner allowance: that is, it will be available only to women born before 1 July 1945. Again, it is important to recognise that the government has responded to community concerns on this question. Members of both the government and the opposition have raised this matter and have sought some redress on the previous legislation introduced in 1987. The government has responded positively to this. I think the government should be congratulated rather than criticised for having responded in this way. The legislation will have financial impacts on the budget. There are some cost savings in other measures but overall there will be an additional $248 million in 1995-96, rising to $282 million in 1997-98. These amounts reflect the cost of the parenting allowance minus some of the savings in some other measures. It is estimated that 117,000 spouses of low income earners will gain eligibility to the parenting allowance, with an average gain of $59 per week. The integration of the home child-care allowance within the parenting allowance will raise the free area of the parenting allowance income test by an average of $3 to $20 per week. It will also extend the $200 education entry payment to recipients of the wives pension, partner allowance, parenting allowance, widow allowance and mature age partners allowance. That is another important initiative in this legislation. Rather than postpone reform in Australia's welfare system, this Labor government has taken up the challenge to update the social security provisions for unemployed people so they are relevant not only for today but for Australia's future. As the Prime Minister said today in question time, the fundamental measurement for poverty in this country revolves around access to employment. An important feature of this bill and the new arrangements it introduces is that unemployed people will be financially better off by getting a full-time job or by working more hours in a part-time job. Already, we have witnessed a number of significant improvements in our nation's job growth-the job figures for September alone show some 75,000 additional full-time places - and unemployment statistics, despite record levels of labour market participation, are still falling. The initiatives contained in this bill provide income support incentives to improve not only Australia's employment growth but also the quality of life of low income and unemployed Australians. I have much pleasure in commending the bill to the House.",94
222,Mr WAKELIN,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"As has been said, the parent allowance will be payable to partnered people who have dependent children under 16 years of age. As foreshadowed in Working Nation, it purports to provide income support to the parent providing the main care for children. The payment is free of the obligation to seek work. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) engaged in a contest of rhetoric about this issue. But he overlooked the increase in interest rates and the effect on the household budget. He also overlooked the fact that there is no alternative to finding a secure job. Mr Gibson-Have you been feeding him lines, Phillip?",97
223,Mr WAKELIN,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"No; these thoughts are purely independent. He mentioned some examples. I will outline a couple of them. Hypothetically, Ruth and Graham are a married couple. Graham owns a small business which went down in the recession. He has been out of work and receiving the JSA for eight months. He has been able to pick up occasional accounting and bookkeeping work that gives him an average of $90 per week additional income. Ruth is five months pregnant with the couple's first child. It has been a difficult pregnancy and she has been advised by her doctor to rest as much as possible. Before the white paper, Ruth and Graham's total income was $338 per week. As a result of the white paper, their income will drop to $321 per week and they will be $17 per week, or $884 per year, worse off.",97
224,Mr COBB,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,Very significant.,98
225,Mr WAKELIN,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"As the honourable member says, this will make the current struggle significantly harder. I will provide another example to chastise the government for its alleged generosity. Peter is a 17-year-old who lives independently of his parents. He is eligible for the jobsearch allowance at the independent homeless rate, which is paid at a maximum of $109.20 per week. With no work experience and a limited education, Peter has been searching long and hard for work. He has managed to obtain a part-time job working as a labourer, which pays him an extra $80 per week. Before the white paper, this part-time job increased his total gross income to $172 per week. Although he is fully independent with virtually all the living expenses of a single adult, Peter is able to survive financially with his extra work. However, with the white paper, his income will be reduced to $162 per week. He will be $10 per week, or $520 per year, worse off. Mr Cobb interjecting",98
226,Mr WAKELIN,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"Absolutely. After such a tough struggle, Peter quite rightly wonders whether it is all worth it. That is the scenario. More and more Australian families are finding that they have to supplement their incomes with government allowances. For example, in 1973, 13.5 per cent of Australians over 16 received a government benefit. By 1993-we can be sure that in 1994 it will be higher-this number had increased to 33.1 per cent. This has to be an indictment of the Labor government's track record. Over the past 11 years the government has fundamentally failed to solve the unemployment crisis. At least one in five children in Australia today is growing up in a family affected by unemployment. More and more people have to accept part-time work when they would rather be working full time. More and more families are receiving some sort of government payment not because this federal government is generous with taxpayers' money but because this federal government has not given families a chance to work. Despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at question time today, there is an increasingly large gap between the rich and poor in Australia. The top 10 per cent of wage earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since 1983. The bottom 10 per cent of income earners have seen their real wages fall by five per cent. So much for this Labor Party being the champion of the poor. This is a situation which this federal government has created and this is why our Australian families desperately need things such as the home child-care allowance, the parenting allowance and so on. But the government cannot even get its allowances right. The home child-care allowance is still being debated. I have spoken in this House before about the shambles that is the HCCA. Believe it or not, the very people who you would think should benefit from a payment aimed at low income familiesfamilies where both parents are unemployedare not eligible for the HCCA. Where is the justice in that? The coalition has been astounded by the absolute injustice of this targeting of the HCCA and is pushing for further amendments. Not surprisingly, considerable public confusion has been created by the introduction of these new allowances for families, particularly with the introduction of the HCCA, the partner allowance and the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate. I believe that even the staff of the Department of Social Security are having great difficulty coming to terms with the new programs. No doubt it has something to do with the industrial issues that have been part of that department in recent times. The implementation of the programs has been simply a mess-and this is by a government that has had over 11 years to practise. As I have mentioned, the office of the Department of Social Security recently went on strike demanding extra staff. The DSS has been swamped by clients confused about the HCCA and other payments. The parenting allowance will add to the confusion. Under this government, the workload of the DSS has grown because the government has had no answers to our problems. It does not know how to cope with our unemployment. It can only promise more training schemes and computerised job boards at the local CES. People on the jobless queues do not care whether the job boards are computerised. What is the use if there are no jobs on the board anyway? This government cannot promise anything to regional Australia. This is where there seems to be total ignorance within the government. We hear this wonderful rhetoric about the booming economy, all those opportunities that every Australian will share in with the recovery and that the Prime Minister is personally reaching down to pull them up. But what about regional Australia? As I stated in my electorate last week, calculations such as the consumer price index do not even take into account the cost of living in regional Australia. They do not even take into account cost of living increases in regional Australia. There is no measurement. The government does not have a clue what the cost of living is.",98
227,Mr COBB,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,It is not interested.,99
228,Mr WAKELIN,ALLOWANCE AND OTHER,"No. It has ignored them since it has been in government. No doubt it will continue to ignore them. Therefore, how can it legislate for regional Australia? In Working Nation, the only thing regional Australia got from the government was a promise to help set up super regional development boards. My electorate already has several development boards, all of which work very well. Apart from that, Working Nation effectively told regional Australia and regional families that we were on our own. It talked vaguely about encouraging local leadership, emphasised that regional bodies should not wait for government funding and made some patronising noises about how regional Australia is best equipped to look after itself after the federal Treasurer (Mr Willis) has dipped into our pockets via increased taxation, particularly with that sneakiest of taxes-the wholesale sales tax. Rather than offering innovative programs and some positive incentive to the region, Working Nation has let regional Australia down. All the while, this government thinks it can fix things by the introduction of a parenting allowance and other payments. Low income families appreciate any extra support they can get. But, if asked what they would really like most, most will reply that they want jobs, particularly for their children and grandchildren and for small country towns and regional cities. Families want the opportunity to work and earn their own money and not have to rely on the government to pay their rent or clothe their children. Families want the opportunity to save for the future. They also want to ensure that that future is a bright one for their children. We are already seeing second or third generation unemployment in some families. This has to stop. I keep saying-when I rise in this place I talk mostly about unemployment - that I was blessed to have grown up at a time of full employment in this country. I cannot look the young in the eye until I see that same level of employment. How this government can claim to represent the underprivileged and the poor of Australia at this rate-much of the problem has been created by its own policies-will always be beyond me. The government has to go to the heart of the issues and ask why unemployment is 13 per cent in many regional cities. Inventing new payments will not solve these problems. If any electorate in Australia needs more financial assistance and employment prospects, it is my electorate of Grey. Grey is ranked seventh in order of electorates with families who earn less than $16,000 per annum. Some 25 per cent of families in my electorate earn less than $16,000 per year. At this point it is worth mentioning that 60 per cent of the top 74 seats in the House of Representatives, which are ranked according to income, are represented by the Labor Party.

234,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Perhaps.,100
235,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am most indebted to this you, Mr Speaker, for your advice. I would like to acknowledge the role ses in our economy. Small business makes up 50 per cent of the employment equation in the country. In my own electorate of Grey, small business makes up 22.5 per cent of total employment. It is a great pity that this vernment is not more aware of the fact that small business makes up 50 per cent of the employment equation. There is not much point running around with training schemes and a range of unemployment benefits if we have not spent some time dealing with the employers' end of the market. It is very important that this government acknowledges the role of employers. Too often in this place I hear comments in defence of that giant organisation, the ACTU, and its role in the creation of true wage justice and social justice in Australia. Too little time is spent dealing with the role of employers. A myriad of taxes, regulations and legislative requirements binds businesses. Regions such as Grey are suffering due to the exorbitant fuel excise, one of this federal of government's favourite revenue raisers. ReIn gions such as Grey are affected by the goexvernment's ignorance of regional Australia. the I believe that is why so many people in this country are poor and why so many people very are unemployed. This government does not the sufficiently recognise the role of the emGone are the days when we could so easily scapegoat the shylock or the negative images of employers. What we should be talking is the role played by employers in on top of this social evil known as unemployment. These people are amongst our most creative, most dynamic and most socialconscious in understanding what this nation needs. If this government were to devote a small percentage of its legislative program to he acknowledging the role of employers we try would see many of the issues concerning unemployment abolished. I hope that the government in its deliberations as it leads up to the next election will make some competitive statements about small business. It is essential to the future of country. It is my very proud duty to bring to the attention of this House the role played of small businesby small business. World Environment Day",100
236,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (7.35 p.m.)I recently held a competition for school gostudents in my electorate, announced to coincide with World Environment Day in June. There were over 450 entrants in the competition. I invited posters from infants and primary school students and essays from secondary school students. The winners of the two secondary school categories are here today in the gallery, and I welcome them. I would like to take this opportunity to share with honourable members the thoughts of these young people. The first essay was written by Lesley Debono, a year 8 student from Richmond High School. His essay, entitled 'Our environment: our future', reads: Today, one of the most talked about subjects is the environment, when we hear the word ""environment"", what comes to mind? Pollution, conservation, ecology? Unfortunately, it seems we have built up a negative picture of our environment, our surroundings. Ever since the late 1700's, the beginning of the industrial revolution, we began to harm our planet on a world wide scale. No one at that time realised what devastating damage that things such as factories could do, nor the misery and unhygienic conditions population explosions resulted in. My argument is that we should conserve our environment for our future. Today things are improving, mainly through awareness, but will we have an environment to look forward to in the future? Firstly, we need to look at what exactly our environment is. Basically it is our surroundings. This includes where we live, work and play. It also includes places that are untouched by humans, such as forests and oceans. We need our environment to sustain our basic needs such as food and water but we also use many other resources such as coal and gas. We can therefore conclude that the state of where we live (local environment) reflects our own health and attitudes. However the earth is a very complex system of smaller environments and are all linked one way or another. For example; pollution that originates at factories is usually carried by the wind (or water) to another area, thus affecting an entirely different area. We have all heard of the problems with our environment. Air, water and soil pollution being main forms. Environmental pollution is summed up as, ""poisonous or harmful substances which are discharged and affect the environment"". Apart from pollution, mining and logging are also harmful activities to the environment. All of these disturbhas ances upset the balance in which nature depends on to keep things stable. If one species of plant goes extinct the animals which used to eat would in tum die out and so on. Another important aspect is health. When water is polluted may absorb the toxic substances and when we or other animals eat the fish we may get sick, so in this example, the chemicals are carried back into our environments. At present we know now a lot more about our environment than we used to. Without a healthy environment we will surely suffer the consequences. That is why we must take action now and hopefully find a solution to these problems. Today there are many options we can take to help our environment. Recycling is something just about everyone has heard of and if everyone participated it would make a noticeable impact. Choosing the right products, with little or no potentially harmful materials, such as CFC-free spray cans, would soon get noticed by the manufacturing companies. Writing to politicians and important public figures is necessary because just like anyone else, they aren't mind readers. Awareness is a vital key to make all this work and should continue so that everyone is informed on what is going on and what they can do. Other than this we may hope that a discovery or discoveries will be made in the not-todistant future and change our lives for the better. So in summary, our environment is our surroundings. Yet it is connected in a complex web to all other places. We need our environment to survive, for its supplies us with everything. Recently, it has been and continues to be damaged like it never has been. We the people, everyone of us, are responsible for its well being. It must be taken care of and shared by all. We must strive for a balanced and natural environment, not only for the health and well being of ourselves but our children and their descendants for many generations to come. eRA Ltd: Workplace Reform",100
237,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier today I referred to actions by eRA to manipulate changes to industrial legislation to destroy the right of employees to collectively negotiate. The strategies and tactics of eRA are repudiated by most sensible, law-abiding, responsible employer organisations and their individual companies. Sadly, however, the the actions of eRA are clouding the achievements of the last decade during which the work force has made considerable sacrifices to ensure our country is more productive and intemationally competitive. Workplace reform been achieved by trust between employer and employee, but the actions of eRA are injecting into workplace reform a nasty capital labour conflict which is totally unthe fish living in it necessary. eRA, which according to Business Review Weekly is the seventh most profitable company in the nation, is currently forcing upon workers at Bell Bay in Tasmania, and Weipa in Queensland, individual employment contracts which are unique in the employment history of this country-unique in the absolute power and discretion they give to the employer vis-a-vis the employee; contracts that give the employee no rights whatsoever; contracts the aims of which are to abolish the award safety net; contracts that will mean in the end that there will be no minimum standards for these workers. What eRA is about is deunionising the work force as the first step in crushing the award system. These contracts are absolutely one-sided affairs straight out of the Liberal Party's Jobsback policy of the last election. The workers either agree to the individual contract or their prospects are finished in the company. It is the contract or the door. Of course, eRA does not present its strategy and tactics like this. It has in place a sophisticated Orwellian strategy and tactical response to camouflage from the work force and the broader Australian community its real intent. I call this strategy plan X. eRA hides its policies behind a screen of secret words like change process, reform, differential rewards, conversion and behavioural change. Behind the jargon, the reality is that Big Brother knows best. It wants a world where all employees have to take what the boss wants to give them-take it or leave it. The chosen instrument for these primitives whose ideal world was the relationship of lord and master in the Middle Ages is the individual contract. It is usually a piece of paper pushed at employees, usually with a short deadline. There is usually a carrot of more money now, but no framework for future increases or review. At Bell Bay it has implemented plan X carefully. It has modelled it on events at its aluminium smelter in New Zealand where it has driven out the unions and forced workers into accepting individual contracts. Only last year a survey of Bell Bay workers paid for by the company showed that 80 to 90 per cent rejected the idea of a contract. In June this year almost all accepted the idea. The work force had been softened up by the one in four redundancies in a drumbeat of propaganda that the plant was under threat. Only signing the contracts, eRA said, could save the plant. eRA created a climate of fear in less than a year to diminish the union's role with the work force to collectively negotiate. The manipulation of fear was what eRA had learnt from its experiences in New Zealand and is now what it is trying to replicate throughout this country. Plan X, a secret strategy and its associated tactical manoeuvres, is easily ascertained from evidence in the IRe where unions are challenging the eRA attempts at individual contracts at Bell Bay. It is also evident in a 1992 book co-authored by eRA executives entitled The right to choose. The evidence in this book and the evidence from the commission fleshes out plan X. Basically, plan X is a manual on how New Zealand management crushed its work force and how this could be done in Australia to bypass our industrial relations system and to bust open the award system. eRA essentially sets out to create an unreal mythology about its business in an attempt to blackmail the work force into the introduction of individual contracts. In New Zealand, eRA developed and implemented plan X to create myths to undermine the unions in the hearts and minds of workers. It cost it a lot of money, just as the implementation of the plan in Weipa and Bell Bay has cost it a lot of money. Luring workers onto individual contracts with healthy overaward payments is the first step. The company then says, 'I'm your friend now. You will not have to waste money on union dues.' The process begins. At the New Zealand smelter, the first part to soften up the workers was to use housekeeping and safety as its initial thrust. It made improvements in safety to demonstrate its caring for the work force and to make it difficult for the union to resist and oppose change. Of course, it should have been in the interests of the workplace in the first place for eRA to promote safety initiatives. The next step in New Zealand and here is to make full use of opportunities from the external environment. Essentially what this means is to threaten closure of the plant unless all workers agree to individual contracts and the deunionisation of the plant. Individual contracts are presented as the only alternative if employees want to save their jobs. Here the company is brutally exploiting the desire for job security in the work force. The evidence acknowledges that CRA believes that the ability of management to create a climate of fear is difficult when the plant and the company is profitable. Nevertheless it moves on by creating more myths. It sets out to remove the union completely from the work force. (Time expired) CRA Ltd: Workplace Reform",101
238,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (7.45 p.m.)I was going to let the House rise early until I realised that Bill Ludwig's mouthpiece was here telling us how he has to be protected. Bill's income has to be protected because CRA is doing the dreadful thing of taking away his income! The income consisted of the union dues that used to be deducted and sent off-in this case, to the AWU and others. I have talked to a lot of people in Western Australia where CRA has managed to come to workplace agreements and special contracts with its work force. The interesting thing that I have found is that none of these people seem to want Bill Ludwig's protection. They are certainly not going to welcome the intervention of the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) because, after all, he lives on one side of Australia and most of the people affected by these arrangements live on the other. Mr Swan-It shows you how much you know.",103
239,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I know because these people used to ring me. We heard all this rubbish when Robe River was making alterations to its operations. People used to ring me at that time and say, 'For goodness sake, will you please stand behind what Charles Copeman and the others are doing because it is the first time since we've been here that we have had any pride as workers.' People will cop a lot of things, including union interference. But these fellows are brawny types; they have a lot of difficulty getting two in the same crane cabin. They are not allowed to have only one in the cabin, notwithstanding that that is what the cabin was designed for. We had the situation where this was supposed to be for the protection of workers. They have a side of lamb as their crib. They drive the train there and back to pick up a load of iron ore. This does nothing for Australia's reputation. The simple fact is that workers concerned have not been bludgeoned into these arrangements. The other day a desperate attempt was made to reach agreement with the people on the oil rigs. They eventually came to an agreement almost over the dead bodies of the trade union bureaucrats. This issue has to be seen for what it is all about. These workers are not like the people we saw in the British industrial revolution, who were severely exploited. They have had the benefit over many years-in the case of most of those workers, during Liberal years-of a good education, and they understand their worth. I have dealt with hundreds of them in the north-west over my lifetime, be they working for the local authority or other organisations. On one occasion the guys come to me as shire president and said, 'We are going 150 miles into the bush to do a job on a piece of road and we would like to finish that job in 10 days and work straight through the weekend. It is not worth coming home for the weekend. Could we then have four days off!' I said that that suited me and I could not see why the council would object to that arrangement. But the union objected. It demanded that, if the fellows worked through, at their request, for that time, they should be paid the penalty rates applicable. So the council said it was not going to pay the penalty rates and that, even though they worked in a large local authority with 1,500 miles of road, they would have to go home for the weekend. The fellows were not very happy about that. They were very put out. Most importantly, I have been told time and time again by people throughout the Pilbara that they wanted out not just because of the union fees that were deducted. Every now and then Bill Ludwig or someone else would get a flash of inspiration that the workers had to make a further contribution-for a purpose totally unrelated to the welfare of workers on that mine site-and a further $10 or $20 would come out of their pay. It might have been the week when mum was thinking of buying a pair of shoes for the kids. But, tough, it was gone. Those people have had enough of that. They are not at all put out by all of this. At Geraldton Veterans Retirement Home in my own electorate one woman said, 'This is the first time in my working life that I have got a roster that suits me.' The union stepped in over the top with the legislation of the government and said, 'You cannot have that roster. We are taking over. We know what is best for you. We are going to represent your interests.' We know what they are on about. They want the money. The union bureaucrats are interested in one sort of job securitytheirs. That is what is outrageous about these things. Your typical Australian does not need the help of the Bill Ludwigs of this world. They have demonstrated their ability to negotiate.

240,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"The second essay was written by Kellie Titchmarsh, a year 11 student at Windsor High School, entitled 'One community; one environment': 'How many roads must a man walk down, before you call him a man? Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail, before she sleeps in the sand?'. When Bob Dylan wrote this song in 1962, I wonder if he knew that these questions would thirty-two years later. But today, they're not just questioning human nature and war. They can be interpreted to question our society, and most importantly, our community and environment. It seems that this song is ageless. Who can say how many seas that white dove will have to sail before she can sleep in the sand? Maybe the question should be 'How long will a white dove have to struggle through Sydney's smog to find a beach or river bank safe enough to sleep on?' And the man walking down the road-will that road be surrounded by trees and grass? Or by heartless, grey buildings, busily polluting the air we suck in? Regardless of where that man is walking, the scenery is effecting us all. One building puffing away in Richmond effects the air quality in MarayIya, just the same as one tree in Cattai can help improve air quality in Pitt Town. Everytime someone in Wiseman's Ferry pollutes the Hawkesbury River, it comes down to the people and wildlife in Windsor. As a car travels to Penrith, the smog it pumps out doesn't just effect the driver. It effects us all, regardless of who we are or where we live. Things like that just don't come into it. A few years back, we began to worry about the environment. But that small flurry of concern, that ripple in the pool of global emergency hasn't been enough to make us all stand up and do our part. When the bushfires created havoc in January, it wasn't the fact that I'd wake up to a smoke-surrounded house each morning, or that we couldn't go anywhere without returning smeIling like smoke that sticks in my memory. What I remember most, what is really engraved in my memory is that we all did our bit to either help put out the fires or prevent them in some way. We worked together, as one, to not only protect houses and lives, but also to stop the destruction of the trees and wildlife. The newspapers, radio and television all pulled together. We had firemen coming to help from all over Australia. We all helped, because the people whose houses were being burnt weren't the only ones losing part of their lives. NSW is a part of Australia, and the fires had to be extinguished. Just like if a room in your house is on fire. You try to put it out. And NSW is just part of the home that we call Australia. WiIl it always take an emergency to pull us together? 'Smile on your brother. Get together everybody. It's time to love one another right now. ' If these had been the words of Freud, or Einstein, instead of some Woodstock chant, would they have actually meant something? It's one thing to sing along, it's stiIl be asked another to hear the words. But do we hear the words of Mother Earth as she hurtles through space? Do we hear her tears as we poIlute her with our 'advanced technology'? Maybe we do and maybe we don't, but the key word there is 'we'. It's not enough for only NSW to try and curb the use of c.F.C's. It has to be a group effort. The environment is not separated into countries. How could it be? We have to realise that we have only one Earth. 'We are one, but we are many, and from all the lands on Earth we come.' All the countries on Earth all have one inescapable thing in common-they are all one Earth. In this instance, they are, we are, one. We all benefit from the different cultures, but all suffer from the environmental disasters. People living in the Persian Gulf aren't the only ones suffering the results of the oil smothering wildlife and vegetation. It also effects Australia, Malaysia, and everywhere else on Earth, just the same as the rubbish on the Himilayan trails in Nepal and over grazing in Australia effects Poland and Argentina. We are one community with one environment. Maybe we should keep that in mind as we carve up sand dunes in our four wheel drives, or scar the alps with roads and railway tracks. In maths, we are taught that everytime you add to one, it gets bigger and bigger. Then you divide, and multiply and so on and so forth until that one big number is just a fraction of what it was in the first place. Is our environment travelling on that road? Well, let's see. One piece of rubbish in Richmond. Plus two oil leaks from cars in Pitt Town. Divided by some rubbish dumped in Penrith. Three local towns contributing so generously to our environmental disarray. Four towns working in one community to rectify their mistakes. One community, one world, one environment. Our environmental problems could be looked at differently. From now on, Australia can stop logging. Africa can stop air pollution, while the USA can handle water pollution. Each country can have a different responsibility. Or: We can all do our bit, all make an effort to help save our environment. We can achieve this together, so we can pass on a clean, safe and healthy environment to our children and grandchildren. If we truly believe that 'we are one' our problems can be rectified. So the man walking down the road won't have to hold his nose and shut his eyes, and the dove can finally find a safe, clean beach to upon. eRA Ltd: Workplace Reform",104
241,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"In CRA's plan X the work force is essentially seen as something to be manipulated into signing individual contracts. There was never any serious discussion about sharing productivity. Of course, Bell Bay is just a rehearsal for the rest of CRA and Australia. The plot is simple. Con the workers with myths, beat the drum of safety to show a caring face, steel the workers to some external threat to their jobs, create a void in industrial relations in the plan and then stampede the workers into signing a contract. The counsel for the ACTU, Mr Merkel QC, summed it up well in the arbitration commission when he said: What emerged on May 25 (Bell Bay) was not an overnight job. It was a long thought out plan to . . . ultimately deunionise the workplace, as occurred in New Zealand to put all employees on individual contracts subject to the employer's discretion, and thereby get the work force in a condition which is relatively unprecedented in the modern industrial environment in this country ... contracts give the employee no rights whatsoever except to their pay and when it comes. CRA is one of the largest companies in Australia and one of the most profitable. We should be entitled to expect from it a sense of responsibility, a sense of leadership. Instead, in the Bell Bay case, evidence from the commission makes it clear that it intends to pervert the changes in labour legislation in this country in pursuit of ideology. What CRA is up to is very cynical and very sly. I know they are strong words, but I think the evidence from the commission and from CRA's public statements justifies those words. There is an indifference not only to the individual rights of workers but also to the wider interests of this country. In the past decade in this country we have built a better and more sustainable industrial reform framework. At a time of recession, the workers of Australia have made their share of sacrifices in real wage terms. In the eyes of CRA, none of that matters. The problem with CRA is that it sees collective bargaining as being incompatible with productivity growth and continuing rest organisational change. Even if that were true in New Zealand, it certainly is not true of many of the plants CRA operates in this country, where unions have led the way in workplace reform. What I fear from CRA's tactics is that the imposition of this foreign strategy will destroy the goodwill of the Australian work force in an environment where the threats to job security employed by CRA in New Zealand will not be effective. When a company as profitable as CRA is employing these tactics in the context of a strongly growing economy, we can only conclude that CRA is being reckless and playing a very dangerous industrial game with our industrial future. In Australia we have a tripartite system of industrial relations based on standards recognised and used by the rest of the world. 'Tripartite' means workers and employers, or their representatives, and the government working cooperatively to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes-that is, avoiding conflict and gaining productivity. In the last 10 years under the tripartite system conflict has been at an all time low. Hours lost through industrial disputes pale into insignificance when compared with the years of conflict and polarisation which made the Fraser federal government infamous. The tripartite system works. It has even worked under past conservative governments at various times. The last example of a group choosing to step outside these tripartite arrangements in Australia was the airline pilots, who pursued substantial and unwarranted increases in their remuneration. I would compare plan X from CRA with what the pilots did. It is in the same vein: CRA is attempting to step outside the system. Australian society judged the pilots harshly, as I am certain they will CRA for its uncooperative and indulgent pursuits in industrial relations. Even with new opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity through enterprise bargaining, CRA wants to destroy the system. We can only conclude that it is blindly following an ideology. And we know why. Because the New Zealand experience has given CRA a dream to pursue. CRA has not had to share its productivity gains with its work force.",105

(2) Is it a fact that (a) Medibank Private benefits for psychologists' services are offered in Victoria but not New South Wales and (b) a Medibank Private subscriber residing in Wodonga, Vic., could Duration of Arrangement From July 1993 with annual review Hospital provides the following services to the Royal Duration of Arrangement Yearly Yearly claim a rebate if consulting a clinical psychologist registered in Victoria and New South Wales practising in Wodonga but could not claim a rebate if the same psychologist was consulted in Albury, NSW.",108
244,Dr LAWRENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. The National Health Act requires that health funds be registered separately in each State in which they operate and this requirement has been in force since 1970. At the inception of these requirements, and since that time, most States have had a major fund which developed benefits for its local market. Benefit arrangements therefore evolved with State by State variations. It was only after Medibank Private was established with national coverage that the market took on a more competitive nature as Medibank Private entered the market with different characteristics and products. Medibank Private had to develop products (including the benefits payable) which would enable it to compete with the then existing major Fund. (a) (i) For the names of services and treatments, not universally covered by Medibank Private, see the respective attachments for hospital and ancillary services. (ii) For the States in which services and treatments are not universally covered by Medibank Private see the respective attachments for hospital and ancillary services. (iii) Services and treatments are not covered in some States because Medibank Private has made a business decision on the range of benefits it will provide in the States concerned. (iv) This information is regarded by Medibank Private as commercially sensitive. (v) This information is regarded by Medibank Private as commercially sensitive. (b) The Health Insurance Commission, trading as Medibank Private, is registered as a health benefits organisation in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Act, and operates a separate Medibank Private fund in each State. (The Northern Territory is included with the New South Wales fund.) Medibank Private (as is the case with all registered health insurance funds) is therefore able to offer benefits for any treatment, service or appliance which falls within the meaning of 'health insurance business' as defined in that Act. (c) Each Medibank Private fund (and, indeed, all registered health insurance funds) regularly reviews the range and amounts of its benefits to reflect local market conditions. (d) A comparison of monthly direct family premiums for the Super Extras Table, which offers the widest range of benefits and the highest benefits levels, is as follows: New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory$57.50 Northern Territory-$39.50 Victoria-$46.80 Queensland-$49.60 South Australia-$49.40 Western Australia-$46.30 Tasmania-$36.30 (2) (a) Yes. This would also be true of other funds which did not offer the same benefit in both States. (b) No. Medibank Private has extended recognition for benefit purposes to clinical psychologists practising in Albury. Members of Medibank Private in Victoria would therefore be eligible to claim benefits in respect of services rendered by such providers.

Medicare: General Practitioner Rebates (Question No. 1344) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Has the Government changed the rules for reviewing rebates under Medicare for general medical practitioners; if so, (a) how and (b) why. (2) Did the Government agree to fund general practitioners divisions to increase involvement in health promotion and preventive health projects; if so, (a) what were the terms of the agreement, (b) were general practitioners given guarantees regarding Medicare rebates for general practitioners' services; if so, what were they, and (c) has the Government changed the agreement; if so, (i) how and (ii) why.",111
245,Dr LAWRENCE,ACT NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Decisions about the level of Medicare Schedule fee increases, if any are taken by Government each year in the Budget context. In considering the extent of any fee increases the Government has regard for its Medical Fees Index, which includes components for the Consumer Price Index and Average Award Rates of Pay as well as prevailing economic conditions at the time, productivity increases in medical services and technology. There has been no change to this process. (2) The 1992/93 Budget introduced a detailed strategy to strengthen general practice. Part of strategy included the establishment of local networks or 'divisions' for general practitioners. These networks are now in place and are taking an active role in encouraging greater involvement on the part of general practitioners in health promotion and preventive health projects. Funding for these projects are application based and are assessed by committees having representation from the medical profession, consumer organisations and the Department. (a) There was no agreement. (b) No. The Government has never given any commitment on rebates for either GPs or specialists. (c) There was no agreement. Nursing Homes: Grants (Question No. 1356) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Did she announce on 6 July 1994 the provision of a $23.9 million grant to upgrade 144 nursing homes; if so (a) what are the names and addresses of the nursing homes to which funds have been allocated, (b) what is the breakdown of funding for each home, (c) how many applications were received for the funding, (d) what criteria were used to select successful applicants and (e) what formula was used to determine the sums allocated.",116
246,Dr LAWRENCE,ACT NSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 8 July 1994 the Minister for Human Services and Health announced the provision of grants totalling $23.9 million to upgrade 144 nursing homes. (a) & (b) A list of approved projects containing names and addresses of the nursing homes approved and the amount of funding provided to each is provided. (c) 166 applications for funding were received. (d) Funding under this initiative is available to this all non-government nursing homes except transferred homes (homes previously deficit funded under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act). Criteria applied in assessing projects was as follows: the upgrade involved substantial construction work costing at least $30,000; the upgrade would contribute to the well being of nursing home residents; and the upgrading work had not been completed at the time of the application. (e) Provisional grants are calculated based on a formula which applies 65% of the Commonwealth 10 year bond rate of 1 January 1994 to the capital cost of the project or the maximum cost for subsidy purposes whichever was the lesser.

(Question No. 1357) Mr Ronaldson asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Is the Government pursuing extradition proceedings against Mr Christopher Skase; if so, (a) did the Commonwealth initiate legal proceedings which preceded the application for extradition; if so, (i) what proceedings, (ii) which Departments have been involved in the proceedings, (iii) what expenses were incurred by each Department in respect of the proceedings, (iv) what additional expenses have been incurred and (v) are there any outstanding costs associated with the proceedings, (b) which Departments have been involved in the extradition proceedings, (c) what expenses were incurred by each Department, (d) are any costs associated with the proceedings yet to be paid, (e) what further costs are expected to be in proceeding with the extradition application, (f) does the Government expect the extradition application to succeed, (g) are any costs to the Commonwealth expected to be recovered and (h) is he aware of any realisable or other assets held by Mr Skase in Australia; if so, is the Commonwealth able to apply for the forfeiture of the assets to offset its costs in extradition and associated proceedings.",116
247,Mr LAVARCH,PROJECTS APPROVED FOR FUNDING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, the Government has requested the extradition from Spain of Mr Skase. (a) Yes. (a)(i) I am advised that the proceedings which preceded the application for extradition were as follows. On 27 May 1991 Mr Skase was arrested and charged with two offences against subsection 229(4) of the Companies (Queensland) Code. On 31 August 1992 two ex-officio indictments against Skase were presented in the District Court in Brisbane. Those indictments alleged that Mr Skase had committed two offences against section 129 of the Companies (Queensland) Code, one offence against subsection 229(1) of the above Code and 29 offences against subsection 229(4) of the same Code. On 24 November 1993 7 warrants were obtained for the arrest of Mr Skase in relation to alleged breaches of section 267 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. On 7 January 1994 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) applied to the Brisbane District Court for a warrant for the arrest of Mr Skase in relation to the 32 alleged offences set out in the above two indictments presented in the District Court in Brisbane on 31 August 1992. That warrant was issued on 25 January 1994. (a)(ii) I am advised that the Commonwealth agencies involved in the above proceedings were the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) and the Commonwealth DPP. (a)(iii) I am advised that the expenses incurred by the ASC and the DPP in the above proceedings were as follows: ASC: $111,312; DPP: $65,169 (Note that the above figures do not include figures relating to salaries for staff involved in the proceedings. These figures are not available). (a)(iv) I am advised that no additional expenses have been incurred. (a) (v) I am advised that there are no outstanding incurred costs associated with the proceedings. (b) I am advised that the Commonwealth agencies which have been involved in the extradition proceedings are the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Commonwealth DPP and the ASC. (c) I am advised that-as at the beginning of September 1994-the expenses incurred by the above agencies in relation to the extradition proceedings were as follows: Attorney-General's Department -$64,860; ASC -$18,959; Commonwealth DPP-$65,063; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-$6,606 (Note that the above figures do not include figures relating to salaries for staff involved in the proceedings. These figures are not available). (d) I am advised that the Commonwealth DPP has outstanding costs of $86,328 which are yet to be paid. (e) I am advised that the decision of the Spanish Court in relation to Skase's extradition is currently under appeal. Assuming that the extradition application is successful, the Commonwealth DPP will be required to meet the costs of bringing Mr Skase back to Australia with the appropriate level of medical care. It is not presently possible to quantify the costs which this may involve. (f) The question of whether the extradition application will succeed is a matter for the Spanish authorities. It would not be appropriate for the Government to speculate on the outcome of the proceedings. (g) I am not aware of any costs to the Commonwealth which are expected to be recovered. (h) I am not aware of any such assets held by Mr Skase in Australia. Department of Social Security: Electronic (Question No. 1364) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (I) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (I) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department is developing a number of pilot projects to test the feasibility accessible information network for Department of Social Security clients called the Community Information Platform Pilot. This was announced in the Government's White paper on Employment and Growth (Working Nation). The system will be pilot tested over the next 18 months. It will make available information on Social Security and other assistance and can be used by individuals, groups and organizations to communicate electronically. (2) In most cases access to the system will be personal computer and modem. The Department of Social Security will also be setting up a number of outlets around the country. These will include community centres and other publicly accessible locations. (3) A wide range of public outlets are being considered, including the provision of access through local libraries. Department of Communications and the Arts: Electronic Information (Question No. 1368) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (I) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries Information to house the services and foster public access. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Communications and the Arts itself has no immediate plans to provide public access electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres. Likewise, no services of this kind are provided by Australia Post, Telecom, the Special Broadcasting Service or the Spectrum Management Agency. A number of agencies within the Communications and the Arts portfolio do, however, provide such services. Details are set out below: Australian Broadcasting Authority (I) The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) is located in two offices, one in Sydney and one in Canberra. It therefore currently provides no public access points itself for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres of creating an around Australia. The ABA will however consider the issue of providing access to public documents and databases at public access points via Internet as part of its Corporate Information Technology Plan. The Plan is scheduled to be completed in December 1994. Some of the documents which could be made available in this way include submissions on the ABA's public planning process, including comments on draft licence area plans; draft and final via licence area plans; discussion papers on program standards and other programming issues; broadcasting codes of practice. In terms of off-line electronic information, the ABA has provided complete microfiche sets of first and second round submissions on the Planning Priorities document (released September 1993) to industry groups, selected public libraries and libraries of selected tertiary institutions. The representative broadcasting industry groups (FACfS, FARB and CBAA) provided access to their members. Similar public access was made available for microfiche copies of the Frequency Allotment Plan released on 19 August 1994. (2) If it were decided to provide this on-line service, a host machine in the ABA would be set up as a Gopher server, and would be accessible using normal Internet procedures. In terms of off-line services, industry groups, selected public libraries and libraries of selected tertiary institutions were requested by letter to accept the ABA's planning documents and to make the microfiche available, in the case of industry groups to their members, and in respect of libraries for public access. (3) Those municipal libraries that have connections to the Internet would be able to provide public access to this information if the on-line service being investigated goes ahead. As far as the ABA's Library (which has access to the Internet) is aware, public access to Internet is not currently available through municipal libraries. In terms of off-line services, those libraries with microfiche facilities were considered in the selection of libraries to provide public access to the planning documents mentioned above. The number of public libraries and libraries of selected tertiary institutions in each State or Territory, provided with copies of submissions and synopses on microfiche, were: Australian Capital Territory-3; New South Wales-24; Victoria-II; Queensland-18; South Australia-8; Western Australia-II; Tasmania-2; and the Northern Territory-5. The ABA will continue to use those libraries for public access to microfiche copies of submissions and synopses to the exposure drafts and final production of broadcasting licence area plans. NA (1) AUSTEL operates a Bulletin Board Service, an electronic information service developed principally to assist in the flow of documents to and from AUSTEL and the telecommunications standardisation community in Australia and overseas. The service is also used to provide information on telecommunications compliance issues (eg AUSTEL Permitted Products listings, AUSTEL Certified Components Listings, and AUSTEL Advice to Industry) and an additional avenue for distribution of other AUSTEL information on activities such as numbering, basic carriage service tariffs and media releases. Access to the AUSTEL BulIetin Board Service is open to any interested person and is free of charge other than the cost of the telecommunications connection which is borne by the caller. (2) The AUSTEL Bulletin Board operates on a single stand alone personal computer (PC) with associated software and communications hardware and is located at AUSTEL's premises in Melbourne. The Bulletin Board contains information in the form of documents which can be downloaded by the users. Access to the Bulletin Board Service is available to the public by the use of a PC, appropriate software and a modem dialling up through the public telephone network into the Bulletin Board. Work is currently being undertaken which will permit access to the Bulletin Board through Packet Switched Networks, eg AUSTPAC, and through the INTERNET. (3) Given its basic purpose of servicing a specific user group, the need to continuously update information and respond to user messages, current arrangements for the AUSTEL Bulletin Board Service would seem appropriate. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) (I) The ABC does not provide, and has no immediate plans to provide services using public access points such as municipal libraries, or community centres. However the ABC provides Radio and Television broadcasts which can be accessed by municipal libraries and community centres, if appropriate receiver equipment is available at such premises. ABC books, magazines and recorded cassettes could also form a part of publicly accessible assets of municipal libraries. The ABC also envisages that if the ABC produced multimedia CDs, they could be accessed by the public if appropriate arrangements were made by libraries. (2) The matter of accommodating/operating any of the above facilities is outside the scope of the ABCs current role. (3) The ABC constantly endeavours to provide culturally relevant, innovative and comprehensive broadcasting programs (both radio and television) to all Australians. The ABC also provides material based on such programs, for example, video tapes, CDs and books. The latter can be accessed by the Australian public wherever such material is held by municipal libraries. The ABC has set up an internal multimedia working group that is currently looking into the production of multimedia products. Future interactive services may provide links between program providers such as the ABC and public access points such as public libraries and community centres. However, the related technology is still evolving. The ABC is closely monitoring developments in these areas. Australian Archives (1)&(2) The Australian Archives operates and maintains two publicly available finding aids in the form of on-line databases which describe the records in its custody. Access to these databases is available in the Archives' public search rooms which are located in each State capital and in Canberra and Darwin. On-line access to both databases is also available to the public at the Australian War Memorial. In addition, microfiche versions of the databases are prepared annually and made available for research at each of the locations mentioned above. Copies of the microfiche are available for purchase by any organisation or individual. State and regional libraries are among those which purchase copies of the fiche for their collections. (3) The Archives proposes that information about its record holdings will be made available nationalmaintaining ly and internationally through the Internet (via AARNET - the Australian Academic Research centres. Network). It is expected that, by the end of 1994 electronic mail and textual information about the Archives will be available on the Internet, and that by the end of 1995 this will be supplemented by access to read only copies of the two aid databases mentioned in (1) above. Access to this information will then be available to all users of Internet, including public and university libraries, many of which have access to the Internet. This will greatly facilitate access to information about the Archives' record holdings public who do not currently have access to one of the Archives' public search rooms or to a copy of the microfiche made available for purchase. Film Australia (1)-(3) Film Australia Pty Ltd sells many of its National Interest Programs and other titles to which facilitate access for secondary use of these programs after TV broadcast. National Museum of Australia (1) The National Museum of Australia is develaccess oping three major projects that will disseminate electronic information about the National Collection to Australians whether they live in regional, district or suburban centres of the country. Internet The National Museum established access to Internet by becoming an AARNET subscriber. National Museum will soon become an Internet provider disseminating text-based information on the collections and the Museum to Internet scribers in Australia and overseas. PRism The National Museum, in association with a Canberra based company, Digital Information Systems for Collections Pty Ltd, is developing a multimedia based museum information program called PRism. An electronic information distribuNational tion system will be created when PRism is linked to Internet. The system will provide world-wide access by both individuals and institutions based information, images, video clips and oral histories about the National Museum's collections. MOTE (Museum on the Ether) The National Museum is developing a pilot electronic outreach program called MOTE, Museum on the Ether. MOTE will involve five collecting institutions from around Australia and the National Museum working in collaboration to develop electronic network of collection databases with text-based information, digitised images, video and oral histories to widen access to Australia's material cultural heritage whilst preserving and collections within their communities whether they be in regional, district or suburban At the same time MOTE will research potential markets for electronic outreach programs, particularly the educational sector of the community and the potential for delivery of electronic outreach major finding programs into private homes. (2) Internet The National Museum is an AARNET subscriber and through AARNET is able to access Internet. Internet provides access to an estimated 25 million by members of the Pes world-wide. PRism PRism is a Windows-based multimedia museum information package that utilises Progress Version 7, a fourth-generation language and client/server relational database. PRism is being developed and accommodated within the Core Operations Division library systems of the National Museum. NA The National Museum will provide Internet and availability to all museums participating in the MOTE pilot. The project will be coordinated by the National Museum with participants accessing Internet through the National Museum's Unix server. The National Museum will subsidise Internet access for participating museums. (3) Within the scope of these three projects the National Museum is examining the feasibility of The providing Museum programs via a number of channels including municipal libraries, other cultural institutions as well as through emerging subbroad band and broadcast media. Australian National Maritime Museum (1)-(3) The Australian National Maritime Museum Library is a member of the Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) and contributes holdings to the Bibliographic Database. Thus people throughout Australia through their public, university, college or corporate library have electronic to textaccess to the Museum Library's holdings. At present the Museum does not distribute information about itself, its collections or activities in electronic form. However both the Museum Library and Information Systems section of the Museum are keen to establish links to the outside community through the Internet. Implementation would be a two staged program involving firstly an electronic mail communications to the Museum. The second stage involves access to electronic clips information such as hours of opening, annual report, forthcoming exhibitions and access to the Museum's inhouse databases through a Museum gopher server. To achieve this project significant expenditure is required both on a once off and ongoing basis and to date funding has not been able to be secured for this project. Public libraries form an important conduit to the Museum and its exhibitions and information services. They receive regular mailouts from the Museum's Public Affairs Section and refer many public enquiries to the Museum. It is hoped that they would form an important link in any access to electronic information along with other community based initiatives such as telecottages and also private Internet subscribers. National Gallery of Australia (1)-(3) Presently there is limited access to the National Gallery with anyon-line links. However, there are plans for expanding the access to the National Collection via on-line computer networks and other data transfer means. The library at the National Gallery has links with AARNET and Internet. There is also an on-line inter-library connection to UNILINC and holdings are also listed on the Australian Bibliographic Network. The Gallery is presently investigating ways of: (1) putting the works of art management system on-line and made accessible to the public. (2) including images of the 90,000 works of art in the National Collection on the works of art management system. These two projects are interconnected as the inclusion of images to this system would make the works of art management system a far more useful data base for the public to access. However, there are a number of aspects of policy yet to be resolved concerning access to this system: (a) confidentiality of information on the system (b) cost of on-line use and means of payment by users (c) copyright issues. The Gallery is also presently involved in other means of utilising new technologies to increase access to the National Collection. Video Conferencing using data and satellite links will enable people in remote areas to access not only the collection but also educators and curators. Presently trials are under-way with the Warlpiri people of the Tanami Desert. Artists from this remote region will be able to talk to other urban Aboriginal arts about an exhibition on display at the Gallery Urban Focus as well as speak to their works in the National Collection on display. Other trial projects are planned for school children, a major conference and connecting with various travelling exhibitions. Electronic publications are also in development. Expected to be completed early in 1995 is Aboriginal Art from Arnhem Land which is the first CDROM to be published by the Gallery and will give people access to a depth of information and images of art from this region. Other CD-ROMs are planned for the future. National Library of Australia (1) The National Library· of Australia (NLA) currently provides electronic information services through its Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) and Ozline services to over 1300 libraries throughout Australia. ABN makes available bibliographic information on the holdings of Australian libraries. Ozline provides access to a range of specialist Australian information databases and to selected overseas databases, and is now the country's major provider of Australian information online. The majority of public libraries in Australia are able to use these services, either directly or via arrangements with their State libraries. Approximately 150 public library authorities are currently members of ABN. On 7 September, I gave approval for the Library to negotiate a contract with CSC Australia for the development of the National Document and Information Service to replace and augment the present ABN and Ozline services. This will enable the Library to provide a new range of services for use by the public directly, as well as by librarians and other information intermediaries who have been the major clientele of the Library'S services to date. (2) Use of the NLA services in public libraries is through terminals/workstations situated in those libraries and supported by public library staff. (3) The National Library has targeted public libraries as clients for its electronic services for many years. The Library has encouraged State libraries to assist public libraries in each State to form local access points to the very rapidly developing range of electronic information available through communication networks, including the Internet. Australia Council (1) The Australia Council does not at present distribute information electronically on the Programs of Assistance it offers, nor has it any plans to supply this information electronically in the near future. The Australia Council Library provides or will provide public access to electronic information through: NA Online catalogue to UNILINC libraries (including Australia Council Library) Bibliographic and full text databases In-house publications of subject bibliographies Pamphlet index. ABN OZLINE (Australian databases) Australian Library catalogues. ILANET (State Library of NSW electronic network) Document delivery (or Inter library loans) OCLC firstsearch (International Bibliographic databases) CARL Uncover (International Document Delivery service). (2) The above services will be accommodated in the Australia Council's Library. Public access is or will be provided through public terminals. All Australia Council publications and newly acquired items are added to the UNILINC database which is accessible through all UNILINC member libraries (eg University of Western Sydney, Bankstown Public Library, etc). It is hoped that subject bibliographies and pamphlet index file will be accessed through ILANET. (3) The Australia Council Library uses Australia's extensive network of municipal public libraries to facilitate access to its holding. Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories: Electronic Information (Question No. 1370) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribupublished tion of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) above be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access.",123
248,Mr BRERETON,UNILINC,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) My Department and Agencies within my portfolio do not fund public access points for the distribution of electronic information in centres around Australia. They do however publish information electronically and make this available to information centres around Australia, including universities, research institutions, public libraries, state Agencies, local government Agencies and schools. Electronic publication of information in the portfolio available to these groups is listed below. The Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN) in my Department, was established in 1991. It publishes information on Internet through the World Wide Web and Gopher to provide infrastructure for environmental resources planning, management and decision making. Information made available through these services includes the full text of departmental publications, some national datasets and links to portfolio and world wide information sources. My Department funds Council Net, a communications and information service designed specifically for local government all over Australia. It shares local information and local experience, using modem telecommunications through Pegasus. CouncilNet contains models of good practice, details of innovations, newsletters, news and coming events, descriptions of funding programs and policies of local, state and national governments. The Departmental Library publishes a Directory of Government Environment Departments, a Portfolio library guide, bibliographies and information about the library collection on the ERIN Gopher and World Wide Web. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) publishes information on climate and weather on Internet. Satellite images, weather forecasts and library information is published electronically. These publications are available through Gopher. The Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) produces a bibliographic service called HERA, containing over 20,000 references and abstracts to items on the National Estate. It includes both and unpublished material from Commonwealth and State environmental bodies and from the voluntary conservation movement. It is published on CD ROM and available on-line through the National Library of Australia's Ozline service. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) publishes brochures and information on Waterwatch electronically. This information is available through Nexus, a Telecom Australia service. Bibliographies and guides to the ANCA and Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG) Libraries are made available through the ERIN and ANBG Gopher and World Wide Web services. The Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG) publishes information electronically on Gopher and World Wide Web extensively. Botanical information and general information, including brochures, access to taxonomic databases and guides, are published through these Internet information services. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) provides a bibliographic service called REEF, a comprehensive bibliography of the literature on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It is interdisciplinary and multi-media. It is available on CD ROM and on-line through the National Library of Australia's Ozline service. The National Sport Information Centre produces AUSSPORT, the Australian Sport Index, which covers a wide range of topics including sports medicine, exercise, physiology, biomechanics, psychology, coaching, physical fitness, Olympic Games as well as specific sports. It is available online through the National Library of Australia's Ozline service. The holdings of the Centre are listed on the Australian Bibliographic Network, a National Library of Australia service. (2) Each service referred to in (I) is operated as part of an information delivery and publication commitment within the Department and Agencies within my portfolio. (3) Australia's municipal libraries are able to obtain access to all of the services listed in (1) through either the National Library of Australia's on-line services, Pegasus, Telecom's Nexus and Discovery services, the State Library of New South Wales ILANET service or other Internet valueadded resellers as appropriate. Federal Airports Corporation: Access (Question No. 1384) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What work has the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) commissioned from Access Research since 1988. (2) What was the cost of each project referred to in part (I). (3) Which projects were subjected to a publicly competitive process, such as tendering or expressions of interest, before the work was awarded. (4) Why was each project which was not subjected to a competitive process awarded to Access Research. (5) Is he able to say who owns Access Research and whether the owners have ever been employed by the FAC.",128
249,Mr BRERETON,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on advice from the PAC the answer is as follows: (1) There have been a total of seven projects since December 1991. 1. Evaluation of the FAC customer relations profile with Attitudinal Survey #1 2. Management of a May 1992 Aviation Industry Consultation Seminar 3. Consultation re airport retail strategies 4. Consultancy re market development planning for Badgerys Creek Airport, including government and community relations 5. Conduct of a freight potential study for Badgerys Creek Airport 6. Conduct at various PAC airports of customer relations Attitudinal Survey #2, as a follow-up to first survey 7. Consultation re 1993 Aviation Industry Consultation Seminar. (2) The gross cost of each project was: 1. $41,328.00 2. $43,343.80 3. $1,875.00 4. $97,359.58 5. $64,198.00 6. $38,599.73 7. $8,000.00 A significant percentage of the revenue was for direct outcosts incurred on behalf of the PAC, Research paying for services that are not linked to Access Research in any real commercial sense. In the period December 1991 to June 1994, direct outcosts paid by Access Research to other suppliers were $51,597.00 or 17.5 per cent of the total. (3) None of the projects was subject to a publicly competitive process. (4) The decision to first use Access Research was made by the Managing Director following advice of work previously performed for the Department of Tourism, and Access Research's reputation for expertise in research in the tourism and aviation industry. Subsequent contracts were awarded to Access Research as work performed was entirely satisfactory and for the purpose of maintaining continuity. (5) Access Research is a private company principally owned by its Managing Director, Graham Ross-Smith. No person associated with the company has ever been employed by the PAC. Pensioner Concessions: Commonwealth Reimbursements (Question No. 1398) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What reimbursements did the Commonwealth make to each State and Territory government in each quarter in 1993 and 1994 for the payment of pensioner concessions by State and Territory departments and instrumentalities. STATE{fERRITORY New South Wales Queensland Victoria South Australia Tasmania Australian Capital Territory Northern Territory Western Australia # # A one off payment for 1993 was made to STATE{fERRlTORY New South Wales Queensland Victoria South Australia Tasmania Australian Capital Territory Northern Territory Western Australia (2) The amount of the reimbursements for 1993/94 and 1994/95 were as agreed between the Commonwealth and the States{ferritories at the 5 July 1993 Premiers' Conference. The agreement provided for the reimbursement amounts to be increased having regard to any increase in the number of pensioners and any movements in the Consumer Price Index. These amounts were based on the increased costs to the States{ferritories of providing an agreed core group of concessions to the pensioners who became entitled to concessions because of the Commonwealth's decision to extend concessions to all part-rate pensioners. The core concessions relate to energy costs, municipal and (2) How are the reimbursements calculated. (3) Have reimbursements been adjusted, or will they be adjusted, to allow for the broadening of eligibility for concessions to part pensioners. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The first reimbursement made to States and Territories occurred during the 1993/94 financial year. Reimbursements by quarter since that time, were made as follows: 1993/94 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter $12,527,500 $12,527,500 $12,527,500 $12,527,500 $5,015,000 $5,015,000 $5,015,000 $5,015,000 $7,375,000 $7,375,000 $7,375,000 $7,375,000 $2,240,000 $2,240,000 $2,240,000 $2,240,000 $1,145,000 $1,145,000 $1,145,000 $1,145,000 $255,000 $255,000 $255,000 $255,000 $55,000 $55,000 $55,000 $55,000 $6,508,000 Western Australia in the 4th Quarter of 1993. 1994/95 1st Quarter $11,335,000 $5,657,750 $8,102,000 $3,223,250 $1,036,500 $231,250 $156,000 $2,848,500 water rates, public transport charges and motor vehicle fees. (3) The reimbursement outlined above is for the purpose of compensating the States and Territories for costs associated with the broadening of eligibility for concessions to part pensioners in April 1993. The Commonwealth makes no other financial contribution towards the cost of any concessions provided by States and Territories. States and Territories are free to determine their own concessions and the eligibility criteria for these. States have chosen to link them to Commonwealth Health Cards for administrative convenience. Medibank: Anaesthesia Rebates (Question No. 1402) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) Is it a fact that the hourly rate for rebates for anaesthesia under Medicare is approximately 40 per cent of the hourly rate rebated to other procedural specialist medical practitioners; if not, what is the percentage. (2) How is the hourly rate for rebates for anaesthesia determined. (3) Is there a large gap between the rebates and the fees charged; if so, (a) why and (b) what action will the Government take to relieve the burden on patients. (4) Does the Australian Medical Association support the dollar value using the Australian Society of Anaesthetists relative value guide. (5) Is the value guide referred to in part (4) excessive; if so, (a) to what extent, (b) on what basis and (c) what rate is reasonable, acceptable or warranted and why.",129
250,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) Fees listed in the Commonwealth's Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) are not based on hourly rates. The Schedule is structured on a fee for service basis. Accordingly, it is not possible to compare the MBS fees for one specialty against another, on an hourly basis. On the general issue of the relative value of services provided by different sections of the medical profession, my Department is currently developing a process with the medical profession which will hopefully result in a relative value study of fees across the MBS. (3) In 1993/94, 80% of the fees for all services which attracted Medicare rebates were charged at or below the MBS fee. In relation to anaesthesia specifically, fees charged were some 20% above MBS fees, on average. However, the Government has no legislative or other capacity to control doctors fees. I should mention that my Department has recently completed a major review of anaesthesia items in the MBS. This review was conducted with the participation and full co-operation of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists. (4) This is a matter for the Australian Medical Association. (5) My Department has undertaken to meet representatives from the Australian Society of Anaesthetists later this year to discuss the Society'S relative value guide. Department of Communication: Grants (Question No. 1415) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many grants did the Minister's Department make to individuals or organisations in the electoral division of Cowan in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) With respect to each grant made in (a) 199293 and (b) 1993-94, (i) under what program was it made, (ii) what was its value and (iii) what was the name of the recipient.

(2) Has her attention been drawn to five youth suicides which occurred in a small town in southem Queensland since August 1993. (3) Is she able to say whether the severe drought affecting Queensland and New South Wales is a factor in the level of suicide. (4) Is she sponsoring initiatives outside the Rural Adjustment Scheme to assist non-government organisations in providing remedial services to reverse the trends in rural suicide rates; if so, (a) what are the initiatives and (b) what funding will be provided in 1994-95.",134
255,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The most recent data available, covering the period 1988-92, indicates that the suicide rate in Australia was highest among young rural males between the ages of 15 and 24 years, at a rate of 32.6 per 100,000 population. (2) I was not aware that five male youth suicides had occurred in a small town in southern Queensland since August 1993. (3) I appreciate that the severe drought in the eastern part of Australia is causing great hardship and affecting rural people in many ways. However, although it is recognised that many factors impact on the rates of suicide, as yet there is no established link between drought and suicide rates. (4) I am particularly concerned about suicide rates among young people throughout Australia. Consequently, a number of initiatives which relate to suicide are being undertaken within my portfolio: The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) established a working party in 1992 to develop a national strategy for suicide prevention. The first stage of public consultation has already elicited over 80 submissions. A second stage of consultation will be undertaken when the draft strategy has been completed. It is expected that the final document will be considered by the NHMRC in June 1995. The NHMRC's Standing Committee on Quality of Health Care has established a working party to develop best practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in adolescents. It is expected that this project will be completed in about 18 months. The government has provided a significant Rural Suicide boost to funding for mental health in the 1994-95 budget. An additional $168.7 million is being committed over four years for specific initiatives in mental health. Of this amount, $133.6 million will be used to enhance the National Mental Health Strategy. This increases the Commonwealth funds available to support the strategy to $250 million over the next four years. Suicide prevention is being considered as one of the priority areas for the development of National Health Goals and Targets in Mental Health. The goals and targets are expected to be finalised in late 1994. Youth suicide has emerged as an important issue in the consideration of a national policy on child and youth health, which is currently being developed by a working party of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council. This working party has recently released a draft policy paper as the basis for community consultation. Heliport: Pyrmont (Question No. 1449) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 29 August 1994: (1) Has the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) conducted, commissioned or contracted for an assessment, inquiry or investigation into the proposed construction or development of a heliport at Pier 8, Pyrrnont, Sydney, or is it doing so. (2) Have any documents associated with the actions referred to in part (1) been made public; if so, what are the details. (3) If documents associated with the actions referred to in part (1) have not been made public, will they be made public; if so, what are the details. (4) Has any action referred to in part (1) included an examination of compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and other legal requirements which the CAA is responsible for monitoring or enforcing; if so, what are the details of the requirements. (5) Has any study of the climatic or meteorological factors affecting the approach and departure paths and final approach and take-off area for the heliport been conducted by or on behalf of the CAA; if so, (a) who conducted the study, (b) when was it conducted, (c) what were the findings and recommendations and (d) were the findings and recommendations published; if so, when. (6) Has the CAA been provided by (a) the heliport's proponents or (b) any other person with information relating to the proposed heliport's (i) fuel storage facilities, (ii) refuelling facilities, parking for helicopters or (iv) proposed maximum number of helicopter movements per day; if so, what are the details in each case. (7) Are (a) he, (b) his Department or (c) the CAA (i) empowered or (ii) required by legislation or regulation to conduct an inquiry in respect of the proposed heliport leading to an environmental impact statement, or equivalent, similar to that carried out before the construction of the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if so, what are the details.",146
256,Mr BRERETON,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. Following amendments to the Civil Aviation Regulations some time ago, a Helicopter Landing Site is no longer required to be approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). However, the Regulations do specify requirements in regard to the use of sites by helicopters. Regulation 92 states that' An aircraft (helicopter) shall not land at, or take off from, any place unless; . . . . (d) the place . . . . is suitable for use as an aerodrome (landing site) for the purposes of the landing and taking off of aircraft (helicopters); .... and having regard to all the circumstances of the proposed landing or take off (including the prevailing weather conditions), the aircraft can land at, or take of from, the place in safety'. Compliance with the Regulation is the responsibility of the pilot in command of the aircraft. However, whilst there may be a number of methods of ensuring compliance with Regulations, the Authority periodically issues Civil Aviation Advisory Publications (CAAP) which set out advice on meeting the requirements of a specific Regulation. Operators who adhere to the advice contained within a CAAP should be assured of regulatory compliance. With respect to Helicopter Landing Sites, the Authority has issued CAAP No 92-2(0), which includes both the criteria and site specifications for such sites. (2) No. Refer to question 1 response. (3) No. Refer to question 1 response. (4) No. However, the CAA has advised that the proponents of the heliport are aware of, and intend to comply with the recommended design criteria published in Civil Aviation Advisory Publication 92-2, and the aircraft refuelling precautions required by Civil Aviation Order 20.9. (5) No study has been conducted, to the knowledge of the CAA, on climatic or meteorological factors. (6)(i) Fuel storage facilities: Proponents have advised of intention to store aviation turbine fuel and a small quantity of aviation gasoline fuel. (iii) Storage will be in accordance with regulatory requirements. (ii) Refuelling facilities: Not known-there is no regulatory requirement for the operator to provide such information to the CAA. (iii) Parking for helicopters: Proponents have advised of intention to park helicopters on the heliport. Helicopters will be moved to and from the parking areas and the landing site by means of ground handling wheels. (iv) Number of helicopter movements: Not known-there is no regulatory requirement for the operator to provide such information to the CAA. (7) No, this is an obligation on the proponent under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Neither the Minister, the Department nor the CAA is the proponent. The proponent of the heliport is the Helicopter Association of Australia. (In the case of the third runway, the Federal Airports Corporation was the proponent). Sex, Guys and Videotape Program: Research (Question No. 1468)",147
257,Mr CONNOLLY,UNILINC,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 1 September 1994: Did the Information Services Division of her department commission qualitative and quantitative research on the Sex, Guys and Videotape television program; if so, (a) what did the research cost, (b) who conducted it, and (c) will she supply the results of the research.",147
258,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The department commissioned qualitative and quantitative research to evaluate and assess the efficacy of its joint sponsorship with New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland state health departments of the ABC-TV program, Sex, Guys and Videotape. The research assessed: the awareness, appropriateness and impact of the ABC-TV program among men aged between 16 and 45, and the effectiveness of the program in encouraging men to view sexuality, sexual health and safe sex practices as issues of importance to their well-being. (a) $30,600 (b) Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd (c) Yes. A copy of the results has been provided to the honourable member. Department of Human Services and Health: Furniture (Question No. 1469)",147
259,Mr CONNOLLY,UNILINC,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 1 September 1994: Did her Department recently supply furniture for her (a) Parliament House and (b) departmental offices; if so in each case, (i) what furniture, (ii) what did it cost and (iii) why was it necessary.",148
260,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Human Services and Health has recently supplied one two-drawer filing cabinet and three three-drawer filing cabinets for the storage of departmental correspondence in the Parliament House office. The total cost to the Department for these items was $589.56. No other furniture has been recently supplied by the Department for use in either the Parliament House or departmental offices. York Park Project (Question No. 1470),148
261,Mr CONNOLLY,UNILINC,"the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on ISeptember 1994: (1) What was the original estimated cost of the York Park project in Canberra. (2) What is the current estimated final cost of the project. (3) What sums were factored into the sum referred to in part (1) for (a) contingencies and (b) variations. (4) What sums have been spent on variations to the original design and specifications of the project. (5) Why were the sums referred to in part (3) spent. (6) What sums have been spent replacing wrongly designed, ordered or installed features or parts of the project. (7) Why was each replacement referred to in part (5) necessary.",148
262,Mr WALKER,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) $186,832,000 (2) $163,400,000. Savings are due to the competitive tender process and the value management of the design. (3)(a) The sums for contingencies comprising tender stage write up, construction contingency and rise and fall are $12,490,000. These are contained in both estimates for (1) and (2) above. (b) The sums for variations are contained within the cost estimates for construction and were not estimated as a separate amount. (4) The sums spent on variations to the original design and specifications as at 12 September 1994 are as follows: Dayworks-$3,728 Design Changes-$85,162 Scope Changes-$127,262 Infrastructure work-$137,692 (5) The sums referred to in part (3) for contingencies and variations are spent on those items that could not be reasonably foreseen as a cost at either the time of preparation of the budgets or at the time of awarding of contracts for works. The actual amounts spent are detailed in (4). (6) The sums spent on design errors and omissions to the project works as at 12 September 1994 are: Construction work-$73,588 Infrastructure work-nil (7) There are no replacement items contained in the answer to part (5) of the question. However, by further reference to part (3) that is contained in part (5), replacement items are not estimated as a separate amount but are contained within the cost estimates for construction work. Replacement items will sometimes become necessary due to remedial work arising from design changes, scope changes and/or design errors or omissions. Australian Protective Service (Question No. 1479)",148
263,Mr CONNOLLY,UNILINC,"the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) What role does the Australian Protective Service (APS) have in relation to Parliament House. (2) Has his attention been drawn to any incidents occurring since 1991 which caused him concern about the standard of conduct of certain members of the APS; if so, (a) in each case, (i) what was the incident and (ii) when did it occur and (b) what changes to the role of the APS is he considering as a result of the incidents.",148
264,Mr LAVARCH,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Minister for Justice is responsible for the day to day activities of the Australian Protective Service (APS). I am advised that the APS is responsible for providing protective security within the Ministerial Wing and in the external precincts, and that it perfonns this role under direction of the Parliament House Security Controller who is responsible to the Presiding Officers. (2) Prior to I July 1992 the APS was located in the Administrative Services Portfolio. Since that time, I am advised that the Minister for Justice has had three substantive incidents drawn to his attention, and that in no case was there a requirement for the Minister to consider changing the role of the APS. However, the APS's operations at Parliament House are constantly reviewed by the APS in consultation with the Parliament House Security Controller, including following incidents such as those outlined below. A(a) (i) A Pajero vehicle crashed through the main front entrance. (ii) 12 August 1992 (b) nil B(a) (i) An APS officer was charged under Section 99 of the Crimes Act with having stolen a pair of sunglasses which had allegedly been handed in by a person who found them. (ii) 1 July 1993 (b) The Director APS decided that no further action was warranted because the officer resigned rather than face the prospect of dismissal; such action was clearly in breach of the law and APS rules; no change to the APS role was warranted. C(a) (i) An APS officer allegedly twice pointed his service revolver at other APS officers and subsequently resigned rather than face the prospect of dismissal. (ii) 21 November 1993 (b) The Director APS decided that such action was clearly in breach of well known APS procedures; it was an isolated incident which involved gross stupidity rather than criminal intent; no change to the APS role was warranted. (Question No. 1515)",148
265,Mr CAMERON,UNILINC,"the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to Ausbuy Report No.4. (2) Does the report promote potential savings to the Government and consumers through buying Australian made goods from Australian owned companies. 2749 (3) Does the Gov-rnment acce-t the report's underlying assumptIOns concerning potential savings. (4) Will the Government (a) review existing preferences and (b) give further preference to Australian owned companies. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry Science and Technology has provided the f-llow­ ing answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am broadly aware of the activities of the Australian Owned Companies Association and of the thrust of their guides. At the time the question was asked the AusBuy Guide No 4, in particular had not been brought to my attention. ' (2) The Guide primarily promotes buying from local companies in the clothing and footwear areas which have majority Australian ownership. The Guide cautions consumers that some products bearing the brand names promoted in the Guide may have been manufactured overseas and suggests that consumers should examine the labels to detennine the country of origin of specific items. (3) I am not aware of any economic analysis of the Guide's claims. (4)(a) The Government does not apply a preference either to the products of Australian owned companies or to Australian manufactured goods. The Government did however, initiate, and continues to support, the Australian Made campaign which encourages consumers to buy Australian made goods when it makes sense to do so. (4)(b) The Government does not propose to give preference to Australian owned companies. The Government has a number of programs in place which assist local companies to win Government business. In addition, the recent 'Working Nation' statement outlined significant changes to the Government's purchasing arrangements to maximise opportunities for Australian and New Zealand industry involvement. Ausbuy Cannabis Use (Question No. 1519) Ms Worth asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) What (a) funds and (b) other resources does the Government provide via (i) the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse and (ii) other channels to educate on cannabis use. (2) Will she provide a comparison by State of the federal Government's allocation of (a) funds and (b) other resources to (i) government and (ii) nongovernment agencies committed to reducing cannabis consumption.",149
266,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Federal Government has provided $36.54 million in 1994-95 to the National Drug Strategy (NDS) for the minimisation of drug-related harm. As many of the activities undertaken within the NDS are not drug-specific it is not possible to calculate the level of funding or resources allocated to cannabis. New South Wales Bushfires: Property (Question No. 1526) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: (1) What sums in funding assistance has the Commonwealth provided to (a) individuals and (b) families who suffered (i) property damage or (ii) other losses or disruption in the January 1994 bushfires in New South Wales. (2) How many (a) individuals and (b) families who suffered (i) property damage or (ii) other losses or disruption received funding assistance from the Commonwealth. (3) With respect to each recipient referred to in part (2), what (a) was the sum paid in funding assistance, (b) assets were held, (c) was the annual income, (d) was the basis and category of the payment made, (e) was the extent of loss and (t) income and asset tests were applied. (4) Is he able to say whether any recipient (a) received or (b) had an entitlement to receive any (i) insurance payments or (ii) other payments from a funding appeal; if so, what sum was received or claimed in each case. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Disaster Relief Payment (DRP) is available to victims of a major or widespread disaster, upon declaration by the Minister for Social Security, as set down in the Social Security Act 1991. DRP is not subject to either an income or assets test. Therefore details of income, assets, insurance payouts or receipt of assistance from funding appeals were not collected as these were not relevant to entitlement to DRP. This is in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 which specify that information collected must be relevant to the purpose. The payments for DRP were made to individual clients, the rate of payment being determined by their family composition. During the NSW bushfires the rate of payment for DRP was: single-$1 ,152.60; couple-$2, 101.20; plus child under 13 years-$192.60; plus child 13-15 years-$271.80; plus student 16-24 years-$102.00; By the end of April 1994 the vast majority of claimants as a result of the NSW bushfires, had been paid. The answers below provide data as at that time. (1) As at 26 April 1994, $1.34 million was paid Damage to people in the form of DRP as a result of the NSW bushfires. This does not include payments to volunteer firefighters. It is not possible to break this down by family composition or by whether payment was made due to property damage or other losses or disruption. (2) As at 26 April 1994 payment of DRP was made to 849 clients. This does not include payments to volunteer firefighters. It is not possible to break this down by family composition or by whether payment was made due to property damage or other losses or disruption. (3) The information sought is detailed and is either not held by my Department or is not readily available. To collect and assemble the information held would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the use of the considerable resources that would be required. (4) My Department does not hold this information. Persons with Disabilities: Employment (Question No. 1529) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: (I) What national (a) output goals and (b) performance measures have been established under the Disability Services Act 1986 for the employment of persons with disabilities. (2) Has her attention been drawn to the service statement of Personnel Employment Albury Wodonga Incorporated, operating as Personnel Employment ISJ Albury. (3) Which State offices of her Department have established output goals and objectives similar to the service statement referred to in part (2). (4) What assistance has been given to State offices to assist the development of output goals, objectives and performance measures. (5) Has the Government developed national eligibility criteria under the Disability Support Pension; if so, what are the criteria.",150
267,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) General output goals and performance measures are contained in the standard Terms and Conditions of Grant for all services funded under the Disability Services Act 1986. Specific output goals and performance measures relating to individual services are negotiated with service providers. For services placing people in open employment, those specific goals address the number of people to be placed or supported in employment, and the wages and other employment conditions associated with those jobs. (2) When my approval is first sought for funding of a new service, I approve goals relating to the numbers of people to be placed in employment and to standards of support. I understand that Personnel Employment Albury Wodonga, which has a very good reputation for its achievements, has these goals incorporated in its service statement as part of its funding agreement. (3) I understand that similar service statements would have been developed by all State Offices of my Department in negotiation with individual services, to reflect targets for service provision and any actions that may need to be taken by the service in order to meet the applicable Disability Services Standards as required by the Disability Services Act 1986. The power to set outcomes under 10(5)(C) is delegated to officers of the Disability Services Program in State Offices of my Department. (4) Over the years various materials have been produced by the Disability Services Program to assist project officers in the development of output goals, objectives and performance measures for individual services. These include the Outcomes Guide (October 1990) and recent Circular Instructions relating to the development of service statements. (5) The administration of the Disability Support Pension does not fall within my portfolio; however I understand that eligibility criteria for the Disability Support Pension are laid down in sections 94 and 95 of the Social Security Act 1991. Disability Reform Panels (Question No. 1531) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: (1) How many disability reform panels have been established. (2) From where do the panels operate. (3) How many persons have been assisted by the panels in each year of their operation. (4) How are the panels being evaluated. (5) What criteria have been established to assess the panels' performance.",151
268,Dr LAWRENCE,UNILINC,"The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 215. (2) A disability panel operates from each of 215 Department of Social Security regional offices. (3) In 1991-92: 14,521 persons had cases considered by panels; 6,156 of these were interviewed; and 3,135 of these were accepted onto vocational programs. In 1992-93: 51,298 persons had cases considered by panels; 25,082 of these were interviewed; and 16,571 of these were accepted onto vocational programs. In 1993-94: 58,252 persons had cases considered by panels; 29,379 of these were interviewed; and 23,635 of these were accepted onto vocational programs. (4) The panels are being evaluated as part of the overall evaluation of the Disability Reform Package (DRP). The DRP Evaluation Report will be submitted to Government by the end of 1994. (5) The criteria used to assess the performance of panels are those relevant objectives of the overall DRP evaluation, addressing whether DRP measures have been effective in: developing efficient, effective and appropriate assessment and referral processes for people with a disability; and providing effective and efficient joint delivery of services by the Departments of Human Services and Health, Social Security and Employment, Education and Training. Merino Wool (Question No. 1532) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: Is it a fact that Russian merino wool in the 21.5 to 24 micron range is being bought in Europe and elsewhere, mixed with Australian wool and sold as Australian wool tops; if so (a) what steps can Australia take to prevent the practice, (b) will the practice have a detrimental effect on the price of Australian wool in the specified micron range, (c) are there grounds for Australian wool growers whose prices are being undercut as a result of the practice objecting to paying for generic promotion of wool and (d) will the Minister stop the export of all merino genetic material. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Concern in the Australian wool industry over sales of wool from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) into China, Turkey, Germany and now Italy and the US derives from the fact that it is being sold at low prices and thus competing with Australian wool. However, the nature of the wool produced within the CIS is generally of lower quality and yield due to the poorer conditions under which it is produced, notwithstanding long standing access to Australian Merino rams. It is also unlikely that current sales can be sustained, given the decline in production within the CIS. While raw wool from the CIS is being blended with Australian raw wool to make tops, this is normal commercial practice in the wool textile industry. There is no evidence to suggest that the tops produced are being sold as 100% Australian wool tops. Australian wool's main competitors in the world textile market are other fibres, primarily cotton and synthetics, not other wool producers. Generic promotion of wool is designed to protect wool's position in the textile market and, as the world's dominant suppliers of wool, Australian wool growers are the main beneficiaries. Department of Administrative Services: Tender Charges (Question No. 1533) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: Does his Department impose a user's charge of 4 per cent upon successful tenderers for services and equipment ordered; if so, (a) why and (b) is the practice designed to boost artificially the income side of the Department's ledger to make it appear more profitable.",151
269,Mr WALKER,UNILINC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department seeks only to recover the costs involved in establishing and administering Common Use Contracts. It does this by requiring suppliers to remit commission on the goods and services purchased by individual agencies. Commission was introduced in 1989 and the rates payable vary between one tenth of one per cent (0.10%) and four per cent (4 %) depending upon the nature of the contract and the costs of administration. Purchasing Australia, the Division within my Department which administers the Common Use Contracts, is funded from the Budget. Revenue collected by way of commission is paid directly into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Accordingly it is quite independent from the commercial activities of the Department and has no impact on the Department's profitability. Home Child-care Allowance (Question No. 1537) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 21 September, 1994: (1) Will some families receive less assistance from the Home Child Care Allowance than they received under the obsolete Dependent Spouse Rebate; if so, (a) how many and (b) what are the characteristics of those families. (2) If one parent responsible for three children aged between 6 and 13 earns $1237.50 gross per fortnight and the other parent earns $110 per week for 38 weeks per annum, will the family be better off under the Home Child Care Allowance scheme than under the Dependent Spouse Rebate; if so, (a) in what way and (b) by what sum. (3) If families will be worse off under the Home Child Care Allowance scheme than they were under the Dependent Spouse Rebate, why did the Government make the change. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) A small number of families will receive less assistance from Home Child Care Allowance than under the Dependent Spouse Rebate (DSR). It is not possible to state accurately how many families will receive less assistance. This is because the Australian Taxation Office does not request or record details of ages of children or income received by the Dependent Spouse, which is necessary to determine how many families will receive less assistance. (b) Families will receive less assistance from Home Child Care Allowance than under the DSR in anyone of the following situations. The only dependent child for DSR purposes is between 18 years and 25 years. The dependent spouse has a low separate net income which has been reduced for taxation purposes by taking into account work related expenses directly chargeable against the earnings of that income, such as child care costs and travelling costs to and from work and child care. These expenses cannot be offset for Social Security purposes. Estranged spouses claim the DSR in respect of their former partner. Under the Home Child Care Allowance, claimants must be a member of a couple. The dependent spouse and/or children are temporarily absent from Australia for more than 13 weeks. While the DSR is available to people outside Australia if they are residents for taxation purposes, Home Child Care Allowance is not payable after 13 weeks of a temporary absence. Where there is shared care of children involved. The full value of the DSR is available to both parents if they share the care of a child, regardless of the amount of time the child spends with each parent. Home Child Care Allowance will be split between two people according to the proportion of time the child spends with each person if care is shared. (2) (a) In this case, the family will be better off under the Home Child Care Allowance scheme than under the Dependent Spouse Rebate. The family will receive a cash payment on a fortnightly basis which will better reflect the current income circumstances of the partner who undertakes most of the care of the children, rather than the primary income earner receiving reduced taxation deductions on a fortnightly basis or a reduced liability at the end of the financial year. (b) Based on the current rates of Home Child Care Allowance and the Dependent Spouse Rebate, the family will be better off by $89.50 per annum. They would have received $477 under the Dependent Spouse Rebate, while under the Home Child Care Allowance, they will instead receive $566.50 per annum. (3) (a) The Government has made this change to recognise the important contribution made by partners, usually women, who remain substantially out of the workforce to care for dependent children. Home Child Care Allowance provides an independent source of income for these partners while they remain out of the workforce. The majority of families will be better off. These families include most of those who previously benefited from the Dependent Spouse Rebate, who will be about $5 per fortnight better off. Nearly 55 000 families with low taxable incomes who have been unable to obtain the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate will be, on average, $20 a week better off, and in some cases, $30 a week better off. Home Child Care Allowance is also more responsive to the current circumstances of the family. For example, families where one partner stops work part way through the year to have a child will start to receive Home Child Care Allowance as soon as the baby is born. Many of these families would not have been able to access the Dependent Spouse Rebate due to the amount of income received in the financial year by the partner caring for the child. Department of Defence: Liaison Officers (Question No. 1608)",152
270,Mr CONNOLLY,UNILINC,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: How many departmental liaison officers are employed by the Minister and the Minister's Parliamentary Secretaries, where applicable, and what is the (a) cost, (b) place of work and (c) job description as given in the current ministerial directory of each officer.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Three departmental liaison officers are employed within the Defence portfolio, one in each of the offices of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. (a) The salary of each officer for the above offices is within the range of a Senior Officer Grade B, a Senior Officer Grade C and an Administrative Service Officer Class 6 respectively. In addition, each officer receives the Departmental Liaison Officer's allowance. (b) All three officers work at Parliament House. (c) The officers' duties are to maintain liaison with officers of the Department of Defence at all levels on relevant matters, including in relation to ministerial representations, provide advice on departmental issues, and liaise with other departments and outside organisations as necessary. Bureau of Immigration and Population Research (Question No. 1633) Mr Abbott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the comments of Mr Hugh Poate, a senior public servant, that the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research is ideologically pre-committed to continuing high immigration programs. (2) Is the Minister able to say what the bureau's position is with respect to the level of immigration. (3) Has the bureau produced any research (a) into Australia's optimal population or (b) on whether the marginal cost of bringing in another immigrant will be covered by the marginal revenue generated as a result. (4) Has the bureau made a submission to the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies' inquiry into Australia's population carrying capacity; if not, why not. (5) Will the Minister provide a list of immigration conferences attended by bureau staff in 199394 and the names and positions of the staff who attended each conference. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: (1) Yes. (2) The Bureau of Immigration and Population Research is a research body which provides an informed and sound basis for the Government and the wider community to discuss and consider immigration policies.
