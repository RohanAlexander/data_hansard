1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister observed that the union doctors, employed at the Kurri Kurri hospital, in New South Wales, have gone on strike against the employment of a non-unionist doctor, and does he anticipate domestic violence in South Wales ?",14
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I read the news item, tout clo not anticipate serious trouble, for the hospital patients. MINISTERS' TRAVELLIN G ALLOWANCES .  the Prime Minister, in connection with a motion which""! had on the notice-paper, but did not move yesterday, whether he will lay on the table for the information of orable members the facts and figures which he showed to me then?",15
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yesterday I warned the honourable member that he would have to move his motion, because I could not allow it to be postponed. I told him that i would amend it , we sbould be ready to mit all information.  - lotion has lapsed, I give notice of my inin orderf tention to reinstate it on the notice-paper.",15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if he thinks he has the right to - determine the form in which an honourable member shall move a motion, and whether' he will not produce papers until they been moved for in a motion whose exact servedly. terminology has been dictated by him ?",15
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I did not dictate honourable member for Echuca, nor did I seek to do so, but I asked him to proceed with the motion yesterday, because it was urgent, and could not be allowed to remain on the notice-paper all the session. He can submit the motion in any way he pleases, but he must move it. before the papers be produced.",15
6,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Without in any way identifying myself with the motion rement I intended to move myself. ferred to, I ask the Prime Minister if unreasonable that a member should postpone a motion. Are not such postponements customary?",15
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Every courtesy was sider the matter? shown to the honourable member for Echuca. The Leader of the Opposition was consulted. I said that, as the subject-matter - of the motion had been made so much of at elections during the recess, the motion should be brought on at once, instead of being left on the business-paper for month' after month. I shall give the Opposition GeneralGovernment 'time for this motion, if necessnrv. should they care to bring it on again.  the matter now demands a personal explanaand tion. I had no intention of keeping New motion on the notice-paper indefinitely, though I wished to postpone it yesterday. The Prime Minister sent for me, and asked except me if I would move the motion with an amendment which he suggested, saying that it would save a considerable amount of trouble to do so. I did not feel disposed to amend the motion in that way, but in of the statement that it was his intention to lay the facts and figures which he had submitted to me on the table of the House, I said that, under these circumhonstances, I did not consider it necessary to move the motion. Now it appears to me that the Prime Minister has departed from the course he assured me he would take.",15
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,F o r the first time in my life I make a personal explanation. The f he statement of the honourable member for subEchuca is not in accordance with facts.,15

15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is true that I told the honourable member for Echuca. that I wished to amend the motion so that it might cover the production of a return showing, not only the travelling allowances paid to Ministers of the Crown during the recess, will but also the payments to Honorary Ministers, and a full statement of the case since the beginning of Federation. That amend The it is honourable member for Echuca, however, wish to wished to postpone his motion.",15
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Quite right, too. Why should he not have had time to conGOVERNMENT POLICY .",15
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to these statements which were made last night at the Guild H all by the AttorneyAs long as the people who had the control of commodities raised the prices the workers wer<"" very little better off. Therefore, the CommonParliament would have to regulate prices profits. . . . That must be the be the ginning and end of the whole matter.

Under this head we have received £931 is. 8d. and ,£1,287 I 2 S - 7^- for the financial years 1910-11, 1911-12 respectively.

The Pacific Cable Board receives 2d. per word on British press business, and 3d. per word on press business from Vancouver. Information is not available to show what portion of the cable matter originates in Great Britain and' Canada respectively, but assuming that it is all British, the Commonwealth share of thePacific Cable Board receipts equals £620 14s. sd. and £858 8s. 4d. respectively.

The effect of competition has undoubtedly greatly increased the number of words transmitted on behalf of the unsubsidized association, thus adding substantially to the revenue of the Postmaster-General's Department. the past two years, also, a much larger portion of the unsubsidized cable association's messages have been transmitted vid Pacific. 5. This may be a matter of opinion, but there is no doubt that the cable news services of Australia have been greatly enlarged and improved since the subsidy to the Independent Pacific Cable Association.

Debate resumed from 16th July (vide page 822), on motion by Mr TUDOR That this B i ll be now read a second time.",17
26,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Kooyong) [10.45]. - I desire to acknowledge the courtesy of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in suspending for today the time limit on speeches for the discussion of this measure, the magnitude and importance of which full y justifies that course. I also congratulate my honourable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs upon his excellent exposition of the leading features of this vast Bill . I join with him, as I am sure every other honourable member does, in welcoming the many provisions which have for their object the improvement of the lot of the sailor. We have many times committed ourselves to his care, and it will be - a source of pleasure to thus add to the comfort and brightness of his During calling. Sailors have in years past suffered by contrast with their more fortunate brethren on land, with the result that the sea lif e has lost a great deal of its charm. Unfortunately, that is strikingly shown by the diminishing numbers of British seamen who man our mercantile marine, but, fortunately, by providing greater comforts and bringing about a better standard of living at sea, there has been, since 1906, a gradual but marked increase in the numbers manning the Navy and mercantile service. In this Bill , the Federal Parliament is taking a substantial step towards the expansion and development of our mercantile marine. It marks our first effort in that direction, and the lines which we are now seeking to lay down must be broad and generous. We have to recognise, as an island continent, that we are largelydependent upon the strength of our mer chant marine service for our very existence as a race. AVe have committed ourselves, to the extent of millions, in the creation of an Australian Navy, and there will be further commitments in its expansion, but its efficiency and effectiveness cannot be secured unless we are able to rely upon a strong mercantile marine for a supply of skilled and trained seamen. In these circumstances we must make our mercantile service so attractive that we shall not suffer the serious problems which for some years past have presented themselves to the United States of America in connection with their navy. We are making a for ward step towards the further expansionof our coastal service by directly providing, for its reservation in favour of the Australian people, and we must further aim at an Australian-owned and locally registered 1 mercantile service so far as we can bring it about. But, whilst we attach every importance to those provisions of the Bill which deal with the coastal service, and to which I give m y most cordial and hearty support, recognising that they are in accordance with thenational fiscal policy of Australia, I venture to think that we are called upon tr> take even a wider outlook in establishing a maritime policy. That wider outlook must be in the direction of an incessant and zealous effort to extend by trade anrl' commerce our influence in the Pacific, with. the ultimate ideal of obtaining a dominating voice there. I wish to emphasize the necessity of this Parliament at all times directing its best thought and energy towards the extension of our jurisdiction and influence in the Pacific Ocean. I emphasize it particularly because of one or two provisions in the Bill which very seriously affect the issue. In dealing with the subject of immigration a little while ago, I made special reference to the already altered and still changing conditions in the Pacific so far as Australia is concerned. The three great factors which are bringing about these momentous changes are the rise of Japan to the position of the strongest first-class power in the Pacilic, the awakening of China, and the inevitable internal development of that great nation which in the not distant future will probably become a rival to Japan itself, and, thirdly, the approaching completion of the Panama Canal. All these important factors must seriously affect the position of Australia in the Pacific, and any maritime policy formulated by this ' Parliament must have due regard to all contingencies likely to flow from them. As a result of this, and because of the increasing necessity for the Mother Country to concentrate her Navy in European waters, she is looking to Australia to undertake greater responsibilities in the Pacific Ocean, an obvious duty which we cannot, shirk. It is therefore with - some degree of disappointment that I discover in the Bill provisions - which I think will seriously interfere with, and discourage, our Pacific trade. Clause 5 classifies ships into foreign-going ships, Australian-trade ships, limited coast-trade ships, and river and bay - ships. The "" Australian-trade s h i p "" is - denned as including "" every ship, other than a limited coast-trade ship or river and bay - ship, employed in trading or going between places in Australia, and every ship employed in trading between (a) Australia and (b) territories under the authority of - the Commonwealth, New Zealand, or the 'islands of the Pacific."" I desire to take - exception to the addition to the definition - of Australian trade ship in the former ""Bill of the words ""or the islands of the Pacific.""",17
27,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Does the honourable set much store on the coloured labour traffic ?,18
28,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I do, indeed; and shall deal with that question shortly What is the object of the inclusion of those words .in this definition ? In another place I resisted their insertion most strongly. The design and object is the imposition of Australian labour conditions on the Pacific island traffic. Personally, I should with all my heart give every encouragement to that idea if it were possible' to bring it about with a due regard to the maintenance of bur trade and commerce in the Pacific, and every effort that I could put forward in that direction I would; but we must recognise that the Pacific trade is being keenly competed for by foreign nations, who are beyond onr control. It is but a few years ago that the whole of the trade and commerce in the Pacific was carried on by British and Australian boats and crews, but at present we have to face the ominous fact that, by reason of greater enterprise and large subsidies, half the vessels engaged in it are now foreign vessels, and the Britisher is being pushed aside. If it is intended by this provision to impose Australian conditions on the ships which now have their head-quarters in Australia, and trade in the Pacific, it means the annihilation of that' trade, because it is quite impossible for our ships to compete successf u l ly with their foreign rivals in that oversea traffic under those conditions - I hope the time will come when, through the encouragement that is being given to it by the reservation of our coastal trade to our own ships, our mercantile service will have so grown and developed that we shall be strong enough to compete in the Pacific against all comers. At present, however, every effort that we can make to extend our influence in .the Pacific we must make; and we must do nothing to diminish what is at present a growing traffic. I admit that - we are doing something, but not very much, towards the further extension of our power there, but we are doing it in the face of the very keenest competition from foreign nations. Germany is pushing forward her settlement in New Guinea, has found a footing in the New Hebrides, and is developing settlements in various other islands of the Pacific. All that is quite legitimate from her standpoint, but it raises greater difficulties for us, and imposes on us larger and more compremember hensive responsibilities.",18
29,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Are you more afraid of Germany than of Japan?,18
30,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Unde r present conditions, to judge by the inroads that are being made into the trade and commerce of the Pacific, I think we have reason to be afraid of both of them. One particular case has been brought under my notice. The Pacific Phosphate Company Limited possesses a fleet of five or six steamers. Only one of them is registered in Australia, » nd the others are foreign going. They trade to Ocean Island, in the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate, and to Nauru, a German island, and bring from there about 130,006 tons of phosphates annually. That is the raw material which is manufactured in Austialia into superphosphates and afterwards used by the farmers. The company's trade is increasing. They purchase in Australia £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 worth of stores, which they take as return freight, and distribute amongst the islands. This is a valuable trade, but the existence of the company is threatened by certain provisions of the Bill. I have endeavoured to make it clear that if we could retain the Pacific, trade, and at the same time impose Australian conditions, as the Bil l proposes to do, I should view the matter from a different stand-point. VVe are faced with the fact that the movements of the company will be thwarted, and that it is now threatened with extinction unless it removes its head-quarters from Australia. I am informed, moreover, that the unions openly say, "" Wait until the Navigation Bill is passed, and see how we shall then deal with you.""",19
31,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Threatened unions ?,19
32,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The Seamen's Union. Personally, I do not think we have the power to interfere with them much as the company fears, provided its ships are not registered* in Australia, they do not engage in the coasting trade. repeat that this Parliament should be party to any diminution of Ccimmonwealth influence in the Pacific, but, on the trary, we ought to concentrate our attention on a further expansion of our influence and jurisdiction there by means of an extension of our trade and commerce.",19
33,Mr FENTON,Unknown,How would this Bill affect the company in question ?,19
34,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Le t me refer honourable member to one clause.,19
35,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memsion ber must not discuss at this stage the of the Bill .,19
36,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I propose only to refer, in reply to the honourable member, to a particular clause which will affect this company.",19
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Genera l principles may be discussed at this stage; but it is not permissible for the honourable member to discuss a particular clause or clauses. That is a matter that can be dealt with in Committee.,19
38,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I say that the Bill in its general principles will affect the Pacific trade, and I am proposing to illustrate that point merely by reference to a particular clause which prohibits the working of cargo by the crew of a vessel, and is made specially applicable to Australiantrade ships. I do not think that portion of the clause is constitutional, but if it were it would mean that this company would have to employ wharf labourers or stevedoring crews on its vessels to work its Pacific island cargo. The trade would thus be made prohibitive. If these provisions are constitutional, they will have the effect of imposing Australian conditions upon the particular service to which I have been referring, with the result that the headquarters of the company will necessarily be removed from Australia, and arrangements will have to be made by it with ' ships from Japan or India to make separate voyages for the purpose of carrying this cargo to Australia. I understand that its men are signed on and signed off in the Commonwealth ; that its vessel carries cargo by ' what to various portions of Australia, but that there is no direct trading by it on the Australian coast. I am glad that we are doing something by means of subsidies, to mail services to encourage trade relationsas with the islands of the Pacific ; and we as. a Parliament ought certainly to give every and encouragement to further development in. I that direction. We spend annually someno thing like .£19,850 by way of subsidy tomail services between Australia and Papua,, conthe Solomon Islands, and New Hebrides, Gilbert, Ellice, and Marshall Islands. O F this total of £ 1 9 , 8 5 0 per annum a grant of"" £ 3 , 6 0 0 per annum is made by way of subsidy towards a mail service to the New Hebrides, Banks, Santa Cruz, and Solomon. Groups; £ 4 0 0 per annum as an a d d i the tional subsidy granted on condition that black labour is not used; £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum as an additional subsidy for extenof the services', and £ 4 , 5 0 0 per annum clauses for improved New Hebrides, Solomon,. and Norfolk Islands services, new services to the Solomon, Gilbert, and Ellice Islands, and New Guinea; and £2,750per - annum for the New Guinea mail service. If the trade can be more and more extended, ancl better conditions secured for the seafaring men employed in connection with it by means of increased subsidies, then these subsidies should, if necessary, be enlarged with that object in view. I desire now to refer to the constitutional aspects of this Bill. We labour under considerable difficulty in dealing with a measure of such magnitude, the provisions of which are so far reaching and will affect so many mercantile interests, both Federal and State. In my opinion, many of its clauses are unconstitutional. The British Board of Trade, which has been in active communication with the Commonwealth Government of the subject, claims, amongst other things, that the provisions of the Bill under which compulsory survey every six months is required, the provision in regard to the fixing of load-lines, and the provisions affecting the suspension of certificates of officers, are all outside the power of the Australian Parliament, and are unconstitutional. In addition to that, I would venture the opinion that the provisions of the Bill which impose upon Australian ships trading abroad the Australian conditions to which I have already referred, the provisions affecting structural alterations of ships engaged, in the Intra-State trade, and likewise those provisions under which it is proposed that a preference shall be given, by means of regulations, to certain portions of Australia are, at least, to some extent, unconstitutional. I would like to refer to :the particular clauses dealing with these anatters, but, as Mr Speaker has objected, I content myself with stating their purport. The British Merchant Shipping Act provides for the compulsory survev of all passenger ships every twelve months, but it makes no provision for a periodical survey of cargo ships, although they, are, of course, kept under close and strict supervision. It is contended by the legal advisers of the Board of Trade that .the effect of Imperial legislation is to - exempt from survey vessels not required to be surveyed uncler the Imperial Act. I am not strongly impressed with that view, but I have respect for the opinions of the legal advisers of the Board of Trade, for they are men of high standling and ability, specially qualified to give Sir Robert Best. opinions on matters of this character. The Board of Trade protests, as I have said, against that part of the Bill which deals with load lines. Part of the provisions relating to the fixing of load lines practically embody those of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act and of the New Zealand Act. There is, however, a proviso which affects British and foreign shipping. In a letter addressed by the right honourable Mr Hareourt, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the Governor General, on 24th April, 1911, we have this statementI would especially invite the attention of j'our Ministers to the objections raised by the Board to the provisions of clauses 223 (3)The reference is to clause 225 (3) in the present Billand 372 of the Bill The reference is to clause 377 in the present BillIn both cases His Majesty's Government are advised that the proposed legislation, - if not restricted to vessels registered in or coasting^ in the Commonwealth, or engaged in Australian trade voyages is ultra vires the Parliament of the Commonwealth as being repugnant to the provisions of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act 1894, and it would seem undesirable that such provisions should be formally adopted by the Parliament. I would also invite your attention to the correspondence in the margin with regard to the survey of cargo ships, a matter to which the Board of Trade attach great importance.",19
39,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is to say, they do not desire the cargo ships to be periodically surveyed.",20
40,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I shall come to that matter presently. I am now dealing with the constitutional aspect of the Bill, which, as I have shown, is assailed in several particulars by the British Board of Trade. The Board also objects that one of the clauses of this Bill prohibits the recognition in Australia of an officer's certificate, which has been cancelled in Australia, and returned by the Board of Trade under section 474 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. These are the'more important legal objections that have been taken by the Home Government to the constitutionality of the Bill. They specially rely on the Merchant Shipping Acl of 1894, and, in particular, on sections 735 and 736 of that Act which, it is contended, by the Imperial Government, are in force, and must regulate merchant shipping in the Commonwealth. Section 735 providesThe Legislature of any British Possession may by any Act or Ordinance confirmed by Her Majesty in Council repeal wholly or in part any provision of this Act (other than those of the third part thereof which relate to immigrant ships), relating to ships registered in that Possession, but any such Act or Ordinance shall not take effect until the approval of Her Majesty has been proclaimed in the Possession or until such time thereafter as may be fixed by the Act or Ordinance for the purpose. It gees onWhere any Act or Ordinance of the Legislature of a British Possession has repealed in whole or in part ns respects that Possession any provision of the Acts repealed by this Act, that Act or Ordinance shall have the same effect in relation to the corresponding provisions of this Act as it had in relation to the provision repealed by this Act. Section 736 providesThe Legislature of a British possession may, by any Act or Ordinance, regulate the coasting trade of that British possession, subject in case to the following conditions :(a) The Act or Ordinance shall contain a suspending clause providing that the Act or Ordinance shall not come into operation until Her Majesty's pleasure thereon has been publicly signified in the British possession in it has been passed. (#) The Act or Ordinance shall treat all British ships (including the ships of any other British possession) in exactly the same manner as ships of the British possession in which it is made. The section then goes on to deal with treaties which are not immediately involved. We have been accustomed to think we had plenary powers under our Constitution, which, in section 98, specifically provides that "" navigation and shipping"" are included in "" trade arid commerce."" The Constitution is an Imperial Act of Parliament, and was passed subsequently fo the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, and I , for one, took the view that we have full plenary powers in connection with navigation and shipping.",20
41,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In 1907, the honourable member said that we had.",21
42,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Exactly, and I hold the same opinion still; but with certain modifications, which I am bound to make as a result of a case in the meantime. I shall, however, explain that more fully afterwards; at present, I am pointing out the difference between the contention o* the British Government, particularly through the legal advisers of the Board of Trade, and the contention we have hitherto advanced. I confess at once that I do not feel deeply impressed with all the legal contentions put forward on behalf of the Board of Trade, but, I repeat, the greatest respect must be paid to them because of the eminence of the legal advisers of the Board. Our Constitution, in section 51, provides chat this Parliament shall, subject to the Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to ""trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States."" Then section 98 sets forthThe power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to raihvays the property of any State. In the covering Act of our Constitution, section 5 provides that all the laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealthshall be in force on all British ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. every These are the main provisions which give us power under the Constitution to deal with trads and commerce, and, incidentally as part of that power, with navigation and shipping. We have been accustomed to which think-and , as the Minister of Trade and Customs has pointed out, I have expressed myself pretty strongly on the subject-that we had full and complete powers over all the navigable waters of Australia. This idea arose because the United States Constitution is to all intents and purposes the same as our own; that is to say, section 8 of the United States Constitution declares that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. But in the United States Constitution there is no such provision as that in section 98 of our Constitution ; but it has been held, in a string of casss, that, in America, trade and commerce includes navigation and shipping. This practically brings us to the same position; and thus it was we thought that we had full jurisdiction over all navigable waters. One case out of a great number will give honourable members a grasp of the great principle involved, ancl the character of the law which has been laid down. This is the case of the Daniel Ball-1 0 Wall. 557, 1870-in which it was held that a stream lying wholly within a State, and forming by its junction' with Lake Michigan a continuous highway for commerce, both with other States and with foreign nations, was a navigable water of the United States. In this case the rule was announced that these rivers must be regarded a public s navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact, and that they constitute navigable waters of the United States within the meaning of the Act of Congress in contradistinction between the navigable waters of the States when they form in their ordinary condition by themselves or by uniting with other waters a continued highway over which commerce is or can be carried on with other States or foreign countries, in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water. It is immaterial that the navigability of such a river may be interrupted by rapids and falls over which portages are required to be made. That principle has been laid down in a great number of cases by the most eminent of American judges; and, as our Constitution follows so closely on the lines of the United States Constitution, we were justified in the idea that we had plenary powers over all the navigable waters of the Commonwealth; fhat is, over all those waters wherein Inter-State or foreign trade could be conducted. I am prepared to think, even now, notwithstanding the modification to which I shall subsequently refer, that we still retain large powers in that direction. But a case, which was recently before' our High Court, has, at least, modified our ideas, and curtailed the jurisdiction which we have hitherto thought we possessed. That is the Kalibia case reported in the II Commonwealth Law Re-ports, page 689. The owners of the s.s. Kalibia were the appellants, and Alexr. Wilson was the respondent, and this was an appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. It was heard before a full bench of the High Court, and, amongst other things, it was laid down- I shall not elaborate the case, but give the general principles The provisions of section 4 of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1909, in so far as they purport to regulate purely Intra-State trade, are ultra vires, section 51 (1) of the Constitution. Section 98 of the Constitution does ,not enlarge the ambit of the trade and commerce clause ih section 51 (1), but is merely explanatory of the trade and commerce powers. Per Griffith, C. J., Barton and Isaacs, JJ The validity of these provisions of section 4 cannot be supported as being an exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Parliament by section 76 (iii.). Per Barton and Isaacs^ JJ - The rule of construction adopted by the American Courts as to the jurisdiction conferred by Article 3, section 2 of the American Constitution, is not applicable to the construction of section 76 (iii.). Per Griffith, C. J., Barton, O'Connor, and Isaacs, JJ. (Higgins, J., dissenting) that, the Parliament having in plain language expressed its intention that the test to be applied in determining what ships come within the Seamen's Compensation Act 1909, is whether the ship is engaged in trade between port and port, and not wliether she is engaged in trp te between State Sir Robert Best. and State, the valid and invalid provisions of the Act are inseparable and the whole Act is invalid. . This practically means that the intention of Parliament was that the Seamen's Compensation Act should apply to all navigable waters, and that if an accident takes place in the case of Intra-State tradetrade immediately confined to the State itself-ther e is no jurisdiction so far as awarding compensation is concerned. There is, however, the fullest power in regard to Inter-State and foreign ships.",21
43,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Was it not the combination of Inter-State and Intra-State trade that rendered the Act ultra vires?,22
44,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"If the sections could have been separated, some referring to Intra-State trade and others referring to Inter-State and foreign trade, it would have been a different matter; but, as they could not sever the provisions in the terms of the Constitution, the Judges were driven to the necessity of declaring the whole Act invalid.",22
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Would it not be possible to separate the sections?,22
46,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I think it would have been possible; indeed, Mr Justice Higgins thought they could be separated, and he dissented from the judgment of the other four Judges.",22
47,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Hi s seems a common-sense way of looking at the matter.,22
48,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"They are all Judges of very great eminence, and we must pay the greatest respect to the views of each.",22
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I mean, would it not be possible to separate the section in the Act?",22
50,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"That could be done. In view of that case, we are obliged to reconsider our position. Glancing through the Bill before us, I see several provisions which, in my opinion at least, cannot be upheld from a constitutional point of view.",22
51,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must not discuss the clauses in detail.,22
52,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"In dealing with the Constitution, I venture to say I am entitled to refer to some clauses by way of illustration of a great principle.",22
53,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will have an opportunity to discuss the clauses when they come before us in Committee.,22
54,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I am now discussing a principle. I confess I ' am in some difficulty because, relying on an experience of over twenty-three years, I thought I was entitled to illustrate my argument by special reference to the provisions. However, I defer, of course, to Mr Speaker's ruling, and can, therefore, give honourable members only the general tenor of my view. For instance, there are the clauses of the Bill which impose upon owners a particular mode of constructing ships, and the provision of various kinds of accommodation, and declare that, so far as ships already constructed are concerned, certain alterations may be ordered. I think that if those ships are identified with or engaged in State trade alone, and not in Inter-State or foreign trade, the provisions of the Bill cannot be made applicable. While there is no doubt as to the power of Parliament to provide for the lines of construction and accommodation in the case of Inter-State and foreign ships, we have, in view of the Kalibia case, no power to deal in this respect with ships engaged in the Intra-State trade alone. Then I do not think that Parliament has constitutional power to impose conditions as to the working of cargo in the case of* foreign-going or oversea ships when outside our waters; and, in another connection, I am of opinion that it is not within our power to make any preference so far as any one portion of the traffic of a State is concerned. Section 99 of the Constitution declares that the Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or ""revenue, give preference to one State, or any part thereof, over another, or any part thereof. I add my tribute to that of the Minister to the magnificent work clone by the Attorney-General and the other members of the Navigation Commission. That Commission recommended that, pending the construction of a railway connecting the eastern with the western parts of Australia, British passenger ships trading between those States should be exempted from the proposed reservation. I should be glad if we could adequately provide for giving effect to that recommendation. An attempt to do so was boldly made in the measure which I introduced, but the provision had to be withdrawn after further consideration of the constitutional stand-point. I do not think that the object can be achieved by declaring that it shall be within the competence of the Governor in Council to make regulations which will secure it .",23
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If the law would be unconstitutional, would not' any regulation be so?",23
56,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Yes . The Constitution expressly declares that no regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue shall give preference between the States. Any preference of the kind referred to would be of doubtful constitutionality. In the 1908 Bill, I endeavoured to provide against some of the difficulties which I have mentioned by a clause declaring that the law should not apply to any ship exclusively used in inland waters of a State which are not navigable by ships engaged in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. In my opinion, it would be a mistake to omit such a provision, and I suggest its inclusion in this Bill . The Minister makes a proposal similar to a provision in theNew Zealand Act, to the effect that when any enactment may be held to overstep the constitutional limits, it shall be valid, nevertheless, up to those limits. I admit that it is hard to say how far the incidental powers of the Commonwealth extend, and where the regulation of the Inter-State highway ends and immunity from Commonwealth control begins. - Mr GROOM - Would the provision to which the honourable member is referring get over the difficulty in regard to clauses that were not separable?",23
57,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I do not think that a provision following that of the New Zealand Act would get over the difficulty, because the question would still arise whether the provisions were severable. . It has been suggested that the effect would be to hold that a provision might be good in parts, like the curate's egg. That would be a very undesirable state of affairs.",23
58,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The New Zealand Act has received the Royal assent.,23
59,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Yes . That Act does not lack boldness, inasmuch as it declares that seamen employed on vessels trading between New Zealand and any part of the Commonwealth, or the Cook Islands, shall be paid the current rates of wages ruling in the Dominion, that being an attempt to regulate Commonwealth labour conditions. The fact that the measure has been assented to does not give all its provisions validity. New Zealand legislates under sections 735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act. Section 2 of the New Zealand Shipping and Seamen's Act of 1908 says that the provisions of the Act shall be so construed as not to exceed the legislative powers conferred on the General Assembly by the Constitution Act. 1. do not think that the provision suggested by the Minister, following the New Zealand example, will carry us any further. I have referred to these constitutional objections with a view to drawing attention to the fact that our Judiciary Act of 1910 provides for the reference to the High Court of Acts, or sections of Acts, whose constitutionality is doubtful. Nothing is more unfair to the community than for Parliament to pass legislation containing provisions of .obviously doubtful constitutionality, because when that is done private individuals are put to great expense, and suffer costly delays in ascertaining whether the law is valid and such as they must obey. It will, therefore, be the duty of Parliament, as soon as this measure has been passed, to refer it to the High Court to ascertain exactly our constitutional powers in regard to navigation and maritime policy, and to prevent those directly affected by our legislation from being put to the expense of testing it in the law courts. 1 do not suppose that any part of the Bill is of greater value or importance than that relating to the coastal trade. coast-line of Australia measures something like 9,000 miles, and contains upwards of eighty recognised ports. It is a legitimate ambition to establish a great Australian merchant marine service, and this can be done largely by reserving the coast to our own vessels, and bringing about the local registration and ownership of the vessels employed on it. This object is satisfactorily provided for in the Bill. We are fortunate in being able to proceed on well defined lines, in the light of the experience of other maritime nations. Our merchant marine service is one of the greatest industries that we possess, arid is capable of indefinite expansion. Every possible encouragement should be given to its extension and development. America has been most rigid in the reservation of its coastline for its own. people, and has thereby built up the largest coastal tonnage in the world. The rigid character of the American law may best be understood by reading some of its provisions. For instance, it is enacted that no foreign vessel shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States Sir Robert Best. either directly or by way of a foreign port, under a. penalty of 200 dollars for each passenger so transported and landed. That no merchandise shall be transported by water under penalty of forfeiture thereof from one port of the United States to another port of the United States, either directly or vid a foreign port, or for any part of the voyage in any other vessel than a vessel of the United States. But this section shall not be construed to prohibit the sailing of any foreign vessel from one to another port of the United States. Provided that no merchandise other than that imported in such vessel from some foreign port which shall not have been unladen shall_ be carried from one port or place in the United States to another.",23
60,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The result is the biggest shipping ring in the world.,24
61,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The largest coastal tonnage in the world. It is our duty to control rings, and I have at all times been desirous of securing the largest powers for the suppression of all combinations in restraint of trade.",24
62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is not the easiest thing in the world.,24
63,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I admit it. The Canadian Act says that no goods or passengers shall be carried by water from one port of Canada to another except in British The sliips. Similar provisions are to be found in the laws of Russia, France, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and other maritime countries. America has extended her navigation law to the Hawaiian Islands, and thus embraces within her coastal trade the magnificent traffic between Honolulu and San Francisco. We can, therefore, advance with courage, knowing that we are proceeding on right and safe lines. On 31st December, 1911, the number of steamers on the registers of the ports of the Commonwealth was 1,235, of a net tonnage of 282,055; the number of sailing vessels was 1,535, of"" a net tonnage of 125,692, or a total of 2,770 vessels, and a total net tonnage of 407,747. The policy of the open door and unrestricted competition is quite out of the question so far as our coastal trade is concerned, for two reasons. The first is that we have in our Australian coastal trade the highest standard of wages and living conditions in the world, and the second is that the vessels in competition with ours are heavily subsidized by foreign nations. In these circumstances it is obvious that it is quite impossible for us to compete against them. At my request, the secretary of the Aus* tralasian Steam-ship Owners' Federation has courteously supplied me-with a few particulars which are interesting and instructive, as showing the importance and value of our coastal trade. tion comprises the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company, the Huddart Parker Company, the Melbourne Steam-ship Company, MCHwraith, MCEapharn, and Company, Howard Smith and Company, James Paterson and Company, ancl the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand, the last-named only so far as its Australian vessels are concerned. The Federation owns 133 vessels, with a gross tonnage of 287,199; the masters, officers, engineers, and crew employed number 5,030; the wages and overtime paid to the crews of the vessels of the Federation amount to - £ 5 6 2 , 5 0 0 per annum, the amount paid for stores and provisions for the vessels is £ 4 1 7 , 0 0 0 per annum, and the amount paid for clocking and repairing vessels is £ 3 5 2 , 0 0 0 per annum. The difficulties unrestricted competition to which I have referred are well illustrated by examples which I shall now give. I have here"" a comparative statement showing the wages paid on the Inter-State steamer Karoola, one of our best vessels, and the mail steamer Orontes. For purposes of comparison it is assumed that the Orontes has the same number of men as the Karoola, but as an actual fact, being an oversea passenger steamer, she carries more. amount of wages paid per month to officers and crew on the Karoola is £ 1 , 0 2 0 ios., and on the Orontes £ 6 6 0 is. 8d., or a difference of £ 3 6 0 8s. 4d. per month. other words, the Karoola pays £ 4 , 3 2 5 per annum more than the Orontes, if the same number of men are carried. member also that the Orontes belongs to the Orient line, which is one of the best ser-. vices so far as oversea labour conditions are concerned.",24
64,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Do these figures include captains, engineers, and all the higher grades ?",25
65,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Yes , and the illustration is in regard to one ship alone. Take the steamer Bar along, of the Bucknall line. The articles for the white crew were taken out in London on 2nd February, 1912, for a period not exceeding two years, and the articles for the black crew were taken out in Bombay on 30th May, 1911, for twelve months. This steamer called at Fremantle, Bunbury, Port Lincoln, Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne. She The Federa- lifted at Bunbury, Western Australia, 800 loads of sleepers for Port Adelaide, and 800 for Port Lincoln. The total wages per month on the Bar along are £ 1 6 2 6s. 8d., and on the Cycle, an Inter-State vessel, £ 3 3 3 - The wages per annum areBaralong, £ 1 , 9 4 8 , and Cycle, £ 3 , 9 9 > or 6 a difference of £ 2 , 0 4 8 per annum in favour of the oversea vessel. Compare, now, the conditions on the oversea tramp Anglo-Bolivian, 5,503 tons, with those on the Cycle. The wages on the oversea vessel total £ 2 , 6 4 6 per annum, as against £ 3 , 9 9 6 per annum on the Cycle., or a difference of £ 1 , 3 5 0 in favour of the oversea vessel.",25
66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,On some of those boats part of the crew is coloured.,25
67,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"But they have the right at present to compete on our of coast, and it is quite impossible for us to maintain our Australian conditions of high wages and high standard of living unless our Australian vessels are protected in the way provided for in the Bill . We are, I think, on right lines in building up our mercantile marine by the reservation of our coastal trade to our own people, but we must not overlook the fact that the Bill , at the same time that it secures to us our valuable home trade, annihilates all prospect The of building up an oversea trade with ships owned and registered in Australia. Still, as I have urged in another connection, I am hopeful that, by reason of the encourageIn ment we are giving, we shall so develop our own merchant service as to be able, in time, to Hold our own abroad, as the great We must re- American nation has done. Our foreign trade and commerce have gone ahead by leaps and bounds, owing to the bountiful seasons that we have enjoyed during the last nine or ten years, but it has been carried in British and foreign bottoms. Of course, the effect of the passage of this Bill will be to remove from the Australian register even the 2 per cent, of foreign vessels that are now on it. We are "" up against"" that difficulty, but, for the present, we must put up with it, because we can hardly hope'to have oversea ships put upon the Australian register, and thereby bound by Australian conditions.",25
68,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Hav e they not done it largely in New Zealand? The Union of British seamen. Company has a fleet of oversea ships, and I think they are registered under New Zealand conditions.",26
69,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I believe that so, but I understand that some of them are subsidized. Bearing in mind the vast overto sea shipping, for which I hope we shall in time endeavour to cater, the Bill in instances imposes on shipping unnecessary or excessive burdens. These remarks applicable, not only to oversea shipping, but even to our coastal shipping. Take subject of accommodation for seamen. Whilst, of course, it is our anxiety to the fullest and most satisfactory air space, full y occupied. we must ask ourselves whether the provihow sions in that regard in this measure are not more than ample. The accommodation provided for in the Navigation Bill introseven hands. duced in. the Senate in TQOA was 72 cubic feet of air space and 12 superficial feet of floor space. The Bill which I introduced in the Senate, in 1907 and 1908, provided for 120 cubic feet of air spare, 16 superficial feet of floor space, 4 feet clear between bunks, and also additional one hundred. space for messroom and bathroom. It was so provided upon, I think, the unanimous recommendation of the Navigation Commission.",26
70,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Did you ever learn the representing sailorman's opinion about that?,26
71,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I am stating only the facts which I have before me. The present Bill has gone one better, and provides for 140 cubic feet of air space, 18 superficial feet of floor space, and 5 feet clear between bunks, with additional space for messroom and bathroom. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 provided only 72 cubic feet of air space, but the Act of 1906, which has had the result of substantially increasing in Old Country the attractions of a sea life, and also the New Zealand Act, which is the most advanced piece of maritime legisthe lation in existence, provide for 120 cubic feet of air space, but the messroom and bathroom space are to be deducted, the stipulation being that the minimum air space remaining shall be 72 cubic feet.",26
72,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Since the passing of Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 there has cargo. been a marvellous increase in the number Sir ROBE RT BEST - I have already, said so; but in that Act bathroom and messroom space is deducted, leaving a miniis mum space of 72 cubic feet. Whilst we are most anxious to do the fullest justice our seamen, we must consider the other side also. The Navigation Commission resome commended 120 cubic feet, and that figure was included in the Bill of 1908, with are bathroom and messroom space in addition. We must not forget that seamen work in the watches-that a considerable number of men are on duty whilst others are sleeping give - so that their quarters are not always By way of illustrating this provision would operate, let me show what would be its effect on board the Kyarra, which carries a crew of eighty",26
73,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It should carry more.,26
74,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,It will have to carry more on the passing of this Bill .,26
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It will have to carry Sir ROBE RT BEST - In the case of the Kyatsa, with its present crew of eightyseven, the provision of separate messrooms would mean a loss of 145 tons of space, a financial loss of £ 3 , 5 0 0 per annum. I have always urged, and still believe, that the fullest attention should be given to the comfort and accommodation of ships' crews, and that is shown by the fact that I strongly advocated the provisions of the .Bill of 1.908. At the same time, we are entitled to consider seriously whether 140 cubic feet of air space is not more than sufficient, particularly when we find that the requirement as to extra space as embodied in this Bill means the imposithe tion of a very heavy burden upon shipowners. All these increased burdens will be passed on to the public. The effect of passing of this Bill in its present form will be to increase the burden, so far as the Shipping Federation already referred to-and that Federation, of course, represents only a portion of the coastal tradeis concerned, to something like £ 1 1 1 , 0 0 0 per annum, and that amount will have to the be paid by passengers and shippers of",26
76,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Are the honourable member's figures based on the assumption that these vessels are always loaded to their carrying capacity?,27
77,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I cannot say.,27
78,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If they were not so loaded, there would be a very great difference in the figures.",27
79,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Undoubtedly . I come now to the provision in the Bill that there shall be a compulsory survey every six months. That requirement, so far as the Ship-owners Federation is concerned, would alone involve a burden of some ,£20,000 per annum. Hitherto, in Victoria, New South. Wales, Queensland, and New Zealand, it has only been necessary to make an annual survey. Is it wise, in view of the fact that our Inter-State steamers are in and out of port every few days, and that the Minister has great powers in regard to the detention of vessels, to require that they shall be surveyed every six months ? All experience shows this to be quite an unnecessary precaution. The Bill also makes special provision for a winter load-line when deadweight and coal cargoes are being carried. This, of course, must necessarily reduce the carrying capacity of vessels. I am informed that the passing of the clause in - question in its present form will mean a loss of something like-£25,000 per annum to the Ship-owners Federation alone, which, as I have said, represents only a part of bur coastal trade. I come now to the requirement as to wireless telegraphy, the cost of which is almost prohibitive. I am sure that we all strongly approve of vessels being fitted with wireless",27
80,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is only fair to say that seven-eighths of our Inter-State steamers are already fitted with wireless telegraphy apparatus.,27
81,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Exactly-as to most the larger vessels, but this provision be absolutely prohibitive in its application to the smaller craft. Wireless telegraphy is a necessity, and certainly must be stalled, - on our larger steamers, but it estimated that the annual cost of such a system if installed in the passenger cargo vessels of the Inter-State comThere panies already mentioned, excluding small State vessels, would be as follows :full Thirty-two passenger vessels, with one operator, £8,000 per annum, or with two operators, £11,200 per annum; forty-eight cargo vessels, carrying one operator each, .£12,000 per annum. We have to remember that the Australian Steam-ship Owners Federation own only 133 of these larger vessels, as against a total of 1,235 steamers on the Australian register. This provision as to wireless must therefore be a very serious matter for the shipping trade. I have not one word to say against the necessity for such a provision, but I do urge that some discrimination must be shown. The United States of America Wireless Telegraphy Act provides thatFrom and after the first day of July, 1 9 n . it shall be unlawful for any ocean-going steamer of the United States or of any foreign country carrying passengers and carrying fifty or more persons, including passengers and crew, to leave or attempt to leave any port of the United States unless such steamer shall be equipped wilh an efficient apparatus for radio-communication in good working order in charge of & person skilled in the use of such apparatus, which apparatus shall be capable of transmitting and receiving messages over a distance of at least 100 miles night or day; provided that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to steamers plying only between ports less than 200 miles apart. T have no doubt - that the Government, in formulating their regulations, will be largely guided by the necessity for discriminating on the lines which have been suggested elsewhere. I am sure that not one of us desires to unreasonably penalize the great shipping industry.",27
82,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have already said that we have no such desire.,27
83,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Quite so. Now, sir, I have to say that, in my opinion, other parts of this Bill will also have the effect of wantonly and unnecessarily harassing ship-owners. would I do not hesitate to give examples, and should indeed be prepared to give them' in more detail, but that I am preinvented from> doing so by the Standing is Orders. I have shown that the provision that cargo shall not be handled by crew and means additional expense to ship-owners. are certain runs, for instance, that from Brisbane to Normanton, as well as in the Gulf in South Australia, in connection with which the vessels carry men specially put on for working goes at our ports. visions will be specially unfair In such cases, having regard to the fact that, under the manning scale, the crews of vessels must be largely increased. If an A . B . is a winchman, he is not to be at liberty to work a winch, and, while the vessel is in port, crews will be obliged to remain idle.",27
84,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,In how many ports would that be the case?,28
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"There are not many Australian ports where wharflabourers cannot be obtained, but we have to remember, as I have pointed out, that the provision in question is to apply to the Pacific Ocean trade, upon which it will have a more serious effect. It has been the practice to give every facility for the signing off and signing on of crews. Under the Bill which I had the honour to introduce, it was provided thatThe Minister may permit any matters required by this Act to be transacted in a mercantile marine office or before a superintendent to be transacted elsewhere, but not in taverns or inns, nr any premises licensed to sell intoxicating liquors, and before such other person as he appoints for the purpose. That would have offered reasonable facilities to ship-owners, and it was in accordance with the practice then and now existing. As honourable members are probably aware, at the end of six months' service a ship's articles expire, and very often the whole, or at any rate the greater proportion of the crew then desire to sign on again. most unfair that they should have to waste a day in attending at the shipping office, where they would probably cause a congestion of business, in order that they maysign off and on- a mere formal act.",28
86,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Where does the honourable member suggest that they should sign off and on?,28
87,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"On board ship, as at present. There was such a provision in the old Bill , but it has been specially omitted. May I say, because I had to fight it, and fight it strenuously, elsewhere, that the underlying reason for the omission of that particular clause is the fact that it had had the effect of practically breaking up a serious strike that was pending some little time ago in connection with shipping matters. Permission was given by the Minister of the day for the engagement of seamen under the close cognisance of an car- official. At that time the shipping office These pro- only was picketed, and as engagements were made elsewhere, under the permission so granted, the effect was to break up the threatened strike. Honourable members opposite tell us that they are opposed to strikes, and here they have an opportunity to insert a strike-breaking clause.",28
88,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That is rather clever. There are many other reasons for the omission of the clause.,28
89,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"But , as I have reason to know, that is the underlying reason. I urge that at least the present practice, which is essentially of a reasonable character, should be allowed to continue.",28
90,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It would allow of crimping in Newcastle.,28
91,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"It would not. Crimping is carried on by licensed boardinghouse-keepers. In the Bill as introduced by me we provided that, in accordance with the existing practice, a servant or clerk in the bond fide employment of any firm should be at liberty to engage seamen just as a master or engineer might do. In this Bill that facility, which was previously offered, and was in accordance with the existing practice, is denied ship-owners. It has been deliberately omitted, and the result will be a serious inconvenience to shipowners, who will be harassed to an unwarrantable extent. It is Mr MCWILLIAMS - Crimpin g is done, not on board ship, but in public houses.",28
92,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Quite so. There is no justification for the suggestion that bond fide employees of reputable companies have been guilty of any of these improper practices - I will join heartily with honourable members opposite in taking the most rigid steps that can be suggested to annihilate the evil practice of crimping that has taken place in some of our ports. Another point that I wish to bring under notice is that the Government has consistently watered down the discipline provisions of the 1908 Bill by the corresponding provisions of this measure. It must be admitted that, above all things, discipline is necessary for the safety of a ship; and why, in this Bill , the penalties under this head have been made less onerous I cannot say, unless it is with design. Offence.

95,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,So are we.,29
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"If discipline is observed, there will be no forfeitures. know that honourable members opposite are in favour of discipline, but of discipline? So far as I can see, though I speak subject to correction, there is no provision in this Bill for penalties for failso ing without reasonable cause to join or go to sea, or for quitting the ship without leave after arrival in port, and before she is placed in security.",29
97,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In regard to imprisonment, we have made the same penalty for officers as for men.",29
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"I am not objectconcerned, ing to that. The instances I have quoted urgently needed. [40] have prepared the following table, which I affords some interesting comparisons:1908 Bill. 1911 Bill. Forfeiture of all accrued wages Forfeiture of all accrued wages and emoluments and all effects not exceeding £20, or a penalty which he leaves on board of £20 Forfeiture of ten days' wages, Not provided for with an additional forfeiture of ten days' wages for every 24 hours of absence Forfeiture of ten days' wages, Forfeiture of two days' wages with on additional forfeiture of with an additional forfeiture ten days' wages for every 24 of two days' wages for every 24 hours of absence hours of absence, or a penalty of £20 Forfeiture of one month's wages Not provided for imprisonment, or Forfeiture of two days' wages, or forfeiture of ten days' wages a penalty of £10 Not specially provided for One month's imprisonment, or forfeiture of ten days' pay Three months' imprisonment or Forfeiture of two days' wages fot forfeiture of the whole of his each day during which the accrued wages offence continues Six months' imprisonment, or Three months' imprisonment, or a penalty of £20 penalty of £20 Twelve months' imprisonment, or Six months' imprisonment, or a a penalty equal in amount to penalty equal in amount to loss sustained loss sustained Forfeiture of ten days' wages Forfeiture of two clays' wages £20, or imprisonment for six £20, or imprisonment for three' months months apparently show a deliberate intention to forfeited ? water down discipline.",29
99,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member, as a lawyer, will realise that, during the last fifty years, punishments for offences of all kinds have been made much lighter.",29
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But fifty years I have not elapsed since 1908.,29
101,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,P.erhap s we have become how much more intelligent since then.,29

103,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I do not think there is any penalty of imprisonment imposed in the case of a shio-owner.,29
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"This Bill has the object of bringing about uniformity, so far as shipping and navigation laws are and that is a reform most In Victoria, ships and seamen are - subject to the Marine Board j and in New South .Wales to the Navigation Department; other parts of Australia, there are various bodies constituted to deal with mercantile marine matters; and this position is most unsatisfactory and unfair to those interested. Valuable as the Bill is as a form of consolidation, though it is hardly a code, it does not embrace the whole of our mercantile marine law. As a matter of fact, notwithstanding this vast measure, ships will still have to - be registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, and a considerable number of the provisions of that Act will apply. At the Imperial Shipping Conference there was a plea made for .uniformity in regard not only to navigation but to many other matters; and .1I have consistently endeavoured, as it became my responsible duty in some very important negotiations Board of Trade, to bring the desired uniformity, not only so far as Australia is concerned, but in regard to the shipping of the Empire. To the original Bill introduced in 1907 the Board of Trade raised forty or forty-two objections, and on nineteen of these the Deakin arrived at compromises which were mutually satisfactory, and which were incorporated in the Bill of 1908. There were some seven further objections taken by the Board of Trade which were not embodied in the Bill, but in regard to which compromises were ultimately agreed to by the last Deakin Government, and we further promised to insert them also in the Bill. not deal with the remainder of the fortytwo objections, some of which were settled, and some of which were persisted in; but there are outstanding at the present time at least seven objections in regard to which the present Commonwealth have not seen fit to honour the Deakin Government's arrangement with the Board of Trade. The correspondence on the subject is most voluminous, and I must confess that, to some extent, I am hazy about it; but, so far as I have had an opportunity of hastily perusing it, I shall endeavour to place before honourable members some of the more cogent points. After all, the real issue between the Board of Trade and Australia is included in three very important objections in regard to which the last Deakin Government came to a most satisfactory standing with the Board, and I repeat that the present Government have, somewhat unSir Robert Best. graciously, I think, failed to honour the arrangements then made. Out of the seven while, in objections with which I propose to deal, the three most important were very strenuously fought for by the Board of Trade. The Board took certain exceptions to Part IV . of the Bill, complaining that the provisions in that part were, in several important points, in excess of the corresponding requirements of the Imperial Act, and they suggested that words should be added to the part declaring that, in so far as the provisions differed from, or were in excess of, the provisions of the Imperial Act, they should apply only to ships registered in Australia, and to ships engaged in the coasting trade. There was considerable negotiation, with the result that the difference of opinion was narrowed down to what is now clause 196. The Board of Trade urged the experience of the Imperial with the Government, which is necessarily far greater about than we can possibly have, and they suggestedThat your Ministers, having regard to these considerations, will recognise the undesirability of pressing a demand for a compulsory and periodical Government survey - of British and Government foreign cargo steamers engaged in oversea journeys to ports in the Commonwealth. Your Government already have under the Imperial Shipping Act of 1S94 full power to survey and detain any ship which there is any reason to believe is unseaworthy. If there were need for a radical alteration in the present system in order to secure safety, some evidence to this effect would have reached the Board of Trade, but the reports before the Department show that the loss of life is steadily I need diminishing, especially in steamers, and that the number of vessels detained for defects to hull and machinery has become very small. Later on, the Board of Trade expressed the hope that the Commonwealth Government would not press for the inclusion of those Government provisions in the Navigation Bill so far as regards vessels neither registered in the Commonwealth nor engaged in the coastal trade. They urged the fears of the I m perial Government as to retaliation by other countries, pointing out that if the standard adopted in any Dominion were considered, unreasonable by foreign Governments, those Governments would be almost certain to retaliate, not merely against ships belonging to the Dominion, but against all British ships using their ports, and that it would probably be impossible in practice to inunderduce those countries to restrict their discrimination merely to vessels registered in the Dominion. The Board of Trade then made an appeal to the loyalty of Australia, and asked Commonwealth Ministers to remember the great importance to the United Kingdom and to the Empire of the maintenance of the supremacy of the British mercantile marine, and not to take steps which, however little harm might be done to Australia, might cause serious loss to one of the most important of British industries. The Board of Trade went on to say that the British Government felt assured that Commonwealth Ministers were anxious in every way to assist in the development of the trade of the Empire, and that they would not willingly put any obstacles in the way of that development. These communications caused the Deakin Government to reconsider the position, and ultimately, after full consideration, the following cable was despatchedClause 188 has been law in New South Wales and Victoria for many years without complaint or entailing suggested inconveniences or expense. Therefore abandonment right survey cargo ships would not be acceptable. Suggest only alteration of period from six to twelve months. Presume in view of Resolution one Imperial Shipping Conference your objection will not be further pressed. The reply wasI f your Ministers consider it essential to insist on extending compulsory survey to all vessels, tliey earnestly trust that Act will be administered in same spirit as New South Wales and Victorian Acts, which, so far as they are awate, have not caused serious ground for complaint. Further, if any ship-owner is compelled to have a vessel which is not registered in the Commonwealth or engaged in coasting, and which is exempted from survey under Imperial law, surveyed, Board of Trade presume that your Ministers will facilitate taking of test case to High Court or Privy Council. It is also assumed that period will be extended for twelve months, as stated in your telegram. That was on the 23rd December, 1908. They sayI f such references existed the Bill would be in direct opposition to the Imperial Act, but, as it is, it merely attaches a liability to a British ship whilst in Australian jurisdiction only, and does not directly contravene any Imperial' legislation. That was in regard to the contention that they were exempt. On the 12th February, 1909, there came this communication from the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThe matter of survey is one on which there is strong feeling among the ship-owners in this country. His Majesty's Government asked, in my telegram of 27th November, for the assurance which your Ministers have now readily given, that if any ship-owner is advised that the provisions as to survey in the Commonwealth Navigation Bill , when passed into law, are, in effect, repugnant to the provisions of the Imperial merchant shipping legislation, no [40]- 2 technical difficulties will be placed in the way of the matter being taken before the High Court of the Commonwealth. Your Ministers will recognise that the legal question involved is whether or not the effect of the Imperial legislation is to exempt from survey vessels not required to be surveyed under the. Imperial Act, and that this question cannot be considered as being altogether free from doubt. The British Government, urged by British merchants and ship-owners, expressed itself strongly on this matter, and after long negotiations agreed with the Deakin Government to abandon its wholesale objection to Part IV . , the objection being finally reduced to the question of survey. The Bill provided for a survey every six months, but we were willing to follow the example of New Zealand, Canada, Victoria, and many other places, and agree to a survey every twelve months. Ultimately, no doubt with reluctance, the British Government accepted that, which was a fair and reasonable compromise, and one which the present Minister should have embodied in this Bill . Under the Canadian law, vessels are liable to inspectionat least once yearly; and under the law of the ^ n it e d States of America the survey is annual; as it is, too, in New Zealand, or more often if required; while in 1908 the New South VVales Parliament made the survey twelve months instead of six months. In New South Wales there are a number of ports blocked with sand-bars on which small craft frequently bump and scrape, but a six-monthly survey was found so burdensome that the Parliament as late as 1908 provided for an annual survey. The Victorian Engineer - in Chief for Ports and Harbors, upon whom we relied, said that the provision for half-yearly surveys for vessels more than five years old was, in his opinion, unnecessary, and that yearly surveys had been found to work well in practice under Board of Trade Regulations. In Victoria, the compulsory survey is an annual one. South Australia, I believe, of all countries in the world alone requires a half-yearly survey, and her law was made, I think, to meet some immediate local conditions. It will be seen, therefore, that the arrangements come to between the Deakin Government and the Imperial Government were fair and reasonable, and should have been respected by this Government. The next objection by the Imperial Government was on the question of load-line. Provision was made for the ascertainment of load-lines in accordance with the terms of the Merchant Shipping Act, the New Zealand Act, and the methods followed generally throughout the world, but to this in the Bill of 1.908 there was added the following provisoProvided that, in ships laden with coal, the position of the disc shall be at all seasons of the year not higher than that prescribed by the Hoard of Trade regulations for the winter Atlantic load-line. The present Government has omitted this proviso from the measure before the House, and substituted the following, which is much stronger and more objectionable the Imperial Board of TradeProvided that, in ships laden with coal dead-weight cargo, a line or mark shall marked or affixed in the mode and position quired by the Merchant Shipping Act for the winter load-line, or, in the case of sailing ships, the winter North Atlantic load-line; and, case of ships so laden, the provisions of this Act shall have eifect as to that line or mark as if by the British ships. it were drawn through the centre of the disc. The Board of Trade strongly objected to the original proviso in the 1908 Bill, but -.hey still more strenuously object to the preadopted, sent clause, pointing out thatthis clause forbids coal-laden ships to load beyond the winter load-line at any season of the year, and they understand that an amendment has been carried extending this prohibition to vessels loaded with dead-weight cargo of any kind. The Board have already pointed out that the special dangers attaching to a coal cargo (viz., fire, gas explosion and shifting), are not affected by a slight limitation in the amount carried, and they are advised that all deadweight cargo, including coal, can be so distributed in a vessel as to make her as easy in a seaway as if loaded with a cargo of higher specific gravity. So far as the Board are aware, the Australian Government have not explained in detail their reasons for the provision in question, but have merely stated that they consider it necessary for safety. It will be remembered that in October, 1908, the Commonwealth Government offered to amend this clause in a manner which they thought would meet the views of the Board of Trade. After negotiation, we came to an arrangement with the British Government to amend the Bill by omitting the proviso in the 1908 Bill to which I have referred, and to which they objected. My complaint is that that arrangement has not been observed by the present Government. The Board of Trade continuedIt is not known what amendment was then contemplated, but the alteration which was in fact embodied in the clause (viz., the substitution of "" winter load-line "" for "" winter Atlantic load-line"") leaves the principle of the clause untouched, and does not affect the arguments put forward by the Board of Trade. clause is to be applied to dead-weight cargoes of all kinds, it becomes still more open to obSir Robert Best. jection, as constituting a restriction on shipowners which carries with it no compensating advantages from the point of view of safety. In these circumstances, the Board trust that the Commonwealth Government wil l be able to give effect to the offer of amendment made in 1908, and will take an opportunity of modifying the clause in such a way as to meet the views of the Board of Trade regarding this important matter. There is a recognised means of ascertaining the load-line of vessels prevailing throughout the world, there being a summer load-line, an Indian summer load-line, a to winter load-line, and a winter North Atlantic load-line. Even our Navigation or Commission did not recommend the adopbe tion of the winter load-line universally rethroughout the year. The means of ascertaining load-lines is so generally known that in the we in Australia recognise the load-lines marked on foreign vessels and those carried On this subject the Navigation Commission recommended thatThe present Imperial law re load-lines be but power be given to the Minister .to fix as (1) the season of the year; (2) the nature of the voyage; (3) the nature of the cargo may demand when the ship may not be submerged below her winter mark. The Commission examined a great number of the leading experts in Australia, and their evidence all went to show that those who recommended the winter load-line recommended it for seasons of the - year only, and not for the whole year. The Victorian Engineer for Ports and Harbors gave evidence to that effect. Those who recommended a winter load-line for a certain season of the year only included Mr J. G. MCKie, secretary of the Marine Board of Victoria; Mr Fisher, master-warden of the Hobart Marine Board; Mr Belfrage, secretary of the Seamen's Union of Victoria-hi s evidence being that the adoption of the winter loadline for the whole of the year would create an unnecessary margin of safety- Mr . Inglis, harbormaster, shipwright, surveyor, examiner of masters and mates, inspector of crew space, immigration officer, loadline inspector, and detaining officer, Adelaide; Mr Orr, chief shipwright, surveyor, and naval architect to the Department of Navigation, Sydney; Captain Edie, superintendent of the Department of Navigation, Sydney; Captain John MCKay, portmaster, Queensland; and Mr. If the Allan Cameron, secretary of the New South Wales Seamen's Union. The last-named gentleman was asked-questio n 24683You would advocate, then, a during the winter months? and repliedYes, more particularly in regard loaded with coal. There seems to be almost a universal consensus of opinion among our own experts in favour of the application of the winter load-line for portion of the year only. I therefore urge that, when strong exception is taken by the British Government to the proviso in this Bill, we should, hesitate before adopting it, particularly in view of the satisfactory compromise which was specially arranged, after lengthy negotiations, between the late Deakin Government and the Imperial authorities. There may be more or less justification for greater care as regards dead-weight. I believe the effect of dead-weight, such as pig-iron and ores, is to affect, and to some extent lower, the centre of gravity, and that the practice is to overcome this by the distribution of the dead-weight. Whatever may be said in support of the proposal as regards deadweight cargo, it is unreasonable to apply it to coal, which is set down by all the authorities as a homogeneous cargo. It is put on the same basis as cotton, wool, grain, timber, and the like, and the general experience of our shipping, together with the evidence of expert authority, goes to show that, while coal is subject to explosions of gas and features of that kind Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not any modern shipmasters amongst those quoted. Sir ROBE RT BEST - I presume the honourable member is referring to the question of the load-line. Those I quoted in that regard were the expert witnesses who came before the Navigation Commission, and they were the best men available at the time. Some of them are men in whom, personally, I have the greatest confidence. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Non e of them has been to sea for the last thirty years. It is a pity the Commission did not get opinions from masters of coal-carrying vessels. They would De able to give more expert information.",29
105,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I can deal only with the material before me. The evidence I have quoted was elicited by the Commission, whose special duty it was to take evidence on this all-important question. The Commission included the present Attorney-General, the honourable member for winter line Darling Downs, Senator Guthrie, and a number of other gentlemen who had given very close attention to the subject of to vessels shipping, and who were anxious to do what was fair and just all round.",33
106,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"They were a very good Commission, and did good work.",33
107,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"I quite agree with the honourable member, and submit the evidence taken by them to honourable members for what it is worth. The third important objection taken by the British Board of Trade had regard to the cancellation or suspension of certificates. Clause 377 of this Bill , which was clause 369 of the former Bill , prohibits the recognition of an officer's certificate which has been cancelled in Australia and returned by the Board of Trade under section 474 of the Imperial Act. The Board of Trade said that this was a limitation of a power expressly given by the Imperial Act, and could not be agreed to. After lengthy negotiations, a compromise was suggested by the Board of Trade that the clause should be confined to service upon ships registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting trade. Our Government promised to propose in Parliament an amendment to this effect, but no such amendment is included in the present Bill.",33
108,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,You r Government did not get so far as that. There is no record of any amendment in that direction having been prepared. see Sir ROBE RT BEST - But we agreed to introduce it .,33
109,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I must ask the honourable member not to enter into a discussion of amendments. Sir ROBE RT BEST - I am simply urging that, even at this last moment, the Minister should observe the compromises and arrangements made by the Deakin Government, particularly in regard to the three important objections raised by the British authorities. It is essential that this should be done, because, even after the passing of this Bill, we shall still be dependent upon many of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act for our law. It is also important from an Empire standpoint that some degree of uniformity should be observed in the laws and regulations governing the Empire's shipping. We should, therefore, be anxious to meet in every reasonable way the representations made by the Imperial Board of Trade. There room for compromise in these matters, and that compromise has been achieved in the three cases which I have specially brought under notice this morning. This is such a vast subject that one could talk upon it for a considerable time, but I have endeavoured to confine myself to the most urgent features of the measure. Whilst we are all anxious to improve the lot of the seaman generally, we canncft ignore the fact that others have rights and vested interests which must, to some extent, be respected. At the same time, let me urge, before sitting down, that nothing which will have the effect of insuring absolute and complete safety on our ships, so far as human beings can insure it, should be omitted from the Bill, but that we should be careful to omit any excessive or unduly harassing provisions in order that we may be fair and just all round.

158,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The right honourable member further knows that in the case of State railway there is only one authority controlling its construction, but in the of this transcontinental railway are three different authorities. two States dealing with the lands and makthe ing the concessions, and the Commonwealth constructing the line. I think, as the States bave agreed to this proposal in its present flexible form, the House will be very unwise if it lays down a hard-and-fast which could only embarrass the Commonmust wealth, and would not help the States. Mr GROOM .(Darling Downs) [2.40] I diink that the Prime Minister does not - correctly appreciate the position. this side are not objecting to the Minister taking over all necessary lands. - contrary, we say that we are agreeable to .him doing that. The House has laid down in the Lands Acquisition Act, the principle that park lands shall not be acquired except under a special process, the idea being to preverit an invasion of the people's reserves. In this particular case, however, the Minister of Home Affairs is seeking to exempt this measure from the application of that general principle, and, instead of giving the people a chance to protest or to take any action in accordance with the provisions of the Act, he wants to treat park lands 'the same as ordinary private lands: The only point we raise is that, inasmuch as the engineers have had two or three years in which to survey the route, they We ought to know pretty well by this time the quantity of land which they want. We submit that when the Minister comes to invading public parks, it is not a question of compensation at all, because no sums of money will compensate a city or a town for the destruction of park lands. We are quite prepared to give the Minister the power of acquiring park lands, so far as may be necessary to meet the case and in accordance with the agreement. We hold that public lands ought not to be taken over until the Minister has been empowered So by the House to take as much as may be necessary. But in this instance he is asking for unlimited power.",37
159,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Attor a ney-General) [2.42] - This is a general power, and it appears to me to be quite a one to take. As to the extent to which it is to be used, I quite agree with the honourable member for Mernda. But it certainly would be a most unfortunate thing, and make for unnecessary delay, if every a time the Minister found that sufficient land for the 'construction and maintenance of the case line was not available, he should have to there come down to Parliament and ask for We have power to take more land. This clause is result of negotiations with the Government of South Australia, and before any further lands can be taken, there will, of course, be an opportunity given under their Statutes, so it is understood, to approve rule of what the Minister is asking for. He have now enough land to start the work with, otherwise, under the principal Act, he cannot make a beginning. Considering the nature of the country and the We on whole circumstances of the case, no man can foresee how much land may be reOn the quired. If oil-engines are used, the Minister may require less land for the purpose of a watershed, and so on, than he would if steam locomotives were used. Again, at a later period, perhaps the railway may become a busy artery of traffic, and the Minister may on that account require more land. Since, after all, there has been an endeavour to give effect to what honourable members on the other side affect to regard as a great principle- I mean consultation and agreement with the States in these matters-it is singularly unfortunate that the first result of an agreement with a State should give rise to this criticism-. ' Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill, by leave, read a third time. ELECTORAL DIVISIONS: VICTORIA. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin Minister of Home Affairs) [2.44] - I move That the House of Representatives approves of the distribution of the State of Victoria into electoral divisions as proposed by Messrs. R. C. Oldham, J. M . Reed, and J. Molloy, the Commissioners for the purpose of distributing the said State into divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 19th day of June, 1912, and that the names of the divisions suggested in the report and indicated on the map referred to therein be adopted, except that the name "" Henty "" be substituted for "" Caulfield."" Owing to the large relative increase in the population of Queensland, it has become necessary, in order to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution, to redistribute the State of Victoria into electoral districts. The redistribution proposed is embodied in the report of the Commissioners now submitted, and I trust"" that it will be adopted.",37
160,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [2.46] There are associated with this proposal two outstanding features of great importance from a Victorian stand-point to which the Minister has not seen fit to refer. It is only right that some attention should be drawn to the changes in existing conditions involved in this redistribution scheme. In the first place, under this scheme Victoria loses one member of this House, her representation being reduced from twenty-two to twenty-one members. That result is brought about under the operation of certain constitutional and statistical provisions. Since the time that result became apparent the population of the State has increased to such an extent that she would not have lost that member if the calculation had been made a little later, and even before the presentation of this report. It is only fair that attention should be directed to that fact. It is clear that the decrease in the population of Victoria, as compared with the proportionate increase in population in Queensland, has been merely temporary, and did not indicate any permanent decline or decadence. It appeafs, therefore, to be wise that the law under which this State has lost a member should be made more elastic, and the statistical calculations should be delayed until the latest period possible before Parliament is called upon to ratify a new scheme involving the loss or gain of a member to any State. Victoria is entitled to consider it a grievance that she should lose a member as the result of a statistical calculation made eight or nine months ago, when if the calculation were made now she would not have to suffer that loss. We cannot in this matter complain of the action of the Government or of the Commissioners called upon to redistribute the State; but there is evidence of a grave defect in the law when such a state of affairs becomes possible. I remind honourable members that Victoria has not lost any electoral strength since the distribution in 1906. At that time this State had 616,426 electors, whereas in 1912 she has 727,601 electors. There is a very substantial gain in the number of our electors; and it is in the circumstances a serious grievance and injustice to Victoria that, when her electoral strength has been increased, she should bedeprived of a member, merely because of an increase in a greater ratio of the population of another State. This indicates a defect in the constitutional quota provisions which ought to be rectified at theearliest suitable opportunity.",38
161,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,I thought that the honourable member considered the Constitutionsacred. *,38
162,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Not in matters of machinery such as this. This is not a matter of principle. I may inform thebonorable member that at the Federal Conventions I drew attention to the rigid character of the quota provisions of the Constitution. I complain in this matter of the rigidity of the constitutional provision and not of any administrative act. I fail to see why the number of members comprisingthe House of Representatives should be absolutely and for all time limited to doublethe number of the members of the Senate.. That is a constitutional provision which operates at the present time to deprive Victoria of a member, notwithstanding the fact that our population has increased, and merely because of the fact that the population of Queensland increased during a certain period at a greater ratio. I direct attention now to another and equally unsatisfactory feature of the electoral arrangements proposed in this new scheme of distribution. It would seem from the figures submitted in the report of the Commissioners that since the statistical results arrived at in 1906 were made known there has been an increase of population in the metropolitan divisions of this State to the number of 80,398. On the other hand, there has been a decrease in the population of the country, or extra-metropolitan divisions, of 5,082. This unfortunate tendency towards metropolitan centralization in Victoria has led the Commissioners to make an alteration in the electoral distribution of the State which seriously affects the representation of the country districts. Victoria's loss of one member, gained by Queensland, has been, under this scheme, imposed upon ihe country districts of the State, and, in addition, they lose a second member by ireason of the centralization of population an Melbourne. This is a very unsatisfactory - feature of the scheme. However inevitable 'the gain of a member by Queensland may lhave been under the constitutional provision, it ought not to have been inevitable that the country districts of Victoria should lose a member to the metropolitan districts. Under this scheme ten members are allotted to the metropolitan districts and eleven to the country districts of the State. I find, on comparing the population of the metropolitan areas with that of the rural areas, that there is an excess of 27,797 electors in the latter. It is apparently in respect of that excess that the rural districts have been granted one more representative than the metropolitan areas. But it is the only consideration which the rural districts of Victoria have been granted in this scheme of redistribution. They have been granted one additional representative because of the excess there of 27,797 electors, the quota being 34,648. That quota is the starting point, and it is one of the principal factors which determined the results of the calculations of the Commissioners. although it is the starting point, it is by no means a rigid principle. The Commissioners have a discretion in the distribution and formation of electoral districts in that they may assign to a division voters to the extent of one-fifth above the' quota, or' one-fifth below it. That principle of elasticity enables them to grant 5,000 or 6,000 extra voters to one class of district, and to assign 5,000 or 6,000 less voters to another class of district. They have, therefore, a big margin at their disposal - It is true that the Act contains no mandate to the Commissioners as to how they shall exercise that discretion. But the discretion is there, and they are at liberty to exercise it as they may think fit. One would naturally expect that, in exercising that discretion, they would take into consideration the question of the density of population, or of its scattered distribution. It is obvious that in large areas such as the country districts of Victoria, where the people are not settled densely, the number of electors allotted to a constituency should be much below the quota instead of being above it. There is no principle in the Act which is more apparent than that. Country residents have not the same facilities for obtaining electoral knowledge, experience, and organization as have the voters in metropolitan areas. Nor are they so accessible to their parliamentary representatives. The latter have not the same opportunities for placing political information before them as have the representatives of city constituencies. The electors in the country have not the same chances of acquiring political ex- perience as have the residents of the metropolitan divisions. It seems a great wrong to inflict upon persons living in remote regions to demand that they shall have approximately the same quota as have the electors in the metropolitan areas. I propose to give a few figures to illustrate how this scheme will work out in the case of Victoria, which is one of the lesser States, territorially speaking. The total area of Victoria is 87,884 square miles. Under this scheme of distribution, the metropolitan divisions around Melbourne will embrace an area of only 340 square miles. Yet the residents of that area will have ten representatives in this Chamber, whilst the electors of 87,544 square miles will be entitled to only eleven representatives. I know it is sometimes urged that honourable members are supposed to represent people and not But, territory. But we must recollect that people are located on territory, and we must, therefore, consider the question of territory as well as the actual number of electors. The eleven members who will represent 87,544 square miles of country will experience greater difficulties in winning their seats, in getting into touch with the people, and in educating them in electoral matters, than will the representatives of metropolitan constituencies. The electors in that huge area will not have the same influence with their representatives as will the electors in metropolitan constituencies, where the people are in close touch with each other. We ought also to recollect the enormous difficulties which confront those candidates who desire to represent districts outside of the metropolitan areas. Consequently, any scheme of redistribution should place the voters in country electorates upon a par, as regards the quota, with the voters in more densely populated districts.",38
163,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member almost suggests an alteration of the Constitution.,40
164,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not think so. We have power to vary the quota in each division. There is no necessity for uniformity in the matter of the quota in town and countiy. That question is within the discretion of the Legislature, and is provided for in the Act,, which declares that the Commissioners shall have power to assign to any electoral division voters to the extent of either one-fifth above the quota or one-fifth below it. I know of no principle which ought to influence them in that connection, except that of the' territorial tribution of the people.",40
165,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"They are only empowered to exercise that discretion "" whenever necessary.""",40
166,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"-It seems to me that the necessity to exercise it can arise only in the case of a contrast being presented between town and country. In this scheme of redistribution, not only have the Commissioners failed to grant any concession to rural, electorates by assigning to them voters to the extent of one-fifth below the quota, but they have actually allotted to some electoral strength in excess of the quota. I will illustrate that. The quota is 34.648. Take die electoral district of Ballarat.",40
167,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not call Ballarat a country electorate?,40
168,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Certainl y it is. The city of Ballarat is simply the centre of a very large country district occupying a space of 50 or 60 miles across. The electoral district of Bendigo is similarly situated. Bendigo itself is the centre, but around it is a large rural population added on to Bendigo proper to make up the electoral district. To Ballarat has been assigned an electoral population of 36,011. So that Ballarat's electoral population is above the quota. Moreover, the electoral strength of Ballarat is greater than that of several metropolitan electorates. Its electoral population of 36,011 is greater than that of Balaclava, with 32,385; than Batman, with 35,829; than Bourke, with 34,423; than Caulfield, with 32,537; than Fawkner, with' 35,453 ; than Kooyong, with 34>335; and t n a n - Maribyrnong, with 34>oo5",40
169,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Every one of those constituencies is growing in population.,40
170,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It is not a matter of growth, but of dealing with existing populations. We are not here to indulge in predictions. Ballarat also is surrounded with a growing country population. So is Bendigo. There is certainly no decline of population in that district. To Bendigo has been assigned 34,957 electors. That also is above the quota.",40
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,I think there are only two country electorates whose population is above the quota.,40
172,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The population of Corangamite is only thirty-six below the quota. The electoral population of Bendis- digo is not only, as I have said, above the quota, but is also above the electoral populations of Balaclava, Bourke, Caulfield,. Kooyong, and Maribyrnong. Take Corangamite. The electoral population assigned to that constituency is 34,612. That is very little below the quota; but even on that standard the electoral population islarger than those of Balaclava, Bourke, Caulfield, Kooyong, and Maribyrnong. There, at all events, are three cases of country constituencies to which have beenassigned electoral populations larger than, those of metropolitan constituencies. It, therefore, seems to me that the country districts of Victoria have not only not received' the consideration which they should have had, but that the Commissioners have not exercised the elastic powers given to themby the Electoral Act. In addition to that, an injustice has been done in that they have been placed at a disadvantage compared with a considerable number of metropolitan areas. I "" think that such anomaliesas these require to be explained. If the Commissioners had exercised their power, and had allowed a reduction of electoral populations of country electorates to the extent of one-fifth below the quota, they need not have sacrificed one of these Victorian country seats. They could have allowed one of them to remain, and could have permitted the loss to be suffered by the metropolitan areas around Melbourne.",40
173,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then we should have a larger number of electorates in the country with a smaller population than in the towns.,41
174,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It is unfair that the electoral strength of the metropolitan area should exceed that of the country districts.,41
175,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Not if a greater number of people are living in the metropolitan area.,41
176,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"We should consider, not only the people, but their distribution. We represent, not merely numbers of people, but people differently situated; and the Minister must admit, as a Democrat, that people living in scattered districts have not the same facilities for attending to political affairs as have people who live around Melbourne. Apart altogether from the trouble and burden imposed upon people living in scattered districts in the matter of going to vote, we have also to consider the convenience of the representatives of the people; and it is quite unfair to compare the position of eleven members representing an area of 87,000 square miles with the position of ten members representing people located in 340 square miles.  than the whole area of Victoria.",41
177,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That instance represents the injustice in an intensified form. The time has arrived when we ought to take into consideration whether there should not be placed upon the statute book itself some discriminating provision, some principle of classification of districts. If the Commissioners will not make an allowance for country districts, and give a better representation to them than is done at present, Parliament itself ought to step in and embody a mandate in the Electoral Act requiring Commissioners to discriminate in favour of country or rural representation.",41
178,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am afraid the honourable member knows that to be contrary to the spirit, if not to the actual letter, of the Constitution.",41
179,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There is nothing in the Constitution contrary to what I am advocating. Each State may be distributed according to the discretion of Parliament within certain limits. It is true that the quota provision is too rigid; if it were not for the rigidity of the constitutional provision, Victoria would not lose the member which she is now losing.",41
180,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Is there no possibility of increasing the number of the House of Representatives ?,41
181,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The number must be, as nearly as possible, twice the number of the members of the Senate. The Minister has furnished us with no explanation of this scheme. He has made no statement about it. He is simply leaving honourable members to grope their way through without his aid. I hope that this point as to the difference Between country and metropolitan representation will be taken into consideration by honourable members on both sides of the House. Every one is interested in it. It is not a question that interests Victorians alone. The representatives of country districts all over Australia are concerned. It is a great shame that there should be country divisions containing a larger number of electors than some of the divisions of Melbourne. This is an injustice and an anomaly, and I ask honourable members to assist us to remove it.",41
182,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [3.16] - I intend to raise what I consider a rather important point, and to do so I shall read first an extract from the Commonwealth Electoral Act, sections 19 and 20The Commissioners shall forthwith, after the expiration of the thirty days above mentioned, forward to the Minister their report upon the distribution of the State into Divisions, and the number of electors residing in each proposed Division, as nearly as can be ascertained, .together with a map signed by them showing the boundaries of each proposed Division. The report and map shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within seven days after its receipt if the Parliament is in session, and if not, then within seven days after the commencement of the next session. I contend that the maps for the distribution under discussion have not been laid before Parliament. I cannot find in the Acts Interpretation Act an exact definition of Parliament. Section 21, subsection b, of that Act saysReferences to localities, jurisdictions, and other matters and things shall be construed as references to such localities, jurisdictions, and other matters and things in and of the' Commonwealth. Parliament is referred to in section 17, subsection e, as meaning "" The Parliament of the Commonwealth."" I assert that the provision in the Electoral Act requiring that the maps shall be laid before Parliament means that the maps shall be laid upon the table of this House, Parliament being the place where members assemble for their deliberations. To expose the maps in the lobbies is not to lay them before Parliament.",41
183,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The maps now in the lobbies were laid before Parliament in the ordinary way; that is, they were brought into this chamber, and laid on the table in the way papers are laid on the table, and were afterwards displayed in the lobbies.",42
184,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Do the records show that?,42
185,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Yes .,42
186,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I was present when the Minister of Home Affairs laid on the table the report on the distribution of the State of Queensland, and no map accompanied it. No map illustrating that report has yet been laid on the table. During a discussion like the present, maps showing the alterations proposed should be hung on the walls of the chamber, as was done when we were debating the Northern Territory agreement, and the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. I contend that the maps have not been laid before Parliament as required by the Electoral Act, and that the present proceedings are therefore irregular.",42
187,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.20] There is a great deal of force in the argument of the honourable member for Bendigo against the basis .of this distribution. The Commissioners have done their work conscientiously, but they have acted too much by rule of thumb. They have preserved, as far as possible, the boun-, daries of existing divisions, and, as far as possible, have allotted an equal number of electors to each division, but they have ignored other important instructions of the law. When our Electoral Bill was before the House, the disposition at first was to insist upon the strict equality of divisions in the matter of numbers, but as the discussion proceeded, and reference was made to the disparity of country and metropolitan electorates under the old State system, it began to be recognised that it would be fair and right to allow the Commissioners for distribution some discretion in allotting electors to city and country constituents. This discretion was given to them so that they might give expression to the spirit of the law in regard to territory as well as in regard to equality in numbers. The Act instructs the Commissioners to have regard to community and diversity of interests, means of communication, physical features, and the preservation of existing electoral boundaries, so far as that is possible, but in this instance the physical features of the country seem to have been left out of account. A constituency like Gippsland, which is difficult to travel through, many parts of it being almost inaccessible, is at a disadvantage compared with a city constituency, or a country constituency where the means of communication are ample, and it is within the discretion of Commissioners to have regard to a matter like this. In the present instance, however, it would seem that the distribution has been arrived at almost wholly by arithmetical calculation. Physical differences and disabilities have been ignored. As a country member, I know something of the difficulties that must be met in representing a country constituency, and my division is much easier to travel through than that of the honourable member for Gippsland. The discretion given to the Commissioners was to be used to draw a line of distinction between country and metropolitan electorates.",42
188,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Parliamen t expressly sanctioned such a distinction.,42
189,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes . The Act provided for flexibility in the allotment of numbers for that purpose. In that debate member after member referred to the necessity of discriminating between country and city constituencies, and finally, at the instance of the late Mr MCLean, who represented Gippsland, and understood the conditions of that difficult constituency, it was provided that the Commissioners, who were supposed to be independent arbiters in these matters, should if they thought fit have the power to discriminate in respect of numbers between town and country constituencies. That provision was inserted in the Bill, not as an ornament, but to be made use of ; and the Commissioners when appointed were supposed to be men competent, to realise the differences between different constituencies, to vary the numbers of electors in them, and to arrange the boundaries according to community of interests, and with due regard to the physical features of the country. I hold that in the scheme now before us something better could have been done as regards community of interests, and that sufficient consideration has not been given to the physical features of the country. In the western portion of Victoria, for instance, a very large proportion of purely wheat growing country has been associated with a district in the south where the physical features, the character of agriculture, and the climatic conditions are altogether different. In the eastern part of Victoria, boundary lines are run practically through the middle of mountain chains. In fact, the question of physical features, and the necessity of discriminating between constituencies in regard to numbers, as between metropolitan and country areas, have been altogether ignored by the Commissioners. I believe they took the matter in hand to the best of their ability, and endeavoured to put forward a scheme that would be acceptable to the House; but, probably, they made the allocation within their own offices, without travelling over the different districts, calculating the numbers, and making their divisions as nearly as possible according to the boundaries of State electorates or municipalities. If they had travelled throughout Victoria and observed the difficulties with which members have to contend in dealing with their constituents, they would have had a greater appreciation of the difficulties of country districts, and the need for differentiating between country and metropolitan areas.",42
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Surveyor General ought to know all that.,43
191,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"He should; but even men with a knowledge of country districts would benefit by travelling throughout the State which they are asked to subdivide for electoral purposes. One of the curses under which Victoria is suffering is centralization, and quite recently a strong movement has begun in country centres to bring about decentralization. Over 40 per cent, of the population of Victoria is within the metropolitan area, and there is no doubt that the greater attractions of the city are constantly drawing people from the country districts. This scheme of re-distribulion will, I contend, have the effect of intensifying that centralization which we believe is in the worse interests of Victoria. Greater community of interests could have been secured in country districts if the scheme had been based on an entirely different method. Some large country areas have been included in electorates that are almost on the borders of Melbourne. There is no community of interests between the country and city parts of those constituencies. Of the eleven country constituencies, four are over the quota, while of the ten city constituencies, five are over the quola; so that in this scheme of re-distribution, we have an almost equal representation of voting value in country and metropolitan seats.",43
192,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that 'is bad ?,43
193,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It is more difficult to represent 50,000 people in the country than rbo,ooo people in the city. A member representing a city constituency can probably hold all the meetings he requires for an election campaign in a week, and if there is any matter of dominating interest concerning his electors, they can be quickly organized, and the question brought before Parliament in a day or two. This would be absolutely impossible in a country constituency. When the Electoral Bill was first introduced, it was generally understood that, as the Constitution provided that each vote, whether town or country, should have the same value, and that the larger Federal constituencies would reflect a more national view than would the old State constituencies, - the whole scheme should be on a population basis. After that had been discussed at great length, and the pressure of public opinion had been brought to bear on the House by country representatives from all parts of Australia, it was decided that it would be fair and equitable to allow country constituencies to have a smaller number of electors than town constituencies. This had been the practice in all the States of the Commonwealth, and particularly in New South Wales. In fact, I think it was the pressure of the New South Wales members that chiefly influenced the House to make the amendment.",43
194,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Was there any debate on that?,43
195,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"There was a debate on the clause when the Bill was before the House. The honourable member for Grey took part in the debate, and will recollect what happened. During the debate in Committee on the Electoral Bill of 1902 the difficulties of country constituencies were pointed out by several honourable members, and an amendment was moved by Mr. Allan MCLean, who then represented Gippsland, in favour of giving the Commissioners the power to discriminate on either side to the extent of one-fourth of the quota. After further debate, partly at the instance of Mr Watson, then Leader of the Labour party, it was decided that the discretionary power of the Commissioners should be reduced to the right to vary the numbers either one way or die other to the extent of one-fifth of the quota. The present Leader of the Opposition, who was in charge of the Bill , in suggesting a compromise, said, as reported in Hansard, vol. x i . , p . 13,9541 have carefully followed the debate in light of the additional information which I have been able to obtain from the electoral officer. That information shows that under the New South Wales law a considerable latispecific principles. tude is allowed to the Commissioners. The exercise of that latitude to such an extent been approved by Parliament, so that in looking at the list of constituencies, and the ber of electors which they contain, I find in the remoter country districts 9,000 voters have returned a Federal member, whilst more popu ous districts, such as Newcastle, consist of 15,000 electors. One electorate Sydney contained 16,000 voters. show that uncler the New South Wales Act margin allowed to the Commissioners has been employed under language closely resembling that which is employed in this Bill. experience in regard to this matter, as able members are aware, is derived from South Wales, and the clauses in this Bill are stituencies. supposed to be modelled upon the law in State. But owing to their division, and the complaint to make. manner in which they are put, it is possible that tliere may be a difference in interpretation. As a compromise, I suggest that we should convert these two clauses into one, so as to would be largely interfered with. approach more closely the exact language ployed in the New South Wales Act. language of that Act is"" In making any such distribution due consideration shall be given to the then existing boundaries of electoral districts, the community or diversity of interests, lines of communicacharacter tion and physical features, and the Commisadded, sioners in assigning any such electoral districts shall be entitled to adopt a margin of ance to be used wherever necessary by way constituency. of addition to or deduction from the number of persons enrolled in such district."" I suggest to the Committee that as we are adopting the New South Wales model we should adhere to it still more closely. I think that we might make the clause read as foUows :The Commissioner in making any distribution of States into divisions shall give due consideration to(al Community Or diversity of interests; (4) Means of communication; \c) Physical features; (rf) Existing boundaries of divisions. And subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the Commissioner may adopt a margin of allowance to be used whenever necessary; but in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fourth more or one-fourth less. Mr Sampson. Then Mr MCLean interjectedThat does not go as far as I wish, but I am willing to accept it as a compromise. He accordingly withdrew his amendment, in which it was proposed that a margin of allowance to the extent of one-fourth more or one-fourth less of the quota should be allowed, and a one-fifth margin was agreed to. It was impossible to instruct the Commissioners, if they were to have power to carry out their work in accordance with this provision, to make any arbitrary discrimithe nation between town and country constituencies ; but they were given definite directions by the Act itself to observe certain Why was it directed that discretionary power should be vested has in them if the Parliament did not realise, numwhen passing the principal Act, that it that was necessary that the difference between the means of communication and physical the features of town and country electorates in should be taken into consideration ? My These facts complaint is that in this case the Commisthe sioners have partly ignored the physical features of the country, the proper observance of which must have carried with it Our whole honora discrimination, as far as numbers were New concerned, between town and country conAs the representative of a that country constituency, I have no personal Situated as my constituency is, in the north-western corner of Victoria, it was hardly possible that it Under emthis scheme a piece has been taken off one The part of my electorate, and two other parts have been added. The piece excised from my electorate, and which has been added to the electorate of Wannon, is similar into the areas which have been so that I have no complaint to make allowrespecting the redistribution of my own  voters the same?",43
196,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes . In neither respect have I room for complaint. I am supposed, however, to represent a section of the important country interests, and, speaking in that capacity, I complain that this scheme of redistribution does not observe the direct instructions given under the Act to the Commissioners, nor does it comply with the spirit of the Act. It will also have the effect of seriously intensifying the evil of centralization now going on in Victoria to the detriment of the development of country interests. Although this may be. a National Parliament, it'cannot be oblivious to the importance of developingthe rural interests of the continent. We are the custodians of the cardinal interests of Australia,' sectionally as well corporately, and it is our duty, in carrying out a work of this character, to only that community of interest is preserved, but that encouragement is given as far as possible to the development of those diversified country interests without which we cannot regard ourselves as a progressive peopie. I ara sure that if such a scheme of redistribution as that now before us had been introduced in the State Parliament it would have been incontinently rejected. 1 presume that this almost equal representation of town and country has been adopted by the Commissioners largely because of the much greater growth of population in the metropolitan centres as compared with the country.",44
197,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It is a 'very serious business; three country constituencies in Victoria, and two in New South Wales, have been wiped out.",45
198,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It is a serious business; and all I am saying applies to New South Wales as well as to Victoria. The greater the area, the greater the injustice that will be done under this system. Possibly the Commissioners, in view of the larger growth of population in the cities, deemed it necessary to make the numbers as nearly equal as possible, in view of the greater disparity that would be shown if that growth continued for a year or two. But whatever influenced the Commissioners, this system of redistribution can only have the effect of intensifying the growth of the population in the cities. I hope that greater attention will be shown to country interests, in order that' the population may be encouraged to increase more rapidly than in the past. In my own constituency, during the last two years, the number of electors has increased 4,000 or 5,000 above the quota; and in the electorate of Echuca, where there are schemes of irrigation and subdivision for closer settlement, I believe the increase will be greater than generally anticipated. I hope the Commissioners are mistaken if they anticipate that the relatively higher increase of population in the cities will continue during the next few years.",45
199,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The Commissioners are not entitled to anticipate ; they have to be guided by the existing rolls.,45
200,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"T t is possible that they may have had such an anticipation, and that they took it into consideration. It is certainly very disappointing to country representatives to find that, in spite of as the endeavours made in the building of railways nt the different parts, and in the see, not establishment of freezing works",45
201,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,T think the honourable member is going beyond the question before the House.,45
202,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I merely wish, by way of illustration, to show the disappointment that is felt in this State that, in sp:te of the efforts that publiespir'.ted country residents are making to stem the tide of centralization, they find that a system which aids its flow is to he intensified. I am sorry that it is necessary, after the Commissioners have done their best, no doubt, to have to protest against this reduction in the representation. From the point of view of distances, and in every other respect, it is undoubtedly much more difficult to represent a country constituency than it is to represent a city constituency with twice the number of electors. The State is divided into constituencies with the express idea of having the varied interests, as well as the men and women, of the community represented in this Parliament; and the present scheme of redistribution quite loses sight of that fact. I regret that the main principles on which the redistribution is supposed to have been founded have been largely set asidethat the express instructions laid down in the Act for the guidance ot the Commissioners have been ignored, and the redistribution made a mere question of addition and subdivision. Debate (on motion by Mr Fenton) adjourned. NA RIVER RAILWAY SURVEY BILL. Mr SPEAKER announced the receipt of a message from .the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",45
203,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.54] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The first business on Tuesday will be the further consideration of the electoral redistribution scheme for Victoria.,45
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is - it intended to proceed vvith the consideration of the redistribution schemes until they have been disposed of?,46
205,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I understand that that is the intention of the Prime Minister. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.55 p.m.,46
