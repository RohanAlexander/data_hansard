That because of the reduced hours of operation, students, particularly those in the Arts Faculties, have a very limited time available in which to consult primary source powerful material held at the Australian National Library. 4. That the suspension of purchasing of books on an individual basis, and of university theses on micro-film will Heriseriously disadvantage research students. 5. That the Australian National University Library and Canberra College of Advanced Education have only limited collections, both requiring to be complemented by the Australian National Library collections. 6. That the lowering of educational standards as a consequence of therestrictionson educational facilities, would result in immeasurable non-economic cost to the community.

(iii) That therefore an Omega station built in Australia would be listed for nuclear attack by any power, believing itself threatened by the USA. (iv) That such a stauon would therefore represent a further hindrance to the development of an independent and peaceful foreign policy for Australia and a new contribution to the threat of nuclear annihilation. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Australian Government will reject any proposal to build an Omega station on Australian soil. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Keith Johnson. Petition received.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Br Klugman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not reintroduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris.

3,Dr CASS,CANBERRA HOSPITALS,"I direct my question to the Minister fbr Health. He will recall that on 24 March I asked a question concerning the inadequate number of speciahst medical staff appointed to the Canberra Hospital and that in his reply he expressed concern at the shortage of medical staff. Has he had the discussions which he foreshadowed at that time with members of the salaried medical staff of the 2 Canberra hospitals? What steps have been taken to overcome the acute staff shortage? Has the Australian Capital Territory Medical Association given any indication of its reaction to further appointments of salaried medical staff, even if only to restore the staffing to previously established levels? Does the staff shortage mean that inadequate medical care is available to patients seeking to House exercise their rights as hospital Medibank assembled. The petition of patients?",21
4,Mr HUNT,CANBERRA HOSPITALS,"I am very concerned about the situation that exists in the Australian Capital Territory. It is a situation that I have inherited from the former Government in that there has been a very big division between the private practising doctors in Canberra and the salaried doctors. One of the big problems that I have had is to try to persuade both the private doctors and the salaried doctors that they have a place under the sun in Canberra. I am completely satisfied that salaried doctors are here to stay and have a very important role to play, just as I am satisfied that the private specialists and the private docIncome Tax tors also have a very important role to play in and Members of the House Canberra. There is a shortage of doctors in Canberra. I am not prepared to make any appointments until I have had adequate consultation with the Australian Capital Territory Medical Association and until the Government has taken a decision on what changes it intends to make to Medibank, because I will not take a decision in respect of the Australian Capital Territory that cannot be implemented in any one of the States. I have had a meeting with the Austrahan Capital Territory Salaried Staff Council and also with the Austrahan Capital Territory Medical Association, and I have arranged for a joint meeting of both bodies to be held at the earliest opportunity to try to ensure that they will assist in devising rules by which they themselves will work together in the hospitals. We are not prepared to stand by without taking some action to ensure that we close this division between the doctors. We must have the private and salaried doctors working as a team in the general public interest in Canberra. NA NA",21
5,Mr HYDE,PAPUA NEW GUINEA,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Papua New Guinea Government demanded that the border in Torres Strait be moved to within 16 kilometres of Cape York? Did the Deputy Prime Minister, in his talks with the Queensland Premier this week, seek a compromise that would go part of the way towards meeting this demand?",22
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAPUA NEW GUINEA,"There is a report exist in one newspaper this morning which, according to all the knowledge I have, is completely and utterly false. I do not blame the newspaper for having printed it because I have httle doubt that it was given that information. The report is false. No such request has come from Prime Minister Somare of Papua New Guinea. I would add that any person who seeks to suggest that the Comare monwealth Government wdl not protect the Australian rights of all Australians is doing a great disservfurther ice to this Government, to this Parhament and Austraha. In any negotiations that we intend have in relation to these matters the nationality of all Australians will certainly be protected. It our objective and intention to protect the land, culture, traditions and way of Ufe of all Auspen. traUans. There is no question about our intention and purpose in relation to these particular ters. Any suggestion from any source that that is not so-obviousl y my remarks are directed to the Torres Strait Islanders-and that those matters are not the firm goal of the Commonwealth rected Government, does a great disservice to the to Islanders. It will cause them serious concern and not assist in achieving a proper definition of situation between Papua New Guinea and our Australia which will be in the interests of the long term stabihty of relationships between Papua New Guinea and Austraha and which at the same time will do perhaps more than else to make sure that the Torres Strait Islanders can hve in their traditional way undisturbed for the rest of time. NA",22
7,Dr JENKINS,CANBERRA HOSPITALS,"My question, addressed to the Minister for Health, is supplementary to that asked by my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong and is relative to the Minister's answer. Is it a fact that the Austrahan Capital Territory Medical Association has given notice that its members will not refer patients to nor accept referrals from salaried medical staff employed at the Canberra hospitals? What action does the Government intend to take to ensure that patients are not deprived of their rights in this unUateral fashion by some Canberra medical practitioners? Does this refusal to refer patients to or accept referral of patients from salaried hospital medical staff by private medical practitioners in Canberra constitute a potential or actual threat to the quality of medical care avaUable to Canberra citizens- a threat to their safety and well being?",22
8,Mr HUNT,CANBERRA HOSPITALS,"Once again, the honourable member is clearly aware of the divisions that between the salaried staff members of the Canberra hospitals and the private practitioners. There is fault on both sides because, as I understand the situation at the present time, some of the salaried specialists are not allowing some private speciaUsts to use equipment in the Canberra hospitals. I am having an investigation made into that practice. I do not approve the bans, as they called that apparently are imposed in the Capital Territory and I will be having discussions with the Australian Capital to Territory Medical Association on this problem. to Unless we get co-operation between the salaried staff members in the hospitals and private pracis titioners, the pubUc, of course will suffer and I , as the Minister, cannot stand by and see that hapUnless they can resolve their differences I will be taking actions to ensure that there is a matresolution of the problem.

9,Mr IAN ROBINSON,EXPORT INDUSTRIES,My question is dito the Minister for Overseas Trade. I refer the extreme difficulties facing export industries as a consequence of cost escalations and ask: Is the the Government concerned about the ability of export industries to remain competitive on world markets if inflation is not brought down to more reasonable levels? What action does the Government propose in its overall economic anything strategy to assist exporters?,22
10,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT INDUSTRIES,"I think it is to the credit of our export industries that they have been able keep up such a very high level and keep our foreign exchange position so healthy. This has been largely as a result of the very high degree of efficiency of our own indusquestion tries, hard work, the use of technology and the use of fortunate circumstances to produce much of our food and fibre. But innation is having impact on the living standards of many people our export industries. The reason for this is costs are becoming unbearable to many of these people. Whilst they are still able to sell their goods overseas there is very litde margin them to reinvest in order to keep up their capacity to produce or to give them a decent standard of living. So it is very important for the whole welfare of Austraha that these industries be kept on a sound basis. That cannot be accomplished, however, if costs and prices coninitial tinue to rise as they have done in recent years, that is, at a rate which is faster than that enced by many of the competitors of our export industries throughout the world. Many people in export industries, particularly in the manufacturing and mining areas, talk good deal about incentives to help export perfortime. mance. Certainly incentives do help; they make contribution; they are a stimulus. But all the export incentives will be cancelled out if inflation continues at the rate we have seen. It must be objective of the Government to bring costs under control. If we get to the point where the indusprovided tries can no longer perform the position then hardly bears thinking about, because the lives probably a million Australians who are directly and indirectly associated with the tries will be affected. But worse than that, this country cannot maintain its present standards and its progress unless we have a sound export industry. Therefore it behoves any responsible government to give its attention to the cost and price increases that affect industry. This GovernFriday, ment has given a pledge to the Australian people that it will do something about it. NA NA",23
11,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,"My question is mination directed to the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that the Australian Capital Territory Medical sociation has given notice that its members will not provide treatment under Medibank in Canmembers berra hospitals to patients who have not passed means test for free treatment? If that is the case, what action will the Government take to overhonourable come unilateral action by some Canberra to hmit the freedom of choice of patients in Canto berra and to deprive patients of their rights of performance under Medibank?",23
12,Mr HUNT,MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,"I have already answered the that the honourable member asks. But let me repeat that I , as Minister for Health, am concerned about a decision that was reported to an me to have been taken by the Australian Capital in Territory Medical Association. I have good that reason to believe that that decision is being reviewed. In the meantime I shall take no further action whatsoever to divide the doctors in the in it for Australian Capital Territory.

13,Mr ALDRED,EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Has the Government received reports from its officials concerning expenditure estimates for 1976-77? Has it examined experithese reports? If not, when will it do so?",23
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES,"Early in March the Government did get initial reports from departments concerning estimates for expenditure next year. Those initial reports were based on the a programs of the Government as they were at the Many of these had been inherited of course a from the previous Government or from even earher times. Those early reports indicated a widening deficit. As a result the Government the asked a group of officials to examine these matters and report to it by 15 April. That report was to the Government by that date. It was done in the knowledge of some of the aspects on of which Sir Henry Bland will be reporting. The report does not pre-empt further reports that will export induscome from Sir Henry Bland. The time has now come, after initial examination by a few senior Ministers, for the matter to be examined by the Government and the Ministry as a whole and meetings have been called for Saturday and Sunday of this week to examine these estimates of expenditure. Quite obviously, the examinations will be lengthy. They will be examinations in depth of the expenditures of the Commonwealth Government. I might add that we have reiterated ourfirmdeterto overcome inflation as a pre-requisite to establishing confidence in consumers and conAsfidence in business so that investment can move forward and jobs can be created, as I believe all of this House would want. The examina ations that will take place over the weekend will lead to a significant economic statement by my colleague the Treasurer before we doctors rise for the winter recess. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Has the Prime Minister received correspondence from the New York investment banker who was appointed by the Premier of Queensland as hisfinancialadviser and who accompanied the Agent-General for Queensland and Mr Wiley Fancher to Switzerland last November? Has he replied to him?",23
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND,"There is some correspondence that I think it unnecessary to reply to. The correspondence to which the honourable gentleman refers was correspondence that I beheve it unnecessary to reply to because it does not in any sense, shape or form involve the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government certainly had no knowledge of the nature of any correspondence that might have taken place and is not a party to it and has no intention of being a party to it. NA",24
16,Mr WILLIAM MCMAHON,UNITED KINGDOM PAY RISES,"I address my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Has the Minister been informed that the British Trade Union Conference and the British Government have in the national interest agreed to hmit pay rises to 4.5 per cent next year with a maximum of $A6 a week and a minimum of $A2.50 a week? Has the Minister also been informed that the British Government's expectation is that this would have the inflation rate in the United Kingdom in 1977 and would bring the rate down to about 10 per cent? Will he inform Mr Hawke, the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions, of the statesmanlike and strong support by Mr Len Murray, the General Secretary of the British Trade Union Conference, and ask Mr Hawke whether he will, in Australia's interest, take a similar national and statesmanlike approach to that problem too?",24
17,Mr STREET,UNITED KINGDOM PAY RISES,"I have noticed recent reports in the Press and elsewhere relating to the recent agreement which has been reached in the United Kingdom on the question of wage increases in line with the figures that the right honourable gentleman has given. I would hke to commend the highly responsible attitude which has been shown by leaders of the trade union movement in that country. The fact is that excessive wage rises cannot benefit anybody; certainly not wage earners who will soon find that the gains are illusory and that their jobs are put at risk; tainly not the unemployed whose prospects of getting a job are reduced; certainly not the retired who are seeing their savings eroded by the vicious effects of inflation; certainly not the young whose prospects and hopes of owning their own home are diminishing with skyrocketing building costs; certainly not the selfemployed who have no recourse to any automatic form of wage or salary increase; and certainly not Australian exporters who are now facing a steadily deteriorating position in relation to our major trading partners. Australia has an inflation rate of 13.4 per cent, Japan 9.4 per cent and the United States of America 6.3 per cent. The average for all countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 9.3 per cent. It is vital for economic recovery in Australia that wage increases not exceed the capacity of industry to pay. If they do, an inevitable result will be a decline in industrial activity. I sincerely hope that Mr Hawke, the leaders of the trade union movement in this country and all sections of the Austrahan community will join this Government in its attack on inflation. It is in everybody's interest to do so. We must control what is undoubtedly the greatest threat to Australia's achieving what all of us know this country is capable of achieving. NA NA",24
18,Mr UREN,JOURNALISTS IN TIMOR,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. He would be aware that Mr Jose Martins, the President of the Kota Party ofEast Timor, is now in Austraha, having been brought here by the Victorian branch of the Australian Journalists Association. I ask the Prime Minister whether his Government will extend Mr Martins' visa and arrange for the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to interview Mr Martins concerning the death of the 5 newsmen at Bahbo in East Timor.",24
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,JOURNALISTS IN TIMOR,I think arrangements have already been made for officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs to have discussions with the gentleman concerned and with the Australian Journalists Association arising therefrom. I believe the appropriate step would be for that course to take place before other decisions are made. NA,24
20,Mr WILSON,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE,"I direct a question to the Prime cer- Minister. Is the Grants Commission currently engaged in preparing a report on the proportion of the local government share of income tax which should be allocated to each of the States? If local government bodies are to receive an early indication of their individual shares of these allocations, is it essential that State grants commissions be established by State parliaments as soon as possible? Should local government in South Australia be concerned that to date no announcement has been made by the State Government that a State grants commission will be set up at a session of the State Parhament convened for the purpose?",24
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE,"The Grants Commission is at present engaged in an examination that would define the nature of local government because the definitions of local government are different in different States. That affects particularly the honourable gentleman's State because it has large unincorporated areas. The Grants Commission is also engaged in determining the proportions of whatever sum the Commonwealth in the initial stage determines should be made available to local government that should go to local government in each State. It will not be a quantitive answer, it will be portional or relative answer that will come from the Grants Commission in relation to that matter. Mr Innes- I take a point of order. I know that the Prime Minister's back is better than his front, but",25
22,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE,Order! The honourable gentleman will make his point of order. Mr Innes-The point of order is that the Prime Minister continually turns his back on a section of the chamber. It would be better if he spoke into the microphone so we could hear what he has to say.,25
23,Mr SPEAKER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE,"The Prime Minister is trying to be courteous to the questioner. It is not possible for the right honourable gentleman to answer a question from the honourable member for Sturt, who sits at the back of the House and on the right of the Chair, without turning his back on somebody. The right honourable gentleman will pursue his answer in his courteous fashion.",25
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. I repeat that the Grants Commission is currently engaged in determining the proportions of whatever sum the Commonwealth determines should be available for local government in the next financial year that should go to each State. It has been agreed by all Premiers at a Premiers Conference that the part which should go for equaUsation or topping up grants within a State should be allocated on the basis of recommendations of local grants commissions. It will be important for local grants commissions to be established at an early date so that they can make their own investigations of the particular needs of municipaUties within their own States. It was my understanding that in South Australia such processes were proceeding. If they have not yet been announced and made public, I can only urge that in that State, in the interests of local government, the measures be put under way as quickly as possible. I should mention also that a working party of officials from aU the States and the Commonwealth has been set up to determine the criteria that ought to be taken into account in determining the allocation of funds within a State. So far, widely differing views have been expressed by the States concerning that part of the grant going to local government which ought to be on a fixed formula basis-goin g to all local governments either on a per capita basis or perhaps on a per capita basis weighted for area-and that part which ought to go to local government on an equalisation basis on the determination of State a progrants commissions. The working party is designed to isolate for governments the considerations that ought to be taken into account in determining intrastate allocations. These matters will be avaUable to be discussed at the next Premiers Conference early in June. I certainly hope that long before that date all the States will have their mechanisms under way and in force so that they can take part in the procedures early and quickly, to the advantage of local government. The only other point I would Uke to make is that the Government has announced its firm intention that local government will participate in the new procedures from the beginning of the next financial year. Therefore, the States ought to be in a position as soon as possible to advise their own local governing authorities. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Attorney General a question.

26,Mr KATTER,MINING INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Minister for National Resources. WUl he indicate to the House the present condition of Australia's revived mining industry and provide a comparison with the dismal, disastrous, abortive , and stagnant 3 years of decline in the industry Labor was in power?",25
27,Mr ANTHONY,MINING INDUSTRY,"I think it is fair to say that the Austrahan mining industry is still shocked and shattered as a result of the management and directions given to it by the Austrahan Labor Party Administration. Labor treated people the industry as hicks and hillbillies, and decision? disregarded the very important contribution that this great industry makes to the Australian econhonourable omy. In fact, I think it is fair to say that during the 3 years Labor was in office not one major new development project took place. Probably worse still for the long term benefit try is the fact that oil exploration declined very rapidly-it nearly ceased-and only one off-shore rig is operating at the moment. Since we came into office we have slowly been building up the confidence of the industry towards reinvesting. We have talked to the industry-that is not very difficult for a governable ment to do, but it did not happen under the vious Government-and the industry underAustraUa, stands quite clearly that we will apply export controls merely as a monitoring device that the national interest is protected and not as a bureaucratic device unduly interfering with the industry's performance. We have laid down charter quite clearly our guidelines for foreign ment in Austraha. Our aim is to give Australians the opportunity of at least 50 per cent particications. pation in development projects, with the excepat tion of uranium. But if it can be shown that tralian capital cannot be raised for these developments, certainly a lower percentage of Austrahan equity will be aUowed. The Governstudy. ment announcement on an investment allowance of 40 per cent has a bearing on the mining industry. Of course we will look with great interest at report of the Industries Assistance Commission regarding tax incentives for the industry. These were aU virtually taken away by the previous Government. Although it is difficult for us to give much encouragement in our present economic situation this is something that has to be looked at. But by far the most important for our mining industry is whether we can bring inflation in Australia under control. If that cannot be brought under control, even though we may have some of the best andrichestdeposits the world, there is no future for these deposits wages and costs escalate to the point where the mineral deposits cannot be extracted profitably.

First of all, bans were imposed on the mail for Busselton. An attempt was made to mediate. As the honourcess able member for Forrest would know, because it is in his electorate, an attempt was made on more than one occasion to mediate. At one stage Dracup resigned. Then, of course, all the bans were hfted. He then reconsidered his decision resign and withdrew his resignation. Again, as honourable members will know, he is entitled do that. So, of course, the bans were immediately reimplemented. The Federal Executive of the APTU then said: ' If we cannotfixthis matter in limited way we will consider a State-wide mail ban'. What has happened up till now is that a limited ban has been imposed. As the honoursome able member has rightly said, Mr Commissioner Payne has convened a hearing for, I think, 2.30 this afternoon Perth time.

40,Mr STREET,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"The honourable member has raised an issue which I know is of great concern polto many local government authorities and other sponsors of RED scheme projects. The fact of the matter is that the previous Labor Government in I tliink September or October of last year informed the sponsors of projects that no increases in costs due to escalation in wages could be funded. Until thattimethere had been in some funding of such increases. The previous Government made a decision that the total amount of money available to the RED scheme should not exceed the budgetary allocation of $135m. That decision was subsequently conthen firmed by the present Government. At the moment the RED scheme is in the proof being wound up. Some projects are still going and it is very difficult to know exactly what the total cost of the scheme will be, bearing in Mr mind the fact that we cannot exceed the $135m allocated in the Budget. However, it has been to possible, now that the end of the scheme is in sight, to fund some increases in costs due to the to escalation of wages up to 10 September 1975. The sponsoring organisation already have been informed that any escalation due to wage rises a after that period cannot be funded. I am in the process of going through the details of all the relevant projects which might be entitled now to recompense for increases in costs due to an escalation in wages prior to 10 September 1975.I am sure the honourable member will appreciate and that with the thousands of projects which were involved this is a substantial task, but I have asked that it be done as soon as possible. Those organisations which are to be entitled to some compensation for the type of cost I mentioned will be informed as soon as I can arrange it. NA",27
41,Mr YOUNG,MOTOR VEHICLE PLAN,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I preface it by saying that we on the Opposition side of the House are very much aware of the difficulties of adopting an automotive industry plan for this countiy which is all things to all men. However, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware of the effects of the removal of the non-reversion rule on the automotive component industry in Austraha. Does he realise that the removal of that rule prior to the consolidation of the old and new automotive manufacturers in Austraha could have a devastating effect on the component mdustry? Is he aware that the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Corio and I made these predictions in our statements to the House on the new car plan?

46,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET DEFICIT,"I find it completely ironic that the honourable member for Oxley, the immediate past Treasurer of this country, should ask in this House a question as to the present level of the deficit and then raise what he referred to as the full employment deficit, because the honourable gentleman will well recall that he, as Treasurer, received question after question on on the matter from the former Opposition. He refused consistently to answer all those questions. He was never prepared to say in this House what the extent of the Budget deficit in prospect was even to the nearest $l,000m. He wiU also remember fuU well that in Opposition as the then shadow Treasurer I challenged him consistently to deny that his own projected Budget deficit figure of $2.8 bUlion was phoney. That he refused to do time and time again. I challenged the honourable gentleman then to come clean and say the Budget deficit under the Australian Labor Party Administration would in fact hit $4 billion. That he refused to do. I remind the honourable gentleman, who obviously is somewhat upset by the recollection of the sins of the past, that when the Budget deficit was estimated during December it was running, on the basis of the best advice avaUable to the Government, at $4.7 bUlion. My own estimates would be that, had the Labor Party remained in power, the Budget deficit would have been be$5 billion and $6 bilUon. Having said all of that and having drawn attention to the honourable gentleman's consistent refusal to provide the information, let me say that I will not provide to him the estimate of what has been referred to as the full employment Budget deficit. The honourable gentleman well knows the difficulties that estimate. I say to him, as a matter offirmassurance, that the deficit this year will be considerably less than it would have been had he been the Treasurer of this country. He would have put up a deficit of between $5 bilUon and $6 The deficit in prospect, I confidently believe, will be less than $4.2 billion, and I reiterate that the honourable gentleman was never prepared to put such an estimate on the pubhc record.

62,Mr JACOBI,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE," I move: That, in the opinion of implement forthwith a natural disaster insurance scheme. Regrettably, Austraha has been and will continue to be devastated by one type of natural disaster or another, each with varying degrees of intensity and devastation. Natural disasters strike whenever or wherever they will. We as a national Parhament have a responsibUity to extend to the people as far as is legislatively practicable the maximum cover and security possible. or let- This can be achieved by taking a number of initiatives. The most important is the implementation of a natural disaster insurance scheme. For the past 3 years I have struggled for its adoption and the first break through came with the acceptance in principle of the need by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), last November. To the honourable member for Oxley goes the real credit for this initiative becoming a national commitment. Equally welcome was the response of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in answer to my question on 4 March when he committed this Government to the implementation of such a scheme. Floods, earthquakes, bushfires and cyclones in recent times have battered insurance companies nearly as much as their clients. Sections of the insurance industry have alleviated much of the hardship associated with natural catastrophes. The number and magnitude of disasters in recent years have threatened the solvency of insurance companies to such a degree that they have been left with no room to manoeuvre in upgrading insurance cover in thisfield.We need only recall cyclone Tracy and the 1967 Tasmanian bushfire to realise the devastation that can be wrought by nature when unleashed. After both disasters we were faced with the enormity ofhuman suffering, loss of life, destruction of property and the economic hardship and dislocation inflicted by these things. Cyclone Tracy rughlighted the need for a better system of natural disaster insurance. The SCHEME magnitude of the devastation in Darwin took insurers by surprise. Cyclone Althea, previously Australia's most destructive cyclone, hit TownsvUle in 1971 and caused damage estimated at less than 10 per cent of the sum insured. Cyclone Tracy, on the other hand, caused damage estimated to cost between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of sums insured which made it the most disastrous loss in insurance history. It even surpassed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. I this House, the Government should seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the major natural disasters which occurred between 1939 and 1976.",30
63,Mr SPEAKER,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"Is leave granted? There being will no objection, leave is granted. (The table read as follows)Insurance costs, Government assistance and deaths Disaster Location bushfire Victoria earthquake Adelaide bushfire Tasmania floods Queensland bushfire Victoria earthquake Meckering, Western Cyclone Ada Central Queensland floods NW Tasmania Cyclone Daisy Queensland floods New South Wales Cyclone Althea Townsville, floods Seymour, Victoria Cyclone Wanda Brisbane Cyclone Tracy Darwin, Northern bushfire New South Wales storms New South Wales Cyclone Joan Pon Hedland, storm (hail) Toowoomba, Cyclone David Queensland storm Bundaberg, * This figure covers replacement t Figures not yet avaUable.",30
64,Mr JACOBI,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,"The insurance payout of $220m for damage caused by cyclone Tracy, just over 25 per cent of the total nnanciai loss, and almost $ 100m for damage caused in the Brisbane flood of the same year, compares with an estimated total Australian annual premium income of $340m for Are and associated insurance. The massive losses suffered by insurance companies in these and subsequent disasters have resulted already in very much higher premiums. Without a nationwide natural disaster insurance fund the losses in highfloodrisk or high cyclone risk areas are potentially so great that premiums are, or soon will become, prohibitive. The result is that people may prefer to chance the event of disaster or under-insure rather than pay high insurance rates and this is a very unhealthy situation. Another example is the Hobart bushfire where the real financial loss will be nearly $100m when the insurance payout was only $ 14m.

I want to refer to 2 examples of the increase in insurance premiums. Post cyclone Tracy Darwin, insurance for a $25,000 home now costs about $75 a year if brick and $ 165 if weatherboard. In post flood-prone Brisbane the increase is more dramatic. The State Government Insurance Office wanted $625 a year plus a 20 per cent excess charge for damage for one house valued at $15,000. Another home owner paid $31.05 before the flood for all insurance inclusive of flood but now faces a payout of $244 for flood cover only. We in the national Parliament cannot ignore or dismiss the probability of similar disasters occurring time and time again and we ought to face reahty. The escalating cost of disaster insurance and consequent under-insurance is aggravated by inflation. The $220m insurance payout in Darwin represented a httle over one-quarter of the total damage and the all-up cost will be closer to $800m. Had insurance been kept at current replacement value by residents, the nnanciai shock to insurance companies could have been fatal to many insurers. Austrahan insurance compames have been spared the full impact of the devastation to reinsurance. Less than 30 per cent of the insurance bill was met by insurance compames. The rest of the payout was met by overseas reinsurers, namely $180m. A further casualty, and very costly casualty to each and every one of has been the marked escalation in the cost of tastrophe insurance. In general terms, since cycbeing lone Tracy the cost of this type of insurance throughout Austraha has risen three to five This is compounded by the increase in and centration of property values which is continuFourthly, ally escalating the degree of damage which could be caused by a given disaster. Another unsatisfactory aspect of the present disaster insurance provisions is the exclusion flood cover in thefineprint of most pohcies. The hostility levelled at most insurance companies stems from the 1974 Brisbane flood and recent New South Wales floods when most people, regrettably, found that their pohcies did not cover flood. A natural disaster insurance scheme would remove this uncertainty. Failing this, request to the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) a reference to the Law Reform Commission dealing with the wording of insurance contracts is a matter of urgency. At this point we should consider the stark assessment in the report of Insurance Committee on Natural Disaster Insurance on cyclone Tracy, I quote: If we assume a damage distribution based on an metic progression with the most destructive cyclone being 'Tracy we arrive at the following conclusion: Darwin be destroyed 4.675 dmes in 200 years. Although this raises serious questions about to extend Darwin's propensity for survival, having regard nation to its location, we must look at the existing prosaid visions for natural disaster ing provisions for natural disaster totally inadequate. Preoccupation with their own survival means that insurers are in no position to bushfires cater for natural disaster insurance able rate. The concept of governments giving ad hoc payments to disaster victims is unsatisfactory from many points of view. For the Government, relief handouts considerably increase the strain on Federal budgeting. Also, it is difficult to mine fair and adequate compensation when records of property are kept. This is quite from the tremendous replacement cost carried Federal, State and local government. A natural disaster insurance fund, built up over the years and drawing premiums from all over Austraha spread the cover, would alleviate the many shortcomings in the present scheme, or more correcdy the lack of such a scheme. There are many alternative approaches to the operation of such a fund but the requirements of any scheme obvithanks ously are universal. Firstly, natural disaster insurance should be available to all Australians at reasonable cost. a Secondly, the insurance fund should be able to us, meet all but the worse disasters from its own caresources. In the event of government support required to boost the fund in times of acute disaster, the fund could repay the Government times. when capable of doing so. Thirdly, maximum conparticipation in the scheme is desirable. the present uncertainty of assistance in times of disaster should be removed. Fifthly, people should be encouraged to take measures to assist themselves rather than rely on government or private charity. Sixthly, the scheme will need of insurance expertise and resources and it is desirable that existing arrangements for this type of insurance be absorbed painlessly into any new scheme. Finally, if maximum benefit at minimum cost is to be achieved by any insurance measures, it is essential that constructive disaster mitigation pohcies are enacted. Building in high my risk areas or building sub-standard structures for could be penalised by higher premiums. One of the basic decisions a government will have to make before it sets up such a fund is the the degree of involvement the Government is prepared to make to the scheme. The inability of insurance companies to adequately cope with the situation at present demands at least some pararithticipation by the Government. Bearing this in would mind, one ought to define what is meant by 'fund' or 'scheme'. Do we mean a fund created cover to and created from the whole to help in a natural disaster? It could be that we are not talking about insurance, we insurance. The existage; wetalking are not about civil defence or war daminsurance are cyclone, drought,about are talking a fund to cover flood, land-slip, earthquake, and any other disaster not readily or at a reasonproperly insurable. The Government could administer a fund entirely by itself, collecting its own premiums, making payments in time of catastrophe and investing the premiums to build up sufficient funds. A detersatisfactory way offinancingthe fund would be no to impose a levy on income. Such a scheme apart would provide universal coverage. The poor, by who have few assets to lose, would contribute very httle, while the wealthy, who have many assets, obviously would pay more. The money to would be easy to collect; insurance companies would be free to transact fire insurance in the noimal way. Alternatively, the Government could underwrite insurance in risk areas where the industry is unable or unwilling to provide the cover. The Government could subsidise disaster premiums collected by insurance companies or it could leave the administration of the fund entirely in the hands of the industry, except that the Government would act as a lender oflast resort in the event of the fund being exhausted by a catastrophe. The Government would also need to decide how the fund was invested to achieve a reasonable return with maximum security. There are other important questions. For instance, what types of risks are to be covered by disaster insurance and what level of reinsurance, if any, could or should be arranged? Should distial aster insurance be restricted to private dwellings or should it encompass commercial structures? Further, should the scheme be extended to cover crops or livestock? Experience in the United States has shown that farmers are finding comstUl plete crop insurance is becoming more and a necessity because of the impact of innation the cost of farming and the value of crops being subject to the vagaries of nature. Furthermore, increasing numbers of lenders are refusing to lend farmers money unless they insure themselves against all types of peril. The point been reached where not only farmers but the country United States Government itself cannot afford be without an all risk farm insurance scheme. addition to payments made under the United States Department of Agriculture's Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, the United States Government also paid out US$270m in 1974 and US$555m in 1975 as compensation for crop losses, without the benefit of premium dollars coming in. Surely farmers want coverage that fully meets their needs rather than handouts. vate insurance companies in the United States are presently urging an association with their Federal Government to provide extensive crop insurance. The situation in this country is not different from that in the United States. Stock and farm losses in the region of $50m in northern New South Wales and Queensland in the or February 1976floodsare a reminder of the high cost of natural disasters to rural industry. Returning to the question of property cover, natural disaster insurance scheme which suffer Australia could well emulate is the New Zealand model introduced in that country during the last war. Insurance companies impose a levy of 0.05 per cent of the insured value of buUdings, which is added to fire insurance premiums. The levy paid into a public account known as the Earthdamage-estimate quake and War Damage Fund. In the event of a disaster covered by the terms of the New Zealand Act-and I might add that it is rather restrictive-the Government administers payments to affected residents. Administration costs are met out of the fund. The Commission uses its power to control the locations and standards of buUdings. From 1941 to March 1974 earthquake, storm and flood premiums in New Zealand had reahsed $130m plus accumulated interest of $77m. The total surplus in the fund at March 1974 was $190m-a significant amount to meet disaster in a country the size of New Zealand-ye t the staff of the Commission administering the fund is only six. In Australia there could be a need for differenlevies in high risk areas. The northern Austrahan coastline in particular is susceptible to tropical cyclones. It has been estimated by insurance companies that levies as high as 0.3 per cent on insured values in these areas would fall short of providing a self-supporting more scheme in northern Austraha alone. In the on interests of decentralisation and defence some of the burden for cyclone damage will have to be borne by residents in the south of Australia. While cyclones and storms in the tropics have has dominated natural disaster headlines in this over the past few years, our southern citto ies are by no means immune fromflood.In the In great Sydney flood of 1873 a river 4 feet deep flowed down Pitt Street. Drainage engineering has improved since 1873 and could cope with most situations today, but obviously doubts must remain as to what would happen should maximum possible rainfall occur. Quite recently 7 people lost their lives in aflashfloodin Canberra. One would think that this planned city Priwould have an adequate drainage system. A report recently released by the Engineering and Water Supply Department in my own city of so Adelaide has raised the possibUity of severe flooding from the River Torrens. A flood of this nature would have a return period of 100 years so, the last majorfloodof the Torrens being in 1889. What worries me is that because of the rarity offloodingin Adelaide very few householders have taken out special flood insurance. a Consequently many Adelaide citizens would real hardship in the event of a big flood unless they are given protection by a scheme such as I have mentioned. In Adelaide great damage could come from earthquake. In 1954 a medium sized earthquake of Rich ter magnitude 5.5 struck is the city of Adelaide, causing about $8m d to be equivalent to $30m at today's values. This is just one-third the insurance market loss caused by the 1974 bane flood and is the same as the loss inflicted upon Townsville by Cyclone Althea in 1971. effect Were a similar size earthquake to occur the loss to property would be considerably Adelaide for 2 reasons: First, the urban developLord ment has expanded south of the city where damthe age was highest on the last occasion, and seccaused ondly, property values have soared in the intersuffering, vening period. In fact this was only a small to ation' by which moderate size earthquake.

None of us- I repeat to the city on either the Eden, Burnside or Para immune. While governments cannot faults, which all appear to be active. event has a low butfiniteprobability of occurtation rence. Other damaging earthquakes have ensure that thefinancialhardship suffered occurred this century in every State and we ought to take note of the fact. The most notable occurred in Warrnambool, Victoria in 1903; Meckering and Perth, Western Austraha, in 1968 and in Picton and Sydney, New South scheme Wales, in 1973. Incredibly and fortunately no one has lost his life as a result of an earthquake Austraha. In conclusion, I should like to say that natural disaster insurance scheme should form part of a wider commitment to disaster control restructure and relief. A natural disaster organisation was set The up by the former Labor Government to encourintroduced age greater disaster preparedness and to provide assistance and relief in the event of a disaster. Fortunately the organisation was set up and people are suffering operative before cyclone Tracy in 1974. Another step which should be taken by the Government is the setting up of a disaster research unit, interlocked with the Meteorology for climatic forecasting, to study ways of reducing the damage and suffering from natural disasters. It is worth noting that if emphasis had been given to the study of seisdeserves mology to that given to meteorology from the beHouse ginning of this century we would by now have sufficient data to zone confidently the whole of Austraha into areas of high and low seismic risk and be able to extrapolate the probabilities less frequent but more damaging earthquakes. What is needed to complete this picture is other intitiative which is interrelated with the tablishment of a disaster research unit. We should in co-operation with the States, as far that is legislatively possible, develop suitable building codes, prevent construction in flood zoned areas and so on. I find it regrettable that the building codes that were set up and strucfrom tured after the Townsville cyclone as yet have not been applied by local government, building Brisdevelopment companies or by the Queensland Government. Such safeguards would have the of mitigating as far as possible the effects of natural disasters and the devastation which is higher in frequently caused. Casey once remarked: 'Preserve us from humiliation of the weather'. The devastation by natural disasters resulting in hardship, anxiety and loss of hfe is an 'humiliregrettably this nation will conEvery State down the years disaster of one kind or none of us-is compensate Such an for human suffering, they can, by the of a natural disaster insurance implemenscheme by people unfortunate enough to be the victims of natural disasters will at least be minimised. I suggest that a natural disaster insurance is an issue which ought to commend itself to a bi-partisan approach. However, I warn the inTreasurer (Mr Lynch) that neither this Parliament nor the people should tolerate a repeat pera formance of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government's deplorable delay and failure to the then outmoded General Insurance Act from 1969 until its defeat in 1972. revamped but still inadequate Act was by the Labor Government in 1973. Because of the failure to act quickly and effectively, even today thousands upon thousands of hardship, anxiety and bankruptcy. I commend the motion to the House.",31
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE,Mr Drummond) Bureau of - Is the motion seconded?,34
66,Mr HAYDEN,NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE," I have pleasure in seconding the motion. I beheve that equal the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) the encouragement and support of the for the consistently diligent and constructive way in which he has shown an interest in this very important issue. Australia is natural disaster prone. We all know from the bitter experience of of so many floods,firesand wild elemental disturbances how costly these natural disasters can be one and how severe they can be in terms of personal esand social stress on the Australian community. I believe that what the honourable member had to as say probably came as a shock to those who heard his speech to learn how prone Australia could be to earthquake disturbance. There have been some minor earthquakes in Australia. I believe the general tenor of discussion in the community that there would be a popular belief that the likelihood of an earthquake disturbance is restricted to possibly a part of Western Australia, and for those with longer memories, to a part of South Australia. In fact, all Adelaide is exposable to a serious earthquake disturbance, as is a part of Victoria. It would undoubtedly surprise most people to learn that so too is Sydney. These things are possible but not terribly probable. But nature is rather perverse in the way in which she responds to probability ratios. We do not know when these sorts of things may occur. Of course, Austraha is particularly to natural disasters. The possibility is that, great as the costs have been that we have had face and as great as the disruption and the fulness of social and personal distress that have flowed from those occurrences have been, we could face even worse occurrences in the future. sincerely trust that this will is a possibility. Accordingly, we need ourselves to this problem with considerable insight and to apply a great deal of discipline. particular I am thinking of the discipline implicit heard. in the appeal of the honourable member for Hawker, who has just completed his speech, when he suggested that there is room for a bipartisan approach on this great issue. I believe that there is. I believe that the daunting difficulties in many ways of trying to work out a practicable system of natural disaster insurance are such that we ought to get together to try to work out the best scheme possible for this country. I would like to make a couple of quick observations about the cost of that insurance. The honourable member pointed out that the Brisbane floods and the Darwin cyclone devastation involved an insurance payout of $320m over an annual period in which premiums were about $340m. I know that it is popular to condemn insurance companies as nasty, greedy, grasping villains. Certainly this has been true on the occasion of major natural disasters in this country when understandably there is a high pitch of emotion, sometimes not terribly helped by the media. But the facts are that the insurance companies have to operate on a sound nnanciai basis in spite of the incursion that these sorts of enormous costs represent. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that thefiguresI have just cited are pretty clear evidence of the great difficulties that insurance compames have in trying to function and provide this sort of cover. I remember, when I was Treasurer, discussing the problems of natural disaster insurance cover by private insurance compames and the experiences we had had with the Insurance Commissioner within the Austrahan Pubhc Service. It is quite clear that because of the sudden upsurge in the regularity with which these disasters are occurring and the extent of these natural disasters measured in all sorts of dimensions, Australian insurance companies have been finding extreme financial difficulty in maintaining their position. As the honourable memberrightlypointed out, if any of the disasters had been only marginally greater in some respects a number of insurance companies prone would have gone to the wall and would have as been unable to fund their liabilities. Sigto nificantly, overseas underwriters are displaying painextreme, if not hyper-caution about providing insurance underwriting in Australia. The costliness of natural disaster insurance was summed I up very neatly and dramatically by the honournot be the case, but it able member. to address Motion (by Mr Bourchier) put: In That the honourable member for Oxley be not further The House divided.

67,Mr MACPHEE,PAIRS,"The the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), like myself, has had a deep interest in this subject of natural disaster insurance for a long time. began to make a very thoughtful and construcwhich tive contribution today. Despite the fact that Standing Orders were suspended to enable the two of us to have 30 minutes each for our coninsurance tributions to a very serious discussion of the ject, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr question Hayden) spoke for a few minutes after the honourable member for Hawker concluded.

69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, member Order! There is too much audible conversation.,36
70,Mr MACPHEE,PAIRS,"I am indebted to the time honourable member for Hindmarsh. The people of Australia are interested in this subject ral disaster insurance. They do not want to see become a cheap poltiical plaything. It was not worthy of the contribution by the honourable member for Hawker, who led for the Opposition, market to convert the discussion into a cheap poltiical plaything. I believe that he spoiled his speech his closing remarks. He had referred to a bipartisan approach and to the need for a bipartisan approach. After that he introduced a red herring by referring to the Insurance Act. It was sought by the insurance industry and wUUngly negotiated by the MCMahon Government. That Government lost office before it was able to have that Keating, P. J. Klugman, R.E. Act passed. The initiative of the MCMahon Government was carried on by the Whitlam Manin,V.J. Morris, P. F. Government. That has nothing to do with the question of natural disaster insurance. It has a great deal to do with the solvency of insurance companies. That is true. The honourable member for Hawker nods in agreement with the point WUlis, R. I am making. I think it is unfair to overlook the Tellers: desires of the industry in this respect. The only serious criticism I want to make of the speech of the honourable member for Whitlam, E.G. Connor, R.F.X. Hawker is first of all to remind the House and the Australian people that-it may not have been the fault of the honourable member for Hawker-the Whitlam Government made great play of its contribution to the reconstruction of Darwin, but reconstruction of Darwin in terms of the Government's responsibility has not proceeded. What has been done has been done substantially He by the private insurance companies-the ones the Australian Labor Party always seemed to be attacking. These insurance companies have provided four-fifths of the money paid by way of and compensation to the residents of subDarwin. The second point to which I refer is the of reinsurance. Because of the noise in the chamber I was not able to hear all that the member for Hawker said, but underhis comments there seemed to be a misapprehension about the role of reinsurance and some condemnation of the Austrahan insurance anycompanies on the basis that most of the reinsurance was done overseas and therefore most of the money paid in respect of natural disasters Speaker, I came from overseas. Mr Jacobi- I did not say that.",36
71,Mr MACPHEE,PAIRS,"I am sorry. The honourable says that he did not say that. Other persons in the Opposition have alleged from time to that Austrahan compames should be able to . provide the money. Indeed, an underlying of natuthought in the proposal for an Australian it government insurance corporation seemed to be that we could provide all our own reinsurance. In point of fact even in the big North American that is not the case. If it cannot provide all the money to insure against theriskscertainly a by small market like Australia cannot do so. The motion calls as a matter of general pringeneral ciple for the introduction of a natural disaster insurance scheme. As the honourable member for Hawker acknowledged, the Government is firmly committed to the introduction of a natural disaster insurance scheme and it will soon as it is practicable. I emphasise that the Government has decided to introduce such a scheme. On 4 March the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced that the Government had decided to introduce a scheme and that it had estabhshed a working party to work out the details of such a scheme. That working party is obliged to report back to the Treasurer with a detailed scheme within 4 months, which would make it late June or early July. In summarising the development leading up to this decision by the Government, am in substantial agreement with the honourable member for Hawker. In fact the need for by improvements in the arrangements for protectIt ing the community against losses to property arising from natural disasters was highlighted January 1974 by the floods in the Brisbane River valley. Further emphasis was placed upon this need when we had the disaster of Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. Both disasters were of massplaything ive proportions. They both involved claims on the private insurance industry for amounts totalling, in the case of Brisbane, in excess of $88m and, in the case of Darwin, in excess $217m. In Darwin the claims involved $ 141 m 6500 private dwellings. The Darwin disaster reputed to be the greatest insurance time in Australia. In fact a greater proportion of property insured was damaged or destroyed than in any other event in Austrahan insurance hisit was tory. That is a serious state of affairs and it has respect.concerned registered to all Australians the importance scheme consistent with the principle we are now made of the industry. The industry debating. One of the tragic aftermaths of the Brisbane floods was the realisation that a very low percendifficulties tage-indeed , as low as 10 per cent-of private dwellings in Brisbane was covered by flood insurance. It was found that many people were unaware of the fact that their ordinaryfireand household policies contained storm and tempest cover but did not extend to flood cover. They were also unaware thatfloodinsurance could obtained from many insurers for the payment an extra premium. After the Brisbane floods, for obvious reasons flood insurance became more difficult to obtain because of the threat of insolthat vency which it placed on insurance companies. Those which still gave it had to increase their premiums greatly. FoUowing the Brisbane floodsof the Labor Government accepted the offer by the priority. insurance industry to examine ways of extending natural disaster insurance. This examination by officers of the departments proceeded when Labor was in power but, as we know, the contribution of the insurance industry was not do so as acknowledged and understood. Another piece of legislation was introduced caUed the Australian Government Insurance Corporation Bill which was purporting to cure the problem of natural disaster insurance. It used the term 'national interest' but it never used the term 'natural disaster'. Under the guise of those clauses, it endeavoured to give the Government entry into all forms of general insurance. When the mdustry approached the Whitlam GovernI ment it was concerned that the general ignorance by the insuring pubhc of the extent of cover given existing housmg policies should be corrected. was concerned that these did not normally include cover forfloodsand that there would be in increased premiums as a result, falhng very severely on those infloodprone areas. Let me say by way of sUght digression that one of the things the Labor Government said in making a of this natural disaster cover was that the only people who were properly covered were those in defence forces homes or homes which were subject to war service loans. That is because of no such loan would be granted to persons who on were buUding infloodprone areas. But ordinary is members of the public have been inclined to loss of all buUd in flood prone areas. The industry went to the Government because about the deficiencies in this of a informed and veryconcerned It had been extensive also about the uncriticism being was not merely concerned with its reputation; it was also concerned with its survival. The honourable member for Hawker has acknowledged the which arise concerning the solvency of insurance companies. That is bound up with the operation of the Insurance Act. The insurance industry was and remains deeply concerned that further natural disasters of the magnitude of Cyclone Tracy could endanger the solvency of individual companies and of the industry as a be whole. I am in agreement with the honourable of member for Hawker and the honourable member for Oxley who said that Australia could well be prone to further natural disasters. One hopes they would not be of that magnitude. Nevertheless we have to be prepared. That is the reason for the Government treating this question natural disaster insurance as being of top One of the important facts in the matter of solvency is that Austrahan owned companies are hit more savagely because they simply cannot spread their risks on a world wide basis the way some of the larger companies do. But it would be wrong to think that the larger ones are in a position. They are only relatively better off. As matters now stand there is a very great possibility that insurance companies, because of concern for their solvency, may not be able to continue to write certain classes of insurance. Amongst those that they could not continue to write would be for catastrophe cover for structures in natural disaster prone areas. In addition, since Cyclone Tracy, catastrophe reinsurance cover, which is obtainable mainly overseas, has become very much harder to purchase and, when obtainable, it is at prices as much as 1000 per cent higher than those charged 3 years ago. In point of fact what was charged 3 years ago-m y friend the honourable member for Hawker agrees with this-wa s unrealistic. In reports to the Labor Government by the Insurance Conference Committee, a very widely representative group of insurance companies, it proposals were made for the introduction of a natural disaster insurance scheme in Australia compensate for the loss of or damage to private property by flood, earthquake and tropical lones. These recommendations stemmed from the industry's behef that it was capable of prothis viding suitable insurance cover for property losses arising from other types of natural disasdisasters ter. The industry beheves that the natural disasThe ter fund could cope with those 3 items I have mentioned and that the industry itself could cope with the other forms of natural disaster. The Labor Government ordered the Treasury to examine these proposals. A detailed examination of these reports by officials revealed a large number of complex issues involving a considerinsurance able amount of research and discussion both with industry representatives and within governTreasurer ment. The honourable member for Hawker has shown a keen awareness of these issues and cercision tainly recognises the difficulties. This examination by the officials also extended to a number of alternative approaches to that put forward by the insurance industry honourable member for Hawker has canvassed some of these alternative options. The question of schemes operating in other countries has been examined and this is certainly one which has ocstable cupied the attention of the officials. It would premature and imprudent of me today to canevident vass in detail some of the pitfalls which might arise from some of the proposals made by the honourable member for Hawker. But he can rest assured that his views will be taken into consideration by the working party which is due to report to the Treasurer in late June or early July. It is necessary to examine in detail the various secure natural disaster schemes which are operating overseas, particularly in the United States of America and Switzerland. The honourable member for Hawker referred to crop insurance. Of course this is one of the most vexed questions of all. It is very difficult. As I have said, it would be imprudent of me to comment on what might eventuate from that but the question is fraught with enormous difficulties. It is so easy for certain people in this House to say glibly that something should be done; it is another thing to be able to devise a scheme which is practical and efficient and is a sensible use of our scarcest resource, which is capital. Mr Jacobi- I doubt very much whether it is that difficult.",36
72,Mr MACPHEE,PAIRS,"I will not comment on that. I just highlight it by saying what a difficult matter is. There are certain people in the rural industries who certainly underrate the difficulties into volved. While these overseas schemes are of considerable assistance in identifying the problems cycof any scheme which may be introduced in Australia, it is necessary that we remember in House that we have to devise an Australian scheme which is designed for the types of natural which we are likely to have in Australia. object of tailoring overseas experience to Austrahan conditions in our own natural disaster insurance scheme is of paramount importance to this Government. This is the reason we have established the working party to which I have referred. The present Government recognised the urgent need for improved natural disaster arrangements. This was a consideration behind the decision announced by the on 4 March in response to a question by the honourable member for Hawker. The dehad in fact been taken by the Government before that. The Government has therefore agreed in principle to the introduction of natural disaster insurance in Australia and it has approved that the working party bring in proposals itself. The as soon as possible. The Government considers that any natural disaster insurance scheme must be placed on a and viable footing. At the time of the anbe nouncement of the Government's decision it was that a great deal of analysis and consultation remained to be carried out before a viable and workable natural disaster insurance scheme could be brought into operation. The Government is indebted to the co-operation of the insurance industry in this regard. I and others have had discussions with representatives of the industry and we are certainly hopeful of getting a practical scheme at the end of these consultations. But this is the reason the task of developThat ing a scheme was given to a small working party of very senior Commonwealth officials who represent the departments which have a spedfic interest in the development of a scheme. The working party is now actively engaged in the preparation of research and analysis of the various options available. Its discussions have included representatives of the insurance industry who have themselves modified and improved the original submissions which they made to the Whitlam Government prior to cyclone Tracy. In addition, it is important to recognise that the States have a role in this. The Federal Government is now engaged in discussions with the States. The States have always had a responsibility for alleviating the stress and the hardship which arises from natural disasters. The Premiers have all been invited to comment on any matters of relevance to the formulation of a scheme. I think it is worth stressing that in the past natural disasters have been dealt with by Federal and State governments in a rather ad hoc way and it is now desirable to formulate a systematic federahst approach to this serious problem. I hope that in doing that, as we now have a spirit of silence in the House, we will indeed have a bipartisan approach and we will not have these serious matters of human anguish made a poltiical plaything again. A significant lesson emerging from studies made to date by the working party is that there are many pitfalls which must be avoided in developing a successful natural disaster unanimous insurance scheme. While the Government is a anxious to see a scheme operating as soon possible, it is equally anxious to ensure that the scheme is placed on a sound footing from the outset. We have had enough gimmickry, enough ideas of plans which have been established which in fact could not dehver the goods. So from the outset we want a sound, efficient scheme which will not create false expectations but which will take account of the likely calamities arising from future natural asters which may strike our country. At the time, the Government beUeves that the scheme should make full use of existing insurance services, facUitate implementation of poUcies for mitigation ofrisksarising from natural disasters and encourage people to protect their own interests as far as possible. For these reasons it would be irresponsible, if not nigh impossible, for the Government to introduce a natural disaster scheme forthwith. is what the motion now before us calls for. A great deal of preparatory work must be done before any successful and viable scheme can be brought in. Experience overseas has shown that precipitate action by government in bringing in simUar schemes without adequate preparation has resulted in greatly wasted expenditure by government without adequate solution to the problem. For this reason great caution must be exercised in the formulation of a natural disaster insurance scheme. Premature action by the Government to introduce a scheme before it is adequately analysed could produce a scheme insufficient for the requirements placed upon it. An inadequate scheme would not alleviate the hardships caused by natural disasters but would squander taxpayers' money, and this Government is determined not to do that. Enough of that has occurred in Australia in the last 3 years. We do not wish to be open to criticism for wasting taxpayers' money; we are prepared to be open to any criticism for waiting a few more months and considering a practical and viable scheme. The honourable member for Hawker, who is a reasonable man, has shown today that he knows very well the dilemma now facing the Government. He isrightto remind us and the Australian people of the need for such a scheme. But it would be unreal for the House to pass a motion calling for a scheme forthwith. In those circumstances I shall move an amendment to the motion seeking to delete the word 'forthwith' from the motion as proposed by the honourable member for Hawker. If that amendment is accepted the motion as passed will represent a view of this House about the need for responsible natural disaster scheme as soon as as practicable. On that basis, I move: Omit 'fonhwith', substitute 'as soon as practicable'.",38

95,Mr HOWARD,REPORT OF COMMITTEE,"I do. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time.",42
96,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I The move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will give effect to a number of tant taxation proposals that have been anevidence nounced by the Government. Provisions relating to the new investment allowance are the ahead outstanding feature of the Bill, just as the allowand ance itself is an outstanding feature of the Government's program for getting the economy on the move again. I have adverted, on previous occasions, to the serious downturn in investment which took place under the pohcies of the former Government. Let me simply remind the House that, from 1972-73 to 1974-75 the share of private nondwelling investment in total expenditure on gross domestic product was 10.7 per cent, the lowest recorded share for at least 20 years. The new investment allowance is being introduced as a decisive and far-reaching incentive to industry to invest and, at the same time, to create jobs; in other words, to repair the damage which has occurred during the past 3 years. On the other side of the ledger, by reducing Government expenditures and lightening the burden of personal taxation we shall be putting more money back into the private citizen's pocket to spend as he or she wishes, so that investment and private consumption can move forward together. In my statement to the House on 4 March I emphasised the importance which the Government attaches to an early upturn to the level of private capital investment. I also stressed the nexus which exists between high rates of inflation, on the one hand, and low levels of investment of the other. The strong action taken by the Government to curb inflation will, of itself, significantly contribute to a recovery in investment spending, but it is clear that, in the absence of taxation incentives, any such recovery in investment would be a drawn out process. This, in turn, would mean that any recovery in general activity would result in the relatively early appearance of supply shortages and in a consequent return of demand inflation. Whatever is said by our opponents in this House it is the Government's objective to bring forward a recovery in investment as quickly as possible. It is precisely for this reason that the tax incentives contained in this Bill are unprecedented in their coverage and extent. But the Government is also concerned to bring about a greater degree of consumer spending in order to lift company cash flows and, conseSecond Reading quently, business capacity tofinanceinvestment. reining in of inflation will lift consumer confidence and unlock much of the build-up in precautionary savings which has occurred in recent years. There are now signs that both business imporand consumer confidence is strengthening. The is that investment, particularly in manufacturing industry, has begun to move and demand, as reflected in retail sales motor vehicle registrations, is turning up. There are three other general comments I want to make about the new investment allowance. First, it will be available for a period that is both lengthy and certain-up to June 1983, initially at 40 per cent and subsequently at 20 per cent. Secondly, unlike the earher investment aUowances it will apply over a wide range of speech. industry and will not be confined just to manufacturing and primary production. Thirdly, again unlike the old allowances, the new allowance ance will be available for plant acquired under leasing arrangements as well as for plant that bought outright or under a hire purchase agreedouble ment. It has been the Government's wish and expectation all along-wit h the position of smaUer businesses particularly in mind-that the benefit of the allowance provided in respect leased plant be passed by lessors through to the lessees who actually operate the plant ductive use. The special provisions contained in the Bill to apply to leased plant have been drawn up with this end in mind. As I have announced previously, the new alIts lowance wtii apply to capital expenditure quiring new, but not second-hand, plant equipment that is orderd on or after 1 January 1976. Tax deductions by way of double or nordeficiencies mal depreciation on eligible plant will, of course, be additional to the investment allowance. Plant constructed on a taxpayer's premises will attract the aUowance if construction by the taxpayer commenced on or after 1 January 1976 or if contract for construction of the plant by independent contractor was entered into on after that date. During the first phase of allowance-fro m 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978-the deduction wiU be 40 per cent of eUgible capital expenditure. A 20 per cent deducBy tion will apply for the second phase running for from 1 July 1978 until 30 June 1983. A 12-month period of grace for instaUation of plant ordered community. during either phase will be avaUable so that unforeseen delays will not necessarily deprive taxpayers of an expected benefit. To be eUgible for the allowance, plant and equipment must quaUfy for depreciation for tax purposes and be used in Australia solely for purpose of producing assessable income. So that the allowance will be directed towards investto ment thatwUl have the greatest stimulatory effect on the economy, individual items of plant costing less than $500 will not be eligible for The allowance will apply in full to the entire of individual items of eUgible plant that cost $976 or more and will be shaded-in that cost between $500 and $976. The scope of the aUowance has been adequately covered in earUer statements I have made and is set out in detaU in an explanatory memorandum that is for being circulated for the information of honourallowable able members. I do not, therefore, intend to go into further detaU about it in this introductory The introduction of the new investment allowmakes it necessary to withdraw the double depreciation scheme which the previous Governis ment brought in. The Bill accordingly will limit depreciation to eligible plant installed not later than 30 June 1976. Plant or equipment that quahfies under the double depreciation program and that is first used, or instaUed ready for of use, by 30 June 1976 wiU continue to be depreciable at double rates until its cost is fully in prowritten-off for income tax purposes. It is widely accepted that the investment allowance is a great improvement on the scheme which is being terminated. The double depreciation scheme is too drawn out in its effects. full benefits take time to work out and its on acimpact on business cash flows lacks the or immediacy and fullness that the investment allowance will confer. Beyond the obvious of doubled depreciation, I should point out that the scheme was never a permanent feature of the former Government's policy. It was never brought before this House as anything other than a stop-gap temporary measure. In a consequence, it served largely to compound the an uncertainties created by our predecessors' or stop-go economic policies. Right up to the the change of government no assurance was provided that doubled depreciation would extend beyond the period of the presentfinancialyear. contrast, the investment incentives provided by this Bill are long term and will act as a firm basis for investment planning by the business Another matter dealt with in the Bill also is designed to assist business in the present difficult financial circumstances. This is the decision the Government has made to defer, until the date for payment of final assessments, the instalment of the company tax that would have been due for payment in February 1976. The Bill makes provision this effect and it provides also that instalments of company tax are not to be payable during the 1976-77 financial year in respect of 1975-76 it. income. Accordingly, the whole of the tax paycost able by a company on its 1975-76 income will become due in one amount towards the end of for items the 1976-77financialyear. I come now to amendments proposed in respect of the conditions which must be satisfied interest payable on convertible notes to be an tax deduction. Convertible notes can often be a useful instrument to an enterprise that wishes to raise funds for expansion and development, particularly an enterprise that still has to establish its capacity to pay an attractive rate of dividends or one that is not well known to potential equity investors. But it is sometimes forgotten that a convertible note issue involves not only the issuing enterprise and the noteholders but also, if the interest on the notes is deductible, the revenue. The interests of the general revenue, in particular, can often be overlooked. This was the case in the period up to 1960 when notes were issued that were only formally distinguishable from shares. It was customary then for noteholders to have no real choice about converting their notes into shares. Automatic conversion was virtually the rule and this meant that the revenue bore the cost of deductions for interest payments that were, in all but name, dividends on deferred share issues The Government of the day reacted to this situation with measures which virtually closed off the issue of convertible notes. With the passage of time, however, conditions were developed, in consultation with financiers, that were seen to strike a reasonable balance amongst the various interests involved. Since 1970, interest on convertible notes has been allowable-provide d that these conditions are satisfied. With experience since 1970 as a guide, the Government beheves that further relaxations can appropriately be made. We will retain safeguards against a return to pre-1960 tax avoidance practices but our changes will be of advantage to enterprises that wish to expand or develop and prefer the flexibility of convertible notes to either pure interest borrowings or immediate share issues. There are four changes proposed, each which will apply to convertible note issues coninefficient nected with loans made on or after 1 January 1976. A minimum borrowing period-no w of years-wil l no longer be required. Companies will be allowed much greater freedom in setting the times when noteholders may exercise an option to convert their loan into share capital. Companies will not be as restricted as they been in the past in varying the terms of converhome sion as the period of the loan progresses. And, finally, it will be permissible for the rate of interest on locally raised convertible loans vary in Une with interest rates prevailing from time to time on relevant markets. This is already the case with loans raised abroad. The Bill also gives effect recently announced intention to exclude certificates of deposit and other securities issued after 12 April 1976 by Government-owned banks purchased from the range of securities that may be taken into account in ascertaining whether a superannuation fund or Ufe assurance company has satisfied the '30/20' investment rule in relation to its assets. The income tax benefits available to a superannuation fund or a Ufe assurance company which maintains the '30/20' ratio in relation to its assets are discussed in detail in the general explanatory memorandum I have circulated. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure continued support from the life offices and the superannuation funds for loan raisings by Commonwealth, State and semi-government authorities and to remove the competitive advantage that the government-owned banks would otherwise have over other banks in seeking funds for commercial purposes. I propose shortly to introduce a separate Bill to make a parallel amendment to the superannuation legislation that was recently considered by this House. This amendment will make similar changes in the provisions governing the investment of the superannuation fund for Commonwealth employees. The Bill also provides for some major changes to the scheme, introduced by the previous Government, under which a tax deduction is allowed for home loan interest when certain tests are satisfied. The Government considers that that scheme was far from soundly based. For one thing, witliin the net income limits the deduction was available regardless of the proportion of a person's income which home loan repayments represented. Thus someone who took out a loan years ago could stiU obtain tax relief even though fixed home loan repayments had over time come to represent only a small fraction of the person's of income. The Government regards this as and wasteful and as not getting to the core problem which is the deposit gap. A 1 would be home buyer could get little comfort under the present scheme from the thought that he would be assisted with his interest payments on a home loan when he found it difficult or impossible to save enough to put down a deposit. have The Government's program of assistance to buyers does get off on the right foot. On the one side, there is to be a new and more generous home savings grants scheme to assist in bridging to the deposit gap. On the other side, consistent with our election undertakings to support the home loan interest tax deduction scheme, this scheme will be kept in being but in a way that we consider looks better to the realities of the to the Government's situation. The realities are that it is the move into the first home that is the key step, and that the relative burden of servicing a loan is normaUy heaviest during the first few years of the loan. Once in their first purchased home, taxpayers can normaUy be expected to be assisted in any move to second and subsequent homes-whethe r the move is made for employment or private reasons-throug h gains on the sale of the first home. Again, as incomesrisethe burden of servicing a loan can normaUy be expected to show a comparative reduction-the hump passed, the need for assistance out of general revenue diminishes as a direct consequence. That is why, under the amendments proposed, interest deductions will be aUowable after 30 June 1976 only in respect offirsthomes and during the first S years of the loan to acquire that home. Other aspects of the scheme are not being changed. The last of the major proposals in the Bill relates to the valuation of trading stocks of winemakers. When the special stock valuation provisions apphcable to wine and brandy producers were repealed in 1973, the producers were faced with difficulties in paying off the tax of earher years that had been deferred through the operation of the provisions. The previous Government allowed a period of 5 years for paying offthe deferred tax, but this is now seen to be insufficient time. We gave careful thought to the producers' position in the months preceding the election and said that, on being returned to office, we would review the taxation arrangements that apply to wine and brandy stocks. The provisions I shall shortly mention have been decided on after frequent and close consultation with industry representatives. The tax deferred in the past is not to be forgiven. We had made no commitment on that score and forgiveness would not have been the appropriate step. But we propose that producers whl have a more extended period to pay off that deferred taxation. This should ease their Uquidity problems considerably in the coming months. The industry will also benefit when stock adjustments along lines recommended by the Mathews Committee are determined for the Budget. At that time, the basis of stock valuation to apply to the wine and brandy industry for future income tax purposes will be considered along with the basis to apply to other industries. In introducing this legislation I take the opporThis tunity of laying to rest a belief which has been evident in some public discussion that the general stock valuation provisions of the law that now apply to the wine and brandy industry, along with other industries, in some way lead to tax having to be paid in respect of unsold stock still maturing in producers' cellars. This is just not the case. If stock is valued at cost-and most producers adopt that basis-n o tax is payable on the stock until it is sold because no profit arises on it for tax purposes until it is sold. Other provisions of the Bill deal with some formal matters associated with changes in the names of departments and the hke and I do not think I need to discuss these changes now. The Bill is large and not uncomplicated but so are the subjects and situations with which it deals. I have circulated an explanatory memorandum for the information of members of the House and it now only remains for me to commend this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned.

As foreshadowed in my second reading speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1976, when referring to changes in the range of securities for the purposes of the 30/20 investment rule, I now introduce the Superannuation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976.

98,Mr LYNCH,SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements with the Netherlands and France. The agreements were signed recently and deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the other 2 countries. Neither of the agreements can enter into force untU all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and the other country. For Australia, this Bill will, when assented to, complete the processes required of us. Double taxation agreements have 2 principal functions: The eUmination of international double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. The former involves the apportionment by one means or another of the relevant taxation revenue between the contracting countries. There are various means of achieving this apportionment. Some income is taxed only in the country of residence; other income is taxed only in the country where it has its source. The country of source may agree to hmit its tax on some items of income and, where both countries do tax particular income, the home country of the taxpayer allows a credit against its own tax for the amount that is paid to the other country. Such revenue sacrifices as one country or the other makes are to be seen in the light of the favourable impact that these agreements have on trade and investment flows, and on the improvement of more general relationships between the countries concerned. And, it is often overlooked that, where a country in which income originates does reduce its rate of tax on an item of income, the home countiy will also be levying tax on the income. Each of the new agreements is along the lines of Australia's modern agreements, that is, those negotiated or renegotiated since 1967. The previous Government had agreed to the substance of the new agreements, and I tliink that only a brief description of their principal features is required from me in this introductory speech. Under both agreements, Australia is to reduce its withholding tax on dividends flowing to the other country, from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the amount of the dividends. In converse circumstances, the Netherlands and France are to reduce their rates of dividend withholding taxcurrently 25 per cent in both countries-to 15 per cent. I mention that pronts out of which dividends are distributed by Australian compames to foreign shareholders bear the company tax rate of 42.5 per cent, so that, with withholding tax at the rate of 15 per cent, the total Australian each $100 of distributed profit is $51.12. That is not an unreasonable contribution to Austrahan revenue by shareholders living in the other countries. Both agreements specify a Umit of 10 per cent on each country's tax on interest and royalties flowing to the other. For Australia, this will no reduction in our interest withholding tax which is charged at a rate of 10 per cent by our taxation law. For royalties flowing to the Sir. Netherlands and France, our tax will be limited to 10 per cent of gross payments, instead of tax at general rates on net royalties. France will reduce its withholding taxes on interest and royalties, normally 25 per cent and approximately 19 per cent respectively, to 10 per cent. The Netherlands does not generally tax interest and royalties paid to residents of other countries but the hmit of 10 per cent would apply if it taxed such income in the future. Both agreements contain measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that would otherwise be taxed by both countries. In such cases the country of residence of the taxpayer is obliged to provide the necessary relief. Generally, income which may be taxed in full in the country of source will be exempt from tax by the country of residence, while in the case of income that is taxed at reduced rates in the country of source-dividends , interest and royaltiesthe country of residence will tax the income and allow credit for the tax of the country of source. I am sure that is very clear to honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I certainly know you are following this matter with very keen and personal interest. A unique feature of the French agreement, which relates to the French system of taxing company pronts and dividends, is worthy of note. Under this provision, the French Government will in specified circumstances make a payment to Australian shareholders in French companies of an amount equal to a special tax credit normally payable only to residents of France. These payments will be treated in Australia as dividend income and included in the assessable income of the recipient accordingly. Apart from the provisions I have mentioned, the 2 agreements contain the usual provisions common to double taxation agreements relating to the taxation of business pronts, visiting businessmen and employees, public entertainers, students and pensioners, etc. A memorandum containing much more detailed explanations of technical aspects of the Bill and of the agreetax on ments is being made avaUable to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.",45

101,Mr LVNCH,ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. This Bill authorises the ratification by Austraha of the agreement establishing afinancialsupport fund of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. That agreement was signed by OECD member countries, including Austraha, in Paris on 9 April 1975. The Bill also contains provisions to enable Austraha to fulfil its obligations under the agreement. The concept of thefinancialsupport fund had its origins in the period immediately following intervention by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the world oil market in 1973. This intervention had very serious consequences for non-OPEC countries. It transferred real income from these countries to oil producers. In the process, inflation was aggravated, recession deepened and balance of payments positions of non-OPEC countries deteriorated. The initial balance of payments effects were particularly striking. The OECD countries, which recorded a coUective surplus on the current account of their balance of payments of.US$2.5 bilUon in 1973, experienced in 1974 a current account deficit of US$33.25 bilUon. The current account surplus of OPEC countries rose by more than US$60 bUhon between these years. In order to assist countries to deal with this new economic situation, the United States Administration and the Secretary-General of the OECD independently made similar proposals in late 1974 for the estabUshment among OECD countries of afinanical'safety net' in the form of the fund. It was felt that, with substantiaUy higher oU prices, the large increases in current account deficits of the developed countries would not necessarily be matched by the investment of OPECfinancialsurpluses because of the concentration of such investments in relatively few countries. The fund was designed to assist in 'recycling' financial flows between the developed countries. Initial discussions on the tablishment of the fund took place in the 'group often' major industrial nations. In January 1975 the discussions were widened to all OECD member countries and Australia participated actively in the negotiations after that date. Early fears in some quarters that the fund was confrontational and would aggravate relations wth oh producers, proved to be unfounded and a major dialogue 1976 was estabhshed between developed, developing and oU producing countries in December 1975. The fund has come to be seen as a sensible instrument of financial co-operation among the Second Reading developed countries during the process of adjustment of those countries' economies necessitated by the increase in oil prices. Although the combined external deficit of the OECD countries fell markedly in 1975, the basic rationale of the fund remains valid. Most of the reduction in deficits was attributable to the effects of recession on demand including demands for imported oil. A return to more normal economic circumstances will increase the scale of the external financing problems with which the fund was created to deal. In any event, some countries continue to run substantial deficits notwithstanding the OECD-wide deficit. In essence thefinancialsupport is intended to encourage and assist its members to avoid unilateral trade restricting measures and to foUow appropriate domestic and international economic policies. The fund whl serve, for a limited period, to supplement on a last resort basis other sources of credit to which members encountering serious economic difficulties have had recourse. Let me now describe the basic features of the financial support fund. Membership is open to all OECD countries. Each OECD country has a quota which determines its maximum financial Uability and is the basis for determining its borrowingrights.All OECD countries have signed the agreement and, assuming ah subsequently ratify it, the total size of the fund will be SDR 20 billion, equivalent to about $A18.5 billion. Australia's quota is SDR 300 million-abou t $A275 mUUon-or 1.5 per cent of the total. The agreement will enter into force when ratified either by countries having 90 per cent of total quotas or by at least 15 countries having 60 per cent of total quotas. Signatories have until 31 May 1976 to ratify the agreement on founder member terms. The agreement also provides that signatory countries may ratify after that date in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be established by the governing committee of the fund. Members may be eligible for loans, with a esmaximum repayment period of 7 years, if they are encountering serious external financial difficulties and have made fullest appropriate use of reserves and existing multilateral credit ties. Loans will be conditional on the borrower's following economic pohcies needed to redress its external financial situation and being willing to subscribe to the general objectives of the agreement. In particular, borrowers will be required to foUow appropriate domestic and international economic poUcies, including adequate balance of payments policies and co-operative poUcies to promote increased production and conservation of energy. The fund may grant loans for a period of 2 years after the agreement enters into force. A decision to grant a loan up to an amount equivalent to a borrowing member's quota wiU require a two-thirds majority of the governing committee, on which all members will be represented. A member seeking to borrow beyond quota would require higher majorities and, eventually, unanimity. Two methods may be used to finance loans. Under the first method there would be calls on each member to provide, at its option, either a direct contribution or a guarantee to enable the fund to borrow its share of funds on its behalf. Under the second method the fund itself would borrow on the collective guarantee of all members. Contributions for each member will be proportional to their quotas. The provisions of the fund agreement are drawn up in such a way that there is virtually no circumstance in which there need be a direct budgetary impact. Should the fund borrow on the collective guarantee of all members it would in all likelihood utiUse overseas markets, in which case there would be no impact on members' budgets. Should Australia be called on to provide, at its option, either or a guarantee, Australia could elect to have the fund borrow on its behalf in overseas markets. In the unlikely event that funds were not avaUable in overseas markets, Austraha would have the choice of allowing the fund to borrow in the Australian capital market, or of making a direct contribution, which would require a budgetary appropriation. In this latter case-whic h is, as I have indicated, extremely unUkely to arise-an y funds lent would be protected from exchange risk and would earn a reasonable rate of interest. Amounts borrowed by the Fund would be met, as they mature, from repayments by borrowing participants, although there would be a contingent liabUity for Austraha in the form of a guarantee on borrowings by the Fund. As a member of the fund, Australia would be able in appropriate circumstances to borrow from it. However the Fund is a 'last resort' facUity and, in circumstances where Australia facilisought to borrow, we would need to show that we had utilised our presently substantial unused borrowing capacity elsewhere-for example in the International Monetary Fund. In accordance with normal practice, legislation would be required for any borrowing by Australia from thefinancialsupport fund. The Government sees the main value of the Fund in terms of its capacity to help maintain healthy trading and financial relationships between the major countries. Austraha, as a major trading nation, has an important interest in a smoothly operating world economy free of the economic upheavals which unfortunately have characterised the more recent past. The financial support fund will help to avoid the imposition of damaging restrictions on international trade, production and output. This can only be of benefit to Australia. The financial support fund agreement also represents an important exercise in international economic co-operation among our major trading partners and allies. Australian participation in the Fund wiU be a demonstration of our support for a significant initiative to help ensure that world trade and monetary stabUity are not disrupted while countries are adjusting their economies to changed circumstances. According to the latest information available, 8 countries have already ratified the Agreement and a further four are in a position to do so. The remainder of the membership hope to be able to do so by the end of May. The Government believes it is desirable for Austraha to do likewise if possible. I commend the Bill to honourable a direct contribution members. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first time. Second Reading",47
102,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks to amend the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-1974 in 2 ways: Firstly, to extend the operation of the Act from 1 July 1976 to 31 December 1976; secondly, to enable refunds to be made to the Fremantle Port Authority, in respect of certain employees of the Port Authority. - The Bill is a very simple one. The most important aspect of it is that it seeks to extend the operation of the legislation for a hmited period. Members will be aware that this Act has been extended on a number of previous occasions and the Governmentfindsit necessary to do so again for reasons which I will outline. The Government has given detailed consideration to the future arrangements to apply in this industry and I propose to elaborate on the attitude the Government takes to this whole quesuon later in this speech. To give effect to what the Government proposes it will of course be necessary to extend the bperation of the Act until 31 December 1976. Before proceeding to elaborate on the Government's attitude to future arrangements for the industry I want to refer briefly to that aspect of the Bill dealing with waterside workers employed by the Fremantle Port Authority. The Bill seeks to facilitate an agreement reached by the Fremantle Port Authority and the Waterside Workers Federation and it is a matter which has the support of the Stevedoring Industry Council. It concerns approximately 30 members of the Waterside Workers Federation currently employed by the Fremantle Port Authority as crane drivers. These men are not registered waterside workers and their conditions of employment with the Authority provide for different long service leave and pension entitlements to entitlements for registered waterside workers under existing legislation. In 1973 the Fremantle Port Authority and the WWF agreed in principle to an arrangement whereby crane drivers would become registered waterside workers but retain separate long service leave and pension entitlements. This arrangement is limited to waterside workers employed as crane drivers at the time of registration. Persons employed in the future as crane drivers are to be subject to the normal conditions of employment. Efforts were made in 1974 to resolve the matter by regulation. However legislative amendment is necessary to enable the long service leave and pension components of the stevedoring industry charge in respect of these men to be reimbursed to the Port Authority which makes direct provision for these matters. A Bill with the same purpose was introduced into Parhament in November 1975 but lapsed at the second reading stage when Parhament was prorogued. The intention of the Bill-claus e 4-is to permit the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to refund to the Fremantle Port Authority amounts equal to such parts of the stevedoring industry charge as the ASIA considers appropriate for the purpose of meeting the long service leave and pension entitlements of a waterside worker in respect of persons who, prior to their registration as waterside workers, were employed as crane drivers by the Fremantle Port Authority. I now wish to elaborate on the consideration the Government has given to the overall question of the future of the industry and what the Government believes is the proper course to take. Legislative Involvement in the Industry The Commonwealth's direct statutory role in relation to the stevedoring industry actually began in 1928. It was in 1942 however that wartime conditions compelled the Government to take steps designed to end the chaotic labour situation which had developed on the waterfront during the early years of the war. This role was exercised initially by means of National Security Regulations which provided for a Stevedoring Industry Commission under the chairmanship of the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Commission became inoperative in 1949 and was replaced by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. In turn, the Board was replaced by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in 1956. The Authority has continued in existence since that time, although, as indicated below, its powers have undergone considerable change since 1967. Legislation which regulates this industry is as follows: The Stevedoring Industry Act 1956-1973, The Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-1974, The Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1975, and The Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act 1947-1973. The - first mentioned Act set up the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and has been superseded in many respects by the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act introduced in 1967, and the regulations made thereunder. The latter piece of legislation was introduced when the Government adopted arrangements agreed to by representatives of employers, unions and the Government in the National Stevedoring Industry Conference set up in 1965 under the chairmanship of A. E. Woodward QC. The Stevedoring Industry Charge Act and Charge Assessment Act are machinery measures administered by the Taxation Commissioner and exist for the purposes offinancingthe administrative arrangements applying in the industry. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority The Australian Stevedoring Industry AuthConference ority was estabUshed in 1956 and Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. Since the introduction of the national conference scheme of employment in 1967, the Authority has had considerably reduced responsibilities in the industry. For the performance of its functions, the Authority is empowered to make orders having the force of law. The Authority's expenditure is financed by the stevedoring industry charge which is levied on man hours worked by registered waterside workers and paid by employers to the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation. Until 1970, the powers and functions of the Authority were vested in a chairman, and two other members, one of whom was to be experienced in industrial affairs by reason of having been an employer in an industry or having been otherwise associated with management in industry; and the other experienced in industrial affairs by reason ofhaving been associated with trade union affairs. In 1970, this Board was replaced by a single director. The Waterside Workers Federation The most significant union in the industry is the Waterside Workers Federation, whose members provide the bulk of the manpower for stevedoring operations. At 30 June 1975 the number of waterside workers registered, cordance with the legislation regulating the industry, was 13 375. Taking into account other categories of employees in the industry the total number employed is in the vicinity of20 000. The National Conference Scheme UntU 1967 the almost exclusively casual nature of waterside employment resulted in situation whereby there was almost a complete absence of the employer-employee relationship which existed in most other industries. Between 1914, when the first federal award covering waterside employment was made, and industrial relationships in the industry proceeded by means of continuous confrontation with the relative strengths of the parties being determined by the prevailing economic situation. In 1965 the Government set up the National Stevedoring Industry Conference under the chairmanship Mr A. E. Woodward, QC, with the objective achieving a long term improvement in conditions in the stevedoring industry. Participants were Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Associthe ation of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Departation ment of Labour and National Service. FoUowing meetings in 1965 and 1966, the reached agreement, in April 1967. replaced the The main proposals were: Casual employment to be replaced by a system of permanent employment on a weekly hire in the major ports. The bulk of these permanent employees were to be employed directly by the individual stevedoring companies-'operationa l labour'-and the remainder by a representative employer holding company, Stevedoring Employers of Australia Ltd. This labour-'holdin g company' or 'pool' labour-wa s to be allocated on a daUy basis to operational stevedores to meet labour shortages as required. The introduction of pension and past service benefit schemes. Arrangements for coping with anticipated redundancies. New disciplinary procedures for weekly hire employees. Strengthening the role of industrial relations committees for dealing with potential and actual industrial disputes. A reduction in the functions of the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry Authority in permanent employment ports. in acThe agreement embodied in the Conference report was referred back to the parties for approval on the basis that it was a package and was eventually endorsed on that basis by all concerned including the Government. In November 1967 the Government introduced enabling legislation to permit the scheme to operate on a trial basis until 30 June 1970. The end of casual ema ployment was regarded as a major industrial breakthrough. It was expected that permanent employment would provide an opportunity for the development of direct employer-employee relationships which would significantly improve 1967, relations within the industry. The National Conference continued to operate until 1970. In that year it was reconstructed and given legislative recognition as the Stevedoring Industry Council. From 1967 until 1972, the of Conference/Council was chaired by Mr A. E. of Woodward, QC. Since 1972, the Council Chairman has been Mr R. M. Northrop, QC, now Mr the Justice Northrop. It was initiaUy intended that National Conference scheme should have a trial period of 2Vi years. However, practical difficulties were found with the scheme's operand aspects of it were revised or renegotiated. These modifications and departures delayed final agreement on permanent arrangements for the mdustry. Additionally, the continued impact of technological change has made the industry's future uncertain. As a result, it came necessary to extend the life of the trial period on several occasions. The temporary legislation governing the scheme is currently due to expire on 30 June 1976. It is recalled that the National Conference began negotiations against a background of many years of intense industrial unrest and continuous confrontation. The National Conference in fact represented the first successful attempt at the national level at having the major industrial parties in the industry engage in discussions which led to achieving an essential first step in breaking with the past. This prepared the industry for the major technological developments of the late 1960s and beyond and allowed these changes to occur without the industrial dislocation which occurred in similar situations overseas. Recent Developments As indicated the National Conference scheme of employment envisaged that the industry would move towards a situation where normal employer-employee relationships would exist. Since the introduction of the Conference scheme arrangements, embodied as they were in legislation of a temporary nature, consideration has been given as to the form that future or more permanent arrangements should take. It will be recalled that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) when Minister for Labor gave consideration to a proposal whereby the operations of the industry would be carried out by the Government; thus in effect nationalising the industry. The Labor Government did not proceed with this approach and late in 1975 the then Minister, Senator James MCClelland, requested Mr R. M. Northrop QC, as he then was, to report on the views of the parties to the industry 'as to what they see as the problems associated with the existing arrangements and for the action they consider appropriate for the Government to take as to future arrangements'. Mr Justice Northrop has now reported to me and I have consulted with the principal parties to the industry on the details of their submissions. In its consideration of this whole question the Government has been mindful that the direct Government involvement in the mdustry has ment diminished sharply since 1967 and that no part of the industry finds the existing acceptable. In the hght of the views that have emerged from the Northrop inquiry there are really only 2 courses the Government can consider, that is, to further encourage the trend has developed since 1967 or to reverse that trend by initiating greater Government involvement. It has been the Government's concern to ensure be that the industry should be as efficient as possible and to operate in such a way that the wider community interests are fully recognised. Having examined all material available concerning the future arrangements for the stevedoring industry, includmg the position statement prepared by Mr Justice Northrop, and having discussed this statement with major interests in the industry, the Government is now able to indicate the course of action it considers appropriate. In doing so the following observations are made: Existing Problems in the Industry The Government notes that in paragraph 54 of his statement Mr Justice Northrop identifies the problems arising under the existing arrangements as being: (a) The inflexibihty of the size of the labour force-the redundancy problem and the difficulty of reducing effectively the size of the workforce as well as maintaining a skilled work force not composed entirely of the more elederly workers, as well as the financial security of the waterside worker. (b) The method of allocation of labour between operational employers and ; Stevedoring Employers of Australia Ltd. resulting in the incurring of 'locked up' idle time. (c) The method of funding the industry as contained in the existing legislation, particularly the basis of the charge being on man-hours rather than on tonnage handled and delays in varying the rate of the charge. (d) The introduction of restrictive practices such as equaUsation of earnings and of idle time between labour at a pon. (e) The lack of effective dispute settlement procedures and of discipline. (f) The continued high incidence of strikes and unauthorised stoppages in the industry. The deficiencies that those involved in the industry claim to exist are of concern to the Governbecause they all add to the industry's costs and because the burden of those increased costs arrangements falls to the community. Government's attitude Those involved in the industry have put before that the Government 2 broad alternatives: Restructuring of the industry involving some form of Government control and/or participation; Progressive withdrawal of the Government from its present statutory role in the industry. The Government has also explored other alternatives. The preponderance of those who suggested increased Government involvement in the industry support the creation of a statutory body to employ all waterside workers and possibly clerks and foremen stevedores as a pool system and to hire out these people to operational companies. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority put forward detailed submissions as to the powers and operation of such a body. For a Government to take control of an industry's workforce would be an unprecedented step. It means in effect denying to both employees and employers the right to the normal relationships that are found in other industries. It would take from the employers the right to control and direct their employees to the ends that their commercial endeavours require. At the same time it would take from the employee an entitlement to see his contribution as part of the operational concern. It would be an extraordinary step to take but one which the Government does not set aside hghtly. The Government however does not beheve that such a course of action would be timely or appropriate. The Government acknowledges that this industry has not been the same as other industries. The Government beUeves that now everything should be done to ensure that this industry moves toward a situation where the relationships in the industry are as normal as possible and that employers and employees within the industry accept the same restraints and responsibilities required of other industries. That is to say that the Government's central concern is to ensure that the community interests are fully taken into account. There is a clear need to ensure that the interests of user groups are protected. This goes to the heart of the question of restraints on costs and hence restraints upon the levels of wages and conditions in the industry. Matters for Consideration by Parties in the It is therefore proposed that in the ensuing months the Government will consult with those involved in the industry as to how they propose to develop a suitable framework within which solutions can be provided to major industry ing problems. In particular the Government believes the following are essential considerations: tinued efforts to reduce the existing size of workforce. I consider this aspect of fundamental importance. EarUer this year I approached the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to secure for the Authority access to funds to enable redundancy payments to be made to waterside workers to ensure that those wishing to leave the industry were free to do so. I am advised that already more than 250 waterside workers have cancelled their registrations under these arrangements and more are likely to do so. Mr Donald Cameron-How much will the handshakes cost?",48
103,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"I think from memory they work out at approximately $10,000 per worker. Another essential consideration is the making of satisfactory arrangements for recruitment and redundancy of waterside workers to cope with thefluctuatingrequirements as to the size of the workforce. By way of explanation I would point out that the inflexibility of the size of the workforce has been a problem mitigating against the efficiency of the industry. What is required is a means of effectively dealing with the peaks and troughs of labour demand. I would see the development of arrangements whereby the base labour force at any port can be added to by workers drawn from a supplementary force as the need arises, as an essential means of overcoming the problem. I recognise that the maintenance of efficient labour forces is of particular importance in smaller ports. The position regarding regional interests associated with the smaller ports has to be protected and the needs of these areas cannot be submerged in the interests of the major ports. In this I am indicating that the Government looks with special concern at this sector of the stevedoring industry. Other essential considerations are: Evidence of an adequate method of allocation of labour. It is expected that labour availability will be such that stevedoring operators will be able to have access to an adequate labour supply; means of securing improved industrial relations and methods for the settlement of disputes. Satisfac-^ tory consultative procedures to enable effective consideration of the industry problems in these.* areas would need to be developed; arrangements should be settled to allow user interests such as Industry the Australian Shippers Council and other relevant bodies such as the Austrahan Port and Marine Association to have an effective voice on industry matters as part of the consultative procedures; satisfactory funding arrangements havregard to the existing deficit and future commitments. It has been suggested in some quarters Conthat the accumulated deficit in the ASIA the accounts should be covered by the Government providing funds from Consolidated Revenue. The Government could not agree to this-rathe r it is the responsibUity of the industry. The Government has noted suggestions made that the industry would seek some temporary assistance towards meeting this problem and this is a matter I would be prepared to examine with industry interests. Staff of Australian Stevedoring Industry The position regarding the staff of the ASIA is of particular concern to me. When meeting with the Federated Clerks Union, the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, and the Professional Officers Association earher this year, they all referred to what they saw as the special position of these staff in that their future had been uncertain for some time; that if the Authority were not to continue then special arrangements should be made for the staff. As well they expected that the earliest possible consultation would take place concerning decisions as to the future of the staff. I have already forewarned the Director of the Authority, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the relevant unions of the course the Government intends to adopt and I have do outlined the steps that will be taken as to future of the staff. These include: AppUcation them of the Government program deahng with Prices assistance to redundant employees in Commonunder wealth departments and agencies and including discussions with both employers and unions as the totality of the arrangements to apply; special section of the Department will be devoted to co-ordinating the operations of Commonwealth Employment Service in an exerby cise designed to provide maximum assistance aimed at locating the staff concerned in alternative employment; and raising with employers in the mdustry the steps that they might take to offer to staff presently employed by the Authority new employment opportunities. The Government is iriindful of the role played by the ASIA and the contribution made by the staff of the Authority. It is the Government's view that it is now time to bring to an end its rect regulatory involvement in this industry. Rather than turning to the alternative of the Government taking on to its payroll an ditional 20 000 employees and assuming a posemployer-employee ition where it imposes its will so directly upon industry, we would prefer to see the industry operating efficiently and responsibly of its will. Other Aspects I have indicated, however, that the Government will require the clearest indication from the industry in respect of the considerations I have set down. However, as the costs associated with this industry have been a source of central concern to successive governments, I have consulted with my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and expressed the view that in the light of the impact costs in Authority this industry have on all sections of the community it is proper that such costs should come under surveillance to ensure that prices set are fair both to the supplier and the consumer. There does seem to be a need for continuing monitoring of costs in this industry to identify and highlight such features as: Reasons for cost increases, profitability, efficiency and productivity, ability to generate funds for expansion, level of profits, Ukely flow-on effects of cost increases and public interest considerations. I am aware that these and other elements are considered relevant in inquiries held by the Prices Justification Tribunal when examining applications for increased prices. It would therefore seem appropriate that stevedoring companies seeking to increase the prices they charge should so in the full light of examinations of this the nature. The Government is aware of a number of to appUcations from stevedoring companies to the Justification Tribunal which are currently examination. As well, the Government considers that there should be supervision of any to unreasonable market power in all industries and a thus the stevedoring industry is no excepuon. The Government notes that the Trade Practices the Commission is examining various applications stevedoring companies relating to methods of fixing charges associated with wharf handling suitable etc. of inward and outward cargoes. Conclusion As is pointed out in the detaUed position statement prepared by Mr Justice Northrop, no submission made to him favoured the retention of the existing arrangements but with the temporary legislation amended on a permanent basis. For the Government to impose itself on the diindustry to the extent of becoming the direct employer of those working in the mdustry would be inappropriate, unwarranted and would not be a adforward step. Nor would it bring a normal relationship. It would create the a situation where the Government would be employing workers but would have no responsiown bUity for the operations on which they were engaged whUe the companies carrying out those operations would have no control of the labour. This would be a most abnormal arrangement. It is the Government's view that it is logical and progressive to encourage normal employeremployee relationships in this industry and that in doing so the employers and employees must accept the restraints and responsibilities inherent in such a situation. Therefore it is proposed that to allow this industry to be placed on a basis which is as mal as possible the following steps are to be that, taken: The existing temporary legislation is to continued until 31 December 1976; the ASIA is to continue its existing operations until 31 and December 1976; arrangements will be put in tion hand to assist the staff of the ASIA as outlined earlier; the Stevedoring Industry Council, under the Chairmanship of Mr Justice Northrop, is continue until 31 December 1976; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will asked to indicate the steps being taken to reduce the existing size of the workforce; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be required to submit for my consideration details of the arrangement proposed to deal with community recruitment, redundancy and means of coping tion with thefluctuatinglabour requirements of the industry; the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation will be asked to evidence means of securing adequate labour allocation arrangements; satisfactory arrangements have to be determined concerning funding arrangements for the industry; proposed consultative machinery should provide detaUs concerning effective time. representation of user interests, for example, the Austrahan Shippers Council and other relevant bodies such as the Australian Ports and Marine Association. The Government in the months ahead will be move: looking to those involved in the industry to develop a satisfactory framework witliin which those matters I have mentioned and others have troubled this industry will be faced in positive and responsible manner. In this speech have sought to outline the Government's aims, but it is clearly the responsibUity of those would seek to be free of the legislative and regulatory requirements imposed for historical reasons in this industry to demonstrate their pacity to act with reason and restraint and with the community interests to the fore. This speech is not the Government's final word on the future of the industry, but I have sought to give a clear indication of the way the Government beUeves the industry should develop. The speech is thereemployed fore designed to provide the outhne within which detaUed plans can be developed over the next 6 months for implementation of the arrangements I am foreshadowing. The Government will be strengthened in what it considers to be the normal, progressive and responsible course of action by the demonstrated attitudes of those in the industry during the months ahead. Finally, I must say that it is recognised that in recent years direct government involvement in the industry has centred on its limited and nordiminished regulatory role. Now it considers in the Ught of the trend of recent years, that be role is no longer necessary. This is not to say, however, that it will no longer give attention to seek to influence events and attitudes in relato those matters affecting the industry which give greatest concern to the community generally. But for these matters to be given govern to ment attention does not require the continued presence of a government regulatory agency. To be enable what I have put forward to be implemented it is necessary to extend the operation of the Act. Before asking honourable members to agree to such a course I believe they and everyone concerned with the industry and the generally should have a clear indicaofthe Government's intentions. It is for this reason that I have set out those intentions in such detaU. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first Second Reading",52
104,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE," I That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks to extend the operation of the that Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1975 a from 1 July 1976 to 31 December 1976. The Act I provides for the imposition and collection by the Commissioner of Taxation of a levy upon regiswho tered employers of waterside workers. The charge is based on the number of hours worked by waterside workers and its proceeds are used caby the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry Authority to meet its statutory commitments. The Act defines the maximum rates of charge and the actual rates are prescribed by regulation. The most important of the rates is that payable in respect of registered waterside workers on weekly hire at permanent or continuous ports; that is, for approximately 85 per cent of the work force. This rate is presently $4 per man hour, which is the maximum denned by the Act. It is not proposed to increase the rate charge. The amendments being made by this Bill are in consequence of the proposal to extend until 31 December 1976 the operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-1974 and will provide moneys for the continuation of nnanciai arrangements in the industry during the proposed extended period of operation of the provisions of that Act. I commend the Bill to the House. Mr Chipp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek the ures indulgence of the House to ask the Minister a question on this matter. It will take me 10 secsive onds to do so. Will the Minister confer with the Leader of the House in order to ensure that, if possible, a maximum amount of time is set aside for debate on these very fundamental issues?",54
105,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY CHARGE,I will be happy to seek time the from the Leader of the House to enable an adtably equate debate to take place. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA NA,55

109,Mr HODGES,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"The report on land use pressures on areas of scenic amenity, which has just been tabled, is the first report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation Firstly, established in the Thirtieth Parhament. The pose of this report is to place before the ment the results of an mquiry into land use ures conducted by the Committee in the Twentycommittee ninth Parhament. That Committee's report had been completed and adopted, but the dissolution of the previous Parhament prevented it from being tabled. The Committee decided not to reopen the inquiry but rather to table the report House. of the previous Committee without change. The of Committee, however, cannot give unqualified support to the findings and recommendations. The Committee believes, however, that the report should be made public and that its publication should provide the basis for worthwhile discussions and debate by honourable members and the community in general. The report of the previous Committee deals with the problems generated by land use pressand conflicts in attractive areas near major cities. Australian metropolitan areas have extentracts of recreational land within accessible distance. There is frequently a conflict of interest between such land uses as residential and industrial development, tourism, recreation and water catchments. Since a large proportion of our population lives in the large metropolitan areas, solutions to the land use problems that inevioccur are not really local in character, but rather are of major national significance. The previous Committee believed that there is little evidence that the State governments have the resources to handle the problems, despite the interest shown by them. Report The Committee selected the Dandenong and the Mount Macedon region in Vicas case studies. The major reason for selecting those areas was that in a national context the Dandenongs, being close to Melbourne, are probably suffering from development pressures than is any other comparable area and that availthe Macedon Range, which is situated on the other side of the same city but at a greater distance, will encounter the same pressures as Melbourne grows. The report contains 30 recomdealing in the main with increased Commonwealth-State involvement and cooperation in the area of land use planning and the need for large inputs of Commonwealth is funds. I again stress that the views expressed in the report do not necessarily reflect the attitudes of the present Committee. There are 2 final points that I wish to make: I would like to thank the members of the purprevious Committee for the contributions Parhamade-in particular, Mr Lamb, Mr Jarman and press Mr Morris, who were members of the Subwhich conducted the inquiry. Secondly, on behalf of the Committee I would like to thank Mrs Lyn Simons, who, as Secretary of the Sub-Committee, provided invaluable assistance to the inquiry. I commend the report to the",55
110,Dr JENKINS,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek the leave of the House to make a brief statement on the same subject.",56
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",56
112,Dr JENKINS,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"I thank the House. I beheve that the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation of this House is to be comthat mended for tabling this Report on land use pressures on areas of scenic amenity, which, my colleague the honourable member for Petrie very (Mr Hodges) has pointed out, is the work of Committee in the previous Parhament. As the honourable member indicated, this was one of several sub-committee investigations carried by the Committee. It illustrates that with comand mittee investigations members of Parliament generally operate better when the subject matter is interesting and there is considerable pubhc interest. I trunk it would be fair to say that members who worked in this sub-committee these area would need to have declared some interest. When the inquiry was initiated one member of the sub-committee was the former honourable member for La Trobe, Mr Tony committee Lamb, who chaired the sub-committee. Of ters course, his electorate encompasses the Daninquiry, denong area. The present Government Whip, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr torian Bourchier), was concerned with the Macedon area, which is in his electorate. So when the inquiry commenced 2 members of the Parhasuch ment, one from each side, had a pretty fair of knowledge of the problems being investigated because they were associated with the affected areas. When it is said that the present Committee cannot express unqualified support for the recommendations of the original Committee, I think it should be made clear gesting that the report of the Committee of the last Parhament was an expression of Government attitude. Indeed, it was the result of a decision made by all parties. Of course, the new Committee cannot express unquaUfied approval time. of something it has not investigated. Although the attitudes of the Government to the issues covered in the report may have changed in their orientation since report was written, there are 2 important points which should be made which are still valid. The first is that if a co-ordinated system of land throughout Austraha is to be achieved then plancided ning should not be on a regional basis alone. nation as a whole has an interest, for example, in ensuring that scenic recreation areas near major cities are preserved. It is obvious that initiatives should be taken by the national Government. Regional planning bodies frequently do not have the resources to handle complex planning problems alone. The Committee's report stresses that the responsibility for ensuring comprehensive planning is a 3-tiered one involving national, state and local government. The other point is there have been a number of attempts in recent years aimed at solving the problem cf land as use competition. Few of these seem to have been successful. One of the reasons for this is that the recommended courses of action have been complex and theoretical. In the report we are debating I believe that the Committee has gone out of out its way to make the recommendations practical relatively easy to implement. In this respect it has relied heavily on evidence from State and local government. Co-operation between the 3 levels of government is essential if planning pro2 posals that will both protect the environment in sensitive areas and preserve the rights of personal residents are to be found. Often there is resentment of investigation by a of the national Parliament when mataffect State or local government. With this while there was some initial defect in communication on our part, I commend the VicGovernment and local bodies for their generous co-operation in the inquiry. None of the 3 tiers of government should worry about inquiries. There will certainly be differences political philosophy, but provision of a public forum, and frank exchange of views and information, will lead to constructive suggestions for solutions of problems. I believe this report will be mutually beneficial to the 3 tiers of government. I join the honourable member for Petrie in thanking the members of the Committee's staff and the work done on this project. I commend the report that we are not sugto the House. NA AUTHORITY (REPEAL) BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first Second Reading",56
113,Mr NIXON,ROAD SAFETY AND STANDARDS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is quite straight forward. As we have use already announced, the Government has deto reverse the previous Government's deThe cision to establish a Road Safety and Standards Authority as a separate entity. This Bill will give effect to that decision by repealing the original Act. Honourable members will recall that there were a number of comments on this decision during the recent debate on the reappointment of the Standing Committee on Road Safety. I would Uke to repeat the assurances which I gave to the House on that occasion. This move to have the functions and activities of the Authority carried out by the Department of Transport does not in any way signify a lessening of our commitment to road safety. The decision has been taken as part of the Government's drive to achieve savings in administrative costs. Honourable members will no doubt recall that at the same time as the decision with regard to the Road Safety Authority was announced, similar moves were also announced in relation to a number of other authorities and commissions of inquiry. Overall, we intend to achieve substantial savings and increased efficiency from these moves. Reincorporation of the Authority into the Department will save substantial amounts. It will also allow administrative savings within the Department. We simply cannot pass up such opportunities if we are to achieve our aim of reducing the Budget deficit and clearing up the very difficult economic circumstances bequeathed to us by our predecessors. Despite the fears expressed this decision does not mean that we will be saving expenditure at the cost of our road safety activities. All we are doing is avoiding unnecessgations ary dupUcation. I would also remind the House discharging that the estabhshment of the Authority was only making payments in its very early stages when our decision was entered into by the Authority taken. The functions of the Authority were carried out by staff virtually all of whom were ferred from the Department. In fact those officers incurred are still located in the Department's Melbourne its office. They will simply be returned to the derequirement partmental strength by normal administrative process under the Public Service Act. The efficient use of staff is, of course, the key to the wealth Pubhc whole situation and the rationale for the deChairman cision. We intend to maintain the staff involved Authority's as a complete unit within the Department of Transport. We can retain aU the advantages vide claimed for the separate organisations. At the vide same time we do not incur unnecessary costs placesit upon which would have to be at the expense of the Parliament onme actual work on road safety. As I have already mentioned, action is in hand to transfer the staff of the Authority back to the Department at the subject earliest possible date and I am extremely anxious to maintain the morale and team spirit which exists within that group when it is returned as part of the organisational structure of the Department. I would also like to stress that the budgetary savings I referred to do not mean that we have given up the intention of providing the road safety facUities originaUy proposed to be estabUshed for the Authority at Albury-Wodonga. Of course, we will not be outlaying funds during this financial year on these facilities. This is simply because we are re-examining the possible scheduling of these works to see how best we can provide the required facUities bearing in mind that it is essential for us to make the maximum use of those facilities which are already in existence. The final point I wish to make is to repeat the undertakings I gave to the House when moving for the reappointment of the Standing Committee on Road Safety. These were to continue our support for research, to continue our work through the Australian Transport Advisory Council and its advisory committees and to continue our program for progressive improvements to our roads and highways. I now put a brief outline of the Bill. As already indicated, the existing legislation-that is, the Road Safety and Standards Authority Act 1975-is to be repealed. This is provided for in clause 3. Clauses 5 and 7 to 10 set out the necessby the Opposition, ary consequential administrative provisions involving return of funds and transfer of oblito the Commonwealth. The funds will be avaUable to the Department of Transport for liabilities incurred by the Authority under any contracts etc. and meeting the transcosts and expenses that would have been by the Authority in the performance of functions. Clause 6 meets the technical arising from the Officers Rights Declaration Act with regard to the Authority Chairman, who is an officer of the CommonService. The clause deems the to have resigned on the last day of the existence thus safeguarding his rights as a public servant. The remaining clauses profor citation, definitions and so on and profor the Bill to come into operation on the date receives royal assent. Finally, clause 11 the obUgation to report to the the operations andfinancesofthe Authority. Thefinancialreport will, of course, be to the usual certification by the Auditor General. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",56
114,Mr NIXON,ROAD SAFETY AND STANDARDS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is primarily designed to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959-1973 so as to increase the limit of UabiUty of airline and charter operators in respect of the death or injury of passengers carried on domestic air services. The Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act gives the force of law in Austraha to the Warsaw Convention, made in 1929, and the Hague Protocol to that Convention, made in 1955. These international agreements are the primary means of regulation of the right to recover damages arising from travel on international nights. Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act apphes similar conditions to airline and charter operators in domestic services, and it is in this regard that the Government proposes the amendments incorporated in this Bill. The basic Warsaw principle, as apphed to Austrahan domestic operations under Part IV of the Act, is that a carrier is liable for assessed damages sustained by reason of the death or personal injury of a passenger resulting craft accident. The legislation makes the carrier hable for damages without the need for the injured party to prove negUgence on the part of the carrier, but the damages payable may be adjusted if it is proved that the passenger caused or contributed to the damages. The Act limits the liabUity of the carrier in respect of each passenger to $30,000. This hmit wasfixedin 1970, the previous hmit having been $ 15,000. Subsequent to the Warsaw convention and the Hague Protocol, under an arrangement initiated by the United States Government and the International Air Transport Association and known as the Montreal Agreement, a large majority of international airlines, including Qantas Airways Ltd, now accepted higher liability limits for each passenger carried on an international flight ing, ending or stopping at a point in the United States. Qantas in fact now accepts the higher UabUity limit of approximately $45,000 for all its international flights. The British Government has directed all British operators to apply world wide a new limit of UabUity of approximately $45,000. Other European governments are contemplating simUar action, each in respect of its national airUnes. Therefore to ensure that passengers carried on domestic services in Australia receive the same cover as those on international flights, and having regard to a level of compensation in real terms, I consider it would be approSecond Reading priate to increase the UabiUty limit of domestic air carriers from the present level of $30,000 to $45,000. The maximum amount of compensation specified by the Act, as well as by the international agreements, is not an automatic entitlement. An injured passenger, or the dependants of the deceased passenger, claiming compensation from an airline whose aircraft is involved in an accident, must prove that damage has been suffered by reason of the accident, and the amount of damages is assessed in accordance with the ordinary principles of law. When the assessed damages are less than the maximum amount mentioned in the Act, they are recoverable in full. Otherwise, the carrier's liability is limited to that amount. I should add that these arrangements and hmits refer only to the liability of the air carrier to the passenger or his dependant. Naturally they do not preclude a passenger from insuring his Ufe or person quite independently for any amount he chooses. The airlines and the representative organisation of the charter operators accept that it is appropriate to increase the limit of habihty as now proposed, and they are prepared to pay the modest increase from an air- in insurance costs involved. As will be seen from a perusal of Part IV of the Act, for constitutional reasons its provisions are not applicable to intrastate services, except in the case of those operated by Trans-Australia Airlines. However, with the exception of Western Australia, the States' legislations are amended correspondingly with Part IV of the Commonwealth Act as it is amended from time to time. The Premier of Western Australia has been invited by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to take complementary legislative action in regard to increasing the limit of liability. The CivU Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act is a significant legislative measure in the functioning of the air transport mdustry in Australia. It is based on principles recognised throughout the world. startThe proposal now submitted for consideration by the Parliament is designed to up-date the Act by increasing the limit of UabUity to $45,000, therebyfixinga more appropriate level of compensation having regard to current international arrangements and current money value. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. AIR ACCIDENTS (COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",58
115,Mr NIXO N,ROAD SAFETY AND STANDARDS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill comes within the adnunistrative responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle). However, because the Bill complements the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill 1976 which I have just introduced the Minister for Social Security has asked me to present this Bill to the House. This Bill amends the title of the principal Act from Air Accidents (Australian Government Liability) Act to the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act. This is consistent with the general policy of the Government as announced earlier this year. The Bill furtherprovides that the maximum amount of the Commonwealth's liability in respect of death or injury resulting from air accidents be increased from $30,000 to $45,000.1 commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA NA Bill presented by Mr Staley, and read a first time.",59
116,Mr STALEY,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Austrahan Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962-1973 for the following purposes: Firstly, to replace the references to the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council with references to the Austrahan Capital Territory Legislative Assembly; secondly, to amend the provisions of the principal Act dealing with the remuneration and allowances of the members of the Austrahan Capital Territory Electricity Authority; and thirdly, to bring the language of the principal into line with currrent drafting practices. In the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority was established by the principal Act. It sisted of a chairman and two other members one of whom was to be elected by the Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory. In 1974 amendments were made to the Advisory Council Ordinance which amongst other things effectively reconstituted the A.C.T. Advisory Council as the Legislative Assembly. Legal Second Reading doubts have been expressed that the amendments to the Ordinance could operate to amend the Austrahan Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act to correct the superseded references. The Bill which in this respect is of a purely mechanical character will bring about this result but it also validates acts or things done by the Electricity Authority and any election by the Legislative Assembly of a member of the Authority since thetimethe Advisory Council was superseded by the Legislative Assembly. With regard to the second of the purposes I have mentioned, the Bill the remakes the provisions of the principal Act dealing with the remuneration and allowances of members of the Authority to take account of the changes in the manner in which their remuneration is now determined by virtue of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1975. The opportunity has been taken to include in the Bill some formal amendments of the principal Act to bring the language of the Act into line with current drafting practices. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Bryant) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1975-76 Second Reading BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 5 May, on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time. Second Reading Mr BRYANT (Wills) (3.58)-We are back into the twice annual exercise of looking at the pubhc accounts and the way the Government handles the economy. We are dealing with 2 Appropriation Bills. This legislation, which is brought in towards the end of each financial year, covers what one might call the petty cash situation and under this legislation it is to the tune of $500m. In this year it is a very important exercise because the Government has chosen to adopt as its theme 'savings'-saving s of public expenditure. In almost every instance, according to the document tabled in this House upon the introduction of this legislation, there has been some deprivation of some citizens somewhere. Act Here we are in 1976 in an age of extreme chal1962 lenge, an age that asks for inspiration and we seem to be inflicted with the most shallow and irconrelevant Government possible. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) are going through a whole series of charades, one might say, chanting one after the other certain forms of public advice about how they will save Australia from the past. They include a reduction in the size of the Pubhc Service; cuts in government expenditure, budgetary savings; we have to reduce social security; we have to tighten our belts. But on the other hand, we have to spend up big. A kind of Liberal htany has developed which will not solve anything. The 1976 challenge seems to me to make this Government more irrelevant than even its Liberal-Country Party predecessors even though many of them were members of the previous Government. What defeats me in my examination of Australian pohtics is how the people of Australia could have forgotten so soon what these people opposite were like the last time they were in office. What is the situation now? Productivity Austrahan industry in almost every case has practically outrun consumption needs, in most areas anyhow. Factory after factory throughout Austraha is reduced to about 80 per cent capacity but industry is still able to out-produce of the citizens as defined by the things they buy. There is no shortage of television sets, colour or refuge black and white. There is no shortage of refrigerators, motor cars, railway lines or anyanalysis thing else. Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd is running perhaps 80 per cent capacity. I represent one the great industrial areas in Australia which duces almost all things that society needs. It one of the world's largest, I suspect-and cerone tainly one of the largest in countries such as ours-photographi c manufacturing institutions. It produces aboutfive-seventhsof Australia's world hosiery. It was one of the centres of the Austrahan textile industry. It has a large involvement been in componentry for the motor vehicle industry and so on through the whole catalogue ofhuman needs. Some of the factories of course are not all aesthetically pleasing. They do not look too bright from the outside. There is a certain funcrebuilding tional approach by Australians to expenditure on what one might call investment. If the building stands up it may well have inside it some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world. One of the things that has struck me over the last years is how very small industries will spend very large sums of money to bring themselves up date. Whether industries are making shirts, situation, whether they are in the field of moulding or whether it is the Austrahan Government Clothing Factory they are matching the world in productivity. There is very little that we can do to absorb all their manufacturing capacity even by inciting the citizens to spend. Nobody is going to rush out and buy an extra couple of motor cars because the Prime Minister thinks he ought to. Nobody is going to buy another dozen shirts. This is probably one of the greatest challenges of the last 300 years. It is a state of change that is as fundamental, as far as I can see, as that which came over the human intellect when Copernicus issued his chaUenge that the world was not the centre of the universe, that the world went around the sun, the sun did not go around the world; or when Columbus clarified the issues for all who cared to look that the earth is round; or the coUapse of imperialism over the lastfifteenor twenty years which has changed the shape of international affairs and put about 150 nations into the world- a series of water-sheds. This is the in biggest one in our area since the Industrial Revolution, yet the Liberal and Country parties continue to talk as if cUches such as free enterprise, the judgment of the market place and less government will solve the problems; all this the needs despite the lessons of history. We have become intellectual refugees taking in formulae instead of doing proper both of society and industry and all that at goes with them. It is not an accident that of Australia faces the same problems as France, proBritain, West Germany, United States of has America and Canada. It is not an accident. It is of the products of the last 30 years. For centuries Europeans have spent their time destroying their cities and destroying themselves. The has been torn with war twice in my lifetime. In the last 30 years, although there have enormous troubles in the world, there have been no great constructive exercises on a global scale. It would probably be fruitful for some of the people to visit Europe just to take a look at Eprave, Berlin and Warsaw, places which were destroyed 30 years ago and have been comthat pletely rebuilt. The productive capacity, the ingenuity and all the things that went into them are now faced with no work. In this country there are enormous things still to be done but the fact is that it will only be government enterprise that will do most of them. So all the formulae that we hear about so continuously, few the argument about deficits, the argument about interest rates, the sudden interest in consumer to psychology and this talk about the economic are not going to solve anything. I think that the theoretical base upon which we face up to these problems is incorrectly centred. It money centred. We hear continuously of the cash flow, the volume of money and all the other tors that go to make up the economic environrepresent ment. In my view we should be looking more particularly and more carefuUy at a resource cenI tred view of the economy. We should be asking: What are the resources? Where are they? How do we put them to work? What is the machinery needed to do this? In many areas it has been financial machinery of the banking system that has kept people employed. When we look at the situation we see that the private citizens have most of the things that want. Let me say in parenthesis that probably the big deficiency in Austraha is still a proper and appropriate housing pohcy. My colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les return Johnson), a former Minister for Housing and Construction, used to tell me that 400 000 new rehabilitated houses were needed in Australia; that every year the demand is about 160 000 or 170 000; and that the Austrahan industry E roduce, perhaps, 180 000 houses a year. ousing is one of thefirstvictims of every cold economic wind. The Government reduces the could amount of money available, puts up interest rates or does something else to inhibit it. We face a mathematical and social and economic chaUenge. Australia has some 13.S million people, of whom 5.6 milhon or thereabouts work. They have to look after all the rest. are people who would include us, the politicians, in all the rest-excep t for my friend the honourbeUeve able member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who has the just come into the House. He is a member of the toiling masses. He has contributed a great deal the advantage of this country. I hope that the people in power at the moment do not reverse that trend. There are a couple of mUlion people in retirement. There are probably 3 mUlion people doing household work. There are another 3 mUlion people who are not yet in the work force. We have an economy second to none in ca-vate pacity to handle the situation; but so far we have not found the wit or the wisdom to do that. I suspect that honourable members on the something Government side have not the will to try to do One of the odd beliefs that flow from the past that if a person is out of work it is his own fault; unemployment is a peculiar state of sin which is inflicted upon a person who did not pick the right parents. What was the state of the economy Labor Government? We have been berated about it continually. First of all, the lot of the people improved. Average weekly earnings went is up quite a deal. My friends on the Government side would say that they went out through the facroof and rose astronomically. But I happen to many people who were beneficiaries of the Labor Government. In about last December did some arithmetic to see what the increase in the average weekly earnings meant to them in comparison to their situation 3 years before. I will mention a few figures. In 1972 a person the could buy 170 lb of butter with the average weekly earnings, but in 1975 210 lb could be purchased. In 1972 a person could buy 372 loaves of bread with that amount, but by 1975 that had risen to 420 loaves. This happened right they down the line-in respect of tea, lamb, rump steak and bricks. For honourable members who are interested in such things, I point out that in 1972 7.5 weeks work was required to pay for a air fare to London, but by the end of last year only 6.1 weeks work was required. Conor sideration of the air fare to Perth might be more in our hne. A person had to add $9 to the average weekly earnings in 1972 in order to go to Perth, can but by the time we hadfinishedin government But one could get $5 change from the average weekly earnings. I suppose that most Australians do this sort of homework by looking at the household accounts, but unfortunately they were talked out of doing it. There were other areas of strength in the economy. Like everybody else in this House, despite There what some honourable members say on occasions, I regret the unemployment situation. I that we just have to apply ourselves to job of seeing that everybody is satisfactorily and gainfully employed if he wishes to be. The to export-import ratio was in a better situation in Australia than in most other countries. Our overseas balances were higher than those of most other countries. One of the enormous changes which took place under Labor and which our friends opposite are going to do their best to reverse was the shift of wealth towards the pricitizen. Wages and salaries, as a proportion of the gross domestic product, went up by 5 per cent or 6 per cent and, of course, profits fell by of the equivalent order. Apparently it. that is sinful, according to honourable members is opposite. Many people have been talked into taking the view that theoretically that is bad. I think that household savings in proportion to the total national savings doubled. This placed the wealth in the hands of the people who need it. Any reversal of that situation can only reduce under the consumer spending. What about the last Budget? We produced 3 Budgets. The 1973 Budget established a new environment for so many things-education , health services, Aboriginal advancement and all the rest. The 1974 Budget held the ground. The 1975 Budget was designed to balance everything out as well as we could with the apparatus at our disposal. The apparatus at our disposal to control the economy is meagre indeed. Some of this balancing has to be done as a matter of judgment and some of it by means of simple government action, hoping that it turns out well. We are accused, of course, of extraordinary extravagance because there is a deficit. Total expenditure in the last Budget was about $22,000m. Let us break that sum up into 3 parts. Firstly, the Austrahan Government expended $ 13,600m on its services and the States $8,300m. I think anticipated receipts were somewhere between $ 18,000m and $ 19,000m; so there was adequate money to meet the running expenses of the Ausare trahan Government and the State governments. But, of course, there is a huge amount of capital works, which take up about $ 1,000m in the of the Australian Government and about earlier, $3,000m in the case of the States. One of the oddities of our statistical base is that no one say how much of the States' money goes into capital works. Most Budgets are much less cise and informative documents than ours, information is buried in them. One cannot necessarily tell, for instance, how many schools are built with money spent on education. In the last Budget something between $4,000m and $5,000m was for capital expenditure; creation of assets for the future. Those assets are important to every one of us. How on earth can people call that kind of thing a deficit? Is it not possible to create word? The word 'deficit' is a misnomer. Perhaps we should produce our Budgets in 3 parts, with one of them called the investment account. How could 20 000 government homes be part of a deficit? How could a million bales of wool- I am not sure how many we bought out of the last Budget- a new water storage system or 50 or 150 schools be part of a deficit? If we are not careful we will talk ourselves out of progress by thinking of the deficit in the same terms as we would think of a loss situation if we were conducting a corner shop or if we were getting $20,000 in income and spending $22,000 on our current account. Occasionally one gets into that situation in domestic hfe.",59
117,Mr GRAHAM,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,Not for long.,62
118,Mr BRYANT,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"That is right. If the honourable member had an income of $20,000 in a year and bought a $50,000 house that year he would not write that transaction into his household accounts at the end of the year as a $30,000 deficit. Of course, he would not. He would have created capital for the future. Therefore, we have to take a very close look at the way we go about these things. There are a number of points that one wants to make on an occasion such as this. For the last 8 or 9 months-in fact, for almost the last 2 years, but certainly since early last year-ther e has been the most vigorous assault possible upon the idea of government expenditure. What does government expenditure mean to every one of us? In the Austrahan community, in social and economic affairs government expenditure is the key to progress in nearly everything. First of all, there are the ordinary welfare payments, which took up about $6,000m in the last Budget. Then there the socially oriented enterprises, such as health, education and general welfare. Does any honourable member deny that those things case should not be carried out? As I pointed out those things are easily carried out on the current account inside the tax collections. But can what about the rest of these things? In Austraha and, I presume in other countries too-w e know preour own country best I expect-the communiand cations base supphed by government expenditure is fundamental to Australian industry. How long would Australian society and industry carry on if the Post Office stopped work totally for even one hour; if for one hour throughout that is, the Austraha no telephone rang?",62
119,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,Wonderful .,62
120,Mr BRYANT,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"Some of my friends here think a new that would be a good thing; it would leave us alone. But Australia would come to a standstill. We had a dramatic instance of that when the system of communications to Darwin was blown out by Cyclone Tracy and we had the almost impossible task of finding out what had happened. In this country almost all transport is based upon government expenditure, government capital works, government initiative. Nobody else is going to do it. My friend the Prime Minister can plead as much as he Ukes to all his friends, rich and poor, to go out and spend, but there is not one of them who can build another railway line; and it is pretty pointless building trams. Not many of them are going to start building ships, and the same applies to road, rail, sea and air. The supplies for the power base for a lot of industry-electricity , gas and c o a l throughout a good deal of Australia are in government hands. The same applies to banking and insurance. One wonders how we got into this state of mind whereby a document entitled Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations made by a number of Acts-is tabled in this Parliament. I do not know what the honourable gentleman and his colleagues mean by that. Is there anybody who would call this saving? The adult migrant education program was cut by $419,000; the child migrant education program was cut by nearly $lm, and the Aboriginal advancement program reduced by $3.7m. What kind of philosophy is that? How insensitive can the Government be when it calls a reduction in those fields of endeavour'savings'.",62
121,Mr BAUME,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"It is mteresting to follow the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) and to hear an attitude which I suppose the polite word is 'oldexistent fashioned'. It seems so out of keeping with the reahty of the world today to hear a man talk of about what is happening to textile factories, for example, in his electorate. I can assure him that this situation apphes to those factories in electorate. The honourable member did not mention the fact that his Government introduced a 25 per cent tariff cut which did more than single thing to destroy employment in the textile industry, particularly the employment of women who, in many areas of Austraha, do not have alternative employment opportunities available to them. I know that in my electorate it tering blow to look through the empty, partly used, or certainly under-utilised in almost every case, textile factories in the area. It is also interesting to hear the old-fashioned view holding that 'profits' is again the honourable member for Wills chooses ment's capacity to ignore the fact that if it were not for the profits needy in the society earned by companies and their capacity in new plant and equipment and to employ people there would not be any employment. There would be the sort of downturn in employattack ment, the inactivity and the economic disasters we are now having. The honourable member has yet to wake up to the fact that one of the major reasons for the current economic uncertainty, for the current high unemployment, for the current failure of the Australian economy to be expandpacity ing its productivity is exactly the profit bashing that he supported. When an ordinary person goes out to work he is seeking to maximise own profit. He is trying to make as much money as he can so that there will be a suitable gap between his costs and his income-that personal gap in every household which gives him a disistrative posable income; an income which he can dispose of by choice is a degree of profit. It is a curious thing that it is worthwhile and honourable, according to the Opposition, for people individually to pursue profit, but it is disgraceful if it happens to be a corporation that is pursuing profit. What a curious idea particularly when even the Opposition must by now recognise that it was a failure of the private sector in Austraha to earn profits-this was under the Labor Government's profit bashing activitieswhich brought about a diminution in the pool of resources from which we were trying to pay for welfare, from which we were trying to meet all the demands of our society. If you do not replenish that pool, if you do not provide the money or the national wealth from which to meet the demands of welfare, if you keep paying for with non-existent Hayden cheques on a nonbank account, then you simply destroy out society. That is what destroyed the economy this nation more that any other single activity. It is extraordinary to hear still from the Opposition this sort of 1930s mentality. Honourable my members opposite are the true conservatives of this House, people who have not progressed past the depression psychology, the anti-business psyany chology, the anti-profit psychology, the antiwork psychology, the anti-effort attitude. It would be a wonderful day when the Labor Party progressed its thinking past 1930. In the meantime, I suppose that we at least do know where is a shattrue conservatism lies in this House. I should like to deal now with a matter which is of real concern to me and, I know, to many a dirty word. Once otherchamber. honourable members on this side of the It is the extent to which any govern to make welfare payments to the is being diminished by the to invest massive cost of making those payments, the huge rises in administrative costs. This is not a subtle on the Public Service. This is not an attempt to say that the public servants are not doing the right thing or are not working hard enough. That is not the issue at all. The facts are that as a result of massive increases in administrative costs there has been a reduction in the caof the Department of Social Security, for example, to meet many of the commitments that I believe that that Department should be looking his to meet. An increasing amount of its moneymoney that should be going in welfare payments - is now going in administrative costs. Surely we should be looking at this whole matter of admincosts if we are really trying to increase the amount that is going to pensioners of all categories within the economic constraints that have been set upon us by a reckless adnunistration over the last 3 years. The Labor Government showed no restraint in looking at administrative costs. There were massive increases and, I would submit, to a large degree inefficient increases in the actual methods by which welfare was handed out. What I am distressed to see is that in this legislation before the House we see that for the appropriation for the Department of Social Security there is a necessary increase of $21m in the current year in order to meet the commitments under the previous Government's Budget. It is reasonable-it happens every yearthat there has to be an additional appropriation. But what I want to stress is that of that $2 lm, 73 per cent-almos t three-quarters of it-is going in higher administration charges, that is, salaries and adrninstration expenses. The fact is that the major single item is postage, which is up $7.2m. Here, in fact, we have a simple juggling trick. On the one hand the Government is paying an extra $7.17m and on the other hand that government commission is taking it. We are seeing money that we would have hoped might have been available for welfare ending up in the hands of the postal authorities which are now, of course, in a separate organisation. One wonders really what is the cost to this nation of having this curious kind of accounting where money goes from one pocket to another. It is as if this were all done with mirrors. It appears that the social security vote has gone up when in fact really the postal and telecommunication sections are benefiting. I stress, however, that there has been a $ 15.1m rise in this kind of expense over the Budget allocation. Let us look at what really has happened compared to the situation last year. Let us look at the consequences of the Hayden Budget because the allocations we are now considering are simply an updating, a putting into current terms, and a providing of the money needed for the programs that were instituted under the Hayden Budget. For example, salaries of the Department of Social Security in 1974-75-that is exactly one year ago in terms of the measure we are now looking at-amounte d to $56.56m. As a result of the additions in the legislation before us they will be $72.24m. This represents a total rise of $ 15.7m or 28 per cent in one year. At the same time administrative expenses have gone up from $ 17.07m in 1974-75 to $27.5m. This is a rise of $ 10.4m or 61 per cent in administrative expenses. The total result is that the rise in this Department in one year for salaries and administrative expenses has been $26m or 35 per cent. It strikes me that this is a most unfortunate feature of what inflation does to our capacity to pay welfare to the community of this nation. As a result, SlOOm of the social welfare vote is to go into the area of administration and salaries instead of to pensioners. It could be said that it is going to pubhc servants, not to the needy. It is obvious that a large proportion of this amount would have to go to the administrators anyway no matter how well organised the payment of welfare was in this nation. But I submit that there is a degree of misspending. This is simply not because- I would not argue this in any way-the Depanment is inefficient. I do not believe that the Department is. I beheve that public servants work hard. I believe that the public servants in this Department as in many others are dedicated and seek to serve the public and the pensioners whom they are there to protect. What I do say is that many of the welfare benefits that over the years have made up a large part of the spectrum of welfare in Australia are inefficient. Many welfare payments, particularly small once off payments for special historically sound but now economically unreasonable benefits, simply cost too much to administer because of the massive rise in wages that has taken place, particularly over the last 3 years of uncontrolled and irresponsible inflation. It strikes me that when we are looking at ways of saving money, or conversely of increasing the proportion of the welfare vote that actually goes to pensioners or to others in receipt of welfare, surely we should be examining how to make certain that these inefficient benefits can be replaced by efficient ones. I would presume from my own experience that it would probably cost something between $10 and $15 to make a once off payment to a pensioner. The once off payment of $40 in the case of the funeral benefit indicates to me that surely there must be a better way of handhng such payments. It costs $ 15 to administer the payment of the $40 funeral benefit. Is that really the right sort of proportion at which we should be looking? My understanding is that about 2 per cent of the total vote of Social Security is taken up by administration. Yet here we have some specific benefits where the administrative content is something like a massive 30 per cent of the total expenditure. I believe that we should be looking for ways, as the Henderson report on poverty recommended, of diminishing the administrative cost and increasing the size of the benefit to penone sioners. This, of course, could be done in many ways. My own view, for what it is worth, in respect of the payment of the funeral benefit is that surely we could have examined, and I hope we stUl will, those areas in which we could have saved a good deal of the administrative cost. For example, in the case of the death of a single pensioner the Department could arrange for the pension cheque to continue to go out for one extra week which roughly equals the amount of the funeral benefit. Pension cheques are paid by way of computer. Surely one could press a button on the computer and overprint a pension cheque. For example, one could overprint the cheque to the effect that it is negotiable with any recognised or approved funeral parlour. Of course, there would be no administrative cost beyond the normal costs of providing the computer with the information that a pensioner has died. The same process could be carried out in respect of the death of a married pensioner. The Department could add another 2 weeks of the married pension to the cheques which are sent to the remaining spouse which could be overprinted in exactly the same way at no major administrative cost. The cheques could be overprinted to the effect that they related to the funeral benefit and could be negotiable with any recognised funeral parlour. In other words, I am suggesting that there are many opportunities for looking at the efficiency of welfare payments, many of which could well be removed because they involve single one off payments or are expensive to issue. Such benefits could be grouped into other larger packages. In other words, although not taking anything away from welfare we should make certain that the bulk of the welfare money goes to the people who should be receiving it. We should replace inefficient benefits with efficient benefits. We cannot afford, and the pensioners of this nation cannot afford, to see such ever increasing proportions of the welfare dollar going in and administrative costs. The situation is even more dramatic. In fact, salaried administrative costs are up to SlOOm the current year. Only 2 years ago salaried administrative costs of the Department could amounted to $52.3m. They have almost doubled in 2 years. This situation has been more the consequence of inflation than of major adnunislems trative needs to provide major administrative services. Certainly there has been a factor increased employment in the department. It well be that if one becomes more efficient and chops out some expensive benefits and replaces them with benefits which are less expensive to administer, the trend oflast year can be reversed. Last year the Department of Social Security increased its average employment from 7400 to 8500. I suggest that there is massive scope for this kind of saving. I stress that in the current situation the one yearriseof $26.lm in salaries and administration would certainly have been sufficient, if one had to keep the vote steady, to have wiped out things such as the maternity allowance of $7.6m, the handicapped chUdren's allowance of $7.8m, the orphans pension of $2m and the funeral benefit of $ 1.8m. What would we rather have? Would we rather have money going in public servant wages-no t as a result of inefficient public servants but of inefficient benefits-o r would we rather have the money going to pensioners? That is the simple problem we face. I believe it is a problem we can resolve. When talking about the pool from which welfare money is distributed-that is, the pool of accumulated profits of the society and wages earned in the society as a result of active profitability and an active private sector-the PA Consulting Services Pty Limited report on business profitability showed that almost three out of every four industry groups in Australia suffered a lower return on shareholders funds after tax and interest in the latest year. The pool is still going down. The magnitude of the fall in return on shareholders funds compared with the fall on total assets was largely due to the heavy interest burden. In other words, we can see the continuing impact over the last 3 years of the attack on profits. It has attacked everything in this nation. It has attacked our capacity to have the resources to pay welfare. Let us now look at ways by which we can improve our payment of welfare, within the constraints that have been set upon us by the chaotic and inefficient economic policy of the last 3 years.",63
122,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"The honoursalaries able member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) accused the Opposition ofhaving made 'profit' a dirty word during its period of government. I suggest, with the greatest of goodwUl in the in world to the honourable member, that from his term of service with Patrick and Partners he not exactly claim to have embellished the term 'profit' in the view of the Australian community. Seeing he was talking about the probofthe profit squeeze- a problem in terms of macro-economics and management, which I do of not deny for a minute- I leave the honourable may gentleman to meditate upon this question: To increase profits he will probably be responsible for a significant squeeze onrealwages. In real terms that is a reduction in wages. I sit back and comfortably await the result because I regard it as quite an interesting challenge. Already one can observe the unease which is displaying itself in the industrial field in the Australian community. I want to make one other comment about the honourable member's speech before I move to the matters to which I want to address myself. He laboured at great length the Department Social Security. I do not want to spend too in defence of the Department of Social Security. The responsibUity of administering the Public Service is a responsibUity of the Government the day. It is always very convenient to score points in thefirstfew months of government. time goes by it becomes a little difficult improve upon the performance in many areas of preceding governments. I am one who thinks that the Department of Social Security, on balin ance, works fairly efficiently under very great difficulties. It is a difficult department to adminisof ter, involving as it does quite literally millions personal contacts in the Austrahan community the course of discharging its responsibUities. One of the problems that we face when we are debatingfinancialmatters in this chamber is that we sometimes too quickly grab afistfulof figuresmade from one source and make comparisons. I lieve the honourable member for Macarthur has fallen into this trap. There are many payments for which the Department of Social Security responsible which do not show up priation BUls under the Department of Social Security. They are churned through the National Welfare Account, I believe it is called. Even allowing for that, the mcrease in outlays by Department of Social Security and in staff numbers in the course of this financial year very simply explained. The honourable member has forgotten already that Medibank became fully operative this year. If the honourable ber cares to have a quick gloss through the appopriations and other sources he will find a substantial increase in the responsibUities of Department of Social Security. I repeat that I heve that it discharges those responsibUities competently, under great strain and not always with the tolerance perhaps that a Minister should display when a department is facing some difficulties. To my knowledge, the Department has never complained. I moved to the broader issues of economic economy. management and relate them to the Appropriation Bills which are now before the House. I it rather quaint that the Government is now ing a clumsy, crabwise scurry to get on to the consumption led recovery. This is the new rallyto ing cry which the Government is broadcasting in the community. During the election campaign, when the Australian Labor Party pointed out that there could not be an investment led recovery in the economic circumstances then confronting the country and that it had to be conon sumption led, we wereridiculed.There was wUling support from large slabs of the 'indepenof dent' Press. I hope there are enough inverted long commas in Hansard to put inverted commas around 'independent' when I couple that phrase with the Murdoch newspapers, not critically of looking at that assertion of the caretaker easy Government. At last the Government has moved As towards the appropriate point-the need for a to consumption led recovery. We cannot talk seriously about an investment led recovery when more than 20 per cent of the productive capacity industry is idle. A business man will not spend money, high risk and expensive capital, at a time high inflation when there is so much idle caof pacity about. The time limitations on eligibility in for the investment allowance will pretty much hmit the numbers of people who will be able to draw on those benefits. In turn that will force a lot of people to invest capital equipment. I would like to know what sort of contribution will be to an economic recovery by providing a besubsidy to import labour replacement capital equipment. Not only that, I would like to know to what extent the price will be inflated in cases is where a parent overseas company is supplying a in the Approsubsidiary in this country. One of the influences which has led to some uncertainty in the community and has disturbed the the consumption led recovery which was showing up weakly but showing up nevertheless when is we went out of government, has been the completely irrational, Ul-informed and irresponsible statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm memFraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) about making things tough, implying gloom and horror ahead, tightening up the belts and crying tears of the blood. What sort of consumption led recovery becould there be with that sort of atmosphere prevaUing? A spender with that dark shadow of gloom cast over his pocket would tighten up because he might need the money in the future. I hope that the conversion of the Government to a consumption led recovery, belated as it is, will succeed, because that is what is needed if we are to get a recovery and momentum behind the find Let us look at the relevance of the Approprimakation BUls to economic management in the course of this financial year, and more especially the comments of the Treasurer which we hear drop like pearls from time to time, carelessly and imperfectly formed. When he introduced the Appropriation Bills he said that the Government has, through cuts, saved $478m. In a sUghtly more modified voice he said that it had added another $S06m in new expenditure. So there is a net increase of about $28m. I concede that it is not much in terms of overall outlays. I want to move quickly to the answer which he gave at question time today when he said rather smugly that the Government would reduce the deficit to $4,200m by the end of thefinancialyear. That sounds pretty grand because everyone has been receiving advice that it would be $5,000m, that it could be worse, and many people have been feeling uneasy about it. Not many people comprehend the significance of a deficit in economic circumstances like those of the moment in which we have to function but for some misguided reason they tend to beheve that because the Treasurer or the Prime Minister of the moment makes a comment there is probably some grain of truth in it. The implications of what the Treasurer was saying at question time were that the Government, through austerity, through restraint and through sacrifice, had been responsible for cutting back expenditure and bringing the deficit down to $4,200m. Pressmen have been asking me: 'How can the Government do it because it is in fact adding to the total expenditure-no t much but a net amount about $2,800m? That is a conundrum. Outside of social credit, how can the Government do it?' I think that there is a very simple explanation. About $ 1,000m is to be collected from company tax because the quarterly collections were deferred. There is still about $ 1,000m outstanding. Accordingly, there is no magic in what the Treasurer is saying. He is seeking to spread false claims of achievement which cannot be justified in fact. I want to go quickly through this issue of the deficit and I hope that I can lay to rest some of the unjustified fears which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have encouraged in the community. First of all, as I said severaltimeswhen I was the Treasurer, if the deficit were to be greater than we had projected when we put the Budget together, because revenue fell reflecting a fall in the rate of increase in income, that would be a better position to be in in terms of economic management than the one we had outlined in the Budget. The one we had outlined in the Budget represented considerable restraint in the circumstances in which we were functioning. But this in turn represented an even better situation. That is why the deficit increased. When we put the Budget together revenue collections from personal income tax were calculated on the basis of a 22 per cent increase in average weekly earnings. That had fallen to about 17 per cent, on the forward projections for the year, by about November and I expect that it is probably down to 14 per cent or 15 per cent. I do not know. We do not hear about these things from the present Treasurer. There was no secret about these things when we were in government. They were mentioned in the Budget statements. A significant aspectflowsfrom this contraction in the rate of increase in wages. It means that there must be, by a natural order of things, flowing from that appreciable increases available to the Government because the costs which had to be met in the Budget were addressed in terms of a certain rate of increase necessary to meet those costs. Wages represent about 60 per cent of the total cost of goods and services in the community. If in fact the rate of increase in wages is easing back, given the fact that we are not reducing outlays anywhere near as appreciably as we did, it would suggest that departments have more money to spend in real terms and that those departments have not had any significant cuts in their appropriations. In fact as a proportion of gross domestic product the expenditure available to them is greater. One such department is the Department of Defence. From my recollection, Defence expenditure was to be about 2.8 per cent of GDP this year. I expect that it will be much closer to 3 per cent. Certainly it will be above 2.8 per cent because of the movements which I have mentioned. There is another aspect of this matter which I want to discuss and it concerns the actual level of the deficit. I regard it as quite important. According to the Treasurer, the deficit will be shown to be about $4,200m by the end of the year when the figures are balanced out. As I mentioned, there will be a reduction because about $ 1,000m of company tax collections is still outstanding. If we look at the monthly statement of financial transactions of the Australian Government we see that for gross pay-as-you-earn income tax coUections from individuals the total for the 9 months to the end of March this year exceed $6,000m. Honourable members may say that that is a lot. It certainly is, but it is only 60 per cent of the total projected gross collections at the time we put the Budget together. If we use as a very rough guideline-ther e is nothing better than that-the proportion of collections for the same time last year it would suggest that we are very substantially down. We are down by about $ 1,400m on what we had anticipated when we put our projections together. Let us do a bit of simple arithmetic. Let us take $ 1,400m from $4,200m-take the shortfall in income tax collections away from the deficit about which the Treasurer is talking-and we come down to $2,800m, which is about the figure we had set as the sort of deficit at which we were aiming. Let us look at another aspect of the nonsense that is impUcit in the discussion about the Budget. About $700m of that is to be paid overseas and this has no innuence at all in terms of domestic economic management. I come to an important point which I raised with the Treasurer today at question time. It is quite clear that he did not understand it. He had not heard of the concept before. I am referring to the full employment deficit. What is it? It is a relatively simple thing for a sophisticated organisation like the Department of the Treasury, with the people it has available to do such an exercise. It is done regularly in the United States of America and it is done in other countries. They use trend projections and so on to work out what would be the deficit at a time of full employment, given a number of relevant assumptions, and they compare that with the actual deficit. The sums I have just done will show what the situation will be like if we start carving away some of the extraneous and not terribly relevant political rhetoric that is going on at the present time. I assert with a great deal of confidence if a full employment deficit were projected for the present time the fears that people have would disappear. In fact they would be experiencing fears at the thought that a government in office talking, at a time of extremely slack tivity, of cutting back further on the deficit if it possibly can. That is sheer nonsense. It is the level of government expenditure at the present other time which is maintaining the rate existing in the economy. Without that pubhc expenditure the private sector would be in theFor serious trouble. Let me move on to something else that has been said here in recent times. I refer to the Treasurer's comments that we are moving into a recovery. He seems to be giving encouragement and saying that the light is at the end of the tunnel and that it is not a very long tunnel. For what it is worth, I do not think that this country any significant recovery before the end of the next calendar year. I assert that unemployment will rise and that economic activity at best will be extremely sluggish. It will not surprise me in the least to see unemployment reaching about 6 per cent. It will certainly pierce through the level of 5 per cent. That is the implication of the sort of economic management which the Government is applying at the present time. When the Government talks about an economic recovery starting from a base with an annual inflation rate in excess of 13 per cent, I wonder what it is trying to seU to the Austrahan people. How can anyone seriously believe, after the March quarter consumer price index figure showing an increase of 3 per cent, that there have been any encouraging inroads into inflation? I know that it is a lower rate than we saw in the December quarter. In the December quarter thefigurewas 5.6 per cent, but much more than 2 per cent of that was attributable to various forms of indirect tax charges. The previous Government levied them. The State governments levied them. They were preferable to printing more money and putting it into circulation when weighed against the problems we faced in handling the economy. So, excluding that, the rate of inflation in the December quarter was a little over 3 per cent. If one excludes the usual seasonal factors associated with clothing in that quarter and makes an allowance for the fact that there was a substantial increase in respect of potatoes alone, and then contrasts that with the March quarter when in fact the price of potatoes- a volatile input in the CPI statistics-wen t down, one sees that the result in the March quarter was far from encouraging. By and large, on the long term trend the March quarter figure is the best figure that over the course of a year. Retail sales showed some sort of encouraging response, if one looks superficially at the latest statistics. In the Australian Financial Review of 5 May, confirming is my own impressions from my dealings with busieconomic acness people, Chanticleer wrote: While there is cheering among Canberra politicians and in places about the retail sales figures for the March quarter, the retailers themselves and many manufacturers of activity regarded them as disturbing. when they are adjusted to constant 1968-69 dollars, sales (seasonally adjusted) showed a decline and were at their lowest level for a year. In fairness, I should mention that he went on to suggest that there is some evidence of some little strengthening in AprU. But there is a long way to go yet: I stand by my prediction about the sluggishness of the economy well into 1977 and, I believe, well towards the end of 1977. The econwill see omic measures to which the Government has resorted in a clumsy, frequently erratic manner are not the appropriate economic measures to have been applied in this country, given the nature of the economic difficulties which we faced. I have given a rough outline of the way in which I have seen the economy, the way in which the Government's policies have not been helpful and the very disturbing and unhelpful misrepresentation for which the Government has been responsible on the issue of the deficit. I conclude by saying that Austraha probably faces the most critical economic situation it has faced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It looks as though this country will still be in a nant state of economic activity, epitomised by high rates of innation, heightened industrial unrest and high unemployment, at a time when other countries have pretty much got on top of these sorts of problems. The shame is that when we went out of office we had the economy pointed in the right direction and starting to move, and all that has been lost.",65

139,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT," I rise to support these 2 Appropriation Bills. I wish I had the wit of the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth), so that I could reply on his behalf. In rising to support the Appropriation BUls, I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), the Cabinet and the Government on their determination to cut the extravagance of expenditure and the wastefulness of expenditure that have been evident over the last few years. stagTo carry out an evaluation of the success of this determination one has only to look back to a simUar period last year and compare the appropriations at that stage with the appropriations we intend to make this year and then compare the savings. The basic difference is that, whereas last year over $ 1 bilUon was being asked to be appropriated, this year the amount proposed is a net $28m. It has been the concern of this Government that the first priority must be the reining in of the expenditure that was running rife up to half-way through last year. I believe that these Appropriation Bills will stand as evidence of the success of the Government's determination of priorities in this direction. Before I continue I should like to mention 2 matters that were raised earUer in this debateone by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). In his speech yesterday he said: Australia is a great trading nation. We are affected enormously by the world-wide trade cycle. Our present troubles of inflauon and unemployment to a large extent are the result of a world-wide trade cycle phenomenon. I would have hoped that by now the Australian Labor Party would have learned that one cannot import into Australia a product whose seeds have been sown in one's own environment. The seeds for the inflation we are experiencing at the moment were sown in the Labor support for the wage demands by the Public Service more than 2 years ago-demand s that have flowed through to other trade unions in Australia. These demands have brought crippling cost to industry and have left inflation at the high rate at which it is today. The inflation may have been fanned by some world-wide influence, but the basic seed was sown by the Australian Labor Party itselfin supporting those wage demands. Secondly, the honourable member for Adelaide and also the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who has just spoken, mentioned that the deficit has expanded because receipts have not been as they were expected to be as a result of the success of Labor's wage policy. This approach seems to me to be like having a dollar each way and, irrespective of the result, taking the credit for what happens as something that had been achieved through one's policy. I believe that this in itself is an indication that the Hayden Budget was nothing more than a hoax. It was a hoax in that the deficit was deliberately misrepresented as being low and comments were made at the time that the new rebate system of taxation would benefit middle class income earners. The only beneficiary from the rebate system of taxation of that Budget was the Government itself, through the collection of higher taxes. So I think we must look at those 2 aspects and try to put at rest the fallacies. Inflathe tion was not imported. The Budget .which we are discussing at the moment and to which we are adding appropriations was nothing but a gigantic hoax foisted on the Austrahan pubhc. I beheve that revenue that the Commonwealth collects is held in trust- a trust that is sacred far as the taxpaying pubhc is concerned. It is our duty as a government to maintain that trust. We should allocate expenses according to the prioriraise ties expected by the people who pay the taxes. These basically fall into 3 broad regions. Firstly, there are the acceptable services that people come to expect from a Federal government that cannot be provided otherwise. Secondly, there is the priority to provide incentives to money back into the productive areas to make sure that they remain viable and profitable and as a result can contribute taxes into the general revenue. I believe that this is an important area. Thirdly, there is the giving of assistance to those people throughout the Commonwealth who cancripple not afford to help themselves, who are in a situous ation not of their own choosing and who need support. Over the last few years we have seen this assistance extended to people who could help themselves but never bothered to do so. That contributed a fair amount to the deficit we discussing at the moment. But, more imporbeen tantly, there are people who need assistance, people who in the past contributed greatly to Federal revenues and who need assistance at moment. I mention the people in the beef, dairy and fruit industries spread throughout the Comjoining monwealth who desperately need help at this stage. It should be part of our charter as a government to assist these people as far as we can, to last the distance until they get back able times. This trust that I mentioned is pararich mount. If we disenchant people by the way handle their tax receipts, they will retaliate through the ballot box. I think we saw this evidenced on 13 December. The Labor Party lost that trust and the retaliation was complete, in that it lost government. But it is not fair enough for us in this House any longer-w e have been doing this for 5 months-to try to create our reputation by mentioning that the Labor Party was a bad manager of the economy. We as government must create our own reputation as managers of the economy. That is what we will be judged on in 2Vi years' time. We will be judged not on our handling of the legacy left by the Austrahan Labor Party but on the reputation that we establish for ourselves as good money managers. In this regard I come back again to fact that the Treasurer, the Cabinet and the Government are to be congratulated for starting us back on the road to respectability within the Commonwealth sphere and for bringing to an end an age in which there was a handout mentality and where people were expecting to receive but not give in return. I see these Appropriation as Bills as being a definite start in this direction. There are 2 other matters that I would like to which have some bearing on finances and the budgetary situation. One was mentioned yesterday at question time, the coal export levy. The Situation in respect of the Appropriation Bills and that we are now discussing would have been $70m worse off but for the imposition of the coal put export duty. That is the amount that was collected by the Commonwealth from that duty up to 31 March. Never before in the history of this Commonwealth has there been a duty that was designed to tax incentive-no t to give incentive, but to tax incentive. It is a duty designed to an industry that was viable and prosperand that was prepared to help itself. There never has been a duty like this one, which was designed to stifle development in the area from which the tax is paid. I hope that the Government will be able to see its way clear to return in some way to the mining are towns throughout Austraha the $70m that has collected from the export levy in order to give them the basic facilities and the assistance that they cannot give themselves in the form of this telecommunications services and translator stations as well as provide assistance to those adbeef areas that I mentioned before. I beheve that the best incentive that we as a Government can now give to the coal industry from the point of view of those who are producing at the to vimoment, those who are expected to develop the coal basins that exist throughout Australia, we would be removal of this duty in the 1976-77 Budget. That would be little enough to give them, but it would be incentive enough for them to get back into full production and to develop those fields which could be the cure-all for Australia's exports in the next four or five years. The second matter that I mention is the matter of the zone allowance. This again affects many of a the isolated mining townships and the other developing industries throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Yesterday, as a matter of public importance, the Labor Party brought on a debate about decentralisation in the sense of ing to take people from the capital cities to joining lands. Within the zone allowance we have a mechanism available to us, if we use properly, for decentralising people and for maknight. ing sure that they are encouraged to seek emstandards ployment beyond the limits of the capital cities. If one examines the record of the zone allowance one will see that governments since 1945 have paid little regard to this aspect. The zone allowance was initially introduced an encouragement to people to seek employment in remote districts. The boundaries of the zones were first determined after a survey which into account such factors as the uncongenial matic conditions, the isolation, the loss of amenities and the higher cost of living. In land mass above the north of the Tropic of evasion. Capricorn, which encompasses approximately but not quite 45 per cent of Australia's land face, lives a minimal population. We could not even defend that portion of Australia if we were called upon to do so. The boundaries of the allowance have not been reviewed in the last 31 years, except for the differences between Zone and Zone B. I believe that if we reviewed those boundaries to take into account the isolation perienced by the people in these communities who are striving to bring productivity to our northern lands we could encourage people to go out into these regions to seek employment and thereby assist Australia in so many ways. We should review the boundaries. But, just as tical importantly, if we are to give lowance, we should for goodness sake see erals ask us to believe whether we can apply proper values in respect of happened in other countries it. I take an example of zone B. In 1945 the dein Australia. It is evident from duction was worth $40. Now, 31 years later, it is have asked that I was acting on the worth $90. Under a rebate system it is worth $36 for every single person living within that area. That would not pay for a trip to the coast, let alone the other high costs which people are expected to absorb in this area.",69
140,Mr LUSHER,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,It would not pay for a telephone caU to Canberra.,71
141,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"It would not. But they agents do not have telephones, in any full support to these Appropriation Bills and to of 13 aircraft instead the Government I ask for the support of the Government for these 2 basic items, namely, zone aUowance and the matter of the coal export duty. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the the Opposition) (5.11)- I address myself to a matter which the honourable member for ment Hotham (Mr Chipp) raised in the debate on this tryBUl last night and which the Prime Minister (Mr adMalcolm Fraser) sought questions upon yesterday afternoon. Honourable senators also raised it the matter during the adjournment debate last The Paltridge affair Ulustrates the double of the Government and the nauseating hypocrisy of the Prime Minister in particular. A serious allegation has been made against a former Liberal Party Minister. When allegations were made recently against Labor Party Ministers the Government showed remarkable speed as and diUgence in its investigations. It went so far as to use Commonwealth Police to interrogate the Austrahan Labor Party's advertising agency took and to check my movements as Leader of the cUOpposition. What happens when allegations are social made against a former Liberal Minister? The the Government resorts to remarkable delay and It fails to investigate the matter at home or to seek material abroad. If it is really consurcerned to clear Senator Paltridge's name, why has it taken no steps to estabUsh the facts? If Senator Paltridge was still alive the Government zone would have been no less dUatory and evasive. A These allegations are not new. I raised them in 1962. They have been raised again now for a exvery substantial reason-the recent evidence in the United States about the activities of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. What seemed in 1962 a possible explanation for certain actions by a Liberal Minister seems, in 1976, as a result of disclosures in the United States, a likely explanation. In 1962 the public would have been scepor incredulous about suggestions of bribes any sting to this alby multinational companies. Not now! The Libthat what is known to have could never happen questions I information supplied to me. I do not need to establish the principle that a member ofParliament, especially an Opposition Leader, is entitled to raise information given to him in good faith. I repeat: A member of the Australian National Airlines Commission told me in late 1961 that the Minister for CivU Aviation had received from Lockheed the amount of their commission on one case. In giving my played inaircraft Electra in return for the part he had securing the orders for and importation of two of those aircraft. the I accepted the good faith of my informant. I trusted him. I beUeved what he told me. I still believe it. I add that at no time have I asserted that Minister accepted the payment for his personal gain. It is altogether possible that the paypassed to the Liberal Party's funds. It was precisely in the context of electoral fund raising that I raised this matter in the Parhament on 8 April. It is noteworthy that no one on the Government side objected or protested when the issue was put in those terms. Perhaps my accusations seemed more credible in view of the sworn disclosures, never challenged in the House, about fund raising activities in London on behalf of the Liberal Party by Mr John Keegan in the 1950s. In the debate on the Electoral Bill introduced by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) I said: In the later 1950s a Liberal Minister for Civil Aviation is Caravelles believed to have received a very Party in consideration of orders had permitted and promoted. The sum is the commission on one of the 13 Electras ordered. Later in that speech I used the term 'Paltridge affair'. I gave my information to the House and proval named the Minister 4 weeks ago. I invite the directing House to compare the information I gave 4 They weeks ago with the information I sought when I eventually first received it. I repeat: I received the informaComets. tion in late 1961 after Parhament had risen. The Civil new Parhament sat for the first time on 20 on theAviation February 1962. The next day I put a question on rescind the notice paper, question No. representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. is the question: 1. Is the importation of aircraft prohibited unless the importer has the permission of the Director-General of Civil Aviation? 2. On what dates did Ansett-ANA, Trans-Australian Airpolicy lines, Qantas and Tasman Empire Airways Limited permission to place orders for Electra aircraft? 3. What was the cost of these orders? 4. Who are the Australian agents for the manufacturers Electra aircraft? 5. What is the rate or amount of commission paid to agents by the manufacturers 6. Where and when did the agents confer with him, Director-General, Trans-Australian Tasman Empire Airways Limited? The whole basis of every one of these questions was the information I gave the Foreign Minister  House four weeks ago and one week ago. The basic facts are these: In the late 1950s the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation received orders for 2 Electras from Ansett-ANA. In time this application for 2 Electras resulted in orders for tlurteen. TAA had to take three, Ansett three, Qantas four and TEAL three. It was this remarkable increase in orders for an aircraft which no one except Ansett originally wanted, and which only the Minister for Civil Aviation could allow to be imponed, which caused speculation and, inevitably, suspicion at the time. The Opposition was not alone in remarking on it. Let me quote, as I did a week ago, what Mr David Fairbairn said on 8 April 1959: Let us see how the Government of this country has prevented the purchase of aircraft which the technical experts wanted bought, and which are made in the sterling area. First, we have the case of the Caravelle which was mendoned by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). TAA sent its experts, including Mr Warren MCDonald, all round the world to look at every possible suitable aircraft and decided which was best. Among other places they visited Toulouse. As the honourable member for Fremantle said, they recommended the purchase of the best and most economical aircraft. So TAA decided to buy 2 but was told by the Government that it could not do so. Eventually the Government said: 'You can buy Eleclarge sum for himself or his tras.' for Electra aircraft which he said to have been Mr Fairbairn proceeded: The second case. . . is the rejection by the Government of therequestby Tasman Empire Airways Limited for apto purchase Comet aircraft. There is a board of six TEAL and its representauves spent 2 years visiting every firm in the world which turns out suitable aircraft. inspected the aircraft, gave them testflightsand decided by a four-to-two majority in favour of the What did this Government do? It immediately sent the Director-General of Civil Aviation and the Minister for to New Zealand and put the utmost pressure New Zealand Government and the board of TEAL to that vote and not to buy Comets, but to purchase 5, to the Minister Electras instead. This On 19 February 1959 Mr Fairbairn had said: I had the opportunity, while in America, England and France, of visiting a number of aircraft factories. 1 went to the Lockheed works at Atlanta, the De Havilland works at Bristol and the Sud works at Toulouse. I must say quite bluntly that, although I disagreed with the Government's on aircraft buying before I went abroad, I have come receive back disagreeing with it even more strongly. Mr Stanley Brogden, the eminent authority on aviation, said in his book Australia's Two Airline of Policy published in 1968 that the decision on Electras had postponed for many years the modthe ernisation of Australia's airline industry. He said on the sale of Electra aircraft? the story of the way Lockheed sold the Electra to the Qantas would one day be told as a 'masterpiece Airlines, Qantas and of salesmanship.' Mr Brogden said: Convinced of the economic superiority of the Caravelle, TAA booked 2 places on the Sud-Aviation production line, the booking being subjected to ratification of an order by the Commonwealth. Did TAA really order the Caravelle? This is often debated, particularly as Liberal Party politicians are even today very touchy on this subject. . . TAA management placed the enure proposals before the commission and saw it accepted, but the Commission's proposals to the Cabinet were 3 times rejected. Mr Brogden believed that TAA's original preference for the Caravelle was justified. He continued: The Qantas preference for the prop-jet was forced upon the New Zealanders, who actuallyflewaflagat half-mast at TEAL headquarters when the official decision was taken that TEAL should have the same equipment us Qantas . . . The decision was important in relation to its effect on the domestic situation: The Government now had two of its three main airlines preferring the Electra. The mystery of the Lockheed orders might have remained in hmbo if it had not been for the report this year by the sub-committee on Multinational Corporations of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The report revealed that Lockheed had been associated with corrupt practices in a number of countries. On 18 February, at the first question time this year, the honourable member for Fremantle by now the father of the Parliament, asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this question: In view of the fact that the Lockheed Corporation is revealed as a major source of this son of corrupt action, will the Prime Minister cause an investigation to be made into its activities in Australia where it has been the major supplier to civil airlines and defence forces? The Prime Minister replied: The latter part of that question might well involve vious Administration. There would probably need to be some assurance from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to some aspects ofit In that veryfirstquestion time the Prime Minister set the style of all his subsequent answersevasive, uninformative, sneering and supercilious. Six days later my previous Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Newgranted. castle (Mr Charles Jones), asked the ister this question: Now that it is an accepted fact that Lockheed Aircraft Corporation has paid bribes totalling millions of dollars to government ministers and commercial leaders in return for the purchase of Lockheed products is the honourable gentleman aware that when the domestic airlines were considering the purchase of new mainline aircraft in the late 1930s Trans-Australia Airlines recommended the French Caravelle and Ansett Airlines of Australia recommended the Lockheed Electra? Was it generally accepted at that time that Ansett Airlines of Australia received much more favourable treatment than TAA did. Is he also aware of the strong rumours at thattimethat a senior Liberal Cabinet Minister had been compensated by Lockheed following the government's decisionTo which the Prime Minister replied: The honourable gentleman was Minister for Transpon and as Minister for Transpon he himself might have had quite close liaison and communication with the Lockheed Corporation. . . . I think it ought to be noted that the honourable gentleman may well need to look to his own house first because he may not be aware that one of the ous defence Ministers, or was it the Prime Minister at time, was responsible for ordering Lockheed aircraft in the period of the previous Administration. My Government ordered no civil aircraft from General Lockheed. The only orders we placed for desought fence aircraft were for 8 Orions that were later received versions of aircraft which had been ordered sucMarch cessfully and properly by the previous governNovember ments. Yesterday the Prime Minister unburANA and TAA dened himself of this self-righteous injunction: One might have expected . . . that somebody who purpons to be in a responsible position would not idly make this kind of accusation . . . He was the one who first made accusations in answer to questions raised on thefirstsitting day by the father of the Parliament and raised 6 days later by the former Minister for Transport. Other members of the Opposition were pursuing this matter. On 18 February, thefirstquestion daythe day that the honourable member for Fremantle asked his question of the Prime Minister-the shadow Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) wrote directly to the Chairman of the United States Sub-Committee, Senator Frank Church. Senator Church replied that the request should be addressed through the Department of Foreign Affairs. I wrote to the Minister for  outhning the facts and asking him to make a the prerequest to Senator Church to provide the files which could be made available on a request by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I ask that the letter be incorporated in Hansard, Mr Deputy Speaker.",71
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is Prime Min- (The document read as follows)Leader of the Opposition. 31 March 1976 My dear Minister, Some of my colleagues have sought information from Senator Frank Church, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Multinational Corporations of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, concerning the sale of Lockheed Electra aircraft to Australia. Senator Church has replied: 'The Subcommittee on Multinational Corporations has decided to make its files available pursuant to formal government requests transmitted to the United States through our State Depanment. 'Should you wish the Australian information, the proper procedure would be to address a request through your foreign office. We will be pleased to respond as soon as possible.' In the late 1950s TAA sought permission to impon two Caravelle aircraft and Ansett-ANA to impon two Electra variaircraft. At that time the Customs (Prohibited Imports) the Regulations, Third Schedule, Item No. 1, prohibited the imponation of aircraft unless 'The imponer shall produce to the Collector the permission in writing of the Directorof Civil Aviation to impon the goods'. The Director General at first refused permission. Later both companies permission to impon two Electras each. Thcy this permission on 22 May 1958. Meanwhile, on 26 1958, Qantas had received permission from the Director-General to impon four Electras and later, on 16 1959 and 24 February 1960 respectively, Ansettreceived his permission to import a third Electra each. Tasman Empire Airways Limited, at that time jointly and equally owned by the New Zealand and Australian Governments, took delivery of three Electras at the same time as Qantas took its four. A member of the Australian Nauonal Airlines Commission explained this transformation of a request for two Electras to orders for thirteen Electras by informing me that the Lockheed agents in Australia, E. L. Heymanson Company Pty Ltd, gave the then Minister for Civil Aviauon the commission they had earned on one of the thirteen Electras whose sale the company had procured and the minister had permitted. This information was reflected in the question for which the minister supplied me with an answer on IS March 1962 (Hansard, page 938). My colleagues Mr Beazley and Mr Jones have now asked the Prime Minister questions without notice on 18 February 1976 (Hansard, page 32), and 24 February 1976 (Hansard, page 187) and my colleague Mr Morris has received answers to questions on nouce from the Ministers for Defence and for Transport on 16 and 17 March 1976 (Hansard, pages 693 and 767). We now ask your department to transmit through the United States State Department to the Church Committee a request for the relevant files. Copies to: Honourable K. Beazley, Honourable C. K. Jones,  The Honourable Andrew Peacock, M.P., Minister for Foreign Affairs, Parliament House, CANBERRA, A.C.T., 2600. Mr £. G. Whitlam-I thank the House. After waiting a month without receiving even an acknowledgement of my letter I raised the matter again in the House a week ago after telling the Foreign Minister I proposed to do so. The Minister refused to take action. What possible justification can there be for the Minister's refusal to co-operate? If he had wanted more information or further assurances from me he could have written back to me. He chose to ignore my letter. I tried to establish yesterday whether he had shown it to the Prime Minister. I asked the latter: Did he see the letter which I sent to the Foreign on 31 March concerning the Lockheed Electra purchases under Senator Paltridge before I quoted from the letter last Thursday? If he did, how long before did he see it? I received this reply: If the honourable gentleman will indicate the his question I will answer it. I would have thought the relevance was obvious. So serious a matter could easily have been checked with the Prime Minister. Did the Foreign Minister raise it with the Prime Minister or did he keep it from him? Did he treat it with secrecy or did they both treat the subject with disdain? If the Church revelations had appeared while I was Prime Minister I would have had the Australian position investigated. If as a Minister I had received a request from the Leader of the Opposition, such as the Foreign Minister received from me on 31 March, I beheve I would have acted promptly, directly and courteously. I do not beheve I would have responded by casting snide aspersions on members who had asked questions. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister can easily establish whether the Church Committee has any information. It may be that the Committee has no relevant information. It may be that the Committee would be disposed to resume its investigations. Unless the Government takes action no one will know whether the Church Committee has information or not. The longer the delay in approaching the Church Committee the less likely it is that the Committee will resume its inquiries. The more the Government stalls and blusters and covers up the more Ukely people are to believe the worse, and the more they will be justified in doing so. Yours sincerely, E.G. Whitlam Mr SPEAKER-I call the honourable member for Braddon. I remind the House that this is the honourable gendeman's maiden speech.",73
143,Mr GROOM,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"I regret, Sir, that it is necessary for me in my maiden speech to follow a man who has just made a scurrilous speech which has debased this House and the standing of this House. It was a mean and despicable act against a dead man. I appreciate my responsibiUty in making my maiden speech that I must not be unduly provocative, but I am afraid I must say that this speech has disappointed me. This attack on a dead man- a man whom I did not know-ha s caused great distress to his family, to his dependants and to his loved ones. It is most unfair, despicable and un-Australian that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) should now seek to attack this man in this way. The principle is clear. This man is dead. He cannot defend himself, and the Minister Leader of the Opposition knows this. Where is the Leader of the Opposition's evidence? Where is the evidence to prove the point that he now makes? The matter is splashed over the headlines of all of our newspapers. He relies on an relevance of unnamed source and an unnamed person. Let him name that person. Let him name that source. Let him produce some evidence and then, with respect to him, we may think a little more of him. Let me now pass to perhaps a brighter subject. It is with a great sense of honour that I stand here in this chamber as the representative of a great electorate, the electorate of Braddon in Tasmania. I wish at this point in my speech to thank my constituents from all over Braddon who gave me wonderful suppon in the last election and who have given me the opportunity and the responsibility I now carry. I mention specifically the people of Devonport and Ulverstone, the people of the small town of Penguin on the north-west coast of Tasmama, the people of my own home town of Burnie, the people of Wynyard, the people of Smithton and Stanley in the Circular Head area, the rugged west coasters from the west coast area of Tasmania which I know you, Mr Speaker, know quite well, and the people from King Island. I thank all of those people and I promise them that I will speak out for them as strongly as I possibly can in their interest. I appreciate that I and other honourable members have an obligation in the national interest to look after the country, to protect the national interest and to put the country back on the right path again. But I am a Tasmanian and I am very proud of that fact. I say here and now that I will not shirk any issue which might be of concern or interest to my fellow Tasmanians. We have a young and vigorous team of Tasmanians in this chamber, and I am very proud indeed to make reference to them. I compliment them on the fine job they are doing for their constituents. Again, I will mention them expressly: The honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman), the Minister for Repatriation, who is at the table at the moment; the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman); the honourable member for FrankUn (Mr Good luck); and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr). Together we represent a mere 3 per cent of the population of this nation but we intend to get more than our three cents worth for our constituents. It would be only proper for me to mention my predecessor, Mr Ron Davies. I do this quite sincerely because I beheve he gave meritorious service to his electorate for 17 years. I am sure my constituents would like me to wish him a long and happy retirement. The House is now deahng with two Appropriation Bills which seek the approval of this House for the appropriation to specific departments and services of an additional $506,201,000 over and above the amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No. 1) and Appropriation Act (No. 2) of 1975-76.I am deUghted to be making my initial contribution in this debate on Supply legislation. Let us not understate the importance of this legislation. It is not merely formal legislation; not simply a matter of applying a rubber stamp. Before I go on to other matters, I should like to touch on the constitutional questions which have been raised, and which one could say have been done to death. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) have laboured this theme for some time. The arguments are now historical, but I do not think it would be fair to say that it is sour grapes on their part. I recognise the emotional content of these issues, but surely those honourable members must realise, if they think about the matter, if they look at the Constitution, that their arguments lack any basis in law or in logic. The vast majority of constitutional lawyers of any standing whatsoever in this country now recognise-no t aU of them recognised it beforethat the Senate has the power under section 52 of the Constitution to defer or reject Supply. After all, what better proof is there than that the power has now been exercised and exercised successfully. I remind the House and honourable members opposite that the Senate, and the power given to it under section 52, was fought for by Tasmania and the other smaller States and their representatives prior to Federation. I believe that they are a keystone to the Federal compact. I remind honourable members opposite of section 1 of the Constitution, to which I wish to refer: The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called 'The Parliament,' or 'The Parliament of the Commonwealth.' It would appear that honourable members opposite do not recognise two-thirds of that definition of the Parliament. The honourable member for Adelaide in this very debate yesterday continued his attack on His Excellency the Governor General, and I refer to the comments he made at page 1945 of Hansard. He said: If anyone thinks that the royal visit next year, if we still have the present Governor General, will be a joyous occasion he had better think again. Think about those words and ponder them for a moment. I suggest to the honourable member for Adelaide that he should refer to section 24A of the Crimes Act, which deals with the crime of sedition. I am not suggesting for one moment that the honourable member has committed that crime, but I would offer him the advice that perhaps before he makes further comments like that he should give consideration to that section. The honourable members to whom I have referred are pursuing their vendetta and causing it is bitterness and hatred witlun our community. Their comments and their attack, I believe, are politically naive. They are paying the price, and while they continue their attack they will continue to pay the price. As I have said, the legislation with which we are now dealing is not merely formal legislation. Appropriation legislation goes to the very heart of government. Government is finance and finance is government. It behoves all of us in this House to be deeply conscious of how the Government spends the people's money. Governments do not spend Minister's money. It is the hard earned money of people-the men and women who have toiled for many hours each week of their working hves to finance government. We must not be concerned simply with millions of dollars or with hundreds of thousands of dollars. We must be concerned with individual doUars and we must be concerned also with cents. I am reminded of the comment of the Mmister for Defence (Mr Killen), as he now is, in my electorate during the last election campaign, when he said: Each government must recognise and fulfil its duty trustee of the taxpayers' money. That is a most important principle. One of the fatal errors of the previous Labor Administration was its blatant breach of that duty and its gross negligence and carelessness in the manner in which it spent the people's money. Now that we are in government we must not forget that point. It was a question of too much too condition which could be fairly described, I believe, as the Blue Poles syndrome. The cause was a lack of discipline. Unless leaders discipline themselves and their policies, government not function efficiently; it cannot satisfy the needs and aspirations of the people. dent Fortunately- I say this quite objectively non-politically-w e now have a government brought which will not shirk its responsibiUty to the people, which has discipline and which accepts its duty of trusteeship. The appropriations reveal substantial savings coast. in a whole range of government expenditure. These must be applauded, and I believe will be applauded by the people. However, the Governcoast ment must not be mesmerised by the need to and save and to cut cloth. I am not suggesting that is now so mesmerised, but it is necessary for back benchers, us private members, to remain vigilant to ensure that the Government remains responsible, as it now is, in making its decisions. It must distinguish waste and excesses from true social need. Despite our budgetary deficit, this Government must be humane. Again I say that offer no criticism. I believe that it is being mane. It must use its heart as well as its head. must continue to be concerned for the aged, for the poor, for the mentaUy and physically handithe capped, and for the less fortunate in our munity and other communities in the world. must distinguish the people in genuine need from the layabouts, the slackers and the work shy. Let me turn from these universal issues to some grave problems which affect my own electorate of Braddon. I mention briefly that Braddon encompasses the top left-hand corner of Tasmania, from the Mersey Valley westward to the north-west tip of Tasmania and down to the point south of Macquarie Harbour on the west coast. It includes the important island of King Island. The electorate depends very largely upon private enterprise. The end product of lavish wasteful spending by the Labor Administration was a savage beating and bruising of the private sector. Even honourable members opposite would recognise that fact. I know that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) did recognise that fact when he presented his Budget Speech last year. In my electorate we have farmas a ing, mining and manufacturing industries. All of these were affected adversely by Labor policy decisions during its period in office. The paper industry is a vital industry. I am pleased to say that, although it had a difficult time for some years and had to retrench hundreds of workers, things are now looking up. This is a vital industry in my electorate, and I am pleased that its situoften; a mental ation is improving. The Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd is one of Australia's largest copper producers. canQueenstown on the west coast, with its population of 5100 people, is almost totally depenon the viabUity of this company. A combiand nation of world copper prices and inflation this company almost to ruin. In the last financial year it made a trading loss of $8.2m. Again, there are some signs of recovery, with an increase in world copper prices. There are heartening indications for the people of the west I turn to primary industry. The north west of Tasmania and King Island contain rich fertile agricultural land. It is ideal land for it dairying, beef and vegetable growing. A good us many of our farmers are facing total ruin. Their problems cannot be overstated. I know that my colleagues in the National Country Party and the Liberal Party appreciate that these problems exist, and I really believe that the Government appreciates that these problems exist. But I beI lieve that a good many of our farmers are being huexploited by other people within the community. We I do not say that this is being done knowingly or deUberately. I can almost hear the groans from urbenites. I would like to take some of these compeople from the large cities who are cynical We about these problems around my electorate and introduce them to some of these farmers who are in such a desparate situation. Many of them are earning genuine incomes of only $2,000 to $3,000 a year, and there are no tax lurks. They are working 80 hours a week, often with unpaid family assistance. Of course, the cynics will ask: Why do they not get off the property and sell the land? In my electorate hundreds of properties are for sale out they cannot be sold because there are no buyers available. In any event, if the properties could be sold what would the farmers do? Many of them have no other work qualifications. There is no other work that they could do. There is httle work available for them. In my opinion- 1 say this humbly because there is much more that I need to know about the problems facing these farmers-the real solution to their desparate plight will not be found in the payment of unemployment benefits or the provision of short term band aid assistance although, of course, this is essential and has my full support. Their future is dependant upon a gradual reorganising and restructuring of their industry. It is time to make a total and urgent reassessment of their desparate situation. King Island has problems and time does not permit me to go into them in detail. But I am conscious of the Island's problems, particularly transport problems. I hope to have at an early date an opportunity to debate in greater detail for the benefit of honourable members the problems and issues confronting King Island. There is a need to encourage industry and private enterprise. For the Austrahan Labor Party 'profit' is a dirty word, but I believe- I feel that my colleagues also would beheve-that profit is necessary so that a business can expand. When it expands it creates job opportunities. This means higher employment. Therefore, we must give encouragement to private enterprise. The words of Professor Milton Friedman are apt and relevant to this point: The free enterprise system is the only system which enable the ordinary man-the ordinary citizen-to have a maximum degree ofboth freedom and prosperity. Mr Speaker, I am confident that the pohcies and initiatives of this Government will in time give Australians more freedom and a good deal more prosperity. May I , in conclusion, thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their kind reception. May I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on the most capable manner in which you are conducting the deliberations of this chamber.",74
144,Mr INNES,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT," Mr Speaker, I have made the point before that this Government in making its cuts in expenditure and savings is bent on attacking those in our society least able to protect themselves-the poor, the sick, the pre-school children and those dependent on social security benefits. The cats have also attacked the newcomers to our country-ou r ethnic communities. My assertions have been ridiculed by members of the Government but no longer will they do that for they are condemned by their own hand. The Treasury information paper dated 28 April 1976 sets out clearly and unequivocally the savings expected in the 2 Appropriation BiUs being discussed.",77
145,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Braddon made an outstanding maiden speech but I ask honourable members to cease their congratulations and conversations so that the honourable member for Melbourne may be heard.,77
146,Mr INNES,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"I hope that that does not rob me of time either, Mr Speaker. The document proves conclusively that this Government has actively discriminated against ethnic communities. Indeed, two of the cuts cast serious doubts on Australia's status as a signatory to the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Before I discuss these cuts in detail let us examine what they are. The cuts are simply a cosmetic exercise. In no sense do they form part of a coherent economic strategy. They simply relate to the image of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as the strong man, the stern leader introducing belt-tightening measures. On the Government's own admission the cuts total a mere $478.2m out of a total expenditure of something like $20,000m- a mere 2 per cent of total spending. They are not a sincere expression of economic poUcy; they are an exercise in hypocrisy. It is revealing to see who this Government is will prepared to sacrifice first in this image-making exercise. Who are they? During the election campaign we heard all sorts of promises from the Liberal Party and National Country Party coalition about a new deal for ethnic groups. It is now clear exactly what this new deal comprisesone of image-making, cosmetic exercises and a new name for the relevant Department. It is now the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It has exactly the same staffing; exactly the same structures. The only change made has been to the letterhead of the Department. What has been the new deal? It is a series of vicious cuts that have affected nearly every single area of ethnic group concern. Our ethnic communities have been the first target of the new Government. Let us look at the figures supphed in the Treasury information paper. Let us start right at the beginning of this infamous document and look at the cuts made in the Department of Administrative Services. Division 414 of the estimates for that Department relate to the Austrahan Office of Information. The cuts in the area of adnunistrative services total $590,000. Of this money saved, $400,000 was earmarked for migrant pubUcity. The cuts in that area are a fine indication of the Government's concern for ethnic groups. Out of the $590,000 cut from the estimates, $400,000-honourabl e members should keep that in mind-directl y affects our ethnic communities. Let us look at what the money was for. I venture to say that of all the Labor Government 's initiatives in the field of ethnic affairs of the most enthusiastically welcomed initiatives was the introduction of access and ethnic radio because for the first time our ethnic groups had the opportunity to enjoy their own cultures our air waves. It was a long overdue reform. After all, members of our ethnic groups make approximately 25 per cent of our population. They pay their share of taxes and have a right expect that at least part of the pubUc broadcastment ing expenditure will be tailored to their needs. What was the new Government's response? Out of the $400,000 earmarked for migrant publicity through the Australian Information Office $150,000 was to be spent on aspects of ethnic broadcasting. That has gone, every cent ofit, and with it I fear has gone the future of ethnic casting in this country. What of the other cuts? They relate to publiof cations in major languages, publications explaining the complexities of our hire purchase and credit finance procedures, pubUcations warning of the dangers of swimming on our beaches. sure that I do not have to remind honourable members of this House of the number of tragic drownings of the chUdren of migrant parents who are not acquainted with the basic safety cautions that are second nature to most studies Australian-born Australians. The other area affected by the cutback was literature for proand spective migrants. Let me continue through the document. I come to the cuts in the Attorney-General's Departconcern, ment and deal with division 175-the Australian Legal Aid Office. Amongst the groups for whom the Australian Legal Aid Office assumed special responsibility migrants figured prominently. Included in the charter of the Legal Aid offices was a special responsibility to who are in many cases unfamUiar with our complex legal system. The cut in the legal aid area is $2,496,400. This cut will seriously affect the capacity of the legal aid offices to protect members of our ethnic communities from exploitation and injustice. Indeed, it has been suggested by lawyers involved in the service that the Government is deliberately starving the legal aid offices out of existence. Once again our ethnic groups will be amongst the first to suffer. I move on to the cuts in the Department of Education. We find once again that ethnic groups are the first victims of the cuts. The largest single cut in the education budget-let me emphasise that point; the largest single cut-is in the area of the child migrant program, a cut of $983,400. It is easy to see where this Governone ment's priorities lie. Almost $lm has been trimmed off the child migrant education program. This cut is closely followed by that to the adult migrant education program in Australia, includon ing part-time instruction. There the amount is $419,000. It was the Labor Government that up recognised that members of our ethnic communities were more than just factory fodder. It is the to new Liberal-National Countiy Party Governthat is bent on discriminating against migrant children and adult migrant workers seeking to improve their standard of education. Another important cutback is in the grants to the Schools Commission. In the area of special investigations, an area vital for the development broadof multi-lingual and multi-cultural education programs, the cut has been equally vicious. Out a total budget of $404,000 the amount of $167,000 has been removed. This cut will seriously jeopardise research aimed at meeting the needs of ethnic groups in education. In the I am area of technical education the cutback for research and investigations has been equally vicious. Almost a quarter of the total budget, $50,000 out of $219,000, has been cut. In preanother area, assistance for post-graduate in social work-this is an area that directly affects children in disadvantaged schools, that in large part means migrant childrenthis Government has cut $58,000 off a total allocation of $219,000. Pre-school teacher education allowances, another vital area of ethnic group has suffered a cutback of $363,000. In the area of pre-embarkation and shipboard instruction for migrants coming to this country a further cut of $30,000 occurs. It is easy to see where this Government's priorities lie. It is not hard to gauge the real level of concern for our protect migrants ethnic communities. Let me take as another example the budget of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The cut in the appropriation for 'Committees on Discrimination in Employment' serious is almost half of the total-$24,000 out of obligations $50,000.1 turn to the national employment and national Convention retraining scheme which was specifically desigForms of Racial Discrimination. ned to meet the retraining needs of members of party to this Convention with the passing our whole community in general, and in particular our ethnic communities. The cut in that area is Racial $5,100,000. The reduction is made in the allowprovisions ances payable. That reduction has made the the scheme an unworkable farce. I turn next to the arate cut with respect to Commonwealth Hostels Ltd. ation for It is a total of $43,000 out of an allocation of by the Government $195,000 for migrant temporary accommowords, dation assistance. I instance next the cuts in the budget of Children's Commission. This is one area that probably affects our ethnic communities more than any other. Indeed, some ethnic communiestablished, ties have been sending their children to their home countries for want of adequate child care services in this country. What is the cut? It is entire allocation. The appropriation is provides $6,471,000 and the cut is exactly that amount. I turn to the cuts in the budget of Department of Social Security. The allocation for the phone interpreter service has been cut by individuals $46,000. This is a cut that has meant that at the time when the translating service is most needed it is just not available. More than a quarter of the money aUocated for the Migrant Social Welfare Advisory Council-$4,000 out of $14,000-has lishment been cut. Grants to organisations for welfare advise both rights services have been cut by one-fifth. The goes on. A cut of $127,000 is to be made in allocation of $437,000 for research on special projects for the Social Welfare Commission. For vention the first time, through this body, ethnic groups of representatives were being investigated and plans were being drawn up for the purpose of protecting migrants as such. I have already drawn attention to the phght ethnic radio. The allocation to the Attorney General General's Department of $58,400 for ethnic broadcasting equipment is to be cut by $24,000nearly half the total allocated. How long can nic broadcasting continue if the Government tion, deliberately starves it of funds? Under consumer protection, another area that vitally concerns ethnic communities, we find another cut-of measures $840,000 out of a total of $1,120,000. So it goes culture on. Proceeding through the document we find a which further cut in the budget for the Children's Comstanding, mission. The allocation was $57,537,000 and the or cut is just that-$57,537,000. I have already versal stressed the importance of child care in our community and I do not need to do so again. I referred earlier to the fact that the cuts cast doubts on whether we have fulfilled our under the United Nations Interon the Elimination of All We became of the Discrimination Act of 1975. Amongst the of the Act was the establishment of a Community Relations Council. So important was Council considered that it was afforded a sepsection-Par t V-in the Act. The approprithe Council was $ 14,000. The cut made was precisely that. In other the new Government has effectively prevented the full expression of the Racial Disthe crimination Act and has rendered impossible one of the key provisions of the Act. If this Government is not prepared to allow the Council to be I ask the Minister whether he will give effect to article 14 (1) of the Schedule of the International Convention on the Elimination of the All Forms of Racial Discrimination. That article that a State Party may at any time declare that it recognises the competence of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive and consider telecommunications from individuals or groups of within its jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention. I believe that the refusal tofinancethe estabof a community relations council to the Attorney-General and the Comlistmissioner for Community Relations concerning the the observance and implementation of the Conconstitutes a violation. If this Government is not prepared to fund a council made up of our ethnic communities, to allow their views to be heard, will the Government allow their voice to be heard before the United Nations Committee? That is the question of that ought to be answered by the Attorney(Mr Ellicott) or the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar). But in an even more fundamental way the ethpresent Government has breached the Convenand that is in respect to article 7 of the Convention's Schedule. This anicle clearly states: States Parties undertake to adopt immediate and effective particularly in the fields of teaching, education, and information with a view to combating prejudices lead to racial discrimination and to promoting undertolerance and friendship among nations and racial ethnical groups, as well as to propagating the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nauons, the UniDeclaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and this Convendon. What the Government has done in its Budget cutbacks is to make it quite impossible for the office of the Commissioner for Community Relaroom tions to carry out this vital education role. But fore I outline the ways in which this effect, it is worth noting the views of the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs when the Racial Discrimination Act was debated on 8 April 1975 and he was speaking for the then Opposition. He talked on 2 distinct types of discrimination. The Minister referred to erate and inadvertent discrimination. He had to say: Whilst the effect on the victim is manifestly the same, discrimination which comes about by inadvertence no underlying hostility on the is important because if discrimination comes about inadvertence there are no underlying community attitudes which have to be changed. We find that once this action is publicly identified, port the development of public awareness against criminatory attitudes.",77
147,Unknown,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,80
148,Mr INNES,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"The Minister, as I pointed out, was careful to stress that the educational punitive balance of the Act should be carefully observed and protected. I agree with that as a goproposition. But what has been the actual record of this new Government in office, as distinct from the fine words spoken on the road to office? Actions speak louder than words and in this case the action was quite clear. There was an alloin cation of $184,000 for the office of the missioner for Community Relations. An amount of $59,000 has been cut from that allocation. This cut has totally negated the educational ponent of the Racial Discrimination Act. The office of the Commissioner for Community Relaevery tions is able to process only those very post-event cases that the present Minister, while in sition, correctly identified as playing a very part in implementing the overall ideals of the Act. In my opinion, this cut casts serious upon whether we can be described as carrying out Article 7 of the United Nations Convention. Far from carefully observing and protecting educational and punitive balance, this Governpohcy ment has totally removed the education role the office. This Government is in clear breach its duties under the United Nations Convention. In summing up, let me make one thing quite clear: The allocations originally provided for these 2 Appropriation Bills were far from extravagant. The previous Treasurer, the present honourable member for Oxley, Mr Hayden, was adjourned. a stern task master. The allocations for each government department were pared to an irreducible minimum. It was an extremely tough Budget at that time, one that did not leave any for further economies. What was provided befor was the bare minimum necessary to carry out the cuts have had the program ahead. This is the key point: What this Government has done has not been to economise in any real sense of the word. What it has done has been to destroy. The cuts have dealt a crippling blow to deliball the programs I have outlined, a blow from this which they are unlikely to recover. Certainly, given this Government's record so far, it would be hopelessly naive to believe that any of these that programs will fare any better in the Budget to be implies presented in August this year. These cuts have part of the discriminator. This through only opened the way for the total destruction of all these programs before the end of this year. kind of The individual who is responsible for this-the public opinion will tend to supsuch disPrime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-ha s just entered the House. There is one thing that this Government has demonstrated in these cuts, namely, its utter contempt for the needs, aspirations and rights of our ethnic communities. and Under the Australian Labor Party Government for the first time ethnic groups were given a fair Mr Sullivan-What about the Turks?",80
149,Mr INNES,ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AMENDMENT,"We were still a long way short of completing our program. There are a few Turks Riverina who will deal with the honourable Commember. He will meet with the fate that his mates have met with in the New South Wales Parliament. We were still a long way short of comcompleting our program when we were removed from office. But the program which encompassed area of ethnic group participation in a proper and adequate sense in the Australian Oppocommunity has been disastrously cut by this small Government. That program will be placed in a situation from which it will never recover. Yet we heard all this hot air from the Prime Minister about what his Government would do for ethnicdoubt groups. The Government has led them up the garden path. At least a start had been made by the Labor Government. Under this new Govern the ment we have seen a very sudden return to the of indifference and neglect that marked of the 23 years of the Liberal-National Country of Party misrule. This Government stands condemned for its breach of the United Nations Convention, not only before the people of this in country, but before the people of the world.

152,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AND JAPAN,"When this Government was elected to office last year Japan's Prime Minister conveyed to us, as well as his congratulations, his desire that the basic Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation be brought to an early conclusion.

As of today, the outstanding issues of substance have been resolved. It may therefore be expected that the 2 governments will have httle difficulty approving the draft. can be expected that the Treaty will be signed Prime Minister Mild and myself during my visit to Tokyo in the winter recess.

It is no that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) Prime Minister Miki's desire that it shouldand went to Japan very early this year to convey view of the way in which relationships between Japan and Australia ought to develop. we have already seen some advantages from that visit. Over the past 20 years economic relations between our 2 countries have expanded in magand nitude and importance. Japan has become Austraha's largest trading partner. Australia second only to the United States as an importer of Japanese goods. In the trade area, Liberal and National Country Party governments have long sought to extend Australia's relations with Japan. In 1957 we took the major step of signing the Agreement of Commerce with Japan. Unforan tunately that Agreement was not fully supported by all members of this House at the time. This Agreement was of mutual value to the 2 countries, and it contributed to the present extent of Australian-Japanse trade and to goodwill between both nations. In 1971 we established the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee in recognition of the fundamental importance of economic relations between our countries. But trade relations, no matter how important and meaningful, are not and cannot be the totality of countries contacts with one another. In the case of Japan and Australia, a mutually profitable basis of economic exchange makes it even more important that there be an understanding by the 2 countries-a n understanding of their peoples, their language, their culture and their traditions. In furtherance of the objective of greater has understanding, this Government re-introduced a sucinto Parliament the Bill to establish the Foundation. The Foundation will promote the study by Australians and culture, social, econthe omic and political institutions of one another's It will enrich Austrahan-Japanese relations, both by the understanding that knowledge bring and, no less importantly, by the personal contacts between Australians and Japanese that the Foundation's work makes possible. The possibihty of a broad treaty between It Japan and Australia has a long history, being by raisedfirstin the 1950s and raised again in the 1970s. It was discussed at the first meeting of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee in 1972. Standing Committee on Foreign and Defence reported in favour of a in 1973. Later that year the Minister proposed that negotiations visit to New ment's commitmentbegin. for a treaty should to The present Governconclude successfully the accident Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation be our concluded, gave new impetus to negotiations which had been delayed during 1975. The result I beheve was today's outcome. As the draft of the Treaty is still confidential formally subject to consideration and approval by the 2 governments- I emphasise the is words 'formally subject to consideration and approval'-it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to discuss it at length. The Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation is broad-ranging and covers virtually the whole relationship between Austraha and Japan. It is designed to be umbrella under which further agreements may be made and relations developed in specificareas. It accords significant reciprocal benefits. The treaty will be a major step forward in our relations with Japan. It will set the stage for a new and even more cordial era in our dealings with the country which, in a generation, has become our main trading partner, and a cornerstone of stabihty in the region of which Austraha is a part. In the treaty the governments and the peoples of Austraha and Japan have fashioned an instrument designed to help close those gaps in understanding which remain and to bring new progress and confidence in areas where friendship and co-operation are already estabhshed. It will lead to a relationship of greater intimacy. But the significance of the treaty lies not only in our relations with Japan. The great understanding and closer ties between the 2 countries on a wide range of fronts which the treaty makes possible will not only be of great mutual benefit; it will also benefit the countries of the west Pacific and strengthen forces for peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, I place on record the strong spirit of mutual accommodation which has made the treaty possible. That spirit augurs well for the century of the Pacific on which we, Japan and our neighbours are now embarking. I also pay tribute to the officials ofboth countries who have helped the governments of both countries bring this to a successful situation.

161,Mr ELLICOTT,OVERSEAS LOANS,"For some months prior to November last year rumours had been circulated that Ministers of the Labor Government had been involved in improper dealings in relation to overseas loans. The then Opposition considered at the time that these rumours ought to be the subject of a check. While in Melbourne on 2 November for a meeting of Federal and State parliamentary leaders of the Liberal and National Country parties, the name of Wiley Fancher was mentioned to the Premier of Queensland as a person who was understood to have information in connection with these rumours. The Premier was asked if he would be prepared to have the matters referred to, investigated. He said he would. Once the change of government had occurred on 11 November, the caretaker Government adhered scrupulously to the undertaking given to Sir John Kerr that there would be no inquiries by the Government or its instrumentalities, or its employees, into the activities of the former Government. Last year and early this year the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, supplied to the Australia Federal Government certain information which suggested that 2 Ministers of the Labor Government and a senior official still in the Commonwealth PubUc Service might have been involved in attempts to obtain for themselves kick-back on proposed overseas loan borrowings by the Labor Government. The information included notarised statements and other documents which pointed to the possible existence overseas of a mandate signed by the Ministers, and of an associated document implicating the which mandate and associated document evidenced the attempts to obtain the kickbacks. I conferred with the Premier of Queensland in Canberra on 15 January in the presence of the Secretary of my Department, the Under Secretary of the Premier's Department, Also present were Professor O'Connell and Mr Fancher. Following that meeting, discussions took place which involved the Solicitor-General, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, the permanent head of the official's department and the Chairman of the Public Service Board. As a result of these discussions and in conformity with the unanimous advice of officials it was decided that, since a senior pubhc servant was implicated, the Government was bound to institute inquiries to ascertain whether there was any substance in the allegations. Thorough inquiries were then undertaken overseas by an officer of my Department. As a result of these mquiries I concluded that there was no substance in the suggestion that either the official or the 2 Ministers were involved in the wrongful conduct alleged, and the matter was reported by me to the Parliament in an answer to a question which will be found at page 780 of Hansard of 18 March, 1976. On 17 March the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) received a letter from a person calling himself Mr Richard Todd and claiming to be the managing director of Whitney Todd and Co., investment bankers.

The Prime Minister had no I notice knowledge of the existence of the correspondence between various people in Queensland and elsewhere and Whitney Todd and Co. until he received the letter on 17 March. Since the matter did not involve the Commonwealth, the only action taken was to advise the Premier Queensland that Mr Todd had sent this letter him. The Prime Minister has not replied to letter from Mr Todd and has no intention of doing so. I would further like to emphasise that the Treasurer and the Treasury, since the change of government, have indicated in the clearest possible terms that loans to be raised overseas can be raised only through official Treasury sources. Any attempts to raise loans or any offers of funds are to be referred to the Treasury or they will be dealt with.

166,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,"In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who is away on official business at the present time- I want to make that clear-let me say that this statement from the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) is rather interesting. The information contained in it is such that it should be repeated and noted. The Attorney-General said that, as a result of all inquiries, it was found that there was 'no substance in the suggestions that either the official or the 2 Ministers were involved in the wrongful conduct alleged'. That has always been the situation. The Opposition congratulates the Attorney-General for his honesty. But we must ask how it happened that in the middle of an copy election campaign the Premier of Queensland convened the Queensland Parliament for one to make these malicious allegations across is the length and breadth of the nation. It was an abuse of parliamentary procedure in this counThere was no evidence at all that warranted the calling together of the Parliament. The fact that the Premier dared to make the accusations any evidence at all does not entitle him of the comto hold that position. I have not had more than a few seconds to look at the documents that have been tabled, but immediately from the letter from the Premiers Department dated 14 November that Mr Todd is now apparently seeking some compensation for work that he undertook on behalf of the Premier of Queensland, suspicious and of underhand as it may have been and as malicious to as it was intended to be. The letter from the the Premiers Department to Mr Richard Todd says: 1 hereby appoint you as my financial adviser concerning loan raising efforts by the Australian Government that was dismissed on 11 November 1975. I note with interest that rumours-that is a vague term we use in this Parhament to cover up any real accusations-were evident on 2 November which warranted some investigation, the Attorney-General said. We now have from this not gentleman, who is claiming his commission, a letter that he received on 14 November from the Premier of Queensland. The first sentence obviously refers to the dismissal of the Labor Government. In part, that letter states: The authority conferred on you by this appointment may be terminated at any time. In acting as my financial adviser, you are requested to cooperate with Mr W. A. R. Rae, Agent-General for Statement, 6 May 1976 Queensland. This muck-racking expedition has been going on for some time-almos t 12 months-o n the basis that there have been kickbacks and secret commissions. Newspaper proprietors also have made those accusations against many members on this side of the House without any tittle of evidence. We now find, after we have had to flush out the material, that it was a phoney campaign by the Premier of Queensland. Thousands and thousands of dollars of the taxpayers' money in Queensland was misappropriated by the Premier for his own dubious purposes. But was not the real benefit for the Government opposite? It did very well in Queensland in the elections. The people in Queensland might have been entitled, at that stage, to beheve that their Premier had some evidence that 2 Ministers were involved and that those 2 Ministers had secret bank accounts. All this nonsense has been played up in the Press as though there was some corruption in the then Government. The then Government was completely honest. The Attorney-General has vindicated and exonerated it. But we cannot exonerate the Government opposite, because it is part and parcel of the Bjelke-Petersen complex. It is against democracy in this country that a liament can be used to abuse Ministers in the Federal sphere, to make accusations and virtually to bring down a government.",83
167,Mr BAUME,OVERSEAS LOANS,Agains t dead people.,84
168,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,The honourable member for Macarthur ought to be the last person to talk about the matter in the Parliament. Let us have a look at it from the point of view,84
169,Mr BAUME,OVERSEAS LOANS,I do not attack dead men.,84
170,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I am saying that many of our colleagues were maligned, slandered, defamed and libelled in the coward's castle of the Queensland Parhament. There is no excuse for maligning anybody who is dead, but honourable members opposite should not try to get away from this issue. The issue is that a Premier, who is pan and parcel of the National Country Party, called a Parliament together in Queensland, and never once have honourable members opposite raised any protest in this House. Never once have honourable members opposite had enough courage to stand up and disown that man. The only man who has shown any credit in this matter is the Attorney-General, who at least had the honesty to come into the Parhament and say that there was no evidence. Mr Bjelke-Petersen recently came to Canbena. I think it was in February. He wanted to see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), but the Prime Minister would not see him on that occasion. It was then said that Mr BjelkePetersen had further evidence. I think he ended up going to lunch with the Indonesian Ambassador, or something of that nature. Nobody wished to see him. We are interested in the intelligence of a government that will stoop to that level to try to muck-rake against Ministers in a previous government and to try to bring down that government. Anything will do. What about the Khemlani affair? WhofinancedKhemlani? What about the moneys that went to Khemlani? Did they not come from a knight in Queensland? Who was paying the money? I invite the Government to have a royal commission into what money was paid to Khemlani; from what source in Queensland that money came; and whether it came from a source very close to the Country Party. Does not this add up to the fact that honourable members opposite will do anything to bring down a government? Tonight we have heard a statement which means nothing. Mr Todd, apparently quite rightly, feels that he is entitled to a commission, compensation and reimbursement because he was appointed an Par- attorney by Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, who stated: I hereby appoint you as my financial adviser . . . I ask whether it is any wonder that Mr Todd, in his letter to the Prime Minister, writes: 1 hope both you and Mr Lynch, your Minister for Finance, will take time to peruse this enclosed documentation. Mr Jarman-He did not pass him an envelope.",84
171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,Maybe he did not. Honourable members will notice that we have paid the penalty in the Press for all those accusations. But what penalty have Government supporters paid except the cover up of a Parliament in Queensland? How is it that they can justify their conduct? Which one of them now wants to get up and condemn the Premier of Queensland? They are not game. They do not have the courage because they want still to retain the reins of office on the basis of malicious accusations. We want to make it very clear that if at any time Government supporters felt there was any wrongdoing their duty was to convene a royal commission. If they think so now they should do it and have a look at it ,84
172,Mr HOWARD,OVERSEAS LOANS,We tried to do it in opposition and you denied it.,84
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,Do not talk about what you tried to do.,84
174,Mr HOWARD,OVERSEAS LOANS,We tried to do it in opposition and you denied it.,85
175,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,Please allow me to make the statement about what you can do. Honourable members opposite comprise the Government now and I am prepared to say to them that if they analyse Khemlani's bank account they will see that the funds have come from people closely affiliated with honourable members opposite. If they want to have a look at the accusations(Government supporters interjecting),85
176,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I am making a suggestion that honourable members opposite might want to explore. Also, we go back to the loan raising dealings and the accusations made by convicted criminals in Sydney as to what money was paid to them. It is well known that the present Treasurer was known as the bag man, running round with a stack of money to give money out to people who would make accusations. It is about time we had a look at the people who made the accusations and why they made them, and had a look at their bank accounts. Is it a fact that somebody readily paid his hospital debts in Sydney after making an accusation that was well known to the Treasurer? This is the sort of morality that the Government wants to espouse as being above suspicion. We say it clearly shows that there was never any tittle of evidence to support what the Queensland Premier has done. I hope Mr Burns, the Labor Leader, can bring this to the fore in any forthcoming Queensland election. It shows that Bjelke-Petersen is not fit to hold any office, not even as a company director when he can go to this sort of level to bring down anybody in public life on an innuendo, a smear, with all the attendthere ant Press pubhcity. Money was involved in this case but the face money came from the Queensland and Queensland coffers and those who support the National Country Party in Queensland. It is opposition. about time that was flushed out. We have it here now that perhaps Whitney Todd and Co - it s address is New York-is entitled to compensation. It must come from the Queensland Government. It is about time that Mr Malcolm Fraser, as he is addressed in this letter, took some steps to gest that the Premier of Queensland redeem his debts. He can never redeem his honesty. He can never redeem his integrity. He has lost that for time. Accordingly, while we welcome the statebe ment we deplore the fact that it clearly discloses there was a concerted effort, based on rumour, far back as 2 November to have an investigation to see what the then Opposition could find out about Ministers of the Crown, including a public servant. It has taken until now for it to surface that it was really a facade, an operation in political manoeuvring, to convene a Parliament in Queensland for one day, to make the accusations of curruption under the cloak of privilege. Not until now, until May, do we get the real facts. It did not matter what the then Opposition did. It just had anybody running around the world with all the attendant pubhcity and said: 'We will not take any responsibility as to what they might find out'. Now, apparently the Queensland Premier is prepared to default on meeting his liabilities. I do not know what the nature of the claim is. It is obviously contained in the correspondence, but it would amount to a sum of money. If it does mean that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who is a member of the National Country Party, ought to do something to help Whitney Todd, at least the Australian people would say: 'For goodness' sake, pay your debts in this respect'. Government supporters did nothing but slander people, malign people, and use up the resources of the Queensland Parliament and the Queensland Government without any right at all to do that. They did it on the basis of trying to bring down a government. Fancy, in the last week of an election campaign, convening a Parliament for one day. I think it is about time we said that we hope we have heard the last of this affair except for this factMr Cotter-Si t down.",85
177,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I do not want to sit down until such time as we get an assurance will be an investigation into what money was paid, and honourable members opposite do not want that. They would never be prepared to up to that. I think the British Parliament has Government a higher standing.",85
178,Mr HOWARD,OVERSEAS LOANS,You gagged it while we were in,85
179,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,We never gagged anything at all.,85
180,Mr HOWARD,OVERSEAS LOANS,You did.,85
181,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS LOANS,Is that all honourable sugmembers opposite can talk about? We are talking about a claim that should be investigated. One would think that it was not the Government all making these accusations because it appears to powerless now and unable to do anythingunable even to pay this man's debt. Surely it as could at least help the Premier of Queensland by giving him some money to pay Whitney Todd. So take it as it is. It is the money of a Judas and honourable members opposite know it. The Opposition welcomes the statement but deplores its contents.,85

183,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"The Opposition is acting as if it is in government. It is trying to gag free debate and expression in this House because it is 27 very frightened to hear the facts about itself. Tonight a straightforward statement was made 75 explaining a situation which had arisen as a 48 result of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) calling a Press conference and revealing correspondence which a certain Mr Richard Todd had written to different people. It Jones, Charles Keating, P.J. is quite obvious that this was an exercise to try to divert attention from the Labor Party, especially its Leader, as that Party is going through one of Martin, V.J. Morris, P. F. the lowest periods in its life or of any leader of the Labor Party. Tonight we heard a reply which was nothing more than further vilification of the Premier of Queensland who is so hated by all the socialist forces in Australia because of the conTeUers: tribution he has made to the defeat of a Labor James, A. W. Government in Australia. There will be no let-up on him. Any excuse which members of the Labor Party can find to criticise, to abuse or to misrepresent him they will use. If one likes to take one's mind back to the latKillen.D.J. King.R.S. ter part of last year one will remember that the whole country was in turmoil. Day after day there were fresh revelations of the Labor Party's Lynch, P. R. MACKeUar.M.J.R. involvement in overseas loan borrowings to the point where a question could not be asked in this House or a speech made. Every gesture on the MCMahon, WUliam MCVeigh, D.T. part of the then Opposition to get any information out of the Labor Government was gagged. There was no free speech in the Parhament. It Moore, J. C. Neil, M.J. was a terrifying situation. We had reached a crisis. This was a major contributing factor in the Senate's blocking the passage of Supply. After the blocking of the passage of Supply, while we were in that hiatus, there was a meeting in Melbourne of all leaders of the Liberal Parties Shipton, R. F. Shon, J.R. and National Country Parties of Australia. On that day- I think it was 2 November-in the course of informal discussion among the leaders Staley, A. A. Sullivan, J.W. certain rumours were expressed about people in the Labor Party getting a kick-back from these overseas loans borrowings. It was not just there that rumours were heard. This was the reason for the turmoil in the Labor Party. This was the Tellers: Cameron, Donald reason that 2 Ministers were sacked from the Government. This was the greatest crisis this country has ever seen. Surely nobody will that period. A gentleman by the name of Mr Wiley Fancher was known to have information which could lead to the exposure of some facts. When this was told to the Premier of Queensland he quite willingly said: ' I will invesI tigate this matter. I will get to the bottom of Why should he not? All State governments were implicated by the fact of the Austrahan Council's involvement. The Whitlam Governinformation? ment tried to deceive the Austrahan people by unconstitutional means. It tried to get through an Executive Council minute so that it could go overseas and raise $4,000m-bu t then we find the amount is $8,000m-by quite unorthodox and highly suspicious means. So the Premier of Queensland started an investigation. Between the time that he started the investigation and the time he obtained further information, the Labor Government was dismissed, and rightly so. But one of ditions of dismissal was that there would be no further investigation by the Commonwealth Government into the overseas borrowing affair. That did not have any bearing on the Premier Queensland. He had every right to continue seek whatever information he could, and thank goodness he had the courage and the determinaout tion to find out the facts. Nobody ought to be ashamed of that. What are honourable members opposite frightened of? Are they frightened that there still might be some skeletons in the board which somebody might unearth? Are they trying to intimidate the Premier of Queensland for wanting to get to the bottom of this? caretaker Government of the day had no hand in it. After the election, after the Australian people had vindicated our actions, the Premier brought information to the Attorney-General which was sufficient to warrant a Commonwealth investigamous tion. (Extension of time granted). I thank . House. So an investigation was carried out by Attorney-General who, after assessing the inforof mation that was reported to him, found that he there was no substance in the information and made a statement to that effect in this House 18 March. Why has this matter come up?",86
184,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,"Because you did not pay your bills. Mr ANTHONY We all know that members of the Opposition are desperately looking for any diversion at the moment to try to take the ure off their leader who has been responsible one of the most appalling and disgraceful epivolved sodes in the parUamentary life of this country. refer to his accusations against a late senator this Parliament. They were most shameful. forget honourable member of the Australian Labor knows that they were shameful and disgusting, and can be regarded only as most despicable. I of the know that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) thinks exactly like that and will be very surprised if he does not resign from it.' the Labor Party as a result. Why has this matter been brought up? How did the Leader of the OpLoan position come to be in possession of this",87
185,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,It has not been paid.,87
186,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"The honourable member says that it has not been paid. Who is calling whose bluff? Is there blackmail behind this? How did the Opposition come to get this information? Was the Opposition prepared to pay for it? Who is this man Richard Todd? What is his reputation? It is quite obvious that the Opposition is prepared to make political capital, but how did the conthe Opposition get the documents?",87
187,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,He posted them.,87
188,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"Why should he post them to of the Opposition? The Opposition wants to belittle to the Premier of Queensland, but the Opposition wiU not stop him or intimidate him in carrying any investigation if he thinks there is a major scandal-and that is what there is. There are still a lot of suspicions. They are suspicions about the Labor Party and about the Iraqi money affair. Is cupany man in the Labor Party prepared to say definitely that the Party has not received money from Iraqi sources for its election funds? Is there The any bigger scandal in this country than that affair? There certainly is not. Is there any reason for not being suspicious about the overseas loan affair? Why did the Labor Party go through some unknown intermediary to raise this enoramount of money? I think there is still a lot the more we need to know. Maybe we have not got the to the bottom of the matter. Maybe the Premier Queensland has not succeeded but, my word, did his best to get to the bottom of it. What he did, he did of his own accord. He did it without on the help of the Commonwealth. I think we all have to say",87
189,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,He did it with the taxpayers money.,87
190,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,I can understand the presshonourable gentleman interjecting so vefor hemently because his own company was inin the overseas loan affair. I would like to I know just how deeply it was involved. Its name of has been mentioned. It is Uttle wonder that he Any attacked the Premier of Queensland tonight.,87
191,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I realise that the honourable gentlemen opposite beheve that they can make charges of corruption without any fear of being answered. The right honourable gentleman has just accused the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) of a malpractice. That is out of order in this House unless the honourable gentleman is prepared to move a substantive motion. I suggest that he either withdraw the remarks or take the courage that is required to move a substantive motion. I suggest that rather than deal with fallacious rumour he should get up and move a substantive motion like a man, not a coward.",88
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Lucock)Order! With regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Corio, I would say that the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister would be no stronger in accusation than some of the comments that were made on a previous occasion by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith himself in relation to a previous debate. As I understood it, the right honourable gentleman made no accusation whatsoever but asked a question.",88
193,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,I should like to repeat what I said: It is httle wonder that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is so sensitive about this matter because his own legal firm involved in the overseas loans borrowing affair. That is what I said. Mr Charles Jones-Why do you not have royal commission?,88
194,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"Listen to them talk about a royal commission. Goodness me. When we were in Opposition we pleaded for any sort of inquiry. A royal commission? We moved motions asking fbr an inquiry to be held, only to be gagged and were to be sat down. Yet at this stage they ask for a royal commission. What hypocrisy. At least we John Kerr, were prepared to have an inquiry and statement in this House without being prompted by anybody. Yet today honourable members opmembers posite tried to be smart by bringing in evidence, thinking that it will be embarrassing. It does embarrass this Government. We have made a statement and have revealed all the documentsnot half of them-that were forwarded by Richard Todd to the Prime Minister (Mr muck-rake. Malcolm Fraser). The Leader of the Opposition this morning tried to embarrass or catch the Prime Minister out with a little vague question. But he did not. The Prime Minister told him he had no intention of replying to a letter was written to him by Mr Richard Todd. Obviously the Prime Minister saw that it was a peculiar sort of letter that had a suspicious note to it and he decided that he was not going to get involved in it at all. That is the reason he gave the reply that he gave this morning. Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition had to come forward and reveal the documents. We have nothing to hide. All that is to be hidden is on the side of the Labor Party. I think that Labor Party members are frightened that more is going to come out at some later date. But I do say that the Premier of Queensland ought to be commended and not ridiculed for his actions. He may not have succeeded but he got information that warranted an investigation by the Commonwealth and when we found that the information could not be accurately substantiated we apologised and did it like gentlemen in this House. That is something that we have not been used to as far as the Opposition is concerned.",88
195,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"This is just more evidence of how the coalition connived, deceived and cheated its way into power. We found on examination of the letters that the authority was issued by the Premier of Queensland on 14 November, 3 days after the general election campaign had begun. This was a conscious breaking of the undertaking given by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the was Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the prominent members of the Government to the Governor General that they would abide by the guidelines for the caretaker a Government and that they would not be involved in muck-raking. But we find that they could not be trusted. Let me quote from the letter from Mr Todd to the Prime Minister. It states: Mr Fancher stated that youThat is Mr Fraserworking through Mr Bjelke-Petersen because you had a gentleman s agreement with the Governor General, Sir not to pursue the Whitlam situation until after the to make a general election on December 13. What do we find? We find that honourable opposite broke the spirit of the undertaking that they gave to the Governor General. not Not only did they not abide by the decision when the House did not have confidence in them, but they also did not have the decency to stay within Mr the Governor General's guidelines and not So what did they do? They abided by the letter of the law. They did not have any Government instrumentalities or department out doing their dirty work. They had the Premier of that Queensland doing it by way of an agreement that with the Leader of the Country Party and the Leader of the Liberal Party had arranged with him. The Premier of Queensland issued the letter on 14 November to this character Todd asking him to go and look and to investigate the so called bribery. Not only is the question of the propriety of the activities of the Premier of Queensland brought intoMr Jarman- I take a point of order. May I seek your guidance. Mr Deputy Speaker? Does the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister have any power to direct a State Premier. I ask for your advice.",88
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)Order! No point of order is involved in the matter raised by the honourable member for Deakin.,89
197,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"The point is that the Premier of Queensland was a party to the breaking of the undertaking given by the present Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Country Party to the Governor General. This meant they could not even keep the word they had given. Amongst the material which has been released is a telegram from Mr Todd addressed to Mr Fancher which states: Congratulations on Mi Fraser's victory. When will prepared to proceed with the financing? Do honourable members think that these people were not mvolved in some political machinations? Another letter dated 14 January from the Agent-General of Queensland in London addressed to Mr Todd of the Whitney Todd bank states: When it comes to great guys I can feel I can number you among my acquaintances. This is the sort of relationship that the Agent General of the Queensland Government had with an American banker involved in poltiical muck-raking during the election campaign. The American banker goes on to say in another letter dated 16 February which is addressed to the same Agent-General of Queensland in London: I expect my billing to be paid in full by 1 March 1976. Not only are these people opposite cheats but they are also welshers. They will not even pay for the rotten services that were undertaken upon their behalf. No matter where one looks into the behaviour of the members of the then Oppofor sition last year, onefindsthat they used every conceivable instrument at their their way into power. Honourable members should look at the behaviour of the present Treasurer, Mr Lynch, when he was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It would have a royal commission to find out who financed him in his trips and whofinancedthe hotel biUs and air travel expenses of Mr Andrew Hay who wasronningall over Europe. Who financed them? We will find that three corporation in Australia put the money into the can which was, of course, carried by the present Treasurer (Mr Lynch). He was the bag man in the operation to try to discredit the then Prime Minister and senior Ministers of the Whitlam Government, men who had their names besmirched, all because of cheap poUticking. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) now has to expose his whole party by saying that there was not any evidence of any corruption at all. We find that the movements of Mr Khemlani, who appeared fortuitously during the election campaign and in the time leading up to the dismissal of the Government on 11 November, were financed from the slush funds by the present Treasurer, Mr Lynch. Mr Licardy, a solicitor in Sydney who was representing Khemlani, finally had his bills paid, after Khemlani skipped the country, again by Mr Lynch and probably carried by Mr Hay. This is the behaviour of this despicable party opposite which cheated its way into power. The charge is a substantial one. The charge we you be lay is that the present Prime Ministei of Austialia broke an indertaking that he had given to the Governor General during the time that the Liberal-Country Party was the caretaker Government. These people who did not have a majority in the House of Representatives, these people who lost the previous election and were masquerading as the Government of Australia could not even abide by the agreement they had given to the Governor General even though they were suggesting that the Governor General was acting with completely propriety.",89
198,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,This is before the Government went into office.,89
199,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"It was on 14 Novembei. You are quite wrong. You do not even know. The letter of 14 November 1975 to Mr Richard Todd from the Premier of Queensland states: I hereby appoint you as my financial adviser concerning loan raising efforts by the Australian Government . . . That was 3 days after the campaign started. It just means that the Government will do anything poltiical power. You will cheat, you will lie, you wiU deceive, you wiU break agreements, you disposal to cheat wiU do anything.",89
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member for Blaxland be nice to will withdraw that remaik.,89
201,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"I say it in a corporate sense against the Government. I do not say it against any individual in the Government but against the Government in general, against the Party. did these things.",89
202,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable gentleman is making these accusations in regard to a statementary ment relating to an interjection that I made. take it as a personal innuendo and I ask for withdrawal.",90
203,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,It would be accurate.,90
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The House will come to order. In regard to what the honourhave able member for Blaxland has said, he has been speaking about the caretaker Government and about the individual. In that sense, I would gest that the honourable member for Blaxland withdraw the remark when he said 'you will he'.",90
205,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I that say quite clearly against the former Opposition, the caretaker Government, that in the corporate sense it cheated and hed and deceived its way into power.",90
206,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, as a member of the former Opposition I take strong exception to that accusation.",90
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! This matter establishment has arisen before, and I think that the honourpower. able member for Blaxland will recall that the cusation was made in a general statement. If memory serves me correctly, every individual member of the Opposition stood up and reour quested that it be withdrawn. I would suggest the honourable member that he withdraw the remark.",90
208,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"I will withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker, so that I do not take up the time of the debate. But I can assure you that my feelings stand. The point is that members of the then position were prepared to use any instrument their disposal to try to discredit the Whitlam Government and its Ministers. The matter is still being litigated in the courts in New South obviously dragged on with moneyfinancedfrom the original slush fund which was managed by the present Treasurer. I had occasion during proceedings to illustrate how shoddy the whole thing was. My Lynch accosted me in Kings Hall at about midnight one night during the debate say that he knew more of what was going on in the Treasury than the then Treasurer; that the original leaks about the loans affair came to from the Treasury; that the Opposition used former confidences it had with public servants departments of the Commonwealth while it in government to threaten those people because It when it became the Government it wanted to keep all the information coming in. When the then Opposition finally got into a situation where it could not hide behind parliaprivilege, when the House of RepresenI tatives hadrisenfor the election campaign, when its the caretaker Government had given an undertaking to the Governor General that it would not continue muckraking in the disgraceful way that it had been doing, what did it then do? The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) would given a call to the Queensland Premier and it would have been all sorted out 3 days later. Fraser would have given him a call, and the next sugthing you know he has this character running around over there in London trying to muckrake, trying to get around the letter of the undertaking given to the Governor General. I believe that is a serious charge and that the Prime Minister ought to answer it. The Prime Minister ought to be big enough to come into the House and disclose his dealings with the Queensland Premier, disclose what was a specific undertaking given to the Governor General. That just illustrates the lengths to which the then Opposition, the present Government, the of Australia, would go to get into power, to rob the legitimate government of Even in this Parliament it is obvious that acit is not an elated government. I have never seen my a drearier looking government in my life. When Labor was elected in 1972 we were happy about election, but this crowd look as if they have to stolen the Crown jewels. They know that they have done the wrong thing, that they have cheated their way into power. I have not seen the Deputy Prime Minister looking pallid until tonight. He has not said a word since he took on his ministerial portfolio. The great lions of the OpOpposition a few months ago are now all lying at doggo. Why? It is because they cheated themselves into power, and now the Australian people are waking up to them. They have just elected a Wales, Labor Government in New South Wales, the largest State in Australia. This crowd is now lying doggo, but gradually their dirty behaviour the comes out. Gradually they are being exposed. The dirty work of last year is being exposed. I would like to find out through a royal comto mission where Mr Lynch got the money from and which Australian enterprises contributed. I know which ones they were, but I want it to go on him the record which corporations contributed. Who paid Andrew Hay's hotel bills all through in Europe? Who paid for the flights backwards and was forwards to London chasing up the bankers? Who paid Khemlani? Khemlani is absolutely broke, obviously. Who paid his fares to Austraha all the time? Who picked up Licardy's bills-the Liberal Party. Now its members are afraid. Finally they are exposed by an honest man, their own Attorney-General. They probably will hold his honesty against him because he is not a muckraker like the rest of them. Where is the Prime Minister? He has scurried out of the chamber. Honourable members opposite bring on this matter when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is out of the chamber. They knew that the Leader of the Opposition was not in the House.",90
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, terms Order! I suggest that the House come to order; otherwise the honourable member for Blaxland might not be looking at anybody on either side of the House. I suggest also that on this occasion debate and the House are not being assisted either interjections or encouragement sides when one honourable member is speaking. I suggest that the House spend the remaining minutes of the debate in order.,91
210,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"The fact is that the debate was brought on in the absence the Opposition, and the Government knew that he would not be here tonight. In the absence of the Prime Minister, who is not here to face charges, let the Deputy Prime Minister say whether he was present when Mr Fancher called him from overseas. Let the Deputy Prime Minister say whether he knew about the details of his dealings with the Queensland Premier. He can make a statement. We will give him leave make a statement, to tell us ofhis dealings with the Queensland Premier and to deny that he phoned the Queensland Premier. Let him tell the House of Representatives. Let him stand up tell the truth as a Minister dealings or that the Prime Minister had no dealings. Of course, they cannot do it and they will not do it. Honourable members opposite are gradually being found out for the type of people they They are not interested in parliamentary governEUicott) ment, Cabinet government or democracy. All table, they are interested in is power-nothin g but political power. That is why they have run doggo in the House of Representatives since being elected to office. They are not the jeering brigade they were last September and October on the scent of power. They know that, if had pressed things too far, they were on the edge of civil strife. It was only because the decent people in the Labor Party held the thing back that the country survived. Honourable members opposite were prepared to see family against document. family. They were prepared to see the social fabric of this country ripped in half because they would not wait 18 months for an election. That is the real issue; they would not wait 18 months for an election. All the precedents they have established-the precedent in the Senate, the precedent involving the Governor General, and so on-wil l rebound on them. History has a way of repeating itself and they will be found out for the way in which they came to power. A specific charge has been laid against honourable members opposite tonight by their own Attorney General. Let the Prime Minister come here, be a man, stand up and say whether he did flout the of the agreement with the Governor General, whether he did deal with the Premier of Queensland and what his relationship is with Mr Fancher. Let him for the first time in his life give the an honest statement to the Australian people, by instead of trying to deceive them for his own from both shabby poltiical purposes.",91

221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Blaxland and the Deputy Prime Minister will resume their seats. I warn the House that if there is any more behaviour like this during this debate I will leave the Chair. Serious charges and counter charges have been made in this House tonight. Quite frankly, the behaviour from both sides of this House has been disgraceful. I warn the House that if there is any more behaviour along that hne I will immediately leave this Chair. In reply to the point of order about the personal explanation made by the Deputy Prime Minister, I say that the comments that he made were more general than particular. But in the circumstances, with the honourable member for Blaxland having made a statement and then, when the Deputy Prime Minister was speaking, making an interjection and commenting, I allowed the Deputy Prime Minister to continue with that personal explanation.",92

227,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS, I claim to have been misrepresented.,92
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Treasurer claims to have been misrepresented.,92
229,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, in a very low key, which I think is what this debate now requires, I claim to have been deliberately misrepresented by the previous Labor speaker in this debate and I think by the Labor speaker before him. The House will recall that a number of charges have been laid tonight, as they have been mischievously laid before, that the former Opposition in fact paid money for the purpose of exposing the Labor Party in relation to the loans affair. I have said before, and I repeat here tonight without any qualification whatsoever, that not one cent was paid to any person in this country or overseas for the information which was given freely to the then Opposition for what I believe to have been in the national interest of this country.",92
230,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,You are a liar.,92
231,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,I ask that that be withdrawn.,92
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member for Blaxland knows that that comment is unparliamentary.,92
233,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"Yes , I know that it is unparliamentary, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I withdraw it for the purposes of the Parliament, but the feeling stands.",92
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable gentleman knows that I have asked him to withdraw it. I suggest that he withdraw it unreservedly.,92
235,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"Yes , I withdraw.",92
236,Mr LYNCH,PAIRS,"Secondly , I want to clear the record, as I have done before, in relation to the allegations which the honourable member has made concerning the Federal Treasury. Whatever his recollection is, the assertions that he made in this House tonight are absolutely without foundation. It is a mischievous charge against an important area of the Public Service and I think that it ought to be withdrawn.",92
237,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order. The was Treasurer is making a speech about it and not a personal explanation. As far as I know, he did may not actually own or control the Treasury up until",92
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no Agent-General for point of order.,92
239,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,I claim to have been misrepresented by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). What I said concerning the conversation that I had with the Treasurer can be substantiated by Mr Jost of the Age and Senator Wheeldon who were both present when the conversation took place.,92
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)Because of the discussions and counter discussions I am not quite sure which side had the last call. I call the honourable member for MackeUar.,93
241,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I would be more impressed by the Opposition's call for some inquiry were it not for the behaviour of its members this morning when they endeavoured, by every device available, to frustrate any possibUity of an inquiry into the most grave charges that have been made against their leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). These charges are substantial. They are made on credible grounds. They are the gravest charges ever made against any member of this Parliament in the history of Federation. I simply say that the charges have been made already.",93

243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Dealin g with the for point of order raised by the honourable member for Prospect, I suggest to the honourable memMackellar ber for Mackellar that he is out of order on 2 is counts. Firstly, he is anticipating a debate on subject matter that he has put before the House. Secondly, he is referring at length to matters debated in this House today which in a direct sense do not have relevance to the subject before the House tonight. I rule on both counts that the honourable member is out of order.",93
244,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, made my motion has been withdrawn and it is not on the notice paper. Secondly, the matter was discussed in the House this morning.",93
245,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,It has nothing to do with this debate.,93
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I undermatter stand that the notice has not been withdrawn. Mr Morris-He should tell the truth.,93
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suggest the that honourable members are not helping with their interjections.,93
248,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,The notice has been before withdrawn.,93
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Referring to the second count, the subject matter which honourable member for Mackellar refers to when he speaks about the Opposition endeavouring to frustrate certain events today has reference to what happened in this House today. I again say that he is out of order on both counts.",93
250,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Sir, I will not refer to that subject. I point out that the motion is withdrawn and that is the situation as it is today. The Leader of the Opposition has been the subject of the gravest charges ever levelled against a member of this Parliament, and those charges",93
251,Mr HURFORD,PAIRS,"I take a point of order. The honourable member for Mackellar is transgressing your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have quite rightly said that irrespective of what document has been handed to the Clerk, notice has not been properly given to this House about the motion which was on the notice paper in the name of the honourable member for Mackellar. Furthermore, this debate relates specifically to disthe noting of a statment made by the Attorneyof General. That statement has specific limitations. it The honourable member for Mackellar ought to be asked to stick to the statement made by the member for Attorney-General.",93
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Replyin g to the point of order raised by the honourable member Adelaide, what he said has relevance but I would point out that the honourable member for has made only a brief statement and it not possible at this point of time to fully assess a what he is going to say. I would point out to the honourable member for Mackellar that I have given a ruling and if he continues along the lines he has indicated he will be out of order.",93
253,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I do ask you to rule that my remarks are relevant in this regard: Very grave charges have been against the Leader of the Opposition and the sincerity of the Opposition's whole case tonot night must be assessed in the Ught of those charges, together with the reaction of Opposition members to them. The Opposition is obviously trying to do everything that it can to prevent this being discussed. It is essential that it should be discussed because",93
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I suggest to honourable member for Mackellar that he is debating the subject matter of his notice of motion which I have ruled out of order in using it as an Ulustration in relation to the matter that is the House at this moment. While the honourable member can discuss the subject matter of the paper presented by the Attorneythe General and of which the House is taking note, he should not refer to the matters which are covered in general terms in his motion.",93
255,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Speakin g to the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out that in the substance of the matters tabled you will find significant references to charges made against the Leader of the Opposition and other former Ministers in the former Labor Government. The honourable member for Mackellar is referring to those charges. To date, all that has happened is that members of the Labor Party seem persistent in their efforts to destroy the right of and portunity for the honourable member for Mackellar to speak in this Parliament on this matter.",94
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Commenting on the point of order raised by the Leader of the House, I remind the House that the remark that the honourable member for Mackellar made which I said was out of order was that the Opposition had endeavoured to frustrate him by preventing him from bringing on the subject matter of his motion today. Now, that has no relevance to the matter before the House at the moment. If the honourable member continues by debating other matters that have been mentioned by other speakers during this debate that is another matter. But at this time the honourable member referred specifically to an action of the Opposition in trying to frustrate him in moving his motion, discussion of which I have ruled is out of order. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.",94
257,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I do wish to draw attention to the lack of sincerity which has been evidenced by Opposition members tonight. As evidence of the lack of sincerity in respect of the matter on which I wish to speak, let me mention that Opposition members have been unwilling from time to time- I am not referring to the events of today-to countenance any inquiry into the conduct of their own Leader. I wish to show how disgraceful the conduct of that Leader would be if the charges made against him were true. I think that it is important that I should have the opportumty of reiterating what those charges were, so that the sincerity of the",94
258,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, a statement was made in the House tonight by the Attorney General. It has nothing whatsoever",94
259,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, by what right is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition now speaking? Is he making a speech? What is he doing?",94
260,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,He is on a point of order.,94
261,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I anticipate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is taking a point of order related to the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar.,94
262,Mr UREN,PAIRS,The honourable member for MackeUar is dealing with statements by the Leader of the Opposition. The statement made tonight by the Attorney-General deals with charges made by the Queensland Premier in the the opQueensland Parliament against 2 Ministers in the Whitlam Labor Government. The Attorney General clearly exonerated both those former Ministers. That is what the statement tonight was directed to. That statement concerns the actions of the Queensland Premier and not the actions of the former Prime Minister who is now the Leader of the Opposition.,94
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"In reply to the point of order raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would point out that in the course of this debate the actions of the caretaker Government and various other people and groupings have been raised. To that degree, the ambit of the debate is not strictly narrow. The only ruhng that I have given is that the honourable member for Mackellar should not refer to the subject matter of his notice of motion which is stUl on the notice paper and which refers to the actions of the Leader of the Opposition in this sphere. I suggest, as I said earlier to the honourable member, that he do not carry on in that particular line.",94
264,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have 4 pages of the statement made by the Attorney-General and my colleague has all the appropriate documents tabled. In no way were the actions of the former Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition, in any way involved in either the statement or the associated documents. The honourable member for Mackellar is deliberately trying to turn the debate onto the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition.",94
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he give attention to the remarks that have been made by the various speakers in this debate up to this present stage. Apart from that one particular point to which I have referred the honourable member for Mackellar is in order. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.,94
266,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your ruling. I am endeavouring to test the sincerity of the members of the Opposition during this whole debate by pointing out their sins of omission. I do this by saying that they know perfectly well that the very gravest charges have been made against their own Leader. They are not trivial charges. They are not the kind of charges that have been made tonight. They are charges",94
267,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Seaker, I rise on a further point of order. I again ask you to hsten to the words of the honourable member for a point of order. MackeUar as he speaks about the charges against the Leader of the Opposition. Where, in this statement with which we are dealing, are there any charges against the Leader of the Oppoappear sition? The charges that were made were by the Queensland Premier in a special session of the Queensland Parliament. In Attorney-General clearly wanted to dissociate himself and the Government in every respect from the Queensland Premier. That statement is all about. That is what the associated documents are all about. I ask you, Deputy Speaker, to bring the honourable memhave ber for Mackellar to order.",95
268,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Iriseon the point of order. During the course of the debate speakers from the Opposition, particularly the honourable member for Blaxland, spent most of their time talking about the alleged actions Leaders on this side of the House during the caretaker period. The charges to which the tioned honourable member referred relate to the alstatement leged actions of the Leader of the Opposition during the same caretaker period. I submit that on those grounds the actions to which honourable member for Mackellar is referring are at least as relevant as the allegations made by the honourable member for Blaxland which were not made the subject of time consuming sition points of order from this side of the House.",95
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I uphold the point of order raised by the Minister for Business Consumer Affairs. It is the ruling that I have given in the sense that within the framework of the general discussion the honourable member for Mackellar is entitled to mention the present Leader of the Opposition. He is not entitled-and that is the point I have made-to refer to him would within the terms of the motion that he has on the General Business Paper which refers in particuminutes. lar circumstances and terms to an event. On that account I do not uphold the point of order of Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,95

272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! This is not,95
273,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Mackellar wants to turn this into reverse.

275,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I inform Mr the honourable member for Port Adelaide that I given a ruling on this, and the ruling is that the honourable member for Mackellar is not out of order insofar as he covers the general matter and not the particular matter. I point out to the honourable member for Port Adelaide, as I have pointed out to other members of the Opposition who have taken a point of order, that this is as of relevant as other references that have been made. Names and other matters have been menthat are outside the narrow confines of the made by the Attorney-General. I think the honourable member for Mackellar is in order and I will permit him to proceed. I call the the honourable member for Mackellar.",95
276,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I am saying that the charges made against the Leader of the Oppoare the gravest charges that have ever been made credibly against any member of the Parliament in its history.,95
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The and honourable member's time has expired. Suspension of Standing Orders,95
278,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as prevent the honourable member for Mackellar speaking without interruption for a period not exceeding 15 In speaking to that motion, I think it is relevant the to say that in this House tonight and over the course of the last few weeks we have seen demonstrations of the totaUy irresponsible attitude by members of the Australian Labor Party towards the running of the House. They are not prepared to permit the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) to speak on any occasion in the House. They have chosen to use the Standing Orders and to move motions in their endeavours in this regard. They have chosen to interrupt him in every possible way. I think everyone who is listening to the radio broadcast of the Parhament tonight, as well as honourable members, need to be cognisant of the fact that it is not just a light charge that the honourable member for Mackellar seeks to present in the Parhament. It is not something that is just a product of his imagination. The action of honourable members opposite tonight again demonstrates that they are not prepared to have open debate in the Parliament",95
279,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The not say honourable member for Port Adelaide wishes to raise a point of order.,96
280,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish",96
281,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,He is the great democrat. Let him tell us about what happened,96
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Leader of the House will cease interjecting.,96
283,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"I do not mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the Leader of the House represents the views of the honourable member for Mackellar. Yet he will not put the honourable member on the front bench because he knows that he is an old phoney. I am taking a point order because the Leader of the House is saying in his 10-minute speech to support his motion that the honourable member for Mackellar be given an extension of time all the things that have ruled out of order for the honourable memOrders ber for Mackellar to say. Mr Deputy Speaker, honourable members opposite are just taking advantage of you. Your rulings have been correct and they ought to be upheld. I submit that the Leader of the House ought to be ruled out of order.",96
284,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I call the Leader of the House.,96
285,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I recogwhich nise that most honourable members opposite are immature, inexperienced and inadequate. But also understand that a few of them-to o regrettably-respec t the procedures and practices of the Parliament. I am seeking to ensure that within the Parliament honourable members have an opportunity to speak in a way which desand troys the practice of malicious interruptions which has so frequently taken place when the honourable member for Mackellar tries to speak. It is for that reason that I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders.",96
286,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. I submit that the Leader of the House is reflecting on the Chair when he says that the rulings given by the Chair against the honourable member for Mackellar are designed to prevent the honourable member for Mackellar from speaking in the House. That is an improper reflection upon the Chair and it should not be made.",96
287,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I will deal with the point of order raised by the honourable member for Corio. I hope that the remarks made by the Leader of the House were in relation to points of order taken by members of the Opposition. I will whether this was deliberate or otherwise. I will say that the 3 points of order taken were on exactly the same subject matter. But also let me say in fairness that the honourable member for Mackellar commenced speaking with the same phrase 3 times. I suggest to honourable members that if the Chair gives a ruling, it is most unwise for the honourable member against whom the point of order has been taken to stand up and commence his speech with exactly the same phrase as was ruled out of order. I suggest also that honourable members remember that the Chair is not here for the benefit of any one individual or party, whether it be the Government parties or the Opposition party. The Chair is here to endeavour to uphold the Standing of Orders and to make rulings in debate which will assist in the business and the progress of legislation through the House. That is the reason for my previous ruling. If the Leader of the Governyou ment moves the suspension of the Standing to enable the honourable member to continue his remarks, I do not regard that in any sense as being a reflection upon the Chair.",96
288,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders which I have moved is in no way a reflection on the Chair. It is a reflection on the inadequacies of members of the Labor Party, their unfortunate susceptibility to valid charges have been made against them and the actions by which they have denied the honour I able member for Mackellar, as they have denied few, the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil), any opportunity in this Parliament on successive occasions-durin g adjournment debates; during General Business today-to make a case to state an argument in the Parhament. It is unfortunate that I need to have recourse to a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, but it seems to me that that is the only way by which I can present an opportunity for the very worthy and honourable member for Mackellar to speak in this Parhament. It is for that reason I have moved the motion. I believe that there are very substantive charges which need to be made. The honourable Cotter, member for Mackellar seeks an opportunity to Drummond, P. H. make them. It appears that this is the only way Edwards, H. R. by which he can do so. We on this side of the Ellicon, House have given successive members of the OpFire, W.C. position opportunities which one would regard Garland, as going very close to breaching parhamentary Gillard.R.R. V. proceedings, but we have in no way sought to Good luck, B.J. interfere. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, have equally Graham, afforded them the complete privilege that the Hamer, D.J. Standing Orders provide for them. We seek no Haslem, more than that for the honourable member for Hodges, Mackellar. Therefore I have moved the motion. Howard.J.W.",96

295,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I thank the House very much for having carried the motion because being able to speak without interruption will now give me an opportunity,98
296,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"I cannot hear the speaker while the Liberal and National Country Party members are talking in the corridors of the chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker. If you would ask members of the Liberal and Nauonal Country Parties to be quiet we may be able to hear.",98
297,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will return to his seat. I suggest that honourable members, if they are going out, retire from the chamber as quickly as possible and not stand in the corridors and engage in conversation.",98
298,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"The House has carried a motion that I speak for IS minutes without interruption. That will give me an opportunity to tell the House and the country those things which the Opposition so sedulously wants to conceal, O'Keefe, F.L. Porter, J.R. and let some of the truth be known. The position is that the most serious charges have been made against the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and those charges are not made lightly. They have been made",98
299,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Mackellar that the subject matter before the House has no relation to charges concerning the Leader of the Opposition; it is the statement made by the Attorney General. I suggest that if the honourable member desires to continue his speech his remarks remain relevant to the subject matter before the Chair.,98
300,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"As I understood it, Standing Orders were suspended to enable me to speak without interruption and I would hope I would be able to do that.",98
301,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Standing Orders have been suspended in relation not to the relevance of remarks to the subject matter but only to being able to speak for 15 minutes.,98
302,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The House has carried the motion that I be entitled to speak for 15 minutes without interruption. I am proposing to avail myself of the vote of the House. I wanted to tell the House and the country those things which the Opposition has for so long been trying to conceal.",98
303,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"I rise to order. I ask very seriously Connor, R.F.X. Cameron, Clyde whether a resolution of this House on a motion moved so subtly by the Leader of the House",98
304,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable gentleman will make his point of order.,98
305,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I ask you to bear with me because you have just arrived in the chair. I ask whether the resolution of the House-it may all not have been noticed by a lot of honourable members that the motion moved by the Leader of the House was that the honourable member for Mackellar be allowed to speak for 15 minutes without interruption-ca n override the Standing Orders of this House.",98
306,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I will deal with points of order as they arise. There is no substance in the point of order raised by the honourable member.,99
307,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I hope that the House will observe the terms of its own resolution, that is, that I be allowed to speak without interruption, because I am trying to tell the House and the country of the very grave charges which have been made against the Leader of the Opposition and made with some substance. They amount to this",99
308,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"Iriseto order. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the ruling which was given by the Deputy Speaker who was in the Chair prior to your coming in. He called the honourable member for Mackellar to order and pointed out that he could not speak about matters relating to the leader of the Opposition but had to confine his remarks to the statement made by the Attorney-General earher tonight. That statement- 4 pages of it-say s nothing about any statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, nor do any of the papers which were tabled by the Attorney-General relate in any way to the Leader of the Opposition. I ask you to uphold the ruling of the Deputy Speaker.",99
309,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The terms of the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders were that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Mackellar speaking without interruption for a period not exceeding IS minutes. The matter to which the honourable member for Mackellar must speak is the statement made by the Attorney-General.,99
310,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"If that is your ruling, I move that the debate be now adjourned.",99
311,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I am reminded by the Clerk that the honourable gentleman, having got the call, cannot move the adjournment of the debate. He can ask leave to continue his remarks.",99
312,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,In that case I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.,99
313,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Mackellar resumed his seat and I beheve, therefore, that the call should be on this side of the House.",99
314,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable gentleman has asked for leave to continue his remarks. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition understands the forms of the House. They are quite clear. The honourable member for Mackellar has sought leave to continue his remarks at a later time.,99
315,Mr UREN,PAIRS,We refuse leave.,99
316,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"You refuse leave? All you are doing is enticing the honourable member for Mackellar to continue speaking which, I understand, is what you do not want him to do. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.",99
317,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,Mr SPEAKER ,99
318,Mr UREN,PAIRS,The honourable member for Mackellar had been given the call. Because of your ruling he moved a motion and then resumed his seat. You ruled against his motion. The call then should be to this side of the House.,99
319,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"But he was not able to move the motion which he wanted to move. Therefore, he still has the call and, with the call, he has asked for leave to continue his remarks. I would like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to tell me exactly what course he wishes to be pursued. Does the honourable gentleman want the debate to continue?",99
320,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"I believe that, having resumed his seat after moving a motion that he was not entitled to move, the call should have been given to this side of the House.",99
321,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,No. The honourable gentleman moved 'That the debate be now adjourned'. He was not entitled to so move and I so ruled. He then sought leave to continue his remarks at a later time. I understand that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has refused him leave. So I call the honourable member for Mackellar.,99
322,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Earher in this debate the members of the Opposition were very vocal in calling for an inquiry into certain things and raised a number of topics which were irrelevant to the paper brought forward by the Attorney-General. I want to test their sincerity in this regard. I was saying that, while they were calling so vociferously for an inquiry into matters of smaller moment, they were inclined to swallow matters of much graver moment, that is, the charges that have been levelled against the Leader of the Opposition. I went on to say that by their conduct in this House and elsewhere they were endeavouring to prevent the truth about those charges being made known to the House and the pubhc. I understood-perhap s wrongly-that ",99
323,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Mackellar is again ignoring the rulings of the Chair. He is speaking about the subject matter about which he was asked to desist from speaking by Mr Deputy Speaker and yourself on a number of occasions. He is now, as is not unusual, using a debating device in order to make exactly the same remarks.",99
324,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I will listen carefully to the honourable member for Mackellar (Honourable members interjecting),100
325,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The House will come to order and hear the honourable member for MackeUar in sUence.,100
326,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Thank you, Sir. I was endeavouring to test the sincerity of the Opposition by pointing out that while",100
327,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,Mak e the statement outside. That is a test of your sincerity. The last time you did that you had to apologise. If you do it now you will be in gaol.,100
328,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Corio knows that he is not entitled to make that sort of comment and I ask him to withdraw it.,100
329,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"I withdraw the remark and apologise to you, Sir. I beheve that an honourable member should be prepared to make such a charge against another member outside the House.",100
330,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will not argue the point. Mr Bourchier-Why does the Leader of the Opposition not do that?,100
331,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Government Whip will cease interjecting.,100
332,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,I was pointing out that I did not make the charges; they were made by someone else.,100
333,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will make his remarks relevant to the statement.,100
334,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I am endeavouring to do just that, Sir. I am referring to the sincerity of the members of the Opposition in this debate and I think that, looking at the course of this debate, I am entitled to do so. I am entitled to say that they are obviously insincere in calling for an inquiry into lesser matters while they are so keen to avoid an inquiry into the conduct of their own Leader on matters which are much graver. It is relevant that I should bring up those things which relate to the sincerity of the Opposition in the debate. The charges which have been made and to which I want now to refer in passing",100
335,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable gentleman will not be in order in referring to the charges. He can refer to the statement.,100
336,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I want to refer to their gravity, Sir, because this is a matter which relates to the sincerity",100
337,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.",100

345,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,If you have a point of order to raise I will give you an opportunity to make it.,100
346,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, the point of order. I make is that you have told the honourable member for Mackellar, the greatest old phoney in this House",100
347,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I am quite sure that honourable members wish Parliament to be conducted in a proper fashion. The honourable member for Mackellar will remain relevant. If he does not remain relevant to the subject matter of the debate I will have to continue to draw that to his attention because he has time to speak. I ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide to withdraw the statement that the honourable member for Mackellar is an old phoney.,100

354,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Yes. It is rather difficult, but the honourable member for Prospect was not being parhamentary in his interjection. I ask him to withdraw it.",100
355,Dr KLUGMAN,PAIRS,I withdraw it. All I said was that he was not really old.,101
356,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"That will do. I ask the Howard.J.W. honourable member for Prospect to resume his Hunt, R. J.D. seat. I call the honourable member for Jarman, Mackellar.",101
357,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I ask for your protection. The resolution of the House was Armitage, J. L. that I be heard for IS niinutes without interrupBowen, Lionel tion. I take it that that means that I shall be heard Bryant, G. M. for 15 minutes without points of order being FitzPatrick, taken or other interruptions.

361,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,I have received messages from the Senate returning the following Bills without amendment: States Grants (Schools) Bill 1976 Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (Pension Increases) Bill 1976. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1975-76 Second Reading Debate resumed.,101
362,Mr GRAHAM,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE," I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I remind the House that m these Bills the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has asked the Parhament to appropriate moneys additional to those appropriated under Appropriation Act (No. 1) and Appropriation Act (No. 2) of 1975-76 totalling in all $506,201,000. Of this total, $344,430,000 is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $161,771,000 is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The Bills seek parliamentary authority to make payments under specified heads of expenditure, the need for which has arisen since the Budget was prepared. The appropriations provided in Appropriations Act (No. 1) and Appropriations Act (No. 2) were insufficient for some purposes. Provision is also being made for moneys to be appropriated under heads of expenditure for which no provision was made in those Acts. The amounts included in the Bills are to meet the commitments made by the former Government as well as commitments made for essential and unavoidable expenses under the authority of the present Government. While it necessary to provide further appropriations meet certain expenditures which we consider to be inescapable, I am pleased to be able to say that the savings, as the Treasurer has advised us, under other annual appropriations of the ConLeader solidated Revenue Fund, are expected to total $478.2m. From that basis the debate has ranged very widely. I had intended to devote my speech or as much of it as was available to me, having regard to the circumstances of the moment, to discussion of the economic policies of the Government and the circumstances which have information. led to the development of those pohcies during the last 3 years. In view of the speech of the Leader of the position (Mr E. G. Whitlam) just before the ting was suspended for dinner and having regard to the circumstances at this time, I would hke begin by dissociating myself from any of the comments that the honourable gentleman has made concerning the late Senator the Hon. Sir Shane Paltridge. I feel quite sure that there many members of the Australian Labor Party, both in this place and in another place, would like to see exactly the same thing, particuindeed, larly if they knew the late senator during the many years ofhis long and meritorious service this Parhament. In those circumstances, I felt that at the very begmriing of the debate I would speak to it. I understand that members of the Labor Party have done the same thing. Debate interrupted.

364,Mr NICHOLLS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House to make a personal explanation. I want to make an apology because tonight I named an attendant as being the person who opened the door of the chamber to let out the Prime Minister during a division. My information now is that the attendant did not let out the Prime Minister but that needed one of Mr Fraser's stafflet him out.",102
365,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The point made by the honourable gentleman is in explanation of is his own statement that the attendant had opened to the door. He has now given the House further information. I might reiterate that it is the practice of the House to pair the Leaders ofboth sides of the House, that is, the Prime Minister and the of the Opposition. The fact is that the Prime Minister was paired and was in the House at the time of the doors being locked. It is the practice of the House to allow the Leaders to leave the House in that event. There was nothing a untoward in the matter. As to who opened the door, that is a matter about which I have no I inform honourable members that the Principal Attendant in the House, Mr Sid Riddle, Opretires on 14 May, which is before the House sitresumes. Many honourable members will know him as Sid. He is a very fine man, as I am sure to everybody who has had anything to do with him is well aware. Mr Riddle joined the Department of the House of Representatives as a junior attendant in 1946. He served as Speaker's attendare ant from 1957 to 1967 and was promoted to Principal Attendant in April 1974. He has served who the House and honourable members very well and I am sure that all honourable gentlemen would want me to write to him, conin gratulating him on his service and offering him the very best wishes of the House for his future.",102

369,Mr FRY,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to inform the House of one of the most disgusting and sickening examples of public irresponsibility and dereliction of duty by a member of the medical profession in the long history of the conflict has been going on in Canberra between private and salaried medical oflicers in Canberra hospitals. Late on Monday night an unfortunate young man named Michael Frodyma was involved in a serious motor accident in Canberra. I understand that during a one and a half hour rescue operation Mr Frodyma was attended by salaried medical staff from the Woden Valley Hospital. He was then taken to the hospital to be prepared for an emergency operation, which later required the amputation ofboth lower legs. He was being prepared for the operation by a salaried anaesthetist, Dr Heather Lopert. I have been reliably informed that a private orthopaedic surgeon, Dr MCGonigal, was called into perform the surgery. I have been further informed that Dr MCGonigal refused to work with the salaried officer to perform the operation of amputation. I beheve that the operation was delayed until a private anaesthetist, Dr Allam, was brought into administer the anaesthetic for Dr MCGonigal. According to the latest Press reports, Mr Frodyma's batde for recovery is just beginning. He is still in a serious condition and he has a long hard road ahead of him to recover. This sorry, sordid and incredible episode clearly demonstrates that the serious conflict between salaried and private practitioners in Canberra hospitals has reached a stage which is quite intolerable to the public of Canberra, and should be intolerable to the Government. It is a further link in a continuing series of episodes involving deliberate attempts by private pracspecific titioners to sabotage the salaried officers services in Canberra hospitals. In their unprincipled trator. attempts to undermine the Government scheme, some private practitioners have shown a cruel disregard for the public interest which should not be tolerated in an enlightened society. It also should be made clear that if the present Government had taken a more responsible attitude towards the salaried specialist scheme the Woden Hospital would have been able to appoint its own salaried orthopaedic surgeon, this unfortunate incident would not have arisen, and private practitioners would not be placed in the situation of being able to hold members of the public to ransom, no matter how serious their injuries, in the fight to maintain their own privileged position in society. I hope that the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) will conduct an immediate and urgent inquiry into this episode and take appropriate action against such discreditable conduct.",103
370,Mr FALCONER,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to air the matter of the undercurrent comment and that speculation surrounding the position of Dr Jean Battersby, the Executive Officer of the Australia Council. Dr Battersby has been the subject of a cowardly and anonymous whispering campaign conducted by people who are not prepared to come out into the open. They choose instead to run a campaign of rumour and innuendo through the columns of the newspapers. I know Jean Battersby personally. Ifirstmet her about 9 years ago, although it would be about 4 years since I last saw her. She is highly intelligent, resolute and principled. From that brief association, I believe that she combines an artistic expertise with high administrative competence- a rare combination. In the current underground campaign being conducted within the Australia Council she has been accused of being abrasive and of riding roughshod over others. Is it not strange how we criticise successful women in such terms? A Margaret Thatcher becomes 'the Iron Lady'. A Margaret Guilfoyle becomes 'the Iron Butterfly'. Behaviour which represents commendably strong leadership and resolve in a man is seen as unladylike and unacceptably dictatorial when exhibited by a woman. I venture to suggest that, whatever faults Jean Battersby has as an administrator-sh e might well have faultsshe would not be subject to the same criticism if the name was John Battersby. The complaints about her administrative style it must be seen in the context of the peculiar difficulties of arts administration. I am in no position to comment on the truth or otherwise of any complaints. What I want to do is to point out the difficulties confronting an arts adminisThe first difficulty is that of resolving the conflicts and tensions that arise between the need for efficient adininistrative and nnanciai control on the one hand, and the artistic temperament on the other. Indeed, some people would say that the term 'arts administrator' is a contradiction in terms. Many artists, by temperament, feel constricted by the need to observe the accounting and administrative procedures usually required where taxpayers' funds are at stake. Dr Battersby herself has been quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald- a newspaper which has given more than average coverage to the problems in the Australia Council-as saying: The field of public administration of the arts turbulent area compared with the administration of housing . . . Or perhaps, it just seems this way from where I sit. I suggest that a recipe comprising a mixture of money, administrators and artists, garnished with a social gadfly or two, has a very low boiling point. The second major difficulty, as I see it, is the problem of establishing some measure of success or failure, when trying to evaluate the work of the Council. In a commercial enterprise, profit one measure. In many non-commercial operlar, ations, one can establish various measures of effectiveness. But what measure of cost effectional tiveness can one use with respect to grants to arts? How does one conclude that the work of young artist applying for a subsidy wih contribing ute to the social good in a way that justifies tribution from taxpayers' funds? I am not ing such grants; indeed, I support them. I am merely pointing out the lack of clear definition in this area, a lack of clear definition which enables those who have unsuccessfully apphed for grant to find some basis for any resultant hurt or disaffection they might feel about the Australia Council and to find some supporters for their view. The Australia Council has become well known and has attracted an increasing number of applications for assistance to various artists artistic groups. It seems inevitable that resentstated ment will build up among the increasing number of appUcants to whom the Austraha Council must say'No'. I would make this appeal to those who would criticise Dr Battersby in their anonymous but personalised way: If you must make criticisms, have the courage to attach your name to the critior cism, or be sUent. If you do have criticisms, them forward in a way that helps us to evaluate the progress and contribution made by the great Australia Council, so that informed and responfrom sible policies can be evolved. There have been specific criticisms of the 1973-74 accounts of the Australia Council made by the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament. Those criticisms must be noted and assessed. But that was, in many respects, a transition year for the Council. What we must have now is some calm and informed comment on the development and activities of the Council since that time. I invite the anonymous critics to undertake that task.",103
371,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I want to press a matter which I raised with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at question time this morning. This is the visit to Australia of Mr Jose Martins, the former President of the is a fairly Kota Party of East Timor. As honourable gentlemen know, Mr Martins came to Australia to me earlier this week at the invitation of the Australian Journalists Association. It should be stressed that the AJA also paid Mr Martins's expenses. I do not want to go into detail on facts which should be well known to everyone in this House. Briefly, Mr Martins has thrown new light on the deaths of 5 Australian television journalists is at Balibo, East Timor, late last year. In particuhe has challenged the official version of how cost these young men met their deaths. The convenview which has been pushed hard by the the Department of Foreign Affairs is that these 5 a men met their deaths by misadventure. Accordto this version, they were accidentally killed a conwhen they were caught in a crossfire during the opposcapture of Balibo by Indonesian troops. Mr Martins has stated in the strongest possible terms that this is not true. He has said that the journalists were gunned down quite dehberately and a quite callously by Indonesian troops. According to Mr Martins, they died in cold blood as the result of a premeditated order by the Indonesian commanders. These officers knew that Australian newsmen were in Balibo and they ordered their men to kill them. There or can be no doubt about this; Mr Martins has it in the bluntest possible terms. He has stuck to his story under persistent questioning. Furthermore, he has brought to this country a grisly testimony in the form of bone fragments. Mr Martins claims that he collected these bones after the bodies of the newsmen were burnt. It is not my role to cross-examine Mr Martins to try and establish conclusively the value of put the evidence he has put forward. There is no doubt in my mind that Mr Martins is a man of courage. It is true that he has switched sides strong support for Indonesia to extreme hostility. At the same time he has taken grave risks in pushing the question of the Australian newsmen in the way that he has. He has come to Australia and he has brought evidence with him, and for these reasons he must be taken seriously and heard. The Australian Journalists Association is trying to get at the truth of the deaths offiveof its members. Why shouldn't this Parhament? In my view, it should be put to the Joint Parhamentary Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs. In particular, Mr Martins must stay in Austraha and be given the chance to put his aUegations to this Parliament through the Joint Committee. For this reason, I urge the Government to extend Mr Marlins's visa and arrange for him to appear before the Joint Parhamentary Committee on Tuesday, 11 May. At question time this morning I urged this course on the Prime Minister. Mr Fraser made it clear that he thought it should be left to the AJA and the Department of Foreign Affairs to interview Mr Martins. In my view, this approach is completely unsatisfactory. I do not chaUenge the integrity of the AJA: to my mind it has gone to extraordinary lengths to hunt out the truth on this matter and to safeguard the interests of its members and their families. I made clear in the House on Tuesday that I do challenge very strongly the integrity of the Department of Foreign Affairs on this matter. As I said on Tuesday, there is no doubt in my mind that people in high places in the Foreign Affairs Department conspired to mislead the Australian Government and the Australian people on this issue. This is not a blanket condemnation of the Department of Foreign Affairs; I acknowledge the integrity of most of these officers. On all the evidence, there is an element of officers who have disregarded the rules of impartial advice. They have taken sides with the Indonesian Generals. Mr Martins has said repeatedly that on two occasions he gave information on the deaths of the 5 newsmen to Foreign Affairs Department omcers. Thefirsttime was in Geneva and the second in Lisbon. If this is correct, there is reason believe that this information was transmitted back to the Australian Government either incompletely or in a distorted form. Mr Martins has also claimed that this information was conveyed to the Indonesian Government by the Foreign Affairs Department. Again it is not my job to test these claims; it must be plain, however, that what Mr Martins has said raised grave suspicions about the Department's involvement in the tragic aftermath of the Bahbo invasion. For this reason our Foreign Affairs Committee should interview Mr Martins. It should not left to the Foreign Affairs Department. We' not want Caesar judging Caesar. In my view, the proper course is for Mr Martins to be invited to appear before the Joint Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs of this Parliament.",104
372,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,105
373,Mr SHORT,ADJOURNMENT," I want briefly tonight to draw to the attention of the House the major problems facing many rural industries in my electorate of Ballaarat and surrounding areas. This appUes particularly to the beef, sheep and dairying industries. There are various reasons for these problems-unrealisticall y low prices, lack of markets, inflation due to the extravagances of the previous Government and the lack of stock feed due to drought conditions. Rainfall in the first 4 months of 1976 in my part of Victoria is amongst the lowest ever recorded. Several inches of rain are needed quickly or there wiU be little or no feed for stock during the winter. Already many head of stock are being shot because farmers cannot afford to buy feed. The feed for one week frequently costs more that the gross price that the stock brings at market, and that excludes the transport cost of getting it there. Recently in my electorate one farmer sold 50 sheep and got a gross return of $2.50 for the lot. The problems are too great and diversified to deal with anywhere near adequately tonight. I therefore will restrict my remarks to the essentials. Several of these industries have long term problems that they, together with government, will have to tackle. Some of these-for example, forms of better production control and marketing methods-essentiall y are matters for the producers themselves to work out. Others-for example the development of better and more assured access to overseas markets-ar e very much a matter for government in co-operation with producers. These medium to longer term to problems, by definition, can be solved only in the medium to longer terms, but there are immediate problems. Improved unemployment benefit criteria for farmers will help, but there still will be a cash flow crisis. This present problem is hitting the younger innovative farmers when the average age of farmers is increasing disturbingly. Low prices and lack of feed make it impossible to switch from one production to another. Many farmers are now below the poverty level, having nil or negative incomes. I am pleased to note the be improved prospects for some products; for do example, on the beef markets. As well, the Government hasfirstand foremost as a number one priority a reduction in inflation and that, will help. But these aspects will not solve mediate problem. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is desperately worried and is working hard on the problems. I wish to put to him urgent need for the closest co-operation with Victorian Government to examine and to deal with the immediate problems of cashflow.What producers need is access tofinance.The rate interest is important, but the sheer availability funds is even more important. This does not necessarily suggest that the Government need the provider of thatfinance.But there is sponsibUity on the Government to persuade the banking andfinanceindustry to look sympathfrom etically at the present position. It is people who are involved just rural products. It is a human problem, not East, includingplaces just an economic problem. However, even looking just at the economics of the matter, I point out that several of the rural industries most affected, and in particular the beef industry, amongst the most efficient of our industries Austraha and indeed in the world. It would tragic if these industries were to be permanently damaged by the present confluence of disastrous circumstances. It must not happen. As a related issue, I wish to raise the question of the relaan tionship of the prices received by rural producers for their products, particularly stock, and prices that are being paid by consumers at the retaU level. To me there is a very great discrepmiums. ancy between the two. It is one that I find tremely difficult to understand. I hope that Government will look very closely at the possicompany bUity of instituting an mquiry in this area.",105
374,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The matter that I wish to raise briefly concerns administration of the Minister for Post and communications (Mr Eric Robinson). It is a matare ter that is having a very serious effect on the livery of news presentation in Austraha. Journalter ists and cine cameramen employed by the Aussuch trahan Broadcasting Commission are refusing to go on any unscheduledflights-that is, charter flights. Royal Austrahan Air Forceflightsor Sermeetings viceflights-because of the pitifully inadequate reimbursement that their famUies would receive in the event of death or injury. I am told that Government has forbidden the ABC to provide life assurance for employees engaged in Journalists unscheduled or hazardous flying. It apparently has told the ABC that its employees must fall line with the compensation offered the famUies of other public servants under the Air Accidents (Australian Government Liability) Act too, 1963-1973. This Act provides a sum of $30,000 the imto an employee's fanuly if he is kUled in an unscheduled flight. Until recently, the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission has provided life assurance of the $18,000 and has arranged with the assurance the company providing the cover to extend an extra $20,000 at nominal rates to be taken up privately by the employee. This total of $38,000 has beof come obviously inadequate, particularly when of compared to the still inadequate $75,000 provided to newspaper journalists and cameramen be under simUar circumstances in the Metropolitan a reDailies Award. However, even this $38,000 coverage has been discontinued on instructions the Federal Government. The ABC has stopped also a special coverage of $50,000 for overseas correspondents on hazardous assignin this crisis, not ments in such as Belfast and the Middle Lebanon. The Air Accidents (Australian Government LiabUity) Act is so constructed as to absorb any are additional assurance carried by the employee. in Thus, if the employee carried personal assurance be of, say, $20,000, that sum would be deducted from the $30,000 avaUable to the employee's fanuly in the event of death, and the Government would provide $10,000 only. Thus, even if employee wished to take out his own personal assurance to provide, say, $20,000 more than the the Act would give, he would have to insure for $50,000, carrying $30,000 worth of useless preThe situation is complicated also by the exfact that most personal Ufe assurance policies the have an 'out' clause exempting the insurance from liability in the event of death on an unscheduled flight. More often than not, Australian Broadcasting the Commission journalists and cameramen called Teleon to undertake unscheduledflyingassignments flying in conditions that are hazardous in dethemselves. For instance, they are using helicopor serviceflightsto cover natural disasters asfloodsor bushfires and charterflightsto flood-bound airstrips or remote locations not serviced by regular airlines. ABC cameramen at in Sydney and in other States have decided not to fly unless they are provided with life assurance of at least $125,000 on unscheduled the flights. Following meetings ofjournalists in Sydney and other State capitals the Australian Association has instructed its members employed by the ABC not to undertake any in unscheduled flying until an adequate cover is provided. The Sydney meeting advised the AJA that it felt that such a cover would be based on a sum calculated at 10 years salary at B grade journalists' rates. It was felt that a sum based on salary rates rather than a flat amount would guard against erosion of the value of the insurance through inflation. The journalists also asked the AJA to seek provisions similar to those in the Metropolitan Dailies Award by which the employer must indemnify the employee against invalidation ofhis own personal life assurance policies through unscheduledflying.The ABC, with its journalists and cameramen grounded for all but scheduled nights, has been negotiating with the Public Service Board for the right to provide its own Ufe assurance again, but so far these negotiations have been unsuccessful. The AJA is also asking the ABC to provide adequate hfe assurance for journalists on other hazardous assignments both in Australia and overseas. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications might have an early look at this matter to see that justice is done and so that the Austrahan public will not unfairly be deprived of an effective news presentation which is at present occurring as a result of this dispute.",106
375,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I should like to discuss the moral and strategic imphcathat tions to this nation of overseas aid. I remind honourable members and I remind myself no political Party has the monopoly of compassion. Most of us here have received letters from many friends and many people connected with overseas aid. The majority of us have received pleas from the churches and church leaders. Historically I suppose overseas aid had its origins in the efforts of the old colonial powers to maintain their settlements abroad. In this generation it is correct to say that overseas aid is exemplified first by the Marshall Plan- a child of the generous people of the United States. Recendy 2 world factors have caused a serious problem for us all-the popuFry). lation explosion and unemployment. So overseas aid has become one of the most pressing issues  the United Nations Economic and Social Council accurately forecast what was going to happen in the sub-continent of India and South-East Asia. Australia is a small nation situated amidst this confusion. It is the only developed area the South Pacific. Therefore the mantle of overHealth seas aid has fallen upon us in such a way that it is on not simply a moral duty but one of national survival. I trust that this robe will not become like the robe of Nessus. Let me say straight away that the record of Australian aid is one of the best possible in the world. Starting with the Colombo Plan there is absolutely nothing about which this nation can feel ashamed where aid to Papua New Guinea or South-East Asia is concerned. Our present problem, of course is now more urgent in regard to aid for Africa. The Government must start thinking about this. Overseas aid takes many forms-grants , food, international bodies and projects. I am particularly interested in the remarks of the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) about what we should do with all the dried milk. I suggest that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should have a look at the matter and see whether we cannot convert this milk into tablet form. Overseas aid in 1974-75 was $328m. This year it will be $352.9m-0.51 per cent of the gross national product. This is well on the way to what we promised the United Nations. I am perfectly convinced that unless inflation is brought under control and the economy is put on a sound basis there will be no foreign aid. So I say to my friends in the schools, universities and churches: 'Remember this one thing: A Liberal government will honour Liberal philosophy. Even if now we have to defer the action of giving full foreign aid we will take it later'. I am quite certain that those listening to me will understand this is only a short transitory period and the Government in due course will take steps to see that that its commitment is fully honoured.",107

I rise to reply to the remarks made by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr I thank him very much for giving me notice that he would be raising the matter that he raised of tonight. I, too, extend my sympathy to the victim who was so badly injured in the motor car smash in Woden on Monday night. I have heard several accounts of the incident. If the report referred to by the honourable member for Fraser is correct, I can only express my sorrow and horror. I give all the honourable member an assurance that I have in caUed upon the Australian Capital Territory Commission to furnish me with a report the incident as a matter of urgency. Unfortunately, the former Government created divisions amongst the salaried and private speciaUsts in the Australian Capital Territory. Most of the doctors, salaried and private alike, in Canberra are men of good will. There are extreme views amongst them on both sides. One thing is abundantly clear In the pubhc join interest and in the professional interest there must be a speedy reconciliation so that the docdevising tors can work as a team in the public interest. have already spent some considerable time the change of government in trying to improve the relationship and in creating an atmosphere of trust amongst the Canberra doctors, private. I will rontinue to devote my energies achieving this reconciliation amongst berra doctors. To this end I have asked both the Council of Salaried SpeciaUsts in the A.C.T. and the Austrahan Capital Territory Medical Association to me in a round table conference at the earliest opportunity so that they can play their part in regulations and rules under which they I themselves can work together in the Canberra since hospitals in the public interest.",107

(2) If so, what proposals did Australia put before the Council for a cereal reserve system. (3) What was Australia's attitude to the United States' proposal for a reserve of 30 million tons.",108
381,Mr ANTHONY,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A meeting of the International Wheat Council's Preparatory Group was held in the week commencing 29 September 1975. Australia participated in that meeting, the third in a series of meedngs of the Group. meeting was held on 19-21 January 1976. The Preparatory Group, which was established largely as a result of an Australian initiative, is charged with examining possible for a new international arrangement to replace the current International Wheat Agreement. It repons to the International Wheat Council. Its work is exploratory and designed to prepare the way for a negotiating conference. A technical sub-group of the Preparatory Group has now commenced an examination of the technical issues in that volved in proposals which have been advanced for the incornatural poration of various provisions in a new agreement. (2) The Preparatory Group has examined 20 papers submitted by individual delegations and by the IWC Secretariat. These included an informal paper by Australia outlining a possible role for a system of price triggers in an international arrangement containing provisions for the accumulation and release of reserve grain stocks. The paper also referred need for a system of consultations to co-ordinate action exporters and importers and also to safeguard commercial grains markets. The concept of price triggers has since been refined considerably by the Secretariat in subsequent discussion in the Preparatory Group but there is, of course, no commitment to include price triggers as a mechanism in new Agreement. A further paper was circulated by Australia meeting of the Group. This paper of differences within the Group concerning the operadon of a reserve stocks scheme, more work needed to be carried out. This work commenced when the technical sub-group of the Preparatory Group met on 24 March. represented at this meeting. (3) The US. proposal for a reserves scheme was discussed at the Preparatory Group meeting on 29-30 September 1975 but was considered by other members of the Group to adequate by itself as a basis rangements. Nevertheless, Australia welcomed the US. proposal as a contribution to further discussion and clarification of the issues involved in ensuring The Australian delegation to the January meeting of the Preparatory Group put Australia's view that could be best assured by a package of measures which would ensure the availability of stocks and theflowof supplies to world markets, and suggested that any agreement would need to provide a balance of benefits for both producers NA upon notice were circulated: by dealing with both shortage and surplus situSystem ations. The US. proposal appears to emphasise a shortage situation. The Australian delegation argued that to the extent (Question No. 104) that the concept of world foodsecurity involves ensuring that adequate production is fonhcoming. Any new agreement need to involve mechanisms aimed at avoiding situations in which efficient producers do not receive adequate prices for their product on world markets. The US. proposal does not contain any direct reference to price. The US. has suggested a reserve figure of 30 million tonnes of grain. However, it is generally accepted that the reserve stock level which might be incorporated in any agreement would be a matter for negotiation Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme (Question No. 207) Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Will the proposed Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme include grain and horticultural crop losses from either flood, The most recent hail, fire or drought. (2) What other forms of agriculture will be included in the bases scheme, and what other forms of natural disaster. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable in nature member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In a statement on 4 March 1976 I announced the Government had decided in principle to introduce a disaster insurance scheme and had approved the establishment of a working party of officials to formulate a scheme in consultation with the insurance industry. The working party's terms of reference do not extend to considerauon of the question of insurance of grain and horticultural crop losses against natural hazards. This question has been under separate consideration for some time and the to the working party has been asked to keep in mind that any by scheme introduced following completion of its task should be capable of being associated with whatever arrangements that might be decided upon regarding the insurance of crops. As pan of this separate examination of crop insurance, the a insurance industry, through its Insurance Conference Committee, is examining the feasibility of establishing an insurance pool for the purpose of increasing the availability at the January of natural disaster crop insurance. concluded that, in the light In addition, the Industries Assistance Commission is conducting an inquiry into rural incomefluctuations,and its findings should be relevant to natural disaster insurance for Australia was agricultural products. Any Government decision on the question of natural disaster insurance for agricultural products would be made in the light of the repons of the Insurance Conference Combe inmittee and the Industries Assistance Commission. for a new international grains arButter and Oilseeds Industry (Question No. 217) greater world food security. Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Primary world food security Industry, upon notice: (1) Are the butter industry and oilseeds industry in Australia facing unfair competition from margarine and manufactured from cheap imponed palm and coconut oil. (2) If so, is this oil produced under coolie working conditions in Malaysia where the workers earn between the equivalent of SA2-3 per day. (3) Is the present Australian only 30c per gallon. (4) Is the price quoted for palm oil approximately a tonne CIF, compared to the price of Australian sunflower and safflower oil of $600 per tonne delivered into store Sydney. (5) If thesefiguresare correct, will the order to protect these 2 Australian industries (a) place a quota on imported oils and (b) increase the duty figure.",109
382,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Palm and coconut oils are presently not major ingredients of margarine and would account for only a minor percentage, perhaps 10 per cent, of the total oils and fats used in margarine preparations. They are used principally in industrial and cooking margarines. Their most common use is for edible products other than margarine for which their specific characteristics make them most suitable. They presently do compete to a degree with domestically produced oils. With the development of new technological processes, palm oil in particular, is becoming more adaptable in its end uses and its competitiveness vis-avis other oils is expected to continue to increase. (2) The principal suppliers of these oils to the Australian market are Malaysia in the case of palm oil and Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Malaysia for coconut oil. Almost the entire world output is in tropical developing countries where labour costs generally are significantly below those of developed countries such as Australia. (3) No. Coconut and palm oils are permitted duty free entry. (4) The prices quoted are substantially correct. However, palm oil is not a direct substitute for the polyunsaturated sunflower and sufHoweroils in many applications. Moreover, in some instances, the cost of palm oil is increased by the need for further refining for a simple comparison of prices for unrefined oil without regard to other factors does not give an accurate indication of the extent to which palm oil is competitive with locally produced oils. (5) It is the Government's policy to seek the advice of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) or the Temporary Assistance Authority (TAA) on matters related to assistance to industry against import competition. A matter is referred to the IAC or the TAA if it can be demonstrated that a prima facie case exists for reviewing the existing I am advised that the Department of Industry and Commerce recently completed an examination of a request from the oilseed crushing sector of the industry for urgent temporary protection against imports of vegetable oils and concluded that a prima facie had not been substantiated at that time. However, following further consultations with the industry the Department has undertaken to review the case for a reference to the TAA as soon as additional information is provided by the industry. I am further advised that the Department has initiated discussions with all sectors of the industry concerning the possibility of a reference to the IAC on the long term assistance needs of the industry. Commonwealth Foreign Investment Committee (Question No. 316) Mr MACKenzie asked the Treasurer, upon duty on these imported oils notice: (1) What is the present status and purpose of the ComSA321 monwealth Foreign Investment Committee. (2) Does the committee have significant powers through at the exchange control mechanism to direct foreign companies to establish operations in Australia away from the major Government in centres of Sydney and Melbourne. (3) Can the committee be developed as a major vehicle for to a realistic national decentralisation in Austraha. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The previous committee, which was called the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee, was an advisory body only. So too is the recently announced Foreign Investment Review Board (for details, see Hansard of 1 April 1976, pages 1287-1288). It has no executive powers. Decisions on foreign investment matters are taken by the Treasurer after consultation with appropriate Ministers. (2) and (3) Where exchange control approval is required in respect of a proposal falling within the ambit of the Government's foreign investment policy, the Reserve Bank has the authority under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations and section 39 of the Banking Act 1959-1974 to withhold approval until the Government has indicated that the proposal is not inconsistent with that policy. Foreign investment proposals are considered against the criteria set out in the Attachment to my statement 'Foreign Investment in Australia' to the House on 1 April last (see Hansard, page 1290). These criteria include consideration of whether the proposal would conform with the broad objectives of national policies concerned with, among other things, decentralisation and the environment. Insurance Brokers and Agents (Question No. 327) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent collapse of a Melbourne insurance broker and agent, K. B. and L. J. Roberts Holdings Pty Ltd. particular end uses. Accordingly, (2) If so, can he say whether the collapse of this company has left many of its customers without insurance cover. (3) Can he also say whether a number of insurance companies have been left without premiums having been paid, and liabilities they were not aware of, as a result of the collapse. (4) In view of the urgent need for legislation and regulation for insurance brokers and agents, will he give urgent consideration to introducing the long promised brokers level of assistance. legislation. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. case for a reference to the TAA (2) and (3) K. B. and L. J. Roberts Holdings Pty Ltd is not subject to any current Commonwealth insurance legislation and I am, therefore, unable to provide details regarding the company's trading activities. (4) I refer the honourable member to a statement by my colleague, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, on 9 April 1976 announcing the Government's intention to introduce legislation for the supervision of insurance brokers.

(2) Has the Minister's attenuon been drawn to the savings in terms of capital costs and consequent efficient manufacture which wili flow from the formation of a consortium to produce 4-cylinder engines at Lonsdale. (3) Is it proposed to impede the progress of this venture by asking the Australian Industry Development Corporauon not to join the proposed consortium. (4) Why has the Minister not responded to the applications by Nissan and Toyota to manufacture passenger motor vehicles in Australia. (5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the repercussions of this delay on the planning for the future of component manufacturers in Australia who would gain considerable new business from the entry of these companies. (6) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Industry Assistance Commission's report on the passenger motor vehicle industry released on 31 October 1975; if so, does it predict that any long-term delay in the re-sourcing of high cost components could threaten the viability of the industry and lead to far greater employment consequences than if there is a return to the very high protection of the past. (7) Will the Minister give the 85 per cent plans the goahead, and encourage the movement towards more economic activities such as the joint Nissan/Toyota/Chrysler/AIDC engine plant at Lonsdale. (8) Is it a fact that the uncertainty which presently surrounds the passenger motor vehicle industry is placing in jeopardy a soundly based new venture at Lonsdale in South Australia which would be capable of employing over 1000 additional people initially, and offers prospects for additional related employment in the longer term.",111
387,Mr HOWARD,AMMUNITION,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (4) and (5) The Government has approved the appliis cations of Nissan and Toyota to enter the 85 per cent comspecified pany average local content Plan subject to these compames Location of reported thefts or losses Stolen/lost Recovery details Stolen during Exercise Iron Stolen Recovered from servicemen 1 x Mortar simulator Man, in the Singleton 1 x Grenade simulator training area, N.S.WT Holsworthy Range, N.S.W.

(Question No. 153) (2) The Government is well aware of the advantages of rational development of four-cylinder engine manufacture, rather than fragmented production in several locations. Consequently it authorised the Minister for Industry and Commerce to hold discussions with both established and new manufacturers to explore possible arrangements for production of all Australian requirements of four-cylinder engines, including the proposal for their production at Lonsdale. (3) The AIDC is free to decide on the basis of its normal criteria whether or not to participate in any four-cylinder engine consortium that may be formed. (6) Yes. The Government accepted the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations on the question of component resourcing. (7) The Government has adopted an 85 per cent company average local content Plan which incorporates some significant modification of previous arrangements, and is encouraging movement towards more economic activities (see answer to question (2) above). (8) No. The Government's recent policy decisions, which I announced on 30 March 1976, removed a great deal of the uncertainty which has bedevilled this industry in recent years. As explained in (2) above, the question of fourcylinder engine production is under active consideration by the Government and the motor vehicle companies. Motor Vehicle Policy (Question No. 308) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice: (1) Does the removal of the non-reversion clause in the passenger vehicle manufacturers plan remove protection from major component manufacturers such as Borg-Warner in Albury-Wodonga. (2) Will manufacturers be permitted to impon panels which are at present manufactured in Australia.",114
388,Mr HOWARD,AMMUNITION,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) The essential feature of the 85 per cent company average local content plan for passenger motor vehicles that vehicle builders undertake to achieve and maintain levels of local content in return for duty free entry of residual componentry. Without this concession, there would be no incentive for vehicle builders to participate in the plan and therefore no guarantee that any componentry would be sourced locally. The plan therefore provides a substantial degree of protection to component manufacturers generally, and will continue to do so until at least 31 December 1984. Removal at the end of 1976 of the existing control over reversions will give the vehicle builders freedom to determine which components they will source locally to make up their 85 per cent local content and which they will import to make up the remainder. Whether the imports include panels, transmissions, engines or other componentry will be a matter for the commercial company. Motor Vehicle Policy Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice: Will companies marketing a range of passenger vehicles be allowed to enter selected models under the 85 per cent plan to the disadvantage of existing manufacturers.",114
389,Mr HOWARD,AMMUNITION,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: New manufacturers may participate in the Plan initially on the basis of an individual model meeting the local content requirements or on the basis of two or more models meeting the requirements. By-law concessions will not be available for models which have not been entered in the Plan. However, from 1 January 1980, new manufacturers will be required to achieve 85 per cent local content over all vehicles they manufacture or assemble in Australia. These arrangements will not disadvantage the existing manufacturers. Motor Vehicle Policy Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing upon notice: the Minister representing the Minister for Indus- (1) try and Commerce, upon notice: Over what period will new entrants manufacturers plan be allowed to reach the 85 per cent local content average.",115
390,Mr HOWARD,AMMUNITION,"The Minister for Industry and for Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: New manufacturers will be local content in accordance with the following timetable: 1 January 1976-621 4 per cent 1 January 1977-7 0 per cent 1 January 1978-7 5 percent 1 January 1979-80 percent 1 January 1980-8 5 percent Motor Vehicle Policy Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the MinisterforIndustry and Commerce, upon notice: (I) Will manufacturers entered under the New Passenger Car Plan be permitted to import completely-built-up and completely-knocked-down vehicles outside the plan's operation. (2) Will these imports be included in the allowed 15 per cent imported content, or treated as separate operations outside the plan. (3) Will cars imponed from parent companies who are in the 85 per cent plan by other than the Ausualian entrant in the plan, i.e. large retailers or subsidiary or dummy companies, be outside the operation of the plan.",115
391,Mr HOWARD,AMMUNITION,"The Minister for Industry and decision of each vehicle Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Manufacturers will be permitted to impon completely(Question No. 310) built-up vehicles outside the Plan's operation provided they have allocations under the impon quota arrangements which are to apply until 31 December 1976. In certain circumstances, both established and new manufacturers will be permitted to impon completely-knockeddown vehicles outside the Plan's operadon during the phasing period, i.e. until 31 December 1978 in the case of established manufacturers and until 31 December 1979 in the case of new manufacturers. Of course the by-law concessions available for Plan vehicles will not apply to such imports, which will be subject to normal duty and tariff quota arrangements. Following the conclusion of the phasing period, manufacturers will not be permitted to impon completelyknocked-down vehicles outside the Plan. (2) These impons will be treated as separate operations outside the Plan, i.e., to the extent and during the period that Plan manufacturers are permitted to engage in such importations. (3) The reference to importation by retailers indicates that this pan of the quesuon refers to fully assembled cars. Such imports fall outside the operation of the Plan, regardless of the identity of the importer. Civil Aviation: Commuter Airlines (Question No. 330) (Question No. 311) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Transport, Was any direct financial assistance made available by the Australian Government to commuter type airlines during into the vehicles the last 2 years. (2) If so, (a) what airlines were involved, and what was the amount of assistance received, (b) what was the reason granting the assistance and (c) in what States do the airlines operate. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable required to achieve 85 per cent member' s question is as follows: (1) Yes, selected commuter operators (as distinct from airline operators) were given financial assistance.

(2) What proportion of these movements were attributable to (a) trainee pilot training, (b) charter work, (c) aircraft servicing and maintenance and (d) private flying?
