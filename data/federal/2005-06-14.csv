2,The SPEAKER,WHITE POWDER INCIDENTS,"Members may be aware that over the last two weeks Parliament House has experienced three incidents where white powder has been found in letters delivered to the building. In stances the substances were found to be nonhazardous. Unfortunately, parliamentary security staff have detected a further suspect package in the loading dock this morning. As a result of the earlier incidents, mailscreening procedures have been enhanced from this morning to reduce the risk of letters containing hazardous substances entering the building. This will include the introduction of a second level of screening. The new screening procedures may delay the delivery of mail to members' suites. However, the President and I consider this action to be necessary while we are experiencing an increase in these incidents. Members and their staff should also be looking out for any suspicious mail and if in doubt should not open the suspect envelope. Instead, they should contact Parliament House security on telephone extension 7117, where they will be given instructions on what action to take. I regret that these measures have had to be taken, and the President and I strongly condemn the behaviour that has made this a necessity. NA Private Members' Bills",17
3,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the public statements of the member for Kooyong that he will proceed with his private members' bills dealing with a more humane system of mandatory detention. Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to the House that these bills will be given precedence and that in the next two weeks these bills will be debated and voted on?,17
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Budget 2005-06,17
5,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasall inurer inform the House of developments which will see the delivery of a tax cut for all hard working Australians by 1 July 2005?,17
6,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I think I can now advise the House that all Australian income taxpayers are likely to get their income tax cut on 1 July this year. The attempt by the Labor Party to block tax cuts for hard working Australians has failed. Over the weekend we had an announcement from the Australian GreensMs Macklin interjecting,17
7,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian Greens were able to make up their minds. The Australian Labor Party is still determined not to determine a position. I never thought I would say this, but the Australian Labor Party makes the Australian Greens look decisive and economically responsible. The Australian Greens announced over the weekend that they will not be supporting a disallowance motion in the Senate to disallow the tax schedules. Today in the Senate Senator Len Harris said that he would not be supporting any motion of disallowance. Shortly before question time the Australian Democrats announced that they would not be voting to disallow the schedules to come into effect from 1 July 2005. Only one political party in Australia now reserves the right to disallow schedules which will give a tax cut to every Australian on 1 July 2005. The good news is that that political party is no longer relevant to the tax debate in Australia. The tax schedules can therefore take effect on 1 July 2005. For lower income earners the marginal tax rate of 17c in the dollar will be cut to 15c in the lar. For upper income earners the threshold for the 42c and the 47c rates will be increased. And on 1 July 2006 this means that only three per cent of Australian taxpayers will be subject to the top marginal tax rate. This has been warmly welcomed by tradesmen and what are commonly called aspirational voters in Australia. As I read in the Sydney Morning Herald today, these were the aspirational voters which the Leader of the Opposition promised that he would look after when he took over from his predecessor. We were reminded in the Sydney Morning Herald by Louise Dodson that he said: Labor “shouldn't have to be embarrassed” by the increasing wealth and prosperity of the electorate because it was due toMr Hawke and Mr Keating. That is what he said. Of course it is far-fetched. Labor has been defeated and all Australians will have a tax cut on 1 July. (Time expired) Taxation",17
8,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. How does the Treasurer defend a $65 a week tax cut to the new Telstra CEO, on a yearly package of $11 million, while a Telstra linesman on $55,000 a year gets just $6 a week? Treasurer, why won't the government agree to Labor's tax proposals that will double the tax cuts for average income earners and see 1.9 million couples without children better off, 2.1 million couples with children better off, 316,000 sole parents better off and 2.8 million singles better off?",18
9,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House of Representatives has already debated those amendments and rejected them. With all of the talk that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition about why he has to have a debate on these issues, I would point out to the House that the House has debated these issues and rejected them. I would warrant that the dol- Leader of the Opposition probably even spoke in the debate; I certainly did. We all certainly voted in relation to that.",18
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left will put those signs down.,18
11,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the substance of the question: as a result of the tax changes which this government has put in place, it is true that somebody on around $100,000 will receive a tax cut of about 20 per cent, and we think that is a good thing. A person on $10,000 will receive a tax cut of 50 per cent, and we think that is a good outcome too. A person on $20,000 will receive a tax cut of around 35 per cent. But, when you are cutting tax rates-I do not know whether this has occurred to the Labor Party-you cannot cut tax for people who do not pay it. I want to say that again to the Labor Party: you cannot cut tax for people who do not pay it. So, when you cut tax rates, those who are not paying any tax do not get any nominal tax cut, those who are on lower incomes get larger percentage tax cuts, and those who are on higher incomes get lower percentage tax cuts although the cuts are larger in nominal dollar terms. There is one last point I will make. In his failed attempt to stop every Australian getting a tax cut on 1 July, the Leader of the Opposition has overlooked one thing. Mr Albanese interjecting",18
12,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I just heard the member for Grayndler interject. The Labor Party policy is that on 1 July no Australians will get a tax cut. The Leader of the Opposition put forward some alternatives as to what might happen in 2006 and then claimed in his budget reply a tax cut which he would have in place under the welfare to work bonus in 2008. 2008 is after the next election. The one thing the Labor Party could agree on was that there should be no tax cut on 1 July. The one thing that Australians have been guaranteed by the coalition is that every tralian income tax payer will get a tax cut 1 July 2005-because Labor has failed in its attempts to stop those tax cuts going through. East Timor,18
13,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on Australia's commitment to peace and stability in East Timor?,19
14,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and for the interest he shows in East Timor. Members of the House may be aware that yesterday the Australian peacekeepers in East Timor and Australian Ambassador Margaret Twomey handed over the former Australian battalion headquarters at Moleana base to the East Timorese government, and that ceremony was witnessed by East Timor's Prime Minister, Dr Mari Alkatiri. This event symbolised an important chapter in East Timorese history and it signalled the end of Australia's outstanding peacekeeping activities, which have been crucial to East Timor's successful achievement of independence as well as its success since independence. Our contribution to East Timor, in one way or another-really, going back to the Prime Minister's letter to President Habibie at the end of 1998-has been an enormously important part of modern Australian foreign policy history. Our peacekeeping troops, numbering 5,000 at their peak, brought stability and security to a society that was in turmoil, and they made a real contribution to reconstruction and development. We have also generously assisted every United Nations mission to East Timor, including most recently offering some military liaison officers and civilian police advisers to the new United Nations mission there, to be known as UNOTIL. Australia's commitment has Ausalso included a very substantial aid commiton ment to East Timor, and I think it is fair to say that we will continue to provide that sort of assistance to East Timor for a long time to come. Yesterday was an important moment in the history of Australian foreign policy, bringing to an end our peacekeeping operation in East Timor. I think all members of the House would share with me the enormous pride we have in the wonderful job that was done by our peacekeepers in East Timor.",19
15,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Briefly, on indulgence, I join the opposition's sentiments to those just expressed by the foreign minister in extending our thanks to the Australian peacekeepers who have operated there for some considerable time, and I offer our congratulations to them on a job very well done. Foreign Debt",19
16,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that Australia now has the highest foreign debt per capita on earth, with the exception of the microeconomies of Qatar and Iceland? Is the Prime Minister aware of analysis by the Reserve Bank in its May monetary policy statement that suggests that the cost of servicing our $21,000 debt per man, woman and child will blow out as interest rates increase overseas, particularly in the US? Prime Minister, isn't the Reserve Bank right and doesn't Australia need to dramatically improve its trade performance?",19
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the foreign debt figures. I am also aware of a lot of other figures, and most particularly the figure that shows the debt servicing ratio has declined quite sharply since this government came to power. I am also aware of the figures that indicate that almost all of the over- they show? seas debt has been incurred by the private sector. I am proud of the fact that, in the I have been Prime Minister, each year we have reduced the contribution that the government made to foreign debt. I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would ask a question about debt, because when he was finance minister he was very fond of making his own contribution to Australia's debt. It is a distinguishing feature of this government's economic management that the government has retired from the business of adding to Australia's debt. In fact, the government has entered the business of adding to the nation's savings. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition: he does not understand much about taxation, and I do not think he understands the reality that governments can add to debt or they can add to savings. When he was a senior minister in a government he added to debt. In the time that we have been government, we have added to savings. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to take a leisurely saunter through all of the comparative economic statistics of the last eight or nine years, I will be very happy to oblige him on each and every occasion. The reality is that this government's management of the economy has won the respect of nations around the world, it has won the respect of the International Monetary Fund, it has won the respect of the OECD, but most importantlyMr Beazley interjecting",19
18,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and the Leader of the Opposition interjects-let me remind him it has won the respect of the Australian public. Labour Market,20
19,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of any recent studies that bear upon employment levels and rigidities in the labour market and what",20
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for time Paterson for what is a very pertinent question. It is true that in recent days there has been quite a bit of commentary, both domestically and around the world, about the relative performance of countries in relation to their labour markets in the wake of the rejection by the public in both France and the Netherlands of the European Constitution. There was some debate about the different approaches of countries in the European Union towards issues of labour market regulation and the consequences of those approaches and the levels of unemployment in those countries. It is interesting, and it is relevant in the context of the Leader of the Opposition's declaration that he would roll back our industrial relations policy. Remember what happened the last time he said he was going to roll something back? He makes a declaration that he is going to roll back our industrial relations policy. Let me say",20
21,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
22,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently he is not going to roll back our industrial relations policy. So he is determined not to determine that policy either. Let me say this: it repays very serious study for all members of this House to have a look at the relative performance of countries when it comes to unemployment levels and the degree to which those countries regulate or overregulate their labour markets. It is interesting to note that the rate of unemployment in Germany, France and Spain-three countries which heavily regulate their labour markets-stands at 11.8 per cent, 10.2 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. In contrast, the unemployment rate in the less regulated labour markets of the United States is 5.1 per cent-that is exactly half of ours-and of Britain is 4.7 per cent, a result, incidentally, of the reforms of the Thatcher government which Blair Labour did not roll back. Blair Labour had the common sense to hang onto the Thatcher reforms because the Blair Labour government knew that the Thatcher reforms were needed and it would be economic suicide for the United Kingdom to roll those things back. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if wants some inspiration about rolling back industrial relations changes, he ought to look to the example of his Oxford mate, Mr Tony Blair, who had the common sense to recognise that the national interest required the courageous reforms of the Thatcher era to be retained. But here we have the United States at 5.1 per cent and Britain at 4.7 per cent. a mirror image, New Zealand, we had labour market reforms by the National Party which the incoming Labour government left virtually untouched. No roll back in Britain, no roll back in New Zealand-but, ‘Oh no, don't take any notice of successful Labour leaders; I am going to roll back your industrial relations policy.' I was asked whether there were any reports, and I can inform the member for Paterson that in 2004 the World Bank published a report that investigated the scope and the manner of regulations that enhance business activity. What the World Bank research found was very interesting. It found that the more intrusive regulated approach of the recruitment and dismissal of employees-in other words, the unfair dismissal law approach pioneered by the Keating government in 1992-had the following the circumstances: fewer jobs were created, lower average national income, a larger black economy, a greater likelihood that female unemployment would be higher, a greater likelihood that youth unemployment would be higher and a greater likelihood that unemployment amongst the unskilled would be higher. The World Bank went on to find that flexible labour markets provide job opportunities for more people, ensuring that the best worker is found for each job, and that productivity, wages and output rise. Access Economics put it this way: Far from protecting the vulnerable, rigid emhe ployment regulations exclude them from the market. ‘Outsider' groups lose out from rigid employment laws. That is neither fair nor efficient. It is not fair. It is not efficient. That is why the government intend to build on our reforms of the last nine years through the workplace relations package I announced in this place several weeks ago and why we are In committed to the national interest. We are determined to provide the underpinnings of further employment growth, further productivity growth and further strengthening of the Australian economy through progressive further freeing of the Australian labour market. NA",20
23,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from Thailand. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to those members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Minimum Wage",21
24,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and follows the recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on the 2005 national minimum wage case. Isn't it the case that since 1996 the Prime Minister has opposed every minimum wage outcome awarded by the commission? Is it not also the case that, following the 2005 decision, if the government had had its way Australian employees reliant on the minimum wage would be $50 a week, or $2,600 a year, worse off? Is this why the Prime Minister will not guarantee that under the government's proposed industrial relations changes no individual Australian employee will be worse off?",21
25,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the member for Perth that, in making submissions to the bench of the Industrial Relations Commission on national wage cases, the government has regard, as is its obligation, to not only the interests of the employed but also the interests of the unemployed. I say to the members who sit opposite that, had they paid more regard to the interests of the unemployed when they were in office, they would not have left us with 8.5 per cent unemployment-unemployment would not have soared to almost 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",22
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth has asked his question.,22
27,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me also finally remind the member for Perth of something, as I did when I introduced these reforms. The opposition asks for guarantees. The opposition seeks to compare this with that. The one comparison that the opposition will always run away from is the comparison that the Australian people remember. In 9¼ years this government has presided over an increase in real wages of 14 per cent. It will be ever to the shame of the once-styled workers party of Australia that, when they were in office for 13 long years, the increase in real wages was a meagre 1.2 per cent. Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",22
28,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth.,22
29,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will be forever to the shame of the Hawke-Keating governments, which claimed to represent the interests of the Australian workers, that they not only drove their wages down; they drove them and their children out of work. Mr Stephen Smith-We drove your 10 per cent inflation rate down!",22
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth is warned.,22
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not only did they do that but they also left a disgraceful $96 billion federal government debt when this government came to office. I say to the member for Perth: ask the everyday person to compare the salary record under this government with the salary record under Labor. I could not be happier if you did so. Debt Relief,22
32,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House recent proposals in relation to debt relief for developing countries? What is the Australian government's position on this issue?,22
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform him and the House that Australia has been a very strong supporter for debt forgiveness through the IMF and the World Bank for heavily indebted poor countries. In fact, in 2000 the government pledged 100 per cent bilateral debt forgiveness for countries that qualified under that program. Australia has forgiven 100 per cent of the bilateral debt of Ethiopia and Nicaragua, which were the two countries, known as HIPCs, that owed money to Australia. In addition to that, the government has committed $112 million to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for debt write-offs by those multilateral institutions. That is Australia's per-shareholding obligation under those write-offs. The government welcomes the announcement of enhancing the HIPC initiative that was made at the G8 summit over the weekend. Importantly, the announcement was that qualifying countries-that is, HIPCs-would be entitled to 100 per cent debt forgiveness rather than just a write-off to a level of debt sustainability, which has been the program to date. The announcement was that the write-off would take place and the amount in payments would be netted off, by way of adjustment, new payments from the African Development Bank and the World Bank; that shareholders in those banks would then make up the write-off; and that the increased pool would be available to all IDA qualifying countries. This means that more relief will be available not just to HIPC countries but to other developing countries. This will take considerable further work to be developed before the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in September, but it is a very welcome announcement and Australia very strongly supports it. In the 2005-06 budget the Australian government increased its aid commitment by $238 million to $2.5 billion in official development assistance. I will make two points in closing. The first is that the important thing for debt forgiveness is that the savings be allocated to poverty reduction. If the savings that are captured are taken in corruption or in enriching those who are responsible for mismanagement in some of these countries then the poor will not have received a thing. That is why it is so important to have poverty reduction programs in place that can get those savings out to those who really need them. The second point I will make is that the World Bank estimated last year that trade liberalisation would deliver $350 billion in income to developing countries per annum by 2015. That benefit to developing countries would be five times the global aid flow. Let me repeat that: trade liberalisation would deliver to developing countries five times the value of aid flow by 2015. To get some perspective on that, however important aid isand aid is very important-trade liberalisation would deliver five times the benefit to the poor of the world if the world were able to come to a trade liberalisation program. That is why this government also supports trade liberalisation. Not only is it important for economic development but it is important to help the poorest countries by giving them access to world markets. Private Members' Bills",22
34,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It follows on from the first question I asked him in relation to the treatment of the member for Kooyong's bills. Prime Minister, is it not a fact that the member for Kooyong can introduce his private member's bills in the House but the bills will not be voted on unless the government gives the bills precedence over other business of the House? If the member for Kooyong's bills are not to be given precedence, for how much longer will babies and children remain behind barbed wire and razor fencing?",23
35,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it was the former immigration minister, now the Attorney General, who remarked last week that when he became immigration minister there were 300 children behind the wire. Let me simply say this to the Leader of the Opposition: I answered his first question and I refer him again to that answer in relation to the handling of any private member's bill on this subject. I have nothing to add to that answer. Can I also tell the Leader of the Opposition that the government intends to maintain to the full the framework of the current policy. I indicated to this parliament a couple of weeks ago-and I repeat it-that where opportunities present themselves to administer that policy in a more flexible way, those opportunities will be taken. The truth is that, the last time the Leader of the Opposition had anything of substance to say on this subject, he flipped and he flopped in a fashion which is well remembered. The truth is that this government has run a successful policy of ensuring that we decide the nature of immigration flows to this country. I believe that that policy is only the right policy but a policy that enjoys the support of the Australian people. There have been a number of changes made to the administration of that policy. I have indicated, consistent with the maintenance of the framework of the policy, a willingness on the part of the government to make further changes. But those changes will not be such as to undermine or destroy the framework of a policy which I believe in, and which, incidentally, I thought the Leader of the Opposition supported. If my memory serves me correctly, at the time of the 2001 election he said there was not a cigarette paper's difference between us and that he stood shoulder to shoulder with the government. That is what he said in 2001 when he was running around the country trying to pretend that he was not Mr Flip-Flop. But now, in 2005, the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to wear-as he once pronounced he wouldsimplicity as a talisman. The Leader of the Opposition is now trying to persuade the Australian people that he has a markedly different policy from that of the government. Let me say this: the Australian public know where the government stands on this issue; they have not the faintest idea where the Leader of the Opposition stands. President Musharraf",23
36,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House how President Musharraf's visit can be expected to benefit Australia and our region?,24
37,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and his interest. President Musharraf of Pakistan will be visiting Australia from 13 to 16 June. This is the first ever visit to Australia by a head of state of Pakistan. Pakistan is above all a key partner for Australia in the war against terror. not I do not think Australians should underestimate the importance of Pakistan in the war against terrorism. For example, Jemaah Islamiah from our own region used Pakistan for training until it was disrupted by Pakistani agencies. The Pakistanis have captured many al-Qaeda members, including most recently Abu Faraj al-Libbi. President Musharraf has been personally targeted by terrorists on a number of occasions. Quite apart from anything else, this is an opportunity for us to commend President Musharraf on the job he is doing in countering terrorism. During the visit, I will be signing with the Pakistani minister accompanying the President a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism, something that was discussed during the recent visit of Foreign Minister Kasuri of Pakistan in May. That memorandum of understanding will lead to further cooperation in areas like law enforcement, information exchanges, and exchanges on financial operations, border control, transport security and so on. For the record, that will bring to 11 the number of memoranda of understanding on counterterrorism that we have with countries around the region. Ministers will also be signing a memorandum of understanding on agricultural cooperation. Pakistan is an important market for Australian agricultural products, including wheat. We had some difficulty last year with our wheat exports, but those difficulties have been resolved. We also have an aid program with Pakistan. We are going to provide $6.6 million for a series of agricultural sector linkages, including seven scholarships to come to Australia. Let me say in conclusion that I have just been in India during the last week where I met with the Indian Prime Minister and other ministers. I made the point to the Indian Prime Minister and to the foreign minister that we very much appreciate the role that India has played with Pakistan to bring about a greater degree of accommodation between those two countries. More than that, this will be an opportunity during President Musharraf's visit to also say to President Musharraf that we appreciate the role he is playing in normalising relations between Pakistan and India. Mr Chen Yonglin",24
38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the Chinese ambassador's statement of 6 June 2005, in which she said: I was asked by the Australian Government about whether heChen Yonglinwill ... face persecution if he returns to China ... Will the minister advise the House when his department spoke to the Chinese embassy about Mr Chen and what his officials said to the Chinese embassy about Mr Chen?",25
39,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen a certain amount of debate about this in the media while I have been away, so let me just make this point: there were a number of contacts with DFAT officials initiated by the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney and the Chinese embassy in Canberra about Mr Chen. Some of this contact occurred before Friday, 3 June. That was the day Mr Chen applied for a protection visa and then made public statements about his situation, and honourable members will recall that. At no time did I or any DFAT official improperly convey information about Mr Chen's intentions-of course we did not. Nor did DFAT officials, or I for that matter, convey any information about Mr Chen's bid for asylum. At the end of a formal meeting with Mr Wang, who is the head of the Chinese Communist Party's international division, on Thursday, 2 June, the Chinese ambassador briefly raised this issue with me, and she has made subsequent public comments about that. Trade: Wheat Exports to Iraq",25
40,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister update the House on how Australia's wheat exports are contributing to Iraq's food security?,25
41,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Many parts, but not all, of eastern Australia that have been ravaged by drought have received good rain over the last couple of days. We hope and pray that that continues. The member asks about Australia's trade relationship with Iraq, wheat exports and food security. For 50 years the Iraqi people have relied on highquality wheat from Australian wheat growers to supply their market in a timely and sustainable way. In fact, since 1992 we have exported 12½ million tonnes of wheat to Iraq. The new Iraq-the Iraq that we in Australia and our defence forces helped to liberate-has bought over two million tonnes of wheat from Australia since mid-2003. Given this strong relationship, we were shocked in recent weeks to hear claims of contamination of our most recent shipments. The exporter, AWB Ltd, undertook a series of independent tests of the shipments of wheat that were claimed to have been contaminated, all of which proved to clear the quality and the standard of the wheat. Following representations by our ambassador in Baghdad, Ambassador Howard Brown, senior AWB officials and me, the new democratically elected Iraqi government led by Prime Minister al-Jafari has accepted those test results and cleared the wheat for unload- whether heing. Last night the ships in Um Qasar started unloading their cargo of wheat. We very much appreciate the way that the new, democratically elected Iraqi government took a quick and clear decision once they came to office to resolve this impasse. We have extended an invitation to the trade minister, Basit Karim, to visit Australia as a guest of the government to help enhance the trade relationship between Australia and Iraq and to work on establishing protocols so this type of delay in getting shipments of wheat into Iraq and unloaded does not occur again. This happens on top of our inprinciple commitment of $20 million for milling and processing facilities in Iraq and also the $125 million already committed for reconstruction purposes in Iraq as part of our aid program. Our government is determined to continue to do all it can to ensure that Australian wheat growers remain the dominant suppliers of high-quality wheat into the Iraqi market. NA",25

45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is engaging your brain I am concerned about. I refer again to the Chinese ambassador's statement of 6 June 2005, in which she said: I was asked by the Australian Government about Chen Yonglinwill ... face persecution if he returns to China ... Minister, did your officials make this inquiry of the Chinese embassy or not?",26
46,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I think I made it pretty clear what conversations there were between the officials of my department, the Chinese embassy and the Chinese ConsulateGeneral. They were conversations that were initiated by the Chinese, and we responded to those queries. I also explained that, at the end of a meeting on another matter that the Chinese ambassador attended, she raised the Chen case with me as she was walking towards the door and, in response to that Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This is the second question I have asked on this, because the minister did not answer the first one, which isMr Howard interjecting Mr Rudd-Well, he did, Prime Minister. I know you are not used to answering any questions in this place.",26

49,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was just explaining that, as the Chinese ambassador left my office, she raised the Chen case, so we had a brief discussion about that. There is now an application for a protection visa that was forward, I think, on 3 June and, obviously, those circumstances we want to be careful what we say about this case.

52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Griffith did not have the call. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order concerning standing order 100, questions are not permitted to be debated either at the time of the original asking nor subsequently on a spurious point of order. I ask that you make a ruling that way and not permit the honourable member to perpetrate that again.",27
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Mackellar, the member for Griffith did not have the call. Workplace Relations Reform",27
54,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware of reports of proposed changes allowing registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act to have increased influence over public policy making and elected officials?,27
55,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am aware of some proposed changes that have been reported. For example, on the weekend, the Queensland ALP conference decided that it would increase unions' voting power in ALP preselections from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, going in exactly the opposite direction to the put reforms which the member for Hotham and in Bob Hawke and Neville Wran attempted to put in place. No doubt this has something to do with the $9.7 million which the unions have donated to the ALP in Queensland since We can see some further examples of this influence in New South Wales. In the Sydney Morning Herald on the weekend, it was reported that in New South Wales unions which are affiliated with the ALP have 393,000 members. The Secretary of Unions NSW, Mr John Robertson, said at the weekend that only 49 per cent of them voted Labor at the last election. In terms of membership, according to the article in the Sydney Morning Herald, only one per cent of the 393,000 members of unions in New South Wales are ALP members. This stands in stark contrast toMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 98, particularly subsection (c), which defines the matters about which a minister might be asked in question time. The minister is clearly responding on matters that are nowhere near his portfolio. I would ask you to draw him back to any part that might be relevant.",27
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been listening to the answer carefully, and I believe that the minister is answering the question.",27
57,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act, which is quite clearly in my portfolio. The reason the member does not want to hear the answer is that there is a stark contrast between less than one per cent of unionists in New South Wales belonging to the ALP and almost 100 per cent of the union bosses belonging to the ALP. It is no wonder, therefore, that on the weekend the Leader of the Opposition caved into union demands with his roll-back of industrial relations policy. When the Leader of the Opposition addressed the two state ALP conferences on the weekend, he was not addressing the workers, most of whom do not belong to the unions and most of whom have benefited by a 14 per cent increase in real wages under this government, nor was he addressing the unionists, 99 per cent of whom do not belong to the ALP. He was simply addressing the unrepresentative union leaders, the unrepresentative union bosses. It is no wonder that in an editorial in the Canberra Times yesterday, headed ‘Corruption the big ALP task', the editorial writer said this about the leader of the opposition of order. How is an editorial in the Canberra Times relevant to the question that is asked or to the minister's portfolio responsibilities?",27
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I say to the Chief Opposition Whip: as the content of the editorial has not been drawn into the debate, it is hard to answer that question, so I will call the minister.",28
59,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the editorial in the Canberra Times said yesterday in part about the Leader of the Opposition: There is no better demonstration that he lacks the drawal. moral and physical fibreMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was about registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act. Clearly, from the start of the quote that the minister just went to, it is not about that matter at all.",28
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will rule on the point of order. The minister will demonstrate where this is relevant to the question.,28
61,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To continue the quote: There is no better demonstration that hethe Leader of the Oppositionlacks the moral and physical fibre to be worthy of being prime minister of Australia than his refusal to face the crooked farce that is his own party. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: can I direct your attention to standing order 90 and the making of reflections on members in the House. Those reflections made by the minister were most inappropriate and ought to be withdrawn. They may or may not be in a quote; that does not make them parliamentary, and I can take you to the relevant bit of House of Representatives Practice on that point.",28
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business has made her point. Has the minister concluded his answer?,28

64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have called the minister. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, you may have called the minister, but I have asked you to determine whether an unparliamentary expression has been used and whether it ought to be withdrawn. You need to determine that question and ask the minister for a with",28
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. The minister is in order in quoting from whatever he is quoting.,28
66,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am quoting from yesterday's Canberra Times. Indeed, for the benefit of the House, I will table the article. Can I conclude by saying this: what the Leader of the Opposition ought to be engaged in is formulating real policy instead of this roly-poly roll-back. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I direct your attention to page 490 of House of Representatives Practice, particularly the following sentence: It is not in order to use offensive words, and so on, against another Member by means of a quotation or by putting words in someone else's mouth. That is what the minister has just done. I have asked for a withdrawal. A withdrawal ought to be asked for now. The minister ought to withdraw those expressions. The fact that they were contained in a quote does not assist the minister on that basis. They ought to be withdrawn. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the comments of the editor of the Canberra Times were very mild compared to what members opposite are saying about the Leader of the Opposition",28

81,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer again to my previous questions. Is the minister aware of section 336F of the Migration Act, which prohibits, under law, the unauthorised disclosure of information identifying an applicant for a protection visa to the foreign government from which protection is sought? Can the minister provide an absolute assurance to this House that the actions of his department in contacting the Chinese embassy did not breach this provision of the Migration Act?",29

83,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House of how the government plans to provide better medical care to people suffering from chronic illness?,29
84,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question. As the Prime Minister and the state Labor premiers agreed recently, we have a very good health system. Our challenge is to make a good system even better. That means, amongst other things, better management of chronic disease, particularly with an older population in the years to come. To that end, on 1 July, the government will introduce new Medicare items to ensure that people with chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, mental illness, heart failure, cancer and arthritis get more attention from their GPs. There will be very substantial new rebates, up to $120 per consultation, to ensure that GPs give their patients the time that they need and also to ensure that GPs become patient-managers rather than simply gatekeepers to the health system. These new items are in part a response to the red-tape task force which the government commissioned. They have been worked through with all of the GP representative groups. What they should mean is that GPs have far more time to spend with their patients, rather than on their paperwork. This more good news from the Howard government. These are further, incremental improvements to what is already a very good system, and this is more evidence that the Howard government",29

87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to the statement by Senator Vanstone where she confirmed that an officer of the department of immigration had contacted the Chinese ConsulateGeneral in Sydney following Mr Chen's initial contact with Immigration's Sydney office. Can the minister provide the House with an absolute assurance that this contact and this conversation between Sydney's Immigration office and the Chinese ConsulateGeneral did not breach the provisions of section 336F of the Migration Act?,30
88,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I should say at the outset that the application for a protection visa by the person involved is being processed in the normal way but as a priority. Mr Chen was provided with a briefing on his visa options before he lodged a protection visa with the department on 3 June. He was contacted by DIMIA early in the following week and offered the opportunity for a protection visa interview to be held later that week. At his request, the interview was rescheduled for a later date acceptable to him as he and his representative wanted more time to prepare the application. Questions about his request is for political asylum should obviously be directed to the foreign minister's portfolio. The application will be processed in the normal way. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. My question sought an assurance of the type the Minister for Foreign Affairs just gave. He refused to give one.",30
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has finished his answer. The member for Griffith knows that if he oversteps the mark then he will be dealt with. Indigenous Affairs,30
90,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney inform the House of recent reforms to the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians?,30
91,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The government has been seeking ways to improve the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians and has been particularly disappointed that, in a number of areas of Australia, organisations that have been providing those services have not been doing so in a cost-effective way. Notwithstanding that, a number of others were. In order to deal with that issue, the government has implemented a new open and competitive tendering process to ensure that Indigenous Australians have access to high-quality legal services and to ensure value for money. As the member for Herbert would be aware, on Friday I announced that two organisations had successfully tendered to deliver these services Queensland. One of them is based in Townsville and will be delivering services to North Queensland; the other is based in Brisbane. This means that the tender process has now been completed in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. In each of these states, groups successful in winning contracts have been outstanding organisations with a proven track record in delivering comprehensive legal and support services. It also happens that they are Indigenous organisations. They have clearly demonstrated that they can, in a competitive tender situation, compete successfully. I congratulate them on the important work that they are going to undertake. I congratulate those organisations in Queensland because they had demonstrated records. This means that some of those organisations which were more questionable in the past will no longer be in the field. The tender process continues in other states, and I expect all contracts to be dealt with by 1 July next year. This is about ensuring that Indigenous people, who deserve the best possible advice and representation available, will continue to receive it-and they will get better services because they be provided in a more cost-effective way. Mr Chen Yonglin",30
92,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to the foreign minister's answer to my earlier question in question time today when he provided the House with an absolute assurance concerning DFAT's obligations concerning the confidentiality of Mr Chen and DFAT's conversations with the Chinese embassy. I ask the minister: can the minister also provide the House with an absolute assurance that the contact and in conversation between Sydney's Immigration office and the Chinese Consulate-General did not breach the provisions of section 336F of the Migration Act?,31
93,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am confident that DIMIA officials at all times acted in accordance with the law and their legal obligations. Where is the mystery on this, given that the department recently issued a media release setting out the context of the contact by the DIMIA official with the Chinese consulate? That press release made it clear that the contactMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I asked a very simple ‘yes or no' question. Can the minister provide his assurance to the House that the obligations of the act have been adhered to by Immigration?",31
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the member for Griffith that if he raises a point of order then it is not necessary to repeat his question.,31
95,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"DIMIA has issued a statement making it clear that the contact with the PRC consulate was short; only confirmed that the person in question, Mr Chen, worked at the consulate; and did not disclose will any information about Mr Chen's whereabouts or intentions. The fact that he was seeking protection was not known to the department at the time. Employment",31
96,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Will the minister inform the House how the government is helping more Australians to participate in the work force?,32
97,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for his question. He is a great member and he is working hard. I know that he has a great interest in Work for the Dole activities and he does pretty well. This government is very proud of its record in putting people into work and helping people through employment programs. It is part of the reason that unemployment under this government has halved from what it was when the Leader of the Opposition was employment services minister. It is no wonder that we have also continued to increase participation rates in this country. We now have working age participation at the record level of 64.6 per cent and female participation at a record high of 57.1 per cent. Tonight I will hand out awards at the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards. The awards are recognition for excellence amongst the community work coordinators, the sponsors and those participants who have engaged in wonderful projects to help their communities. Over the last 12 months this government has been involved in placing 272,000 long-term unemployed people into work. There is more that we need to do, and this government will continue to do it and we will continue to support the unemployed in this country.",32

100,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The Prime Minister may proceed.,32
101,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,I would like to correct a minor detail in an answer that I gave. I said in response to a question that the unfair dismissal law approach was pioneered by the Keating government in 1992. I was wrong. The laws were announced in December 1993 and they were introduced into parliament in June 1994. But they still remain terrible laws. NA Ruling,32
102,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I would ask you to reflect on a ruling that you made today.

104,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Are we to understand that when something does appear on the public record in a capital city newspaper that, if another member takes offence at it, it is not just meet for this parliament? I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that if that were to become a precedent it would be a very dangerous intrusion onto the rights of members of parliament.",32
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Hinkler. I will re-examine it but I also remind the member for Hinkler that, just because something appears in a newspaper, it does not mean that it cannot still be found to be offensive to a member, and therefore quoting it does not remove the responsibility of a member or a minister in respecting others in this chamber.

108,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,33
109,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,33
110,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been misrepresented in the headline of a newspaper yesterday, to wit, the Australian. I have been misrepresented by the Prime Minister today and I have been misrepresented by the workplace relations minister. In regard to the government's proposed legislation I have never used the expression ‘roll back'. In relation to the intentions of the Australian Labor Party, we will unquestionably go to the next election with a proposal to reform the government's industrial relations legislation to make it fairer for ordinary Australian wage earners. NA Unparliamentary Language",33
111,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a couple of questions to you, Mr Speaker. The first concerns your policy with respect to interventions regarding the use of unparliamentary language. You may recall that on the Thursday evening of the last sitting day I spoke on the adjournment and you ask me to withdraw the description of the Prime Minister as a ‘hypocrite'. No intervention was made by any member at that time, but you asked me to withdraw. As a result of me refusing to withdraw, you then threw me out of the House. Fortunately no division occurred. Given that the term ‘hypocrite' is hardly high on the list of unparliamentary language, I am wondering why you did not choose to intervene today when terms were used that I think were significantly more serious with respect to the Leader of the Opposition such as a ‘crooked'. I wonder whether you could enlighten the House on your policy with respect to when you will unilaterally intervene to seek a withdrawal rather than waiting for a member to request a withdrawal. My second question relates to your policy regarding giving members the call. Early in question time the member for Denison sought to take a point of order and by the time you recognised him the minister had finished his answer. Later in question time the member for Chifley had the same problem. May I very politely suggest that you may get your lateral vision checked because it seems that you have some difficulty acknowledging people up here.",33
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Melbourne has made his point. In response to the first question, I make the point that the chair does not need another member to draw attention to unparliamentary or offensive language. The chair has a responsibility to uphold the standards of the chamber. In relation to the second point, yes, unfortunately I did not see the member for Denison but as soon as I did I attempted to give him the call. Standing Orders",33
113,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you also. I wonder whether you could enlighten the House in due course as to standing order 98(D)(1), which says that questions must not ask ministers for an expression of opinion including a legal opinion, and relate that to the questions put by the member for Griffith today.",33

115,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Gene Technology Regulator-Quarterly report for the period 1 October to 31 December 2004 Debate (on motion by Ms Gillard) adjourned. NA Industrial Relations,33
116,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Perth proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The reduction in the living standards of working Australians as a result of the cutting of slashing of conditions and entitlements and removal of safety nets for employees through the Government's extreme, unfair and divisive industrial relations changes. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",34
117,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The topic of the matter of public importance is a reduction in the living standards of working Australian families, families who find it hard to make ends meet and who struggle to keep their heads above water. Make no mistake: this will be a defining issue of the 2007 federal election campaign. The Prime Minister said today that we should take this issue up with him day in, day out-and do not worry; we will. The MPI describes the government's proposals as ‘extreme, unfair and divisive', and they are. The Prime Minister has been waiting 30 years to have a go at making these changes and, now that he has all the power under the sun, he is not being shy about having a go. The more the Australian community find out about these proposals, the less they will like them. It is unquestionably the fact that the Prime Minister has gone way too far here, and the community will slowly but surely come to understand that these changes will impact adversely on their living standards and on their rights and conditions in the workplace. The public policy objective of the Prime Minister is quite straightforward. It is to reduce wages, to strip entitlements and conditions and to remove or reduce safety nets. If those are not his objectives, then why won't the Prime Minister give the simple guarantee that we have been asking from him day in and day out at question time? We are simply wages, asking him to guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off as a result of these changes. The Prime Minister will not give that guarantee, the Treasurer will not give it and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will not give it. This is a guarantee the government gave when they had Peter Reith with the alsatians and balaclavas. They gave it then but they will not give it now, because the public policy objective is to drive wages down, to remove conditions and entitlements and to remove or reduce safety nets and minimum standards. The framework that puts this into effect is quite straightforward. It is in about half-adozen areas. There is plenty of detail, and there will be much more detail to come with the government's legislation. But the framework of the approach is quite clear. It is to take an axe to the minimum wage and the minimum wage case. It is to take an axe to the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is to take an axe to minimum conditions and awards through changes to allowable matters and the no disadvantage test. It is to take an axe to the states and the state systems. It is to open Pandora's box on unfair dismissal and to take an axe to collective bargaining and the rights to associate and join a union and to act upon those rights in the workplace. That is the straightforward approach here. This is about reducing wages, removing those conditions, removing those safety nets and removing those minimum standards. This legislation takes an axe to the minimum wage, an axe to the commission, an axe to award conditions and minimum standards, an axe to the states and the state systems and an axe to collective bargaining, and it opens up Pandora's box for unfair dismissals in workplaces where there are 100 employees or fewer. The first point of detail that I attention to is the changes the government is proposing to make to allowable matters and the no disadvantage test. For many members of the public, this is arcane industrial relations speak. But they do understand important things like public holidays, allowances, loadings, penalty rates and redundancy pay. Currently we have 20 allowable matters. These are the allowable matters that are contained in awards which form the minimum standards for awards, for collective bargaining and the test against which a person's entitlements are made. These matters are scrutinised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire. The government proposes to eliminate four of those allowable matters overnight: superannuation, jury service, notice of termination and long service leave. They will go out of the minimum standards required against which awards, collective bargains or individual contracts or agreements will be tested. The government proposes to go from 20 allowable matters to five, to include part or all of four conditions currently contained-ordinary time; hours of work; annual leave; and personal or carers leave and parental leave, including maternity leave-and a single minimum wage. Effectively, the system will go from 20 allowable matters to four allowable matters and a single minimum wage, leaving at risk things such as public holidays, allowances, loadings for working overtime or for casual or shift work, penalty rates, redundancy pay and incentive based payments. These things are all at risk through the government's changes in this area and no longer will we see the independent, impartial umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, being the arbiter of what does or does not meet the no disadvantage test. Simply by lodging an agreement with the Office of the Employment Advocate, the government's retail agent for Australian workplace agreewant to draw ments, the test will be met. The combination of these changes, the government's encouragement of the use of Australian workplace agreements and the extension of the unfair dismissal changes, from workplaces of 20 employees to workplaces of 100 employees, is the most pernicious part of the government's approach. That is where the real social, policy and political evil comes in. In the old days of the Court and Kierath reforms in Western Australia, where much of this is taken from, the adage used to be ‘sign or resign'. Now the adage will be ‘sign or be sacked and have no remedy for being sacked unfairly'. The government is proceeding on the basis that somehow it is appropriate public policy to say that if you are the 101st employee at a workplace you cannot be dismissed unfairly but if you are the 99th you can. That goes right to the heart of the pernicious nature of this legislation. Make no mistake: when the community come to appreciate the insidious and invidious combination of reducing allowable matters, reducing the standard of the no disadvantage test, promoting Australian workplace agreements, removing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from the compliance role for those standards, and standing over an employee saying, ‘You sign or resign', the community will walk away from these changes in droves. This is all about the wages and conditions of Australian working families. It is a fundamental shift in a balance of power; it seeks to impose the political and economic will of people with strong bargaining power on people with weak or minimal bargaining power. There are a couple of fundamentals which pervade the government's approach and which are worth referring to. The first fundamental is that these changes pay no attention whatsoever to fairness. On the contrary: the government and the minister, with the Business Council of Australia, quite openly stand up and say that fairness is not a public policy priority when it comes to this area. The minister has previously welcomed and endorsed the statements of Michael Chaney from the Business Council of Australia. Michael Chaney, who comes from a good family in Western Australia and who should know better, articulates the view that fairness is not a public policy criterion in this areathat the relationship between an employer and an employee in Australian society should not be cluttered by fairness, that workplace arrangements between an individual employee and employer or a group of employees and employers should not be cluttered by fairness. Where do we find that most starkly articulated? We find it in the government's attack upon the minimum wage. When the Prime Minister is asked to give a guarantee that one will be worse off, he says: ‘No, I don't need to worry about that. My guarantee is my record.' But he walks a million miles away from his record on the minimum wage. He will not respond to that in any way at all. What do we know of the Prime Minister's record on the minimum wage? This government has opposed every minimum wage case outcome since 1996. If the government's view had prevailed before the commission, individual Australian employees on the minimum wage would be $50 a week$2,600 a year-worse off. And what was the government's submission for the 2005 case, the case recently determined by the commission? The government's submission was that people on $24,000 to $25,000 a year, people on the minimum wage, should have their wage increased by 29c an hour-that it should not be increased from $12 an hour to $13 an hour. It was a 2.35 per cent increase so far as inflation is concerned, less than the inflation rate found in the budget papers and less than the inflation rate found on the Reserve Bank's web site-a real cut in the wage of people on $24,000 to $25,000 a year. The government said, ‘A $6 tax cut is fair enough.' The government says you can have a $65 a week tax cut if you are on $110,000 but a $6 a week tax cut if you are on the minimum wage of $24,000 or $25,000. And let me draw attention to something that most people do not know: the government went back to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with a supplementary submission and said to the commission, ‘Before you determine the minimum wage case outcome, you should take into account the fact that people on $24,000 to $25,000 will get a $6 a week tax cut.' It made no comparable supplementary submission to the Remuneration Tribunal when the Remuneration Tribunal said that members of parliament no- should have a real wage increase-they were the recipients of a $65 a week tax cut-let alone a submission about the benefit that comes from the removal of the superannuation surcharge. That reflects massive unfairness. Another unfairness is the unfair dismissal arrangement that I have referred to. Ninetyeight per cent of Australian workplaces will be subject to that arrangement. A rule-ofthumb figure is that there are nine million employees in the workplace in Australia. Four million of those Australian employees will be subject to an arrangement that essentially says: ‘You turn up today. You can be sacked. There is no remedy, no recourse. You can be unfairly dismissed. Unless you sign an individual contract, you are out the door.' The second fundamental principle which is littered throughout the government's proposals is the government's view that the trade union movement does not have a legitimate role to play in the social and economic affairs of Australian society. We find that in the undermining of collective bargaining, rights to associate, rights of entry and range of traditional, standard rights in the workplace that have been there for many years at state and federal level. The government does not believe that unions have a legitimate role to play in the social and economic circumstances of Australian society. I pose a simple question: who came to the rescue of the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie? I did not see Treasurer Costello, Prime Minister Howard, Minister Andrews or employer associations on a white horse; I saw the trade union movement. There are two fundamental principles here. The government does not believe that fairness is appropriate here and the government does not see a legitimate role for the trade union movement. We do. What does the government say in response to our concerns? Firstly, it says, ‘Don't worry.' All of these things were said in 1995. When the Prime Minister introduced these measures, he said: Let me quote just one example of the Chicken Little mantra that was the stock-in-trade of the Australian Labor Party ... Of the Chicken Littles, none was more shrill than that noted rooster, the member for Perth ... The word ‘rooster' was always a term of endearment, and I take the reference from the Prime Minister as a badge of honour. The Prime Minister continued: In October 1995, hethe member for Perthsaid this: The Howard model … is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions ... it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. It was true then and it is true now. What the government will not tell you is what happened between October 1995 and now. The a Senate, through the Democrats, knocked off about 175 proposals through various amendments. How many times have we seen the government say: ‘It is shocking and terrible. That Labor party in the Senate-they've stopped bill after bill.' There must have been hundreds of industrial relations bills that we stopped-hundreds! Well, at least 15 or 20. The government cannot have its cake and eat it too. The government cannot say ‘We are pursuing these reforms because that terrible rotten Senate stopped all these things occurring' and then not accept the fact that the things we said in 1995-96 when Reith was there with his balaclavas and alsatians were true. They were true then; they are true now. The problem for the parliament and the community now is that the government has all power under the sun. I know that the Prime Minister used to have Reith with his alsatians and balaclavas. Now he has Minister Andrews; he is more of an opera glasses and poodle man, but he does follow his instructions. Not for nothing did he turn up to the annual general meeting of the HR Nicholls Society and give the vote of thanks to the overseas visitor who said that there should not be a minimum wage at all. This is an iron fist in a velvet glove, but make no mistake: the government is trying to do everything it wanted to do with Reith, and more. When you get all power under the sun, you get too close to the sun. Sometimes you are touched by the sun. This issue will come back to bite the government. It has gone too far with these proposals-it has gone way too far-and the community will understand that. When the Prime Minister walks away from his minimum wage record, the other point he makes is: ‘Look, my guarantee is my record. Look at the increase in real wages that has occurred since I came to office.' Let us just look at the things he will not tell us. pired) The Prime Minister does not tell us that when he left office as Treasurer in 1983 he left a 10 per cent inflation rate and when he returned to office as Prime Minister in 1996 the inflation rate was two per cent. Last time. I looked, the essential thing about a real wage increase was the value of the wage increase over inflation. In the course of Labor being in office, in addition to the structural changes we made that set the country up for 14 years of economic growth-and I would have thought that 14 years of economic growth was a helpful contribution to real wage increaseswhat did we see? Disposable income under Labor increased by 40 per cent because of a social wage through superannuation and a universal health care system, both of which the Liberal Party opposed violently. We have also seen-and the Industrial Relations Commission in its 2005 wage case decision refers to it-a shift from profits to wages over that period and continuing, which has helped create the incentives for investment and economic growth. At a time of a shift from profit to wages over a decade and a half, at a time of record corporate profits, why would you think it made sense in the economy to take an axe to the backs of people on low pay, to take an axe to the backs of people on the minimum wage? It is all about ideology; it is all about zealotry. The Prime Minister has been waiting 30 years to achieve it and now he thinks he can, but he has an election to get through. After that election you will see Labor produce a fair system based on fairness and the fundamental principles of minimum standards, wages and conditions; safety nets; an independent umpire; the right to associate; and the right to collectively bargain. The Australian community will catch up with you, to your regret, in this area. (Time ex",34
118,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.30 pm)-Can I, in contrast to the honourable member for Perth, start my remarks with a few facts. Fact No. 1: we have the lowest unemployment rate in almost 30 years in Australia-a far cry from what it was when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in the Hawke-Keating government. Fact No. 2: we have 1.6 million extra jobs in Australia which were created over the last nine years. Fact No. 3: real wages in this country have increased over the last nine years by some 14 per cent-again, something which stands in marked contrast to the 1.2 per cent increase in real wages under 13 years of the Labor government. Fact No. 4: in the last few years industrial disputation in this country has been at the lowest levels since records were first taken, and that goes back to the time of Gallipoli. When one starts a debate about industrial relations and bases it on some factual indication of what has actually happened in Australia in the last decade, it is a far cry from the scaremongering of the member for Perth. But the member for Perth is not new at this. He quoted the Prime Minister, who in turn quoted the member for Perth. On 17 October 1995 the member for Perth said: The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. As a worker, you may have lots of doubts about the things ... you might lose, but you can be absolutely sure of one thing: John Howard will reduce your living standards. That was the member for Perth in 1995. We have a sense of deja vu today in his claims about what might happen in the future. The reality is that what he predicted on 17 October and other occasions in 1995 has turned out to be totally untrue-totally false. Rather than lower wages, worse conditions and a massive rise in industrial disputation, what we have seen over the last 10 yearsparticularly since this government has been in power-has been about an increase in real wages for Australians, about better conditions and about a decrease in industrial disputation as well as about the falsity of the other claims that have been made by the honourable member for Perth. On the weekend the Leader of the Opposition made speeches to the ALP conferences in New South Wales and Queensland. These conferences, ordinary Australians might think, might be representative bodies of the ordinary working class in Australia. But it seems that that is far from the truth. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on the weekend, it was pointed out that apparently there are 393,000 members of unions in New South Wales where those unions are affiliated with the Australian Labor Party-almost all the unions. But the number of people who are members of the Australian Labor Party and are unionists is actually less than one per cent of those 393,000 people. So the speeches were not made to an audience of ordinary working Australians-the ordinary working Australians that have benefited under this government. These were speeches made to the apparatchiks of the union movement who control the Labor Party in it Australia-who control it to the extent that over the last nine years the union movement in Australia has donated well over $40 million to the Labor Party. This is a merry-goround system where the unionist bosses control the Labor Party and make donations to the Labor Party; in return we see industrial relations policy being made by the Labor Party for the union bosses in Australia. That is the only way that one can describe the regressive policies of the ALP when it comes to industrial relations. Let us consider what the Australian Labor Party's policies are in relation to industrial relations. They have not been changed since the last election, at a time when this was placed squarely on the agenda for the Australian people in the matters which were raised during the election campaign. That at least is one reason why the Australian people rejected the Labor Party last October. Let us consider what the Labor Party's proposals involve: reintroducing comprehensive and prescriptive awards, returning to the days when we had 500and 600-page awards controlling every minute of every day of workers in Australia; empowering the Industrial Relations Commission to be involved in every step of the enterprise-bargaining processes; taking away from people the right to have a choice, which they have increasingly entered into and taken up in Australia; and abolishing Australian workplace agreements. This is a favourite of the member for Perth and the Labor Party. There have been almost 700,000 Australian workplace agreements entered into in Australia since they were introduced by this government, and they give businesses and workers flexibility that they did not have before. One example that may be well known to the member for Perth is Catalano Seafoods, which I understand operates in Perth in Western Australia. Catalano Seafoods is subject to the seasonal nature of seafood processing, like many other businesses. I see the member for Lyons here. Tourist operations that are in business on the west coast of Tasmania in places like Strahan have also taken up and made use of AWAs. Catalano Seafoods is a good example. Because of the seasonal nature of the work in seafood processing, they had as part of their work force a large number of people who were casuals and not in permanent employment. With the use of Australian workplace agreements, they were able to smooth out the seasonal nature of work at Catalano Seafoods-so much so that today over 90 per cent of the employees at Catalano Seafoods, through the use of Australian workplace agreements, are now permanent employees of that business. I would have thought somebody pretending to represent the workers of Australia would be saying that this is a good outcome not just for the business itself but for its workers and their families. Yet there is this ideological objection to Australian workplace agreements on the part of the Australian Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth. But let us go to the other things that the Labor Party would abolish if they were able to roll back the industrial relations changes-and not just those being proposed by the government at the present time but also those that have been in operation for the last number of years. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party were very sensitive about the word ‘rollback' today. We know their history on rollback; they were going to roll back the GST. Who are the greatest advocates of the GST in Australia today? The Labor state premiers, all of whom want to hang on to the money that comes directly to their coffers through the GST. So when you hear the word ‘rollback' around Labor Party policies, you should just think about the example of the GST and the Labor Party's flipping and flopping over that and finally, after two terms of parliament, their deciding that they would not proceed with the roll-back-the roll-back of the roll-back. We will hear more about that in relation to industrial relations. The introduction of a national payroll tax is also part of the Labor Party's policy; that would cost more than $270 million and probably 5,000 jobs. Labor would mandate compulsory union bargaining and interference in every workplace. It also would remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Workplace Relations Act and abolish the 20 allowable matters cap in awards. So, as part of the policy of the Labor Party, we would return to the 500and 600-page awards of the past. Labor would abolish the building industry task force and reignite the unfair dismissal burden on small businesses. That would make it even easier than it is now to bring an unfair dismissal claim, because Labor would abolish or greatly reduce filing fees-one of the very few things to have put some sort of brake on unfair dismissals in this country. It is no wonder that, in the lead-up to the last election and not only on October 9, the Australian people rejected these sorts of policies from the Labor Party-and Labor has not repudiated these policies, although I will come to its present flip-flopping-and that everybody else who made a notable contribution in that debate said that the policies were misguided. Labor's most successful pollster, Rod Cameron, described the party's AWA policy as misguided and its overall workplace policy as ‘backward-looking and totally out of step with community and work force trends'. When you have 1.6 million extra jobs and a 14 per cent increase in real wages, it is no wonder that you would start to question the logic of winding back a policy that had helped bring about that situation in Australia. John Edwards, Paul Keating's former economics adviser, described the platform as one that had the potential to ‘reverse Labor's own reforms of 1992-1994 and reintroduce the worse aspects of the old awards system'. This man was one of the chief advisers to Mr Keating when he was the Prime Minister of this country. Access Economics, one of the ALP's preferred economics consultants, concluded that: Such policies are unlikely to deliver on the goals espoused by the ALP-high growth, high incomes, low unemployment, and a fairer Australia. ... the ALP workplace relations policy platform runs the risk of moving Australia further from those goals. So even Access Economics, one of the Labor Party's economics consultants of choice, was saying that the goals that were espoused by the Australian Labor Party were unlikely to be advanced by the very policies it took to the last election. Indeed, on the weekend I saw remarks from the Leader of the Opposition about a decrease in productivity in Australia, and yet, on the other hand, he proposes policies that would further limit productivity growth in this country. There is simply no logic in these propositions coming from the ALP. It reminds one of the ALP's proposals in relation to tax policy, and that is to block. Labor is the only party still blocking and saying that it will block in the Senate those tax proposals which were announced in the budget this year and which would be to the advantage of all Australians. But criticism of the ALP's approach to industrial relations is not confined to those I have quoted. The Australian business community has overwhelmingly condemned the ALP's platform as a serious threat to the economic health of Australia. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry warned that it would: ... adversely affect the interests of private employers and compromise economic development. It said: The additional costs it would impose on business through further regulation and heightened trade union activity would have significant implications for jobs and employment ... This organisation, which represents businesses that employ something like 3½ million Australians, says that this would have an adverse impact on jobs and employment in Australia. Surely those who are creating the four jobs and employment in Australia ought to be listened to by those who are making policy, particularly those in the ALP. The Business Council of Australia also warned of ‘real threats to Australia's continuing economic and job growth if workplace relations were re-regulated in line with Labor's platform'. The member for Perth spoke about Michael Chaney, one of the members of the Business Council of Australia and head of its IR committee. Mr Chaney has warned about the policies of the Labor Party and said that they would take Australia backwards. The Australian Mines and Metals Association, which represents businesses that are involved in developing the resources sector, described Labor's IR policy as ‘a disastrous U-turn' in IR policy making for the resources sector and Australia generally. It seems that no account whatsoever is taken by the Australian Labor Party of the dire warnings of organisations such as this, which represents companies that are responsible for much of the wealth creation in Australia through the resources sector, about what the Labor Party's policies would do for this country and every one of us in terms of our job prospects and wage prospects. The Australian Industry Group described Labor's policy as: ... a major retrograde step, which would have enormous economically damaging impacts and really, it would drive investment out of Australia. Any Australian that hears this litany of complaints about a policy by a political party ought to be concerned about it. Mr Adams interjecting",38
119,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Lyons says that it is only one side of the argument. It is the side of the argument that is concerned about investment in Australia, which is a critical, core component of employment and jobs. I know the member for Lyons is interested in jobs and employment. He was concerned about jobs and employment for people in the Tasmanian forestry industry, and rightly so. I suggest he go and talk to people like those at the Bakehouse in Strahan, Tasmania. They were able to use AWAs to smooth out the seasonal fluctuations in terms of the tourist trade for that business. I suggest that he go and ask the workers there whether AWAs were an advantage to them in Strahan. The member for Lyons and everybody who knows the west coast of Tasmania would be aware that there are great seasonal fluctuations in terms of employment. There is employment when the tourists are there, when they come. Do you want people working for three months of the year and not being able to work for six, eight or nine months of the year, or do you want to smooth out the seasonal impact on employment in industries like that? I know the member for Lyons has his heart in the right place in terms of protecting the workers of Tasmania and the workers of Australia. I say to him: look at the record. That is where I began this speech. The record is that there are 1.6 million more jobs in Australia than there were in 1996. There has been a 14 per cent growth in real wages. We have the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country. We are in a time of prosperity, but if that prosperity is going to continue for this and future generations then we cannot rest on our laurels. The world does not owe us a living. We have to make further reforms to ensure that all Australians can thrive into the future.",42
120,Ms GEORGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to be able to speak today on this matter of public importance. It is a matter of importance not just to those in this chamber; it is a matter of increasing public importance that will be taken to people in the community in the months and years ahead in the lead-up to the next election. I am amazed at the introduction of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to the debate this afternoon. He asks us to look at the record and at the facts. Then he goes on to talk about the fact that we have now the lowest unemployment rate, the extra jobs that are being created, the real wage increases that have occurred and ends by talking about the fact that, in this country today, we have the lowest level of disputation on record-an all-time low. The first question one would ask is: if all these economic outcomes have been achieved under a system of conciliation and arbitration that has served this nation well for over 100 years, what is the minister's rationale for the extreme, divisive and unfair changes that this government wants to introduce? Secondly, I listened very carefully to what the minister had to say and there was a good deal of speculation about what Labor may or may not do in the future but very little rationale for the kinds of measures that this government is intent on introducing. The minister thought the heat was on the opposition about what they may or may not do. The government's real agenda is to obfuscate and cloud the issues in this debate by appealing to the often heard refrain in this House, ‘The Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had.' How often have we heard that line? We have heard it repeated often in this House. The government thinks that, if you repeat a slogan ad nauseam and often, somehow people will believe it. People on this side of the chamber understand quite clearly, as the community will, that this refrain is no more than a spin-a real con job-and that this will be well and truly understood by the community as the package of proposals is unravelled and brought to their attentionnot in any scaremongering way, as the minister suggests, but the truth will be laid out all the people in the community to make their judgments about this government's real intent. As the member for Perth explained in his contribution, this agenda is really about John Howard's lifelong political ambition of deregulating the Australian labour market and ridding Australia of effective trade unionism that is there to protect those who are most vulnerable in the workplace. He now hopes that with control of the Senate, which comes after 1 July, his punitive and extreme agenda will finally be adopted. We have been lucky in being able to protect working people in the community because the Senate has been able, up until now, to temper the worse excesses of this government's ideological zealotry. The Senate has provided checks and balances, but the community needs to understand that, from 1 July onwards, that will no longer be there. We know this government's form on industrial relations matters, we know that the tentacles of the maritime dispute reached into the highest levels of this government and we know what their objective was on the waterfront. But the men in balaclavas with their rottweilers did not break the spirit of working people and neither will these proposed changes break the spirit of people out there at work in the community who, I am sure, will understand the intent of the so-called reforms this government wants to introduce. People need to understand that the changes that the government will bring into this chamber will be the final nail in the coffin of a system of conciliation and arbitration that has served our nation well since the early 1900s. It is this system that John Howard and his government want to dismantle. The end result of dismantling that system is that ordinary workers and their families will bear the brunt of reduced wages into the future, of awards being stripped of existing for entitlements, and of the removal of industrial safety nets that have ensured that Australia has been a land of the fair go and a system of conciliation and arbitration that has been the envy of the world. Make no mistake about it: workers with the weakest bargaining power will have the most to lose. The people hardest hit will be those who we refer to as the working poor, the part-time and casual workers, workers who are not in unions, and workers for whom the award system to date has been their only protection against excesses at the workplace. We are talking about some two million workers across a range of industries who rely on their awards as their safety net: workers in the hospitality sector, the retail sector, health, the child-care sector and in community services. It will not take long for them to see through the lie that this government continues to repeat-that is, that this government is the best friend that workers have ever had. They will realise, without too much debate, that this government is no friend of working people. It will take one simple thing for the government to immediately allay their concerns. All it has to do is give a simple guarantee to all workers in Australia. That simple guarantee is that no individual worker would be worse off under its changes. But it cannot and it will not cause the changes are not about protecting existing conditions and entitlements but about eroding them. Workers out there understand the inequities in the system. How is it that the government can sit back while the new CEO of Telstra, Sol Trujillo, receives a package of $10 million but, if you happen to be a worker on the minimum wage of $25,000, you are not being given any guarantee that your conditions and wages will remain intact? The new CEO of Telstra will earn in one day nearly double what is earned in a whole year by 1.6 million workers on the minimum wage. In today's dollars a worker on the minimum wage would have to work for 40 years to earn but one-tenth of Sol Trujillo's new package. It would be nice for this government not to obfuscate on the issue-not to try and deflect attention onto our supposed agenda but to say to working people, ‘Not one of you will be worse off.' But you will not, and you cannot, because your agenda is all about making them worse off. The government has shown its true form over the minimum wage. As the member for Perth indicated quite clearly, the government's agenda will see people who are currently on $25,000 a year being $2,600 a year, or $50 a week, worse off if they have their way. It is no wonder they want to get rid of the independent umpire: the independent umpire has exercised independence, has taken into account what it requires to have a decent standard of living in a civilised community and has awarded increases higher than the government wants. So you get rid of the commission and you put into place a new Fair Pay Commission. What will it do? It will have the discretion to set the minimum wage on a ‘periodic basis'. How periodic will ‘periodic' be? It obviously will not be annual wage adjustment; otherwise the government would have stipulated that. We are be- looking at going down the American route, where the federal minimum wage is $6.70 an hour and has not been increased since 1997. That is the kind of fate that awaits people on the minimum wage. The other issues under attack relate to the awards. The awards across industries have provided the industrial safety net for workers for time immemorial. But no, they are also at risk as the government moves to legislate a handful of minimum conditions, which will be the comparison, the new no disadvantage test, for agreements and individual contracts into the future. So you get rid of awards as the industrial safety net, legislate a handful of minimum conditions and then you say to employers: go for it, force people onto individual contracts with the only test being a minimum wage that is adjusted periodically and a handful of minimum conditions. We know what that will mean. It will mean that current entitlements like overtime, shift penalties, leave loadings, public holiday loadings, weekend rates and redundancy pay are all up for grabs. (Time expired)",42
121,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pleasure to be able to speak on this MPI. It is just a pity that the members on the other side either have amnesia or have not been students of recent Australian industrial history. The best record that Australian workers have experienced has been under this government. In the last 10 years we have seen real increases in wages of 14 per cent compared to only 1.2 per cent in 13 years of Labor. People on the other side want a guarantee. We all remember guarantees and the cheapness of some of those words, particularly those uttered by the last Prime Minister on the Labor side prior to us coming in in 1996 and even his predecessor, Bob Hawke, who made that disgraceful assertion that ‘no an child shall live in poverty by 1990'. Words are cheap. The best indication of future performance and of the entitlements of Australian workers is past performance. This government can hold its head up high in terms of its record over the last nine years and what it has been able to deliver to Australian workers. Australian workers do have a good friend in this government. The Howard government is a good friend and one that has delivered for workers in this country. Let us go through it. I know that members on the other side know these facts; they just seem to have amnesia when it comes to giving us credit for our achievements. We have delivered real wage increases of over 14 per cent, compared to 1.2 per cent in 13 years of Labor; the lowest unemployment in almost 30 years; the lowest levels of industrial disputes since records were kept; higher productivity; and the highest living standards that we have seen for workers in this country. The ALP could certainly learn from the history and the record of what this government has been able to achieve. It is a record that we can be proud of. It a record that, in itself, is a guarantee of the type of performance and the diligence that we will apply in government to making sure that the living standards and the financial security of Australian workers are not diminished by our industrial relations changes. As I said, we have a 5.1 per cent unemployment rate, the lowest since 1976. Last month we saw an increase in employment of 14,000, leading to a record high of 9,981,000 Australian workers. This is the highest that we have ever seen. Over the past year 330,000 jobs have been created. Almost 70 per cent of those have been full-time positions. I know that members on the other side decry increases in employment levels, always saying that it is an increase in part-time and casual employment. Seventy per cent of new jobs created in the last 12 months have been in full-time employment. There have been 1.6 million jobs created since we came into power in 1996. This is a record that we can be proud of. This is a record that every worker in Australia can look at and say: ‘We've seen what you've done. We can trust what you've done. We know that you will deliver with your next reform package, as you've delivered in the past,' rather than falling for the cheap scare tactics of the ALP. That is the only thing they have going in any policy area. Name the policy area, and that is the tactic that they use: one of scare and fear rather than putting down the facts and the history that we have been able to achieve in government. By contrast, what do we have from the ALP? We had an announcement on the weekend. It took place because at the ALP conference in Queensland the Leader of the Opposition was intimidated by his union friends into giving some form of guarantee that he will roll back the industrial relations reforms if and when the ALP ever come to is power. This situation would be disastrous for Australian workers. We have heard it said before in this debate, but I will say it again: do not take our word for it; simply look at some of the spokespeople on the other side who also say the same thing. Take for example John Edwards-a former Keating government economics adviser who does not sit as an adviser on this side of the House-who acknowledges that a roll back of our industrial relations reforms by a possible incoming Australian Labor Party government will take Australian workers back to the 1970s. So we are not simply rolling back the reforms of this government; we are even rolling back the reforms that took place under their stewardship when they were in power in the 1980s and early 1990s. This will be disastrous for Australian workers. Australian workers can look to the Howard government to look after them, rather than to the cheap theatre and scare tactics of the other side. I understand that one of the things the Labor Party want to roll back is AWAs. For some reason, they have this fear of AWAs. They have got it in their system that they simply want to get rid of AWAs. They think that AWAs are a disaster and that they cheapen the conditions of Australian workers. The Australian Labor Party's policy to abolish AWAs will be disastrous for Australian workers. It will create greater disadvantages for Australian workers than anything which they claim we would do through our system. Labor's policy will lock workers into a rigid ‘one size fits all' awards system, lower wages, lessen flexibility and lessen incentives to earn more. We have seen the success of AWAs since they were introduced in 1997. Since then, 691,000 AWAs have been approved. Indeed, 205,000 have been approved in the 12 months ending on 31 May, an increase of 44 per cent over the same period last year. Industries with the highest rates of AWAs have been those in the retail trade, accommodation, cafes and restaurants, property and business services. Those industries need flexibility in order to survive and they often rely on seasonality and peak demands in their work and customer base. The Australian worker has benefited from this government's industrial relations reforms. Another source of evidence for that, which the member for Throsby conveniently overlooked in her contribution, is the Business Council of Australia. Recent research from the Business Council of Australia estimates that the benefits of changes to the workplace relations system were equivalent to $4,200 in additional income per person in 2004. As much as the opposition would like to talk about national wage case decisions and the government's position on those, the fact is that through this government's policy and industrial relations reforms, we have seen $4,200 in additional income per person in 2004 because of the changes that we have introduced. It is equivalent to over $80,000 in wealth per person. That is significant and it has been welcomed by Australian workers. Why are we having this debate? Why has the ALP all of a sudden got itself into a lather over industrial relations reform? Is it because it is losing out on all other policy fronts? Is it because it has a myopic view about who has the right to represent Australian workers? I believe it is because of two things: leadership and preselections. This is all about domestic ALP politics. It has nothing to do with workers' rights and looking after working people. It is all to do with the two issues of leadership and preselections. The Leader of the Opposition said in a speech earlier this year that the lemon of industrial relations reform has been squeezed dry. The member for Perth says that more reform needs to take place. Richard Marles, a possible preselection candidate in the seat of Corio, has acknowledged the absurd situation that the current complex and competing systems(Time expired)",44

I previously spoke in relation to Labor's amendments to this bill regarding the access of adoptive parents to the maternity payment. It simply does not make sense for the government to place an age restriction of two years on adoptive parents accessing this payment. I urge the government to take up Labor's amendment for the benefit of all adoptive parents. While the improvements in changing the method of calculating family tax payment benefit part B are welcome for those returning to work, the government has indeed missed an opportunity to address the crucial policy problems of measures like the maternity payment in this bill. As I have said, I do not believe it is fair for rich city families to get the same government support that battling families in my electorate receive. A struggling single mother from west Tweed should rightly expect more support from the government that the wife of a rich North Sydney executive. Not only should they expect it, they deserve it. While the government is giving families this $3,000 with one hand, it is taking it back with the other, with rising health care costs and mortgage repayments. Their now infamous broken promise on the Medicare safety net-the minister for health's rock-solid, ironclad guarantee that turned out to be a waste of breath-has indeed weakened Medicare and increased health costs to families. This is at a time when families can barely afford to go to the doctor. For those 10,000 families in my electorate who struggle to get by on just $500 a week, there is often a real choice made between seeing a doctor and buying the groceries. The local bulk-billing rate is just 69.5 per cent, well below the state average of 78.1 per cent. Some local families simply cannot afford to go to the doctor, and the government has failed to address the problem. Local families also suffer because of the government's removal of the federal dental health scheme in 1997. They now often have to wait years for treatment. The government's other famous broken promise on interest rates is also hitting local families very hard. On the North Coast the median house price is approximately $333,000, which means the March interest rate rise will cost an average of between $52 and $56 a month. So while the government seems to be giving families a helping hand, it is actually taking it back dollar by dollar. The government has also missed an opportunity to cut red tape for these same struggling families. In order to get the maternity payment, families are required to fill in a very complicated 20-page form. Families in my electorate are telling me that this cumbersome and often time-consuming form would almost stop them from applying for the payment if they did not so desperately need the money. This is a government that continually puts up barriers to stop families accessing the help they need. This is a government that says, ‘We'll give you $3,000, but we'll make you walk through a bureaucratic minefield to get it.' As anyone who had a baby knows, parents of newborns barely have enough time to sleep let alone fill in a complicated 20-page document. There are still very real and very valid concerns attached to this payment that the government has failed to address, as there are with most of the government's welfare reforms. This year's budget saw the creation of a two-tiered welfare system: which side of 1 July 2006 a person with a disability or a single mother goes on to benefits determines the level of government assistance they receive. The government has created a system where people suffering from exactly the same disability will have different work and income obligations and single mothers with the same needs will receive two different payments. It is an obvious display of the of inequity we have come to expect from this government. We have also come to expect this government to make these sorts of demands without providing the infrastructure needed to support its changes. The Treasurer is pushing sole parents back into work but has not given too much thought to who is going to look after their kids. In Tweed Heads there is only one after-school care centre. These people do a fantastic job, but their resources are stretched to the limit. They simply cannot take on any more children because they do not have the federal funding for more afterschool care places. So where are the children of these sole parents supposed to go while their mum or dad is at work? The government certainly is not providing the child-care places needed to care for the children of the people it is forcing back to work. A new generation of latchkey kids will be created. This is not a measure from a government that values families. This is not a government that is providing for Australia's future. While I support the changes to the family tax benefit part B in this bill, they need to be has looked at in the context of other government decisions. Local families in my electorate are struggling under this government with rising health care costs, no investment in local infrastructure like child-care places, a twotiered welfare reform system and higher mortgages because of their poor economic management. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to give with one hand and take with the other. I will continue to raise these issues until the families of Richmond are heard.",47
125,Ms LEY,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary (Children and Youth Affairs)) (4.12 pm)-I thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to this debate for their concern for and commitment to the families in the electorates that they represent. type The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2005 provides important assistance for families and for lowincome Australians renting their homes. The first initiative arises from the government's More Help for Families package, which was announced on 11 May 2004. It relates to family tax benefit part B, which assists families with one main income and, in the case of couples, is based on the income of the lower income earner, provided that their income is under certain thresholds. Current arrangements provide for the income of the secondary earner in a couple who commences paid work for the first time or returns to paid work partway during a particular income year following the birth of a child to be taken into account under the part B income test for that income year. This can result in a debt on income reconciliation for that year and may act as a disincentive for those wanting to return to the work force. A new method of calculating part B is introduced by this bill. The new method ensures that the secondary earner gets the maximum rate of part B for the relevant period as long as all the criteria for the new method are met for the day or days in question. This beneficial measure will be available to a secondary earner who is a natural parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or other primary carer of the child, such as a grandparent who starts work or returns to work for the first time after taking a grandchild into their care. The measure will apply in respect of the 2005-06 income year and later income years. Maternity payment is a substantial payment, available since 1 July 2004, to families with new children, including adopting families who assume the care of children up to 26 weeks of age. However, recent data on adoptions in Australia suggest that the majority adoptions are inter-country adoptions which often happen when the children are older than 26 weeks, because of the lengthy processes involved. Therefore, these adopting families have often missed out on the maternity payment. The government is attentive to the needs of this group of people and has acted in this bill to widen the maternity payment age range for adoptions. Maternity payment will now be available for children being adopted from another country who enter their new family's care and arrive in Australia before age two. This change will be backdated to the commencement of maternity payment on 1 July 2004. Local adoptions will also benefit from the age extension to cover all families assuming the care of a child before age two, assuming maternity payment has not already been paid for the child under the current rules. Several other family assistance measures are introduced in this bill. Among these are amendments to reduce the impact of family tax benefit or child-care benefit debts in certain situations. These amendments will apply in situations where parents have separated and a debt arises for one parent because an income tax return has not been lodged by their ex-partner when the return is necessary for annual income reconciliation of FTB or child-care benefit to occur. Finally, there are two measures to refine the administration of the rent assistance program for social security and family tax benefit. Rent assistance assists low-income customers who are renting their homes. Amendments are being made to make sure that rent assistance is paid to a customer only once, not once with a person's FTB and once with their social security or veterans' affairs payment. This double payment is at risk of occurring under the current legislation. Also, some clarification is provided that, when a person fails to give information regularly of sought by Centrelink to confirm their ongoing rent assistance entitlement, the rent assistance portion of their family tax benefit or social security payment may be cancelled, rather than the whole benefit or payment as currently provided. In the debate in the last session, the member for Isaacs raised an individual case for comment. However, I make it clear that it is more appropriate for these individual cases to be referred to the minister's office for advice on the basis of the full circumstances, because too often, as we have seen in this place, information is provided that is not complete, not correct or both. So I would urge the member for Isaacs, in the interests of her constituent, to contact the minister's office. The member for Fowler talked about an election year handout of $600, and I want to make it clear to members opposite that that $600 supplement is paid not just in an election year but in every year. Since coming to office in 1996, this government has increased total family tax benefit payments by $6 billion. In the earlier debate, the member for Mitchell, I think, reminded us that each eli- MCGauran, PJ gible family now receives an average payment of around $7,500. In all, since coming to office, the government has, as I say, increased total assistance to families by over $6 billion a year, and the base rate of family Schultz, A assistance has increased from less than $600 per child in January 1996 to almost $1,700 per child-a real increase of over 100 per cent-and that is a record we are deservedly proud of.

SKILLING AUSTRALIA'S WORKFORCE BILL 2005 Cognate bill: SKILLING AUSTRALIA'S WORKFORCE (REPEAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That the bill be now read a second time.",51
127,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Jagajaga) (4.29 pm)The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 represent some of the most significant changes to the structure of the tional education and training system since Labor established the national system over a decade ago. That was a national training system built upon a common understanding that cooperation equalled progress, where the interests of ensuring Australia had the skills base we required so that our economy could grow were put before petty politicking. Unfortunately we now have Commonwealthstate relations reduced to political grandstanding and cheap pointscoring by the current federal government. Unconcerned by the outcomes, they are motivated by increasing their control and power but without the troubling by-products of responsibility and accountability. Their attitude is nowhere better typified than in the area of education and training. The approach of the government in this very important area has bordered on negligence for the bulk of their time in office. They cut away swathes of growth funding for TAFE during their first two budgets and failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine years. They were sowing the seeds of today's skills crisis-a crisis they still cannot acknowledge. When the cacophony of voices crying for increased skills investment reached a crescendo the response of this government was a petulant display with talk of bypassing the states and territories and threats to TAFE funding. We heard the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education carrying on like this just last Friday. Instead of negotiating and discussing with the states and territories, the government are proposing to duplicate world-class infrastructure and programs with their technical colleges. Minister Hardgrave confirmed their skills negligence, with the latest in a long line of head in the sand comments from this government, when he said during his second reading speech on this bill: .. there is limited evidence of economy-wide national voca- skills shortages ... How can the minister stand in this House and make that extraordinary claim when everyone from the Reserve Bank to the OECD is shouting warnings about Australia's skills crisis? Frankly, it is beyond belief. It should not be surprising then to learn that the content of the two bills before the House today reflect an arrogant and out-of-touch approach-all control and no responsibility. These bills dismantle the cooperative tripartite national training system established by Labor in 1992 under the auspices of the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA as it has become known. The Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 abolishes ANTA and repeals the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act. It transfers ANTA's assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth. These will be vested in the Department of Education, Science and Training. The companion bill, Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005, proposes to establish a new system for the provision of Commonwealth funding to vocational education and training in Australia. It is certainly an audacalendar cious bill. It proposes an unprecedented level of Commonwealth legislative prescription over vocational education and training funding in this country in an attempt to unilaterally force the Commonwealth's agenda upon the states and territories, and therefore upon our world-class TAFE system. There are some very troubling conditions detailed in the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill which demonstrate why the Commonwealth would be better advised to remove the conditions from the legislation itself and to leave them to the text of any future agreements. Proposed section 12 contains two provisions that Labor cannot support. The first forces TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements. Labor believe that the government's ideological industrial relations crusade has no place in legislation about funding vocational education and training. The second requires governments, both state and Commonwealth, to reduce TAFE funding. At a time of skills crisis it is outrageous that the government would introduce legislation that required a reduction in TAFE funding. We will be moving amendments to delete these proposed sections from the bill. Should both of these amendments be unsuccessful, Labor will oppose this legislation. Labor believe that our national training system should be supported by a strong, independent tripartite body able to provide broadly based advice to the entire sector. Training our current and future work force should be a partnership between all involved: government, industry and workers. Given that the government is not willing to honour these principles in the new system it proposes, Labor will also oppose the bill which repeals ANTA and its associated national arrangements. Under current legislative arrangements, vocational education and training funding is lawfully appropriated for the entire 2005 year. I want to emphasise this point because I understand there is a scare campaign being mounted by the government that if we send this legislation off to a Senate committee then we jeopardise VET funding for the rest of the year. Our advice is that the current legislative arrangements guarantee that VET funding is lawfully appropriated for the entire 2005 calendar year. TAFE funding therefore is secure. The massive changes proposed in this legislation should be properly reviewed by this parliament. Commonwealth money for TAFE is available for the rest of the year but will only be passed on if the Commonwealth keeps its word. The government must honour its commitment-reiterated as recently as the last ministerial council-that, if negotiations were continuing, it would maintain funding to the end of 2005. The minister should remember that commitment, which he gave to state and territory ministers. Given the extensive reach of the new funding conditions, coupled with the lack of promised consultation with the states and territories, we will be seeking a Senate inquiry. These are major funding changes with very significant conditions attached to them. It is only right that we have the opportunity to look at the impact that these changes may have on the vocational education and training system in Australia. Before looking at the details of the bills I want to say a few words about the Australian National Training Authority and the national training system it helped bring into existence. On 4 November 1992 the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. He introduced a legislative package to establish ANTA, supported by the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act. These legislative measures gave effect to the groundbreaking agreement between the Commonwealth and the states to establish a new vocational education and training system-a national system with ANTA as its centrepiece. It is worth reflecting on the significance of this agreement and the spirit in which it was negotiated. To quote from the then minister's second reading speech in 1992: That agreement was reached after a sustained period of negotiations, during which the needs a national and properly funded system of vocational education and training were balanced against the constitutional reality that vocational education and training remains primarily a responsibility of the States. This package of legislation respects that balance. Doesn't it seem like an absolute eternity ago that we had a Commonwealth government that understood, let alone respected, the constitutional balance? Certainly this government does not. It also seems like an eternity ago that we had a Commonwealth government that could usher in a comprehensive refocusing of the direction of vocational education and training while crossing not only the federal-state divide but also the party political divide. The agreement to establish ANTA was not implemented by surprise on the state governments. Rather, it was negotiated by governments of both political persuasions. The then federal Labor government was able to be in the same room and have constructive multilateral and bilateral dialogue with the then state Liberal governments, including with that of the biggest state, New South Wales, under both premiers Greiner and Fahey. It really does seem like an absolute eternity ago, given the attitude of the current federal government. To quote again from an age when the Commonwealth acknowledged the need to have the vocational education and training system grow-and actually had an education minister able to deliver the additional funding required-the then minister said the first agreement ‘honours the Commonwealth's commitment to provide triennial funding for vocational education and training, including a total of $720 million in additional funds over the 1993-95 triennium'. So not only did the 1992 legislation lay the institutional foundations for our national training system; it also funded expansion of the system. When Labor introduced the first Vocafor tional Education and Training Funding Act back in 1992, there was $720 million in additional growth funding provided by the Commonwealth from 1993 to 1995. If this government's bill that we are debating here today did what Labor's legislation did back in 1992, there would be an additional $925 million in additional funding in today's dollars for VET funding over the next three years. Instead-and I am sure it will come as no surprise to all of those young people trying to get into TAFE or trying to get an apprenticeship-what we have from this government is very little that is new. It is mostly just a reallocation of existing funds. We have a proposal on the table as part of a new Commonwealth-State Training Funding Agreement funded by this legislation that we are debating today. It almost entirely comprises a reallocation of existing funds and has been unanimously condemned as inadequate by state and territory governments. So, unlike the 1992 agreement, where we could get agreement between the states and territories across the political divide with growth funding for vocational education and training, this time, with this government, we have a Commonwealth government saying, ‘Take it or leave it-this is what's on the table.' And, of course, they are saying that not only to the state and territory governments but also to all the families, all the young people and all the businesses who are being hurt by this government's damaging skills crisis. It is extraordinary, because this common. offer also flies in the face of the Productivity Commission's call for the Howard government to better cooperate with the states on vocational education and training. Of course, the government are ignoring their calls just like they are ignoring the calls of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the OECD to put more investment into this critical area of skills development. So the differences in the Commonwealth's approach now and its approach back in 1992 could not be more pronounced. These bills are the result of no negotiations, no consultations, no sharing of responsibilities and no respect for Commonwealth-state balance. Most damning of all, though, given the extraordinary skills crisis this nation is presented with, is the lack of real growth funding. There is no new general funding of TAFE places for all of those Australians who want to develop their skills. The abolition of the Australian National Training Authority will mark the end of an era. ANTA has earned a very well deserved amount of praise for establishing and maintaining a national system of vocational education and training qualifications and a national system of recognition and credit transfer. This should exist as a worthwhile guide to the often idiosyncratic credit transfer system between, and even within, our universities. So I do want to say thank you to ANTA staff members who have worked hard to create this national system. Staff are now faced with a ‘Canberra or nothing' offer of continuing employment within the department of education. Thanks must also go to the members of the ANTA board from industry and from the unions who have worked very hard together, cooperatively, to bring about this unified national system-not without their disagreements at times but, nevertheless, with a very clear focus that they had in From 1992, under ANTA board chairs Brian Finn, Stuart Hornery and David Hind, they laid the foundations for a truly national tripartite vocational education and training system. It was only a Labor government which actually had the vision to bring about a revitalisation of vocational education and training in the early 1990s. It was a vision to bring together an assortment of qualifications under a single consistent national framework-so important for Australia's development-and a commitment to provide the funding necessary to back the vision up and make things happen. Extraordinarily, it took just a few lines in a prime ministerial press release to undermine and threaten the entire ANTA system. Many in the training sector were taken by surprise by the few short lines buried on page 4 of the Prime Minister's press release dated 22 October 2004 with the headline ‘Fourth Howard Ministry'. In nothing more than an aside the Prime Minister unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA. He did not talk to the states and territories. He did not announce it in cooperation with the partners who had entered into the ANTA agreement in the first place. He just announced it unilaterally on page 4 of a prime ministerial press release. By many accounts, apparently including his own, the minister for education was told, not consulted, about the change. So Dr Nelson, like all of the states and territories, was relegated to the position of a mere bystander-along with his department and everyone else-to one of the biggest changes in the Australian vocational and educational training system in over a decade. The state and territory governments were not consulted. They were supposedly partners in this cooperative national system, founded on a productive relationship of collaboration that the government has progressively undermined and now all but destroyed. It is worrying-although from this government not surprising-that those who have been so intimately involved in the national training system over the past decade were not consulted about its future. This is symptomatic of the growing arrogance of this government. With impending absolute control, on a whim it will be able to do away with national institutions like ANTA. No doubt what we are debating today is a portent of things to come. The government's arrogance is highlighted when we examine the detail of the bills and the funding arrangements for the new national training system it proposes to put in place. The new funding system will be established by the Skilling Australia's Workforce bills, which contain a level of unprecedented prescription from Canberra over how states and territories should allocate training resources. Extraordinarily, this is not only over the Commonwealth's share of the funding but also over all of the states' share of funding. Despite the fact that over 70 per cent of public VET funding comes from the states and territories and less than 30 per cent comes from the Commonwealth, this government wants 100 per cent control. No doubt the minister for education will continue to accept zero per cent of the responsibility for any problems that arise. In this legislation the government is appropriating $4.4 billion in general VET funding over the next 3½ years. Interestingly, this is less than the $4.9 billion the government was purporting to offer the states earlier in the year, so when the minister responds I would appreciate it if he would explain that $500 million discrepancy. To this funding the government is attaching a raft of statutory conditions that will impose restrictions on how the VET system would operate. The states and territories are being told by the Commonwealth, ‘If you want our 30 per cent of funding, you must agree to all of our conditions over all of your funding.' As I understand it, the Commonwealth is refusing to negotiate. The states and territories were promised the opportunity to discuss this legislation before it came into the parliament, but not surprisingly that did not happen. What sort of negotiation can there be if these conditions are enshrined in legislation that comes into the parliament before any discussion takes place? The previous agreements contained targets, goals and conditions, but they did not require legislative entrenchment to make them effective. We are under no illusion that the government will listen to any sense or reason. It seems to be blinded by an extraordinarily centralist crusade, in a perverse reverence of the Whitlam government. We were told by the Prime Minister that abolishing ANTA would create budgetary savings. The current budget identifies savings of $12 million over the next four years. But without ANTA there is a gap to fill in the national industry led advice to government on training and skills. To plug this gap the government is proposing an Institute for Trade Skills Excellence. The functions of this mysterious institute have not yet been detailed, and we will have more to say about that once we finally know what it looks like. What we do know, from the budget papers, is that it is going to cost twice as much as the government is saving by abolishing ANTA$22.9 million over four years; extraordinary. Before I look at some of the specific conditions proposed in the legislation, I want to reflect that it extends the Commonwealth's capacity to micromanage the TAFE system and the courses it offers. This will not come as a surprise to anyone in the university system, because they know that is what has already been introduced in universities by legislation passed through this parliament in 2003. The education minister then gave himself unprecedented power to pick and choose what he considers to be courses worthy of funding. It is extraordinary that we have an education minister who knows better than our universities what should be taught to each and every one of our students. It is not only in undergraduate teaching; the minister, Brendan Nelson, also has the power to veto research grants. Using his extraordinary, untold wisdom he has already rejected two Australian Research Council peer reviewed recommendations. Unfortunately, we still cannot get any reasons for him rejecting those recommendations. Proposed section 7(3) of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 says: The Minister must not authorise a payment of financial assistance ... unless the Minister approved the annual VET plan for the State for the year. That gives the minister unprecedented control-which is, of course, very true to form for this arrogant government. Part 2, division 2 of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill details the lengths this government wants to go to to prescribe the operations of the VET system and circumscribe the policy-making capacities of state and territory governments. Proposed section 7 stipulates that the Commonwealth minister must not authorise payments of financial assistance unless the conditions are complied with. All of this is, of course, at the complete discretion of the Commonwealth minister. As I mentioned earlier, section 12 contains two provisions Labor will be seeking to delete from the bill. Section 12(1)(b) requires all of our TAFEs to offer Australian workplace agreements to their staff. Labor strongly believes that the vocational education and training system is no place for the Howard government to be driving its ideological industrial relations agenda in. I will move an amendment to delete this requirement. There is no question that Australian workplace agreements have been an outright dud in setting employment conditions. The hallmark of their success is that, after nine long years of vigorous advocacy and promotion by the Howard government, AWAs cover just 2.4 per cent of the work force. That is why the government has decided that advocacy and promotion are no longer the way forward: wherever it can, it is going to force AWAs onto those institutions-make them offer AWAs to their workers. The government is proceeding in universities; now, through this legislation, it is trying to impose its industrial relations conditions in our TAFEs. The government has even decided to has establish its own system of technical colleges and force the implementation of these industrial relations changes in these new schools. This requirement contravenes the objects of the government's own Workplace Relations Act. A principal object of that act is: ... ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level ... That is the government's own law; that is their own principle. They should at least have some respect for their own principles and leave the decision as to whether or not AWAs will be offered to be made by the people who actually run the TAFEs-who, of course, are not employees of this government. Of course, the government acknowledge that their blind ideological pursuit of AWAs is somewhat constrained by the Commonwealth Constitution. Some state governments have repeatedly told the government that they are constitutionally precluded from offering AWAs to TAFE employees. This is because in some states, such as Tasmania and Queensland, TAFE employees are part of the state Public Service and therefore ineligible for AWAs under the terms of the Workplace Relations Act. But it would be unlike this government to let reason stand in the way of its ideological crusade on industrial relations. The second amendment Labor will move concerns words in section 12(1)(f); specifically, I will move to delete the words that would require governments, both state and Commonwealth, to reduce their funding of TAFE. At a time of skills crisis in this country, it is outrageous that the Howard government would introduce legislation that required a reduction in TAFE funding. This government has already slashed the vocational education and training growth funding; it has created an $833 million skills deficit by lagging behind states and territories on vocational education and training funding; and it has turned away 270,000 Australians from TAFE since 1998. Now, in this bill, the government proposes to further reduce funding, and to force the states to do so as well. Labor supports TAFE institutions developing more entrepreneurial and commercially orientated business plans, but this should not be used as an excuse to cut TAFE funding at a time when Australia is crying out for more skilled workers. The government has belatedly been forced to follow Labor's lead on this issue, and the minister will be moving amendments to delete these words from the bill. But the words are hardly a drafting error, which is the way the minister tried to explain the situation when he made the amendments public: they are an admission of policy intent. If both of the amendments that I will move in the consideration-in-detail stage do not succeed, we will strongly oppose this legislation in the House and we will seek a Senate inquiry to look at the details of the legislation and the impact that it will have on our vocational education and training system. If the government perseveres and takes this legislation as it currently exists into the Senate, we will strongly oppose it in the Senate as well.",51
128,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"In attempting to lay the blame for everything that has happened in skills training upon this government, the member for Jagajaga puts a case as to the failure of the fundamentally responsible body-the state governmentthat wants to defend the rights quite significantly. She also failed to mention to the House that, at a recent COAG meeting, for the first time in the life of the Federation, there was an agreement that we should have some harmonisation in skills training and, more particularly, qualifications, to ensure that modern young Australians gaining a qualification in one state can practise it in another. Let me add to that that, notwithstanding agreements made, virtually no state will recognise defence department qualifications. I have had cases brought to my attention. One particular person went to the WA authorities and said: ‘Here are my qualifications. Please authenticate them so that I can go up to the north-west, fill the skills vacancy and make good money so I can save for the future.' They said: ‘You enlisted in Victoria. You'll have to go over there to get these qualifications ticked.' When he went over to Victoria, they said: ‘No, we don't take any notice of defence qualifications. You'll have to start apprenticeship for four years, at 27.' The member for Jagajaga complains about her perception of bullying. Why couldn't the state governments have got off their parochial high horse and fixed these problems years ago? Why is it that we have to use the power of the purse, the chequebook, to get some common sense on the most fundamental of issues? I remember the minister pointing out in this place that a young person trained in hairdressing in Victoria cannot get work in that trade, with that skill, in New South Wales. And what about the nursing profession? Today, people in that profession are educated in universities. In my state, they can give you an injection; the last I heard was that in New South Wales they cannot. These are the sorts of silly, parochial crossborder problems that highly mobile Australians confront today. The member for Jagajaga is complaining that we the Howard government did not properly consult with the states. They ought to have been ringing us up, saying that it was time we got rid of ANTA, that it does not work. It clearly has not worked. We have had trotted out to us that somehow since the Howard government came in there has been a massive change in the availability of skilled persons. Early in the piece we boasted that we had lifted apprenticeships from 160,000 under Labor to 400,000, but our efforts to generate prosperity within Australia have made 400,000 not enough. To suggest, as the member for Jagajaga did, that there is some relationship between that and union awards in TAFE is drawing a pretty long bow. It is very obvious that the opposition wants to make something of overseas debt notwithstanding the fact that the issue has no substance, in as much as the servicing cost of Australia's overseas debt today-not conan tributed to by the Commonwealth-is at about nine per cent, when under Labor it grew to 20 per cent. I remember reading at the time that when you go over 25 per cent the IMF gives you a call. We would have been one of those nations needing debt forgiveness. Nearly $100 billion of it by any measure was Commonwealth debt. The Leader of the Opposition in raising this issue infers that all you have to do is fix the skills problem and the foreign debt will go away. That was part of the transcript of his speeches to Labor or to the unions over the weekend. While we need increased skills training and we have jobs to fill, any suggestion that that would reduce our foreign debt when it is a debt contracted through expanding our industries-and we are going to get another $2 billion spent in Western Australia on a new liquefied gas train and some of that will be borrowed overseas but not by the government-is wrong. There is a hidden message in what the Leader of the Opposition is telling us. Notwithstanding that the government has got rid of all the debt and that skills in themselves could never address whatever amount of overseas debt might exist from time to time, it is wink wink, nod nod, you should go and raise interest rates and have the recession we had to have repeated. That is the only serious intervention left to government if he is worried about something that in fact is not a problem. He ought to get clear for this House what he is talking about in that regard. The member for Jagajaga mentioned the Leader of the Opposition's time as minister for education. I thought he told Australians at the time that was the most boring job he had ever had and he never did anything because nothing was needed. So he was not worried too much about the present skills shortage. When it comes to these issues the government has made some very sensible provisions. Firstly, something like $4.4 billion will go to the states and territories over the funding period 2005-08. Let me just comment briefly on the so-called amendments to be moved by the member for Jagajaga. She makes the point that the legislation is going to shove AWAs down the throats of state employees. That is not what the legislation says. It says: ... ensuring that TAFE institutions introduce more flexible employment arrangements by offering Australian workplace agreements to staff, except where making such agreements under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is not possible because of the corporate status of the TAFE institution, in which case other individual agreements should be offered. The clear description was that this is our ideological bent and you will not get any money if you do not have AWAs. No, you will not get any money if you do not offer them. AWAs get all sorts of criticism. The member for Jagajaga went so far as to say that they have been an absolute failure based simply on the extent to which they have been taken up. There has been a flood of AWAs from Western Australia. The reason that they were not taken up earlier was that the state legislation was even more flexible until the MCGinty-MACTiernan government with their offsider Gallop changed all those laws and made an absolute mess of them. Business just voted with its feet and came over to AWAs, and I think there has been a very substantial increase. AWAs were implemented in the Pilbara under state legislation, and I read just the other day how the only criticism being levelled up there was that people on AWAs are not talked to by the people who stayed with awards. Every now and then the unions tell us that AWAs rip money off people. Every now and again the unions go into the arbitration commission and say, ‘We want our award workers upgraded to AWA levels under the award.' Are the unions going in there and saying, ‘We want the same conditions as the AWA blokes get so that our members get less'? It happens. They go in there and they use the AWAs as the standard for changes to the award. I read the other day of a bulldozer driver in the Pilbara whose wages went up $20,000 a year and he got access to staff superannuation. He said, ‘I'm not going back.' I know why the boss made a profit on that deal: because there did not have to be two people, fully paid under the award, allocated to the bulldozer. Because there were two jobs at all times for workers, the extra person allocated to the excavator driver and the dragline driver played cards in the shed. Of course, they did not do anything. Then, of course, there was a bit of a problem because the train drivers taking their trains out to the mine site and back-a daytrip in an air-conditioned cab-had to be provided with a crib and that included half a side of lamb. All train drivers are apparently carnivorous-they have to chomp on a raw leg of lamb on the trip out to the mine site. That was what AWAs did away with. On the one hand, the employee on the bulldozer got a major wage increase and, of course, his skills were upgraded in the process. On the other hand, the second party had to work on another job typically on the mine site. There were not many sackings; they went and did something productive. I have seen that same thing happen on a woodchip stockpile, I think it was near Geelong. The operator could not employ his own bulldozer driver, he had to take one from the port authority and the other one was down in the shed. They showed us the shed. They had to provide a table so that they could play cards. We say that we have a skills shortage and that sort of stupidity contributes to it. That is what AWAs have done. They have not reduced people's wages but at least they have given the employer the right to be competitive in a place where, as we know, it is getting more and more difficult. The Prime Minister today talked about the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom. He did not tell us what it is across the Channel in France: it is 10 per cent. They legislated a 35-hour week and inspectors went around to see if the lights were still on after five o'clock, to make sure no-one was working. Look at their problems. That is the point I want to make. It is ridiculous to think that we are going to pass two amendments that do not even stack up when you look at them. I think the second one that takes away part of the legislation is quite remarkable because it basically refers to some lines in the legislation which state that all actions should be taken to reduce the cost to government. We are here as the representatives of the taxpayer and the Labor Party say, ‘No, you don't do that.' All they want to do is to measure excellence by expenditure; they do not want to say what expenditure is sufficient for the taxpayer to achieve the sorts of outcomes that are required. This is good legislation. It commits a huge amount of money-and I might add that was one of the member for Jagajaga's other contributions. She wants to tell us that this ernment is putting in only 30 per cent of the money and the states are putting in 70 per cent. But half of the 70 per cent comes from here too, from the federal taxpayer. It is now clearly evidenced. I can only quote the figures for Western Australia, and they vary two or three per cent around Australia. On 9 September the Western Australian newspapers referred to the fact that the state Treasurer over there, Mr Ripper-well named for the job-actually discovered that he had $900 million in the bank that he did not know about. They bothered to tell us where the revenues of the state of Western Australia come from. They said $4.12 billion for that year came from their own sources of taxation and $5.68 billion was sent by the Australian government per favour of the Australian taxpayer. In Western Australia over 50 per cent of their total revenues are provided from the decisions made in this place. We give them a specific grant of 30 per cent-they do the same with education, they only talk about the specific grants-but in fact across the board we give them 50 per cent of everything they spend and that means that the member for Jagajaga is wrong. The Commonwealth contribution to this training process is 30 per cent, if she is correct, in specific grants and another 35 per cent in general-purpose grants. So we are the ones that are putting in the 70 per cent and we should have some say on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. The Labor Party should not be striking out a clause that asks for efficiency. Above all else for the first time, as agreed at COAG, we are to agree that qualifications will relate to performance not to years. It is the most amazing contradiction that I have ever struck. For decades, the trade union movement, in their awards-particularly in my experience as an employer-insisted on the number of apprentices that could be emgovployed relative to the number of tradesmen. The purpose behind that was that bosses were such nasty people they would fill the workshop with apprentices to save money. It was a basic principle that unions did not like apprentices. I am not sure how many awards you would find where that is still relativity applicable, but I certainly experienced the fact that, when you were trying to give kids some training, the trade union was knocking on your door saying. ‘You've got too many; you've only got one chef and you can't employ two apprentices,' notwithstanding that they joined in different years. All of a sudden the unions say we do not have enough but then they put their foot down and say apprentices have to hang around on apprentice wages for four years. You wonder why the statistics say apprentices all leave after two years. A mother of such an apprentice recently told me that his boss says he is qualified enough to work not only as a tradesman in his trade but also as a foreman of a gang, yet he has two years to complete his apprenticeship. You wonder why these people disappear out of the system. They get jobs anyway but in hard times they will put in their CV and some employer will say, ‘Oh, he's not a tradesman.' It appears that COAG eventually had a flash of inspiration and is going to do something about it. The member for Jagajaga got up here and said there was no collaboration, there was no cooperation and that we just made some announcements-surprise, surprise, there has been an entrenched opposition to all these matters. Of course excellence should be the standard for all TAFE people, not longevity of service or any other measure. She complained and mentioned universities. In my recent reading I see Newcastle, Curtin and Bond universities all saying they have to restrict certain courses. Why? Because nobody is taking them. Bond today announced they are moving IT back into commerce because they are not getting enough students. They are a business and have to break even. Congratulations to the new vice-chancellor at the University of Newcastle. He at least realises how many basket weaving courses they apparently still have. Of course they should not be there at taxpayers' expense. You provide for the needs of the people and the skills they want to be trained in. I support this legislation. certainly will not be voting for the opposition amendments. They are silly and they are wrong. I am very pleased to support the legislation.",57
129,Mr CREAN,NOES,"Hotham) (5.15 pm)Australia faces a skills crisis because of a failure of government policy. The problem is that the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 takes away the life support system that underpinned the development of effective vocational education and training policies in this country and in its place applies a couple of bandaids. This is not a crisis that has come upon us recently. It is one that the government has been long warned of and their failure to act means we have failed our youth in this country, we have failed our businesses in this country and most of all we have seen this failure lead to an underperformance by us as a nation. This, of course, is just one more example of policy failure by this government, which has even acknowledged on certain occasions that it inherited a robust, dynamic and sustainable growth economy. It has allowed itself through complacency to see us underperforming as a nation. It is complacency that has seen a record current account deficit, record foreign debt and the combination of things putting upward pressure on interest rates. What we have is not just the trade crisis that I referred to but now this skills crisis and an infrastructure crisis-all because of the failure of government policy. I speak in support of the amendments moved by the shadow minister. There are a number of points I want to make in relation to this area. Firstly, skilling a nation does not just empower individuals; it is an essential driver of economic growth. Secondly, equipping a nation with the necessary skills to meet the demands of a modern dynamic economy does require a comprehensive inteI grated approach throughout the education and training sectors and it needs that across all levels of government, working together but connected to the needs of industry. Thirdly, Australia's skills crisis has not come out of the blue. The government has known for a number of years that skills shortages were emerging but it has failed to respond and we are now paying the price: lost opportunity for the individual and lost opportunity for the nation. The fourth point I want to go to is that government's response to this crisis is short sighted. In my view it is doomed to fail. It refuses to recognise the extent of the problem, which was only responded to in a halfbaked way because of panic in the lead-up to the last election that they needed to look as though they were doing something in the policy response area. As for the comprehensive policy approach that is needed, we all know that we are confronted with a rapidly changing global environment. If Australia is to continue to grow and prosper and to be able to sustain that ability we must change as well. The empowerment of individuals must be developed through a policy framework of lifelong education and training initiatives. The driver of sustained economic growth is how well we manage that dimension of the strategy. Labor have always understood this and when last in government we did make a significant contribution to developing the skills of the country. Under us, we saw school funding increase by 55 per cent in real terms. It was a huge commitment by the then Labor government. We also saw TAFE and other vocational sector funding increase by 56 per cent in real terms, as well as the huge expansion in universities. There was an increase in funding of 60 per cent and an almost 80 per cent increase in the number of university places. None of this came about overnight. We had to plan for it, we had to prepare for it and we had to budget for it. In contrast-and it is a pity that the member for O'Connor has left; he was telling us how much the government had done-in its first two budgets, and off the back of the jectory that Labor had put in place, this government slashed $240 million from the vocational education and training sector. That is what the Howard government did in the first two budgets, 1996 and 1997. Following that, the we had the 1998 to 2000 ANTA agreement which abolished growth funding altogether and froze the funding to the vocational education and training sector for the following three years. How can you expand as a nation, how can you increase the opportunities, if you are not only cutting real growth but also freezing the funding? When Labor were in office we established ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. We did that in 1992 to coordinate and drive a national agenda with the states. We did that through cooperation but with an agenda for vocational education. We had a commitment to provide growth funding to the sector on the basis that the states agreed to maintain their funding commitment. We had the leverage to ensure that that funding occurred. In addition to the establishment of ANTA, in 1994, through the Working Nation program, we focused particularly on reengaging the long-term unemployed and on lifting the skills level of the nationparticularly the skills of our young people. We used that program as a means to empower not just individuals but regions. Through the structure of area consultative committees, regions were given the opportunity to identify the skill needs of their areas and have the Working Nation programs and the ANTA funding respond positively to those needs. The Labor government established Netforce, an expert committee comprising eminent business, union and community leaders who understood what industry wanted and needed to address their skill requirements. traThis was an enabling, empowering, grassroots up or community based approach. If I can put it this way: the national programs were actually responding to what regions, local communities and businesses were asking for. The task of Netforce was to expand on accredited training in the non-traditional trade areas. It did not replace the apprenticeship system; it complemented it. The reason was simple: the non-trades area was the fastest growing area of job demand. Labor also introduced the training wage and we developed labour market policies which targeted subsidies, core management and skills accreditation to what individuals, industry and the nation needed. These initiatives were hugely successful. To give some indication, when Labor gained office in 1983 there were fewer than 35,000 structured training places. By 1996 Labor had almost trebled them: 60,000 apprenticeships and 36,500 traineeships. What did this government do as soon as it got into office? It abolished Netforce immediately, and now it is abolishing ANTA. This is not a government that builds skills; it is a government that deskills. That is why the skills crisis that we are facing is of the government's making. It could have been avoided. Again, I go back to the success of the programs that we put in place. In 1995, as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, I released Australia's Workforce 2005: Jobs for the Future. That report identified the skill needs of our nation 10 years out. It was a road map for our skills needs. It identified the changing nature of our labour force, demographic changes, immigration factors, and industry and occupational needs. That is what Labor did in office. When we were in opposition we actually called upon the government to join us in a bipartisan approach and repeat the exercise-to update it and take it another five years out. In 1999 we called on the government to produce the updated report. As I was preparing for this speech I was reminded of Greg Wilton. Today is the anniversary of his death five years ago. He was one of those people who understood the significance of this issue and identified with it, and he pushed us to update the program. We called on the government to do it but they refused. In my view, this reflected their short-sighted and narrow nature. They refused to recognise the nature of the problem then-and so what did the Labor Party do? We produced it from opposition. We produced the next stage report, Workforce 2010. It again correctly identified what is apparent now: that the strongest areas of new jobs growth over the next decade will be in a number of key growth areas, particularly in retail trade but also in human services, health, education, welfare, property and business services. Since 1998 the Howard government has turned away 270,000 people from TAFE and created an $833 million skills deficit by lagging behind the states and territories in investment in vocational education and training. The 2004 skills shortage list includes 42 professions and trades-including those identified by Labor in Workforce 2010-such as nurses, and childand aged-care workers. The Australian Industry Group has estimated that 175,000 people will leave trades over the next five years, with only 70,000 entering trades. Skills growth, as a driver of productivity, has dropped 75 per cent over 10 years and vacancies for skilled tradespeople have increased by a massive 68 per cent since June 1997-that is according to the skilled vacancies index. All of these shortages were, therefore, foreseeable. A government that was planning for the future of the nation should have been better able to anticipate them, prepare for them and put in place the policies that would have avoided the problem that we are now facing. The Howard government promised, on its election in 1996, to boost the numbers of apprenticeships. That is what it promised because it was arguing then that we had a problem. Of course, it was ignoring the initiatives that Labor had put in place. What was its solution at the time? Its solution was to roll traineeships and apprenticeships together and call them ‘new apprenticeships'essentially, to argue that they were getting the numbers up. But despite that fudge it has still fallen well short of the nation's needs. doing that the government has failed young people, business and the service providers. It has failed the nation. Most of the growth in apprenticeships under this government has been in the areas where there are no skill shortages, and the number of people commencing a traditional trade apprenticeship between 2000 and 2003 has actually dropped. During a period of sustained economic growth we saw a drop of that dimension. A staggering 40 per cent of people who start ‘new apprenticeships'their term-do not complete them. They do not complete their training, at a time when we have severe skills shortages and a desperate need for more skilled workers. You have to do more than simply change the name; you have to have a strategy and you have to put in place the structures that will deliver on that strategy. When confronted with this skills crisis before the last election, the government announced a couple of initiatives. The big ticket items to tackle the skills crisis emerged essentially in panic from the government. At no stage in the lead-up to the last election did the government say it intended to abolish ANTA, which I have talked of earlier. Its policy announcement was that it would establish 26 technical colleges and, in the process, cut across Australia's already well established TAFE and vocational education and training schemes. The problem with the initiative is that it will not be fully in place until 2008 and the first apprentices will not be fully trained until 2010. We are supposed to be dealing with a skills crisis now, but the government's policy initiatives do not even begin to deliver until five years down the track. And even when they are finally in place the technical colleges will graduate only around 3,600 students each year when the AiG, amongst others, is estimating a skills shortage of 100,000 workers over the In next five years. It is a totally inadequate response. Tacked onto the technical colleges announcement in the election campaign was an announcement to give new apprentices a tool kit. At a time when the country is calling out for real solutions, the government scraps one of the success models of the country, sets up a duplicate system and offers a tool kit. This country needs a far better set of solutions than that, and so we went to the last election promising to build upon the Labor legacy that I have talked of before. We had an approach in the lead-up to the last election that would have seen a billion dollar strategy to boost Australian skill levels and address the skills shortage: 36½ thousand new vocational education and training places each year, a commitment to pay TAFE fees for secondary students to encourage more young people to get a VET qualification while at school, 6½ thousand skill-up apprenticeships through group training organisations in regions of skills shortage, more funding for group training organisations, more opportunities for mature age Australians and an extended youth allowance to new apprenticeships. This approach built on Labor's $27 million Bright Futures program to help schools raise awareness of post-secondary study options, including the benefits of a career in the traditional trades. So we had a real response to the skills crisis. We have since that time also announced the $2,000 trade completion bonus to encourage Australians to complete training in skills which are in demand. We have also proposed the creation of 4,000 extra trade training places in our schools each year. What we are really saying here is that instead of the Howard government importing an extra 178,000 skilled migrants, which has been its effective training policy since 1997-but turning away 270,000 Australians from TAFEs since 1998-it must begin to embrace the sorts of comprehensive policies that Labor announced and went to the last election on and implement them in a way that will see a massive expansion in VET effectiveness and skill formation in this country. Despite all the evidence-despite the acute skill shortages, despite the negative impact that it is having on our export performance and despite the increased costs it is imposing on all Australians-the government pays little more than lip service to responding to the country's needs. Instead of building skills through a comprehensive package involving all levels of government, industry and education sectors, it is tearing down the very structures that worked so well. Despite promising prior consultation before determining the new national funding arrangements, the Commonwealth did not consult with state governments over the content of these bills. This is not the way to run skills development, a set of training and education policies for a nation which has continued to grow off the back of the policies put in place by us and will sustain us into the future but which will not sustain us if we are running down the very mechanisms by which we can drive productivity, get skills formation and enhance our productive capacity. You cannot do it on your own. You have to do it in cooperation with the states. This bill does not do it, and it is the failure of icy that will continue to undersell us as a nation.

130,Mrs VALE,NOES,"I am pleased to welcome this legislation, Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the accompanying Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. These bills demonstrate the Howard government's continued commitment to vocational education and training and provide for clear national goals and objectives. The legislation also sets out the funding and the groundwork for planning and accountability responsibilities. Australia's sound economic management over the last decade has resulted in sustained growth and has ensured low interest rates. It has overseen the reduction of national debt and a fall in unemployment from 8.7 per cent in 1995 to 5.1 per cent today; the lowest since November 1976. In my electorate of Hughes, the unemployment rate is currently estimated at 2.6 per cent, one of the lowest in Australia. In the past our vocational education and training system has made an enormous contribution to this economic success. However, Australian business and industry need more highly skilled, productive workers to compete even more successfully in the current global market and especially in the global market of the future. The purpose of this legislation is to implement the government's new national training arrangements for the period July 2005-December 2008, following the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and the transfer of its functions and responsibilities to the Department of Education, Science and Training. Twelve years ago, before the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority, Australia had eight separate training systems in the states and territories operating quite independently of each other. Employers operating across more than one state could polnot be confident that the quality of their employees' qualifications was consistent nor that they would have the competencies required by industry. Today, the foundations of a truly national industry-led system are in place, with training covering most industries and most of the work force. Nationally recognised qualifications are offered by more than 4,000 registered training organisations-all of which are registered in accordance with a national set of standards. Further, there has been enormous growth in the options within our vocational education and training system. Each year, the publicly funded training system educates more than 1.7 million Australians-an increase of half a million people since 1995. The system has grown in sophistication and prestige, and it is now recognised as a world leader. It is not surprising, therefore, that vocational cation and training is increasingly a first choice for many of the 70 per cent of young Australians who do not go directly from school to university. The progress to date can be seen as a measure of the success of the Australian National Training Authority. However, in meeting the challenges that now confront Australia's economy and its education and training system, more appropriate governance, accountability and operational arrangements are required. Australia's economic growth over the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the demand for skilled workers, and Australian businesses report that their greatest challenge is finding people to take up skilled jobs. Australia's vocational and technical education system is well equipped to respond to the challenge, but we need to keep focused on training for current and future skill needs and on reinvigorating the leadership role of business and industry. From 1 July 2005, the responsibilities and functions of the Australian National Training Authority will be transferred to the Department of Education, Science and Training and a new ministerial council on vocational education will be formed to lead the new national training system. This will provide a structure to build on the successes to date and to ensure that the national training system continues to improve-providing the skilled people required by industry to maintain Australia's strong economic growth. This government's goal is to ensure that in the future Australia's training system will be even more responsive to the ever changing needs of industry. The training system will continue to build its reputation, with young Australians broadening their options and opportunities after school. It will also attract mature age Australians back to study and provide them with specialised skills and edupathways to new rewarding careers. To accomplish this goal, the new national training system demands a cooperative and collaborative approach between the Australian government, states, territories, business and industry to deliver nationally recognised qualifications of a consistently high quality. A key feature of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 will be the strengthening of the funding framework, which will link funding for the states and territories to a range of conditions and targets for training outcomes. These will move forward the government's reform agenda and drive quality improvement and increased flexibility in the vocational education and training sector. This government's strong commitment to vocational and technical education is illustrated by the significant funding of $4.4 billion provided through this bill and a further $1.4 billion over four years announced last year for an integrated and comprehensive suite of policies to reinforce national building skill needs. This lifts the Australian government's contribution to vocational and technical education to a record $10.1 billion over the next four years. This funding offer includes an additional $176 million compared to 2004, which the states and territories are required to match. Also as part of Howard government's Welfare to Work package, the budget contained an additional $42.8 million to fund a further 12,800 vocational and technical education places for those who are receiving welfare support to help them participate in the work force. This represents an average real annual increase of 4.1 per cent compared to 2004. These initiatives represent one of the most significant boosts to vocational and technical education ever undertaken by any Australian government. In order to receive financial assistance, states and territories will be quired to meet a number of statutory conditions to receive their share of the Australian government's funding. These include maximising choice for employers and new apprentices to enable them to select the most suitable training provider for their needs; implementing workplace reform in state owned TAFEs, including the introduction of more flexible employment arrangements such as Australian workplace agreements and performance pay so that they are more responsive to local employer and industry needs; removing impediments in state awards and legislation so that training qualifications are automatically based on competence rather than length of time; increasing the utilisation of fully publicly funded trainnew ing infrastructure by providing third-party access to that infrastructure on a commercial basis; and ensuring that payments received under the act are not used for providing vocational education and training to overseas students nor for private recreational pursuits or hobbies. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 are the result of consultations that were undertaken with all key stakeholders between 21 February and 23 March. Strong support was received for the key directions the proposed by the government, particularly for making the training sector more responsive and flexible. These bills give effect to this priority. The states and territories received the funding offer on 30 March and work is under way to develop the multilateral agreement. This process provides considerable opportunity for scrutiny. Linked with the main bill is the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 and the Vocare- tional Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This will effect the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and the current funding arrangements for Commonwealth grants to the states and territories for vocational education and training. This bill also provides for the transitional arrangements for the transfer of functions and responsibilities from the Australian National Training Authority to the Department of Education, Science and Training. It has been estimated that savings of $3.096 million can be made through the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority, primarily through the elimination of duplication in management and corporate services. These bills will ensure a smooth transition to the national training arrangements and will confirm this government's continuing commitment to vocational and technical education. This is for the advancement of the youth of Australia and for the skilling of our industry. In conclusion, these bills will strengthen Australia's economic base through providing a highly skilled work force which will meet the future needs of Australian businesses, industries, communities and individuals. These bills will also promote a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training through collaboration and cooperation between the federal government, the states, the territories and industry. These bills support a national training system that responsive to the needs of industry and employers and in which industry and employers drive the priorities and the policies. Today, with these bills, this government has delivered on those priorities. I commend both these bills to the House.",65
131,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NOES,"This evening I would like to speak briefly on the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 in my capacity as shadow minister for industry, infrastructure and industrial lations and to concentrate, in some respects, on the industry and industrial relations aspects of these bills. Firstly, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaga. I make the point that, when we look at Australia's economy, we see two things which have been the subject of criticism and which the government has effectively ignored. They are the two factors which the Reserve Bank of Australia drew attention to when it increased interest rates by 0.25 basis points in March. The first is pressure on wages and, as a consequence, inflation and interest rates as a result of a skills crisis. The second is capacity constraints as a result of neglect of infrastructure. So the Reserve Bank in March drew attention to pressure on wages and pressure on inflation as a result of a skills crisis. These bills go to the heart of the government's neglect of skilling Australia's work force during its period in office. We know, for example, that the government cut funding for TAFE during its first two budgets and failed to provide any growth funding in six of the last nine years. That short-sighted funding approach has sown the seed for today's skills difficulty-not that the government has acknowledged or is acknowledging is that in any way. We have seen reference to difficulties in skills from anyone from the OECD to the Reserve Bank, the Minerals Council of Australia, Engineers Australia, the BCA and the Australian Industry Group-a litany of commentary that this is one area where the government has very seriously dropped the ball. So far as industrial relations aspects of these pieces of legislation are concerned, what the government does, courtesy of these two bills, is effectively tie funding to a raft of statutory conditions that impose restrictions re- on how the vocational education and training system will operate. The Commonwealth is effectively telling the states and territories, ‘If you want funding, you have to agree to all of the conditions over all of the funding.' There are two conditions which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has drawn attention to. The first is forcing the states and requiring the states to implement Australian workplace agreements through TAFE colleges. The second is the quantum of funding. Both those aspects will be the subject of detailed committee stage amendments to be moved by the member for Jagajaga. The one that relates to Australian workplace agreements is the first of those amendments: Clause 12, page 11 (lines 22-27), omit paragraph 1(b). It is in the legislation that we find the stringent requirement placed on states and territories to comply with the government's approach to industrial relations. We have seen, since the government announced the outline or the framework of its industrial relations package, that this is based on an extreme view, a harsh view and a divisive view of Australian society. Particularly in this context, we often get a lot from the government about flexibility and choice. I have gone through the materials in respect of these two pieces of legislation, I cannot quite see the choice in there. Here we have the Commonwealth saying to the states and the territories: ‘What we want to do is force you to take up our approach to industrial relations; otherwise we will not discharge any Commonwealth responsibility with regard to the funding of your TAFE systems at all.' As I say, the detailed commitployees tee stage amendment circulated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in respect of proposed section 12 shows that harsh, divisive and ideological approach by the government. The choice which TAFE colleges are deprived of is that it will no longer to TAFE colleges, as mature employers, to determine for themselves if they wish to offer Australian workplace agreements, if they wish to offer common-law contracts, if they wish to engage in enterprise bargaining or if they wish to engage in union or non-union collective bargaining. So it is an attempt by the Commonwealth to impose upon states and territories an ideological industrial relaagreements tions agenda tied to its own purse strings. It is not as if you would regard Australian workplace agreements as being a fantastic or sensational success, and perhaps that analysis is one of the reasons why the government is going down the road of compulsion. Australian workplace agreements were introduced in the government's legislation in 1996, so they have effectively been in operation for a nine-year period. Over that period of time we find, in accordance with the latest ABS statistics, that AWAs have been taken up by about 421,000 individual Australian employees. In terms of coverage, that is about 2.4 per cent. Such has been the success of the government's initiative in this area that, after nine years, 2.4 per cent of Austratistics, lian workplaces have taken up individual contracts. That compares with about 20 per cent of employees on awards, about 38 per cent on certified agreements, just over 31 per and cent on common-law contracts and just under three per cent on unregistered collective agreements or non-union agreements. So AWAs have the smallest component of coverage so far as the workplace is concerned. Again, when you look at the most recent ABS statistics, if you take the top line figures you could be forgiven for believing that emon AWAs do okay. But if you take out managerial positions and leave a direct comparison between award entitlements and conditions and certified agreements under enterprise bargains, or even unregistered collective agreements, you will find that when be up you compare non-managerial staff there is the following break-up of the statistics: employees on AWAs work six per cent more hours, non-managerial workers on AWAs earn two per cent less than those on registered collective agreements, women on AWAs have hourly earnings 11 per cent less than women on registered collective agreements, women on registered collective receive 90 per cent of the hourly pay of men on those agreements and women on AWAs receive 80 per cent of the salary or hourly pay of men on AWAs. So far as casual or part-time workers are concerned, casual workers who are on AWAs are paid 15 per cent less than casual workers on registered collective agreements, and part-time workers on AWAs are paid 25 per cent less than part-time workers on registered collective agreements. Over the period 2002-04, average weekly earnings for employees on AWAs in this category went backwards by $110 or 11 per cent. Over that same period, average weekly wages for workers on collective agreements went up by 6.2 per cent, or $46. So, when you get below the headline stathe analysis is quite compelling. When you compare like with like-AWAs as against registered collective agreementsemployees on AWAs work six per cent more hours and earn two per cent less. Women are particularly badly done by. Their hourly earnings are 11 per cent less on AWAs than on registered collective agreements. Women receive 90 per cent of the hourly pay of men on collective agreements but on AWAs they receive 80 per cent of the hourly pay of men. Casual workers earn 15 per cent less on AWAs than if they were on registered collective agreements and part-time workers earn 25 per cent less than if they were on registered collective agreements. That statistical analysis courtesy of the ABS is damning. Why would the government proceed on the basis that this is a terrific thing to do far as vocational educational training policy is concerned? Those figures are reflected in what has occurred in my own state of Western Australia, where you essentially have, courtesy of the Court-Kierath industrial relations changes in the nineties, a similar regime of forcing workers onto individual contracts underpinned by a comparable minimal legislative minimum. Under the CourtKierath regime, employees in Western Australia suffered significant injustices so far their salary and conditions were concerned. Fifty-six per cent of all WA workplace agreements were below the award rate of pay. That figure was higher for juniors and casuals. Sixty-seven per cent of Western Australian workplace agreements did not have overtime rates. Introduction of workplace agreements in Western Australia in the state public sector resulted in pay disparity anywhere up to 30 per cent between like employees. When you join that Western Australian analysis with the ABS analysis, there is only one possible explanation for the government going down this road-that is, in advance of an ideological fervour. We know the Prime Minister has been waiting 30 years to have a go in this area and from 1 July, when he has all power under the sun, he is making it quite clear that he is ing to have a go. Having got the Senate out of the way, he wants to get the Industrial Relations Commission out of the way, and he wants to get the states out of the way, so far as the state industrial system is concerned. He wants to compel the states to go down a road that they would not necessarily choose or that TAFE colleges would not necessarily choose as individual employers. You can mount a respectable argument that the government forcing employers to offer AWAs contravenes the objects of its own Workplace Relations Act. A principal object of the act is: so ... ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level. That is the government's own statute and, allegedly, its own principle of public policy, but in this legislation, for the sake of compulsion to pursue an extreme ideological approach, it walks away from that. As I have said, a very respectable question as remains to be asked. This government, on an ongoing, daily basis in this place, mantrachants that it is in favour of choice. Yet in this package of legislation we find people being deprived of choice, the states and territories being deprived of choice and individual employers in the guise of TAFE being deprived of choice. Looking at the analysis of the imposition of workplace agreements in of Western Australia and the ABS analysis of entitlements, conditions and salaries of people on AWAs compared with collective agreements, you see that there is only one possible explanation: a government that regards itself as having all power under the sun. Having flown too close to the sun, it has been touched by it and thinks it can do whatever it likes. This will come back to bite the government. The more the community start go- to hear about its extreme ideological approach in these areas, the less they will like and the more conscious they will become of the imposition and the downward pressure it will place on the living standards of Australian working families. We find that the government, having been sprung by the Reserve Bank for having neglected this area-that neglect being half the reason for the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates in March, with the other half being the government's neglect of infrastructure-is not worried about trying to rectify or remedy the skills crisis in this country but instead is using its capacity to effectively blackmail the states and territories as a backdoor means of imposing upon them and our national TAFE system individual employment contracts. We know from the general industrial relations changes that the government proposes that individual workplace agreements will be subject to a much lower no disadvantage test and will be subject to a smaller number of allowable matters. In the end this will have one outcome only-a reduction in the living standards of Australian employees.",68
132,Mr BALDWIN,NOES,"I rise today to speak on the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. The Australian National Training Authority was established in 1992 to coordinate levels of government in establishing a national vocational education and training system. By all measures, it did a good job. On 22 October 2004, the Prime Minister announced the abolition of ANTA and the transfer of ANTA's functions to the Department of Education, Science and Training from July 2005. That is the reason we are debating these bills today. We might ask ourselves: why the need for change? Since 1992, there has been a lot of change. There has been a lot of change in it industry and in the technology used in industry, there have been changes in skill requirements and there have been changes in the demographics. We need a more flexible training regime that is able to respond quickly to industry's needs. As much as it hurts me to say this, it is not government that creates jobs; the actual employers create jobs-something that Labor has never been able to understand. We can create the framework and a secure financial environment so that people feel confident to invest in, expand and grow their work force, but we need employers to create jobs and to take people on. In this country we have seen the economy and the demand for Australian product grow, but our skills training has not kept up with the demand. In my area, the electorate of Paterson, Forgac shipbuilding secured some very good contracts. Because of the time frame of those contracts, after experiencing an inability to attract locally skilled boilermakers, it was necessary to resort to importing people from overseas to fill that gap. I am the parent of young boys, one of whom is looking to go into an apprenticeship-and he is doing so gladly. He will be one of the 70 per cent of young people who, upon leaving school, do not go on to university. Mr Deputy Speaker, having a trade background is something to be very proud of. I am a skilled fitter/toolmaker; that is my base trade. I left school when I was 15, after year 10, and I have enjoyed my trade immensely. Not everyone can go to university, nor can they access a trade. In my electorate of Paterson in 1996, there were around 750 people involved in trade training; I am glad to say that today we have 2,480. That is an increase of 231 per cent. By any measure, that is spectacular growth. But that is not enough to address the needs of industry. If industry cannot satisfy its skill requirements, then it is obvious that either those opportunities will go to migrants coming to Australia and bringing those skill sets or-I hate to admit it- industries will go offshore and do the work there, where they can get people with the skills to do it. We need to maintain the focus. Who is the focus here? Is it the likes of the trade union movement? Is it the likes of the politicians who make the decisions? No. The focus here is the young people that we want to provide the skills training to, to get them into jobs where they can utilise those skills they have been trained in and earn good money for doing so. Our focus also has to be the industry that has the demand for those skills and creates the jobs in the community. When I listen to the Labor Party, I keep hearing the same old mantra-chant: ‘But this is the way we have always done it.' As I have said, times have changed since 1992. Today, in 2005, the training dynamics are totally different. One of the other issues that affects our people who go into trade or skills development is the issue of borders. To give you a classic example, someone as simple as a hairdresser, with those skill sets, cannot in Victoria without sitting local exams if hold training qualifications from New South Wales. Quite a number of trades are affected in this way. People may say: ‘You're located in the middle of New South Wales. How does that affect you?' Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, like you I have a military base in my electorate. We have a high level of transitional people coming and going on postings. At times their partners are vocationally trained with skills in areas such as hairdresstourism ing. If they have been trained in Victoria, in order for them to be able to work in my area around Williamtown or Newcastle they need to submit to more exams. The idea of borders should be between one nation and another. At a time when we are looking at free trade agreements, it is crazy that the borders between our states mean that people cannot move their job skills from one state to another. We need portability. This affects trades more than it affects the professionals-the doctors, the lawyers and the like. We need to see that addressed. The other thing that we will see through this legislation is an investment in the youth of this nation. We will see an investment of approximately $4.4 billion as our government's contribution to the states and territories for vocational and technical education from July 2005 to December 2008. This is on top of the $577 million already paid to the states and territories for the first six months of 2005. That will take the total funding for the quadrennium to $4.9 billion. Also included in that is an additional $175 million in funding compared to 2004, which represents a real annual increase of 3.2 per cent in that year. I have said that there is a skills crisis in this country. It is good to see that that has occurred, because it has meant that businesses and opportunities have grown in this nation along with opportunities for young work people. The main areas where there are they shortages in my electorate, which are addressed by the introduction of the new technical skills colleges program this government is embarking on, are the areas of hairdressing; metal trades, particularly fitting; boilermaking, as I have stated before; engineering; electrical engineering; and hospitality. We have a huge amount of employment in tourism in our area-in fact, 7.1 per cent of the work force in Paterson is engaged in the and hospitality industry. We have a shortage of chefs, which needs to be addressed. You cannot train those people in five minutes-there is a long time frame-but you have to provide them with the opportunity to get training. That training needs to be flexible. It needs to work in with the employer, the employee and the training provider. Having a flexible arrangement means that we can achieve a little more and get more people into the work force. I also note that one of the big issues in discussions with one of the leading electrical contract development groups in my area, Ampcontrol, is the fact that training providers these days find it very hard to afford the latest technology that our young people, and not so young people, need to be trained on. What is the point of having a machine that may be worth half-a-million or $1 million in a TAFE environment when it could actually be in the workplace? Training providers can access that sort of machinery or technology-the latest state-of-the-art technologyto develop and enhance the skills of the people they are training so that they can carry those skills sets forward. I also have a couple of outstanding training companies in my area: the Hunter Valley Training Company and the Hunter Valley group apprenticeship scheme. These are highly recommended people. The apprentices and the trainees that they turn out of these facilities are world-class trade skills holders, and in fact win many of the awards with their skills sets. As I said earlier, we have had a lot of cussion with industry. We need to work hand in hand with industry to develop the opportunities. We must address the needs that are being raised by industry and the needs of our young people to be able to access the training. If the Labor opposition were serious about this, as we are, they would be committed to developing a skilled nation. We need to move with the times, we need to move with technology, we need to move with what industry wants and, in particular, we need to move with the requirements of our young people, who are searching out the opportunities to develop their skills and to apply them to industry so that they can set themselves up for the future. As I said when I started this speech, this is not about politics and this is not about governments; this is about young people pursuing opportunities through the development of their skills and it is about industry, the very people who employ apprentices and trainees in their industries to develop those skills. I say to the opposition: ‘Let's work together, let's develop a skilled nation and let's embrace the change that is required in today's times.'",71
133,Ms BIRD,NOES,"I assure the member for Paterson that, while I agreed with a great deal of the general commentary in his speech that was about supporting efforts to get young people into the skilled work force, I entirely disagree with his statement that this has nothing to do with politics or government. I think these bills have everything to do with politics and government. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 seek to make what are in effect the most sweeping changes to the vocational education sector in over a decade. The Skilldising Australia's Workforce Bill establishes a whole new system for Commonwealth funding of vocational education and training. It will be tied to statutory conditions including provision of AWAs and increased flexibility and competition for TAFE. The Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Arrangements) Bill repeals both the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 and addresses the transitional arrangements that arise from ANTA's abolition. The changes that flow from these two bills will significantly alter the face of vocational training in this country. In his second reading speech the minister outlined his government's reasons for such a wholesale restructuring of the federal government's funding arrangements for this sector. The minister claimed that these changes will provide ‘the nation-building skilled people required by industry and business in the short term and beyond'. The minister's argument rests on the claim that nationally we have reached a point where further improvements to the sector and its ability to address the national skills shortages being experienced in some of our traditional trade sectors cannot be addressed because of the ‘union sponsored failure of policies of the state and territory governments standing in the way of progress'. I suggest to the House that this statement by the minister is the key giveaway to the real agenda of these bills. It is why I made the comment to the member for Paterson that I believe these bills are all about politics and government and have little to do with solving the problem. For many years, Labor has been warning of the impact of this government's underfunding of the public TAFE sector and its refusal to seriously address the skills shortof ages that would develop as a result of the failure to more extensively support trade prenticeships. Not surprisingly, now that dustry is also identifying the problem, the government is responding. These bills, and the minister's varied comments on the skills issue, reflect this government's commitment to driving the training agenda to respond almost solely to the demands of industry. I remind the government that these are the very same industry players who have shirked their own responsibilities to forward plan by not continuing their own programs of apprenticeship employment and training. Given their short-sightedness in looking after their own long-term work force needs, it is not surprising that many of us are particularly sceptical about handing over the long-term planning for vocational and technical training completely to their agenda. It is, of course, critically important that industry has input into the national training agendaindeed, it has done so for a very long time. Having worked for many years in the New South Wales TAFE system, I am acutely aware of the efforts that local TAFE management make in order to get feedback from local industry and to plan to meet its future needs. The reality, however, is that industry's immediate needs and the long-term nation building needs are not always one and the same. Industry, when not experiencing shortages of skilled labour, did little or nothing to invest in their future work force needs. In areas such as mine, hundreds of young people would leave school in the seventies and eighties to take up trade apprenticeships in the steel and mining industries. Then, during the period of the late eighties and nineties, when those industries restructured and decreased their work forces, one of the first roles they walked away from was providing training for the next generation of skilled tradespeople. We are now seeing the results those decisions. When young people discovered that these options were not available ap- to them as a career, not surprisingly, they in- looked to other sectors and industries for employment. The dilemma that this has caused is now acute in many industries. The reality is that many of these employers, even if they wanted to employ more apprentices, are caught in the bind that their existing tradespeople are so fully employed now doing their job, doing overtime and additional shifts to provide the required number of tradespeople for a shift, that they do not have the time to supervise the training of apprentices. I am outlining this history to indicate why I am sceptical about giving too much power to industry in driving the national agenda on such important issues. To be frank, they do not have a particularly good historical record in planning for such long-term matters. The other point I make, in a similar vein, is that for decades Australia has enjoyed an enviable world reputation in trade training. Young people with a trade would be snapped up in other countries because of the Australian trade training and its reputation. This was because we offered training that provided both depth and breadth in creating tradespeople. Our tradespeople actually knew their trades. In many countries trade training had become so specialised that people could only do one segment of the job and were unable to effectively troubleshoot and problem solve across a variety of tasks. Australian tradespeople were trained so broadly in their field that they could undertake such tasks and were highly valued in the international market. My serious concern is that the direction the government is taking in these two bills, and particularly in the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005, will put the final nail in the coffin of our world-class trade training system and, in another 10 years, we will be trying to fix the problem that our new generation of tradespeople are so narrowly trained that they have become insufficient for the needs of industry and unable to move between industries. The other point I make on this issue is the people who undertake trade training should also be seen as equal partners in the national debate on trade training. The people who train in trades want to know that the training they receive is not only of high qualtheir ity but also portable so that they have the ability to move not just between states-as the minister constantly comments on-but also between employers and industries. The member for Paterson talked about the issue of technology in particular workplaces, how complex it has become and how people need to be trained on the machinery for the particular work force. The danger, the other side, of that is that they become so specifically trained that they do not have portable skills. One of the best ways to ensure their ability to transfer their skills between industry and employers is to respect the views of the profession on what constitutes quality training. The government is ignoring the fact that an important part of the role of the trades based unions has been, for over 100 years, to provide the perspective of the trade professionals on the viability of their vocation and the best methods of providing relevant training to ensure this outcome. For six years I worked at Wollongong TAFE and for several of those I was the elected union representative for the college. This brought me into regular contact with my colleagues in trade based schools. I developed a great appreciation for their dedication to their vocation and their pride in their technical expertise and the quality of their work, both in the trade they practised and in the standard of training they provided to their students. It is a cultural aspect of the trades that people take pride in their skills and in their ability to pass those skills on to the next generation, whether this takes place in formal training institutions or in the workplace. These students went out and worked in in that dustries-small, medium and large-in their local communities. They were seen to reflect on the reputation of their trainer and of TAFE. The perspective of trades teachers and workplace tradespeople, including through representative bodies such as trade unions, provides an important focus for the development of national training policies and programs. The government likes to present the trade union movement as selfishly interested only in protecting the interests of its members-a perfectly legitimate role, I would have thought. The government, however, equates this as being, without exception and on all occasions, contrary to the national interest. This is simply not so. While I have expressed reservations about the total reliance on the ability of business to be the sole driver of vocational and trade training, it is equally true that we should not rely solely on trade unions and trade trainer bodies. I have, however, argued that industry is a major consumer of the training product and has the right to be involved. Equally this applies to trade unions, trade trainers and the trainees themselves. However, these bills and all the comments of the minister deny that there is any value in the input of these individuals and organisations. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 makes no effort to hide its real agenda, which is not an educational one but an industrial relations one. It is another example of the federal government using its funding powers to drive its industrial changes. The government's priority is to dismantle balances in the industrial relations system that have ensured that workers have been able to secure fair recompense and reasonable working environments. The federal government now attaches industrial requirements to infrastructure funding and educational funding to states as a regular attachment. It is more concerned with seeing its industrial relations agenda being put in place than it is with ing the success of the particular program. Clearly it seeks to lay blame for the signifiamendment cant infrastructure and skills challenges ing this nation on states and unions. In his second reading speech the minister was quite clear that the purpose of this bill was to force changes to the nature of employment of TAFE teachers and to the nature of employment under state awards that regulate trade training. The only example the minister puts forward-and I notice other speakers have repeated this-for justifying such a radical shake-up of a worldrecognised, quality TAFE system that is copied in other parts of the world is that some tradespeople, such as hairdressers, cannot cross state borders and work in their trade. I have to admit that I am pretty sceptical about the extent of this problem, as I personally know many tradespeople, such as riggers, fitters, joiners and carpenters, who regularly work across state boundaries with no hindrance at all. In fact many companies in my area and in others that I have visited have complained about poaching by companies in other states. So it is obviously not a major hindrance to them. However, if there are particular areas where there are problems, there is no reason that they cannot be resolved through negotiation and discussion, as we saw come out of the recent COAG meeting. It is quite obvious that the purpose of these bills is to extend into the TAFE system the ideological changes that the government has been pursuing in the university sector. One of the great challenges facing our university sector has been the government's program of pushing universities to have greater reliance on entrepreneurial and commercial funding and then undercutting the value of this by decreasing government funding. The original version of this bill included in proposed section 12 a statement that TAFE would be required to develop commercial seebusiness plans that would enable government funding to be reduced. Labor proposed an to this bill to remove these facwords. We have no problem with the principle of TAFEs undertaking entrepreneurial and commercial activity-indeed, they have done so for at least the last 15 years that I know of-but we vigorously object to the reduction in public funding being a result of that activity. It is therefore most interesting that the minister, on 24 May, issued his own amendment withdrawing that particular requirement. It is also interesting to note that when the minister delivered his second reading speech to this House on 11 May he made no reference to, nor gave any explanation of, this section of the bill. There was no justification of its role or purpose in achieving the claimed objectives of the bill. One can only conclude that it was a rather cynical attempt to slip this component of the changes through and that when it was highlighted by Labor the minister felt the potential backlash made it unsustainable. It is important to increase funding to the TAFE system to improve access for potential trade apprentices to the high-quality training TAFE provides. However, TAFE colleges provide far more than trade training. I have often talked about the critical role that TAFE fulfils in providing second-chance educational opportunities for many people in our communities-young people who have dropped out of school and then realise the importance of higher qualifications, women who have been out of the work force for extended periods of time and mature age workers who have been restructured out of their employment. Most of these people ease themselves back into the classroom through a range of courses offered by TAFE that are not focused on a specific vocation. Often on completing this training they have developed a clear idea of what new employment area they are interested in and have greater dence in their ability to undertake such ing. This is a critical role provided by our public TAFEs that would not be supported by funding focused solely through commercial or entrepreneurial activity. It is an that would be under threat with diminishing government funding and a sector driven solely by industry priorities. I am, consequently, pleased that the minister has decided to amend the bill to remove this statement, but I remain suspicious that it reflected an agenda that has not gone away. I am sure we will have to remain vigilant to ensure it does not appear in other guises on future occasions. The other amendment that Labor proposes, which remains on the table, is to delete references to section 12(B) of the act, which goes to the provision of Australian workplace agreements and/or individual contracts as conditions of funding. This proposal in the bill is purely, simply and only about pursuing the government's industrial relations agenda, specifically the obsession with attacking the public sector work forceparticularly, in this case, in the education sector. These proposals exactly mirror the recent moves the government has made in the university sector. This government is more than happy to bask in the benefits the education sector brings to this country. Our university and TAFE sectors have international reputations for excellence, and their contribution to our trade position through overseas students and the export of educational product is an invaluable contribution to our economic prosperity. These achievements belong as much to the teachers and administrators who work in both sectors as they belong to governments of any level or any party. Indeed, on 18 May-only a few weeks ago-the minister wrote a press release congratulating the confi- five winners of overseas scholarships trainawarded to young new apprentice graduates at the Australian Overseas Foundation award night. I am very proud to point out to the minister that two of the five award winners area are graduates of my old TAFE at Wollongong. The significant success of students from Wollongong TAFE does not surprise me at all, as I personally know the dedication and professionalism of the staff at the TAFE. I know it has created and sustained a reputation for training excellence within our local community. The first winner was Peter Buckley, employed by Nepean Engineering, who completed his fitting and machining apprenticeship at Wollongong TAFE in 2001 and won a silver medal at the WorldSkills competition in Switzerland. The second winner was Andrew Vine, employed by Elchaars Accident Repairs as a panel beater. Andrew completed his apprenticeship at Wollongong TAFE in 2003 and won first place in the 2004 National WorldSkills competition. I know that head teacher Lindsay Phillips and the teachers from the section would take great pride in the achievements of Peter and Andrew. Lindsay and the team have always taken pride in their work and in their students, as I well remember when I worked with them. The teachers of that section are also strong supporters of the local union branch, which I greatly appreciated when I was their elected representative. Wollongong TAFE maintains a strong and enviable reputation in our local community for the quality of its teachers and the students it produces. The college also has a strong alliance with the TAFE Teachers Federation, and I am always pleased to attend the college to support the efforts of Rob Long and the local branch of the union, as well as the student organisation TAG. Despite the minister's rhetoric, the truth is that strong union links, quality training and dedicated teachers are often seen together. These attributes reflect professional commitment, a community focus that is expressed through a belief in collective action, and the role that unions have in supporting quality outcomes in the education sector. In this bill, the minister is attempting to force TAFE colleges to a completely deregulated employment base-to undermine the value that has been achieved by collective support in a working environment where teachers seek to share what they have and share their knowledge, resources and skillsand into a system that rewards only individual performance, where that sort of effort would be discouraged. I do not believe it would be a better outcome for the national training agenda. (Time expired)",73
134,Mr BAKER,NOES,"I support the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and cognate bill and encourage all members to provide their support. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, in introducing these bills, spoke of the Australian government's commitment to addressing areas of skill needs as a prerequisite to keeping Australia's economic growth strong. It must be noted that before the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority in 1992 Australia had eight separate training systems operating independently of each other. The content and delivery of training was largely determined by the training providers. With changing commerce and industry needs, a more consistent and national unified approach is now required. It must also be noted that the achievements of the Australian National Training Authority include the establishment of national training packages covering most industries and more than 80 per cent of the work force; the offering of recognised qualifications by more than 4,000 registered training organisations; the implementation of New Apprenticeships and the Australian quality training framework; the facilitation of recognition of prior learning; and the expansion of vocational education training in schools. All these achievements have led to a sound and established base on which to build a new national training delivery system. With globalisation and the changing needs of industry and education, more appropriate governance, training delivery, accountability, evaluation methods and associated processes are required. Hence there is a need for a truly national vocational education and training system. National collaboration and industry engagement will lead to the success of Australia's new training system. It can be argued that these elements provide the foundation of the three proposed components of the new training system-that is, business and industry leadership and engagement at all levels of training; the national governance and accountability framework; and the national skills framework. The national governance and accountability framework establishes decision-making processes and bodies responsible for training, as well as planning, performance and evaluation arrangements to guide the operation, development and growth of the training system. The national skills framework sets out the system requirements for quality, content and national consistency in terms of qualifications and training delivery. The governance and accountability framework will include the legislation, funding arrangements and key decision-making processes in relation to leadership, policy, planning and the monitoring of training in Australia. The framework will ensure that the training sector performs to the highest possible level and responds to the needs of government, industry, the individual and communities. A focus on performance, governance and accountability is paramount. Good governance is the key to a high-quality and responsive national training system. Well-governed organisations that are focused on their central purpose have a good understanding of the success they are aiming for and have clearly defined roles, responsibilities and powers. The challenges that face Australian industries today are vastly different from those of 1992, when the Australian National Training Authority was first established. Thus there is a need for change. For example, in 1992 Australia had an unemployment rate of about 10 per cent. But, as a result of the Australian government's resolute economic management since 1996, unemployment has now fallen to 5.1 per cent, the lowest in 29 years. Record low interest rates and a positive economic climate, where real wages have grown over 12 per cent in the last 8½ years compared with less than two per cent under the previous Labor government, have resulted in skill shortages in our industries. Therefore, the most significant challenge to Australian businesses' ongoing economic growth and development will be the need for more skilled workers to meet a growing demand. By abolishing the Australian National Training Authority and transferring its functions to the Department of Education, Science and Training, the Australian government is strengthening its leadership role in determining the overall direction and strategies to develop a skilled Australian work force. These bills will drive genuine reform by requiring states and territories to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the sector so that industry advice on upcoming skills needs and the resulting training priorities can be quickly addressed. One way in which this will be achieved will be by removing impediments to state awards so that training qualifications are based on competence rather than length of time. The legislation also requires states to take action to maximise choice for employers and new apprentices so that they can choose the most relevant, flexible and convenient training for their particular needs. Maximising Australia's skills base is a high priority for industry, particularly in the traditional trades like engineering, electrotechnology, building and construction, as well as in emerging technologies such as photonics and nanotechnology. Skills needs exist at most stages of the business cycle in skilled occupations, and they are also a sign of a thriving and open economy. Skill gaps arise, for example, in the new innovative industries and in sectors of more traditional industries that are changing rapidly to meet new consumer and technological demands and to develop new products and services in a highly competitive, international market. Through these bills, the Australian government is demonstrating its commitment to high-quality, nationally consistent education and training and its commitment to working closely with industry to find solutions. As part of this commitment, the government announced new measures last year to a total value of some $1.4 billion over four years, aimed at addressing skills needs, particularly in the trades. Working closely with industry, education providers and local communities, the Australian government has now begun implementing these initiatives. They include establishing 24 Australian technical colleges in regions experiencing skills needs and high rates of unemployment; and offering Commonwealth trade learning scholarships, providing tool kits and extending youth allowance to new apprentices, which will provide greater financial assistance for new apprentices in trades experiencing skills needs. The initiatives also include creating the Institute for Trade Skills Excellence to identify best practice in trade skill tuition and promote value of choosing a trade or vocational education; expanding the highly successful school based New Apprenticeships program into the trades; and creating a further 4,500 prevocational training places, giving young and mature aged people preliminary training in a skilled area, making them work-ready to enter a new apprenticeship in the trades. The Howard government's commitment to vocational and technical education is illustrated by the significant funding of $4.4 billion provided through this legislation, and the additional $1.4 billion over four years announced last year, for an integrated and comprehensive suite of new policies to reinforce nation-building skills needs. These initiatives represent one of the most significant boosts to vocational and technical education ever undertaken by any government. They lift the Australian government's contribution to a record $10.1 billion over the next four years. Ongoing savings of $3.096 million per year will be realised from 2006-07 through the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority. This amounts to approximately 25 per cent of the annual Australian National Training Authority appropriation of $12 million. These savings will be achieved primarily through the elimination of duplication in management and corporate support services, which will account for a saving of $2.646 million, and minor administrative savings of some $450,000. Today around 12 per cent of Australia's working age population is undertaking vocational and technical education in the publicly funded training system. These bills are the most significant legislation for the vocational and technical education sector for the past decade. They will establish the new national training system and will provide the Australian government funding required to support the Australia's world-class training system in 2005 and beyond. Since coming to power, this government has reinvigorated the vocational and technical education system. The total numbers undertaking vocational and technical education have grown from 1.27 million in 1995 to 1.72 million in 2003, an increase of 35 per cent. The numbers in new apprenticeships have grown to around 393,800 in trainingin more than 500 different occupations, including emerging technologies such as electrotechnology-which compares with 143,700 in 1995. The numbers in Vocational Education and Training in Schools programs have grown to around 202,900 students, with approximately 44 per cent of senior secondary students participating. This represents a massive 116 per cent increase in numbers since 1997 and reflects the huge success of the Vocational Education and Training in Schools programs, now available in more than 95 per cent of Australian secondary schools. Twenty-six per cent of all young Australians aged 15 to 19 participate in vocational and technical education. Thirty per cent of vocational and technical education clients are aged 40 or over. Thirty-nine per cent of vocational and technical education clients are now in rural and regional Australia. And, since 1996, the number of women in training has grown by 34 per cent to 834,400, with women accounting for 49 per cent of vocational and technical education clients. Last year saw 135,700 new apprenticeship completions, which was an increase of some 11 per cent from the previous year. These are outstanding results and reflect the sound economic management of the Howard government over the past 8½ years. It is imperative that these bills move Australia's technical and vocational education forward. Therefore, I commend these bills to the House.",78
135,Mrs IRWIN,NOES,"The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 is another nail in the coffin of what was once one of our proudest institutions. Few nations have had the advantage of having such a well-resourced system of technical education and training as Australia's. While at times we may think of Australia as the lucky country, we as a nation have made most of our own luck. If you go back a century ago, two countries led the world in their standard of living: Australia and Argentina. While we may complain that we have slipped down that table to some extent, we are well in front of Argentina. There are many reasons for those differences. One major factor that can never be ignored is that Australia's state governments took the lead in developing the skills of our work force. While other countries have imported their skilled work force, Australia has been able to grow its own. These homegrown skills have been the backbone of Australia's industrial and commercial development. Our skills base has not come about by accident or by a stroke of luck; it has been achieved by the planning and dedication of generations of visionary Australians who have guided the development of our education and training institutions for over a century. In the case of New South Wales this began with the establishment of technical colleges in the 1890s. It is interesting to note in the light of this legislation why state governments stepped into the field of technical education. Those first colleges took over the role of the mechanics institutes, which had provided limited training in areas such as technical drawing. Apprenticeship training was totally on-the-job training, but special skills such as technical drawing could not be learned on the job and it was not always possible for a trade apprentice to gain all the necessary skills from one master. So the greater proportion of skills training was taken over by technical colleges. An added benefit of college based training was that new technology could be introduced and each apprentice could be exposed to the full range of methods and techniques. From boilermakers to pastry cooks, Australia produced generations of competent tradespeople of a standard equal to that of anywhere in the world. Many of those highly trained people went on to start and build their own businesses or take on high-level management positions. Their trade training provided them with the foundation on which they developed their business skills. But technical colleges did not limit themselves to trade training. Even greater numbers of Australians learned accounting and business administration skills at our public and private colleges. One thing that seems to have escaped the government's thinking on this issue is that the great majority of those who built our skills base through access to our technical and business colleges did it on their own time. It was not until the 1950s that daytime training of apprentices became the rule. And for well past that time students and trainees took themselves off to colleges for two or three nights a week to develop their skills. Many still do that today. The structure and face of training today has changed a great deal. The increased role of the Commonwealth has had some positive effects-and national standards were well overdue-but the effect in some states has been to bring high standards down to the much lower levels of other states. While states such as New South Wales maintained high standards in their level of resources and facilities and in the training and accreditation of staff and while other states starting from a lower base have improved their systems to a degree, it remains fair to say that overall the standards in our training systems have fallen. That brings me to one of the requirements set out in this bill. Proposed section 13 of the bill calls for the complete implementation of competency based training. This will require the amendment of state legislation and awards to bring them into line with a competency based approach rather than a time based approach. This will result in major changes to the traditional apprenticeship system. I can appreciate that the rigid application of apprenticeship training times can be a factor in deterring older people from undertaking a trade. While there is some element of allowing for increased maturity on the part of apprentices, we really need to question any supposed benefit in reducing the length of trade courses-and, for that matter, the concept of competency based training. The idea that competency based training includes something that does not happen in time based courses does not always prove to be the case. A good example of competency based training would be a motor vehicle drivers licence test. A lot of people are critical of these tests because they do not test the driver in a full range of situations-for example, emergency situations which may occur. We should also remember that in recent years states have changed driver testing to include the requirement for learners to complete logbooks to show the number of hours of driving practice they have had. Despite these changes there are often calls to improve driver training and testing. I should also add that over recent years we have seen an increase in the length of time required for the holding of provisional licences. We should not see competency based training as the best or only option for many types of training. It does have its place butand we should not forget this-true competency based training can extend the time taken to complete a qualification. We now have a situation where 40 per cent of apprentices do not complete their trade training. There are many reasons for this, but we should not assume that competency based training will shorten the time necessary to complete training or that it is a better program for the individual trainee. Another aspect of competency based training that should be considered is the cost. When talking about trades it is easy to forget that there are many small, specialised trades and that there may be as little as one class for each such trade in each state. Even trades with greater demand can have small classes when spread over a large state. Competency based training assumes that each learner proceeds at their own pace, but this can be quite impractical in smaller classes. For this and other reasons, competency based training can be more expensive than time based training. One other reason that is totally overlooked is that trade training is more than just collectcalls ing a few skills; it represents an achievement worth recognising. The present Minister for Education, Science and Training is fond of saying that more young people should consider learning a trade rather than going on to university. There was a time when it was considered good advice for young people to get a trade, as they used to say, but in those days a trade was a rite of passage. A 15-yearold first-year apprentice would mature into a responsible 21-year-old adult journeyman, ready to face the world. Two years ago I was in Zurich when I was passed on the street by two strangely dressed young men. They wore top hats and dress coats and carried small sacks. When I asked them what they were doing, they explained that they were journeymen carpenters and that to complete their trade training they had to leave their master and their home town to go out into the world to become master tradesmen. It may seem old fashioned and a waste of time, but if we are to give skilled trades their proper place in our society then we cannot pass off the respect that once existed for having the skill of a trade. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to talk about overalls and navy blue singlets, but it is something else to give proper recognition to the skills of our tradespeople, and watering down the content of trade courses does nothing to achieve that. Introducing mickey mouse trades in hamburger flipping does nothing to enhance the status of skilled trades. Competency based training has its place, but it is only when you see skills training in a very narrow sense that you insist on competency based training being the only model. As I mentioned, many trades have small numbers of practitioners and the demand for courses in such trades is spread widely over the country, so it is surprising that this bill for an expansion of user-choice policy without allowing for difficulties that may be faced by some states and regions. State TAFE systems have undergone radical rationalisation over the past decade, and that has often meant that courses are available in only one centre in each region. The expansion of the user-choice policy in this bill will lead in many cases to the costly duplication of courses, making it harder for centres to meet the national unit price bands which are also part of the deal. The only outcome from this policy will be a race to the bottom in standards and facilities. The losers will be not only those young people who look to those centres for training but, in the long term, industry and our economy, as skills training becomes less and less accessible. Three weeks ago the Wall Street Journal lamented the shortage of skilled workers in the United States. The article stated: ‘While skills strapped companies often blame schools for not providing proper skills, some executives say outsourcing jobs abroad and eliminating training programs to cut costs made the problem worse.' And yet this bill is trying to bring to Australia a US-style skills training system. It is a system that has failed in the United States of America, but it is to become the model that we are to adopt here in Australia. But behind all this is what comes down to a lack of respect for working Australians and a lack of respect for those with skills, and it has been that way on the conservative side of politics for more than a century. It was not by accident that the first trade unions in Australia were craft unions. They were able to represent the skilled trades in industrial disputes and they were resented for their bargaining power, so it became the goal of employers to break the bargaining power of the skilled trades. The way that was done was by reducing the level of regard that skilled trades were given. Today we are paying a price for that in skills shortages throughout many industries. But what is the government's response to those shortages? It seeks to make up for its failure to ensure our supply of skilled workers by increasing levels of skilled immigration. Instead of growing our own, we are importing skilled workers. Instead of providing training opportunities for young Australians, we are attempting to buy skilled workers on the world market. That is the stage we have reached through the savage cuts already made to TAFE funding in Australia. These measures will, as I say, be another nail coffin of our once proud TAFE colleges. Related to that is the government's requirement for Australian workplace agreements and other individual contracts to become the standard in TAFE, and this is part of the same process. Instead of recognising the value of our teachers in our colleges, government is doing everything it can to reduce the status of teachers. We saw what happened in TAFE in Victoria when the Kennett government slashed the TAFE system there. We saw wages reduced and we saw qualified and skilled teachers driven out of the system. This is not the way to attract and train the best teachers for the colleges which will provide our skills training. We will pay a high price in future years for this government's short-sighted policy. Some other measures in this legislation are also of concern to me. Proposed section 19 prohibits the payments being used to provide education or training for private recreational pursuits or hobbies. The minister likes to poke fun at these courses, referring to yoga classes and the like. There have already been big reductions in these types of courses in state systems. The days are long gone when every country town had an active fashion class. There was some criticism of the ladies of the town spending two nights a week creating their latest wardrobe with the benefit of the college sewing machines and the expert assistance of a qualified teacher. In locking out the fashion ladies and those who took the class in French cookery, we might have given TAFE a strictly vocational outlook but at the same time we overlooked what we were doing with these courses: we were building the overall skills base of the community. I know a gentlemen who did a French cookery course a decade ago, and he is now running a bed and breakfast. The link between skills and employment is not always in the as direct as an apprenticeship implies. A generation ago when tertiary education, including TAFE training, was made free of charge the thinking was that everyone was entitled to tertiary education. It was not the exclusive preserve of the academically minded or those already in a line of emthis ployment. One of the biggest reasons students give for undertaking training is that they want to change their job; they are looking for something different. But under this bill they will be locked out. Training is for industry only, not for individuals. At a time when many people are looking to retire from the full-time work force, there are fewer opportunities to build on the skills that can provide them with the opportunity to contribute to the economy through their hobby or other interest. We are locking many people out of useful and rewarding employment. We say that skills training should be subsidised but only for those courses that industry thinks are useful. I can think of one former member of this House-and it is not the former member for Fowler-who some years ago, before retiring, undertook a short course at TAFE in small farm management. He now successfully breeds goats on his small property. I would not describe it as a great commercial venture but it is productive and it keeps him occupied. I know that he learned a lot in his TAFE course and he found much of what he learned very useful. As the Treasurer keeps urging older people to keep working, he should not forget that many older people would much prefer to work in an area that interests them. At their stage of life they do not want to work for a boss anymore and they often have interests or hobbies that they would like to continue, but this minister wants to lock them out of the system. Unfortunately, that may mean locking them out of making a positive contribution to the economy in their retirement. We once had a fine and effective system of skills training in Australia. It served us well in the past. But this government is trying to destroy that. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (7.04 pm)-In speaking on the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous commitment this government has to vocational and technical education. For all the history that was outlined by the member for Fowler, the ALP does not have the currency to deliver up-todate reforms to keep our skills on top of the world or relevant to today's workplaces and employment opportunities. Whilst this country, in a bipartisan manner, must encourage intellectual and academic research, we also must meet a growing skills shortage in the trades that is brought about by a five per cent unemployment rate. We have skilled and unskilled shortages. In the 12 months to September 2004 a record 135,700 new apprentices completed their courses-but that is not enough. We must reinvigorate the trade training sector. Our society cannot function in the way that we want it to without the builders, the mechanics, the electricians and the plumbers to build our houses, to fix our modern cars, to install our modern electrical appliances and to keep our modern pipes operating. The member for Fowler talked about building a skills base when the ALP were in power. Their skills base was 10 per cent unemployment. Dare I say it, but the minister is absolutely right when the member for Fowler defends a goat-farming course at TAFE. This legislation provides the reform we need to reshape the future of trades training. Nobody would deny that we need thousands of new skilled tradespeople in every city and town in Australia and that vocational education and training provides for over 70 per cent of young people who do not go to university. Drive through Kingswood in the electorate of Lindsay and you will see hundreds of small businesses specialising in trades. These are panel beaters, electricians, plumbers, car detailers and auto-electricians and people working in air conditioning and building. These businesses cannot get enough apprentices, and so the government is being proactive in doing what it can to encourage kids to go into the trades, to encourage businesses to take on apprentices and to make trades as sought after as university degrees. In Sydney 20 per cent of the population is aged under 15. In my electorate of Lindsay in Penrith 24 per cent, or 42,000 young people, fall into this age group. Our youthful population combined with the large amount of small trade businesses makes this legislation very important to my electorate. As the minister said when he spoke on this legislation, this government is targeting apprenticeship incentives at employers who make a commitment to high-level trainingemployers such as Hix Electrical in the seat of Lindsay. The Hix company, who deliver electrical services right across Sydney, take on and train many apprentices every year, giving back to the community where they have established a very successful business. The government is also targeting apprenticeships at mature aged Australians so that they can have a future in a new career if they have lost their job in an area that has become redundant or is no longer required or if they return to work after a long break. The member for Fowler's solution to this is to extend the number of years it takes to do a trade. Basically, it is a matter of ‘Let's keep on doing all the old trades the way that we've always done them.' The marketplace has reformed; the skills base and the types of work that people are doing have vastly changed from the era she is talking about. If the member for Fowler had her way, what would happen when a young person compared the cost and time of doing a university degree, especially after New South Wales increased the cost of some TAFE courses by 100, 200 or 300 per cent? The member for Fowler can yearn for the days of Zurich and her many travels abroad from the electorate in Western Sydney where she met all these journeymen, but at the end of the day I bring her back to an employer in my electorate who employs welders and is quite disappointed. Some of the people that he is taking on from TAFE can do a beautiful weld-a perfect, copybook weld-but he needs a whole lot more welds an hour than those people are capable of delivering. He needs a tradesperson who can work in the modern workplace in a relevant manner. The bills will enable the government to start to directly address some of the problems like those that Hix Electrical have been talking to me about. Many of my local small businesses have been telling me that they are unhappy with the way that TAFE runs its courses, particularly in relation to apprenticeships. The member for Fowler touched on this but did not seem to quite get to the kernel of the issue. In the first term of a course, one apprentice may have their classes on a Monday, another on a Tuesday, another on a Wednesday, another on a Thursday and another on a Friday. The company has its apprentices all set up with regular hours so that it is covered across the board for its personnel for each day of the week. When the next term comes, TAFE has changed the times for the release of those apprentices. Suddenly all five appies have to be out on a Monday. That throws that small business into complete disarray. There is no consultation with the employers; there is total disregard for their workplace set-up. This is being done to accommodate TAFE employees-lecturers for whom it is convenient to say: ‘I have another commitment on a Thursday. Can I now do it on a Monday?' This means a total alteration of the schedules and shifts within a business to cope with the whims of a training institution. Timetabling is just one of the practical problems employers face when they take on apprentices. That is not to say that TAFE is all bad: it does have a sound curriculum, it offers some practical courses and it has many excellent teachers. But TAFE can be improved. The government must make TAFE more flexible, because TAFE provides up to 85 per cent of all training. TAFE must be given more flexibility, and this means the introduction of Australian workplace agreements to give TAFE directors the opportunity to respond quickly to market shifts and employment needs. The member for Cunningham saw this as an attack on the ALP and unions. That gives an indication of the ideas-or the vacuum of ideas-on the other side with respect to reform and new approaches in the workplace. The ALP is full of great ideas, isn't it? All these young people go there with great ideas, and there they stay, wallowing on opposition benches. On this side, we have the energy, the verve and the ideas to get out there, implement change and bring our Australian workplaces up to speed with those of the rest of the world. The legislation will give the Commonwealth more influence over vocational education and training than it has had in the past. This will enable the government to have a more direct impact on Australia's international competitiveness and on youth unemployment by tying funding to conditions and training outcomes to improve the performance of the trade training sector. This government has the support of the business and training sector for these changes. Consultation was undertaken with key stakeholders for four weeks during February and March this year. The feedback was that stakeholders wanted the changes proposed by the government to make the training sector more responsive and flexible. When TAFE fees went up in New South Wales, the number of people attending TAFE courses fell away. The first people to go-the first people laid off at TAFEs-were the casual staff. The casual staff at TAFE are generally casual because they are working in the industry for their day jobs. That means that they have current and relevant workplace experience. They are the first to go. Current trainers with relevant experience in industry are the first to go, because of the inflexibility of a TAFE system that puts a priority on time served by lecturers who have spent an enormous amount of time doing a degree but who have seen substantial changes from when they were last employed in a workplace, affecting their awareness of how speedy or technical people need to be or what particular skills are demanded in the current workplace. Under the legislation there will be bilateral agreements that set targets, national priorities and performance levels. These agreements will be negotiated between the federal government and each state or territory government. Each agreement can be unique. That is necessary because the needs of the Northern Territory, for example, can be different from those of New South Wales in some trades. This can ensure local diversity and also meet regional needs. But the agreement can also bed in a national standard that will allow a New South Wales trained plumber to work in Queensland. The ALP see this as an attack on unions. For me, that is further proof of their inability to come up with any new ideas or reform in order to keep the Australian work force internationally competitive and up there with the best. I am confident that the agreements negotiated with the states will represent the best interests of the community and the nation. The government will drive genuine reform by requiring states and territories to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the sector, including by maximising choice for employers and new apprentices, to enable them to select the most suitable training provider for their needs; implementing workplace reform in TAFE, including through more flexible employment arrangements such as AWAs and performance pay, so that TAFE is more responsive to local employer and industry needs; removing impediments in state awards so that training qualifications are based on competence rather than on length of time; increasing the utilisation of fully publicly funded training infrastructure, by providing third-party access to that infrastructure on a commercial basis; and ensuring that payments received under the act are not used for providing vocational education and training to overseas students or for private recreational pursuits or hobbies for retiring goat farmers. Under the bills the Australian National Training Authority will be disbanded, and its functions and responsibilities will go to the Department of Education, Science and Training. ANTA has been successful, but it was established more than 10 years ago when the economic conditions were very different-a la 10 per cent unemployment. With unemployment hovering around five per cent, there is more demand for skilled workers than ever, and we need a new training system to meet that demand. I think it is entirely appropriate that the minister and his department take responsibility. It is a great thing that the minister is actually now more accountable for the performances in this area. Gone are the Labor days when you could insulate your minister from any criticism in the media-you could also insulate them from any real power. Full credit has to go to our minister, as an elected representative, for taking on the responsibility, having the courage to take on a possible mea culpa down the track and having the courage to take action as it is required rather than refer it to a committee, another training authority or ‘someone else but me'. In this instance the minister is responsible enough, brave enough and courageous enough to take this on himself. All credit to him because he is a very successful, competent and reforming minister. The bills will provide an extra $175 million, which we are asking the states and territories to match, to provide funding for up to 116,000 new training places over the next three years. This will provide a very real and needed injection of students into apprenticeship schemes. We expect that the vast majority of these students will then move into jobs in the trades sector and help plug the gap in trades that this government has identified and that is affecting our lives in very real ways-like when we cannot get a builder for 12 months or a plumber for six weeks. It is certainly working with training providers to make sure that the courses they deliver are flexible, responsive to employer needs and producing the skills that we need today, not what we needed a decade ago. The states and territories will receive $4.5 billion for vocational and technical education until December 2008. This will be a real average increase of 3.2 per cent per year. This government is committed to investing in the trade sector and meeting the skills shortage. That is why the government will fund, to the value of $65 million, 24 technical colleges throughout Australia, including one in Western Sydney. I hope that these pilot colleges will be successful and that we will eventually see our one in Western Sydney for 300 students expand to 1,500 students and probably another two or three technical colleges in Western Sydney, producing a skilled work force for the Australian future. We are ensuring that apprentices have the resources they need to do their apprenticeships by spending $28 million to provide a tool kit for each new apprentice in specific trades, to make extra payments to bring their income level up to that of a uni student and to establish the Institute for Trade Skills Excellence to promote and benchmark excellence in trades skills development and training. We are also looking into the all-toocommon problem of the poaching of trained apprentices from companies who have invested effort and time into 25 per cent or more of the training of new apprentices. These bills reinforce this government's commitment to trades and trade training and will reform the training sector to better meet the needs of the country's trade shortages as well as to listen to the needs of employers who create trade jobs. As a result, TAFE will become more flexible and responsive to industry and national demand. As the minister has said, it will take Australia's system into a new era.",81
136,Ms LIVERMORE,NOES,"The title of these bills is another one of the government's classic misnomers: ‘skilling Australia's work force'. There is nothing in the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 or the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 that shows that the government is serious about addressing the skills shortage that continues to grow and threaten Australia's economic performance, putting pressure on inflation and interest rates. In technical terms the purpose of these bills is to provide for a new funding framework for the provision of grants to the states and territories vocational education and training. It comes about following the government's out-of-theblue announcement just after the last election that it would abolish the Australian National Training Authority. We on this side of the House oppose that initiative and these bills, and we do so for a number of very good reasons. The fact is that these bills are nothing but a grab for power by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education which undoes years of cooperation in the vocational education and training sector between the Commonwealth and state governments. First of all, the Howard government froze funding to ANTA. Then it unilaterally abolished it without consultation with the states. Now, with this legislation, it seems that the federal government is more intent on picking political fights over industrial relations than ensuring that this country has the VET system it needs to meet the nation's demand for skilled workers. You would think, when the OECD and the Reserve Bank are telling us that we need urgent action on the skills shortage, that the Howard government could put politics to one side and work with the states to resolve the crisis. But instead of a single-minded focus on vocational education and training this government is insisting on building the new system around its industrial relations agenda by making vocational education and training funding to the states conditional on TAFE colleges introducing AWAs. I have to ask the minister: instead of using VET funding to bully the states over industrial relations, how about using VET funding to improve the skills of the Australian work force? This legislation should not be considered in isolation from the government's serial neglect of vocational education and training in this country. We should remember that it was the former Labor government that led the way in setting up the Australian National for Training Authority in 1992 to establish a national cooperative system of training management. Unlike this government, the Keating government recognised the need for a skilled work force to underpin Australia's growth and prosperity and took its responsibilities for training seriously. Instead of picking fights with the states and finding ways to shift blame and costs on to the states, the Labor government of that time worked with them. The first ANTA agreement reflected that cooperative approach, providing for the Commonwealth to contribute $720 million over three years, with growth funds of $7 million annually on the condition that the states agree to maintain their levels of funding to this important sector. As we all know, however, in 1996 the Howard government took the axe to training, and we are seeing in today's skills shortage the results of its failure to invest in training. The Howard government abolished the growth funding that was central to the original ANTA agreement and reduced expenditure further by imposing efficiency dividends and requirements for the states to achieve growth through efficiencies. By 2004 the cooperative approach and genuine commitment by the Commonwealth to bear its share of responsibility for training that underpinned the ANTA agreement lay in tatters thanks to this government's complacency and short-sighted penny pinching. So, when it comes to answers for the nation's skills shortage, you have to look at what this Howard government does and not listen to what it says. Since taking office, the Howard government has reduced real funding to this vital area of vocational education and training. It has ignored the states for years, even when it was the state governments who were constantly drawing the government's attention to the demand for training places and were calling for adequate money from the Commonwealth to meet that demand and avoid a skills shortage. Now, just when the skills crisis it has created demands the complete focus and cooperation of all governments, the Howard government, with its usual arrogance, has acted unilaterally to abolish ANTA and, without consulting the states, is seeking to impose this new system. ANTA has been the honest broker, with the states and all stakeholders in the VET sector having confidence in it to allocate VET funding according to the national interest. This government needs to realise that it must have the cooperation of the states in order to have any chance at making any real difference to the national skills shortage sis. Instead, it seems that the Howard government wants to go it alone in designing and administering the training system, but its past failures and neglect of training and vocational education show that it is not up to We see the results of this government's neglect and lack of interest in training in my electorate. I wish to take this opportunity to give the House a couple of examples of how the people of Capricornia have been badly let down by this government's failures in the area of training. I am sure that all members of the House would be aware of the boom in the mining industry, particularly the coal mining industry, affecting areas in my electorate of Capricornia. That boom is very welcome, but one of the problems it creates for small business in regional cities is that it is very hard to find skilled labour. This is true also for the trade of motor mechanics. At present, motor mechanics are in great demand in Central Queensland. To try to overcome this problem, a local garage proprietor engaged in his business a matureaged apprentice. In August 2004, the employee made an application to Trade Recognition Australia for an Australian-recognised trade certificate. The employee sent off his application and included the $300 fee. On 13 October, some two months later, the employee again wrote to the Trades Recognition Council and asked for a progress report on his application. On 7 January 2005-this is some five months after submitting his application-a telephone interview was conducted by someone from the Trades Recognition Council in Brisbane. On 19 March 2005, the employee received a letter saying that he had to sit an examination in Brisbane within 28 days-and Brisbane, of course, is 750 kilometres south of Rockhampton. The employer then wrote to the department, explaining that the employee was uncri- able to make it to Brisbane and asked whether some alternative arrangement could be made for the taking of that exam. To date, the employer has not received a reply to his request. In April this year, the employer rang it. the department in Brisbane. He was told by the person he spoke to that he was overworked and that the other person in the office was on holidays and would get back to the employer when he returned. Four weeks later, the employee rang the department's Brisbane office to be told, ‘Can't you read English? The 28 days has expired.' The phone was then hung up. This is a case of a man wanting to work in regional Australia, wanting to gain recognised skills to secure his family's future and wanting to work with his employer to provide a service to his community but being hung up on by this government's Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. Today I have written to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on behalf of my constituent who is seeking a trade tificate. I am also writing on behalf of his employer, the small business man who is doing what he can to help develop this nation's skills base-and doing it, it seems, despite the best efforts of this government stop him. If we assume that the department's employee in Brisbane is right when he says he is ‘overworked', then we must ask what the pieces of legislation before the House do to change that. Can the minister explain exactly how picking fights with the states and meddling in the internal human resource management of TAFE colleges will address the skills shortage and remove the impediments to small business people that I have just scribed? Sadly, the answer is nothing. Nothing the government is proposing here will change the situation for the department's employee in Brisbane or the small business man in Rockhampton. As for the employeethe man in Rockhampton who just wants to have his skills recognised-as far as the Howard government is concerned, he can just go and join the other people in Rockhampton whom this government has failed to skill up for work, even though it knew the opportunities for work were there. I am talking about those who see their jobs being taken by foreign workers because this government has failed to skill Australians up to take advantage of my region's growth industries. The unemployment rate in Rockhampton is running at eight per cent, compared with the national average of just over five per cent. That eight per cent equates to 2,539 people in Rockhampton who would like to find a job. In February this year, I placed on the Notice Paper a question to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs asking, amongst other things: How many visas had been issued at the request of cer- Teys Bros meat works in Rockhampton. The minister's response advised that, as at 1 March, a total of 81 visas had been issued. Of these, 80 had a skills classification of slaughterperson and one had a skills classifito cation of butcher. The minister also advised: No independent examination of the labour market in Rockhampton was conducted, however, the Department had regard to a submission provided by the company detailing attempts to recruit locally in Rockhampton and difficulties experienced in securing suitably qualified people. The words ‘suitably qualified people' go exactly to the point I am making. The company says that it could not find 81 skilled Australians amongst the 2,539 unemployed people de- in Rockhampton and had to import skilled labour to work in their meat works. It is not my intention today to question the company on its reasoning, but it is my intention to highlight the role that the Howard government has played in ensuring that not one of those 2,539 unemployed Rockhampton workers was skilled enough to take any of the 81 positions that have gone to foreign workers in our city. On 17 March this year, the Brisbane Courier Mail published a story in which it mentioned my saying that the government had been aware of these problems since at least 1999. The Courier Mail also spoke to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Gary Hardgrave, who said, ‘Ms Livermore's claim that the government was given a proposal for a meat training plant in Rockhampton was wrong; there is no evidence of that having happened.' I believe that the 2,539 unemployed people in Rockhampton deserve to know the truth of this matter. I want the people of Capricornia to understand that this Howard government cannot be trusted, has not delivered on training in the past and that there is nothing in this present bill to give any confidence that it will deliver in the future. On 30 April 1999, the company operating the Lakes Creek Meat Works in Rockhampton wrote to the local development organisation. The first paragraph of the letter states: We refer to our earlier discussions regarding the concept of constructing a dedicated facility for the ongoing formal training and assessment of Trainee Slaughterpersons, Boners, Slicers and Packers on site at our Lakes Creek meat works. A number of meetings followed from that letter and on 18 August the company again wrote to the local development organisation. The third paragraph of the letter states: A cornerstone of this is well trained operators. Training facilities are negligible and it is tive for the success of the expansion plans and future effective, internationally competitive, formance of this company that it has a well trained workforce. Enclosed with the letter was a proposed plan of the training facility. In January 2000, a meeting was held in Rockhampton with the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. On 31 January 2000, the Deputy Prime Minister wrote: I have written to the Minister for Employment, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, seeking to have my letter of support attached to the proposal. … I have written to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon Peter Reith MP, drawing his attention to the proposal and the need for the establishment of a Training Abattoir in Rockhampton. On 8 February 2000, the company wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister about the matter and on 1 March the company wrote to the Hon. Peter Reith; in fact, a local group flew to Hervey Bay in March 2000 to meet with Minister Reith to lobby for the training facility. I have copies of correspondence from not only the Deputy Prime Minister but also the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith, the then Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, and the then Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald. All of this correspondence from 1999 to 2000 refers to the then obvious need for a meat industry training facility to be established in Rockhampton. For the current vocational and education minister, Gary Hardgrave, to suggest that this government was unaware of this training proposal is simply not true. But what is even more important and distressing about all this is the simple fact that even with the written support, at the time, of the Deputy Prime imperaMinister and other ministers, this training proposal did not get up. As a direct conseper- quence of this government's failure to work with our local community to enhance employment opportunities, 2,539 Australians have been overlooked for a job and the work has now gone to 81 overseas workers who have been imported mainly from Brazil. This government was advised six years ago that shortages of skilled meat workers would affect the future of this industry. A locally initiated solution was given to it. This government failed to provide the training and now there are people in Rockhampton who are unemployed as a direct result of that indifference. I have demonstrated today, by these examples, that this government has an appalling record on skills training. It might be said that it can talk the talk, but when it comes to delivering on skills training it cannot walk the walk. It seems the only people walking are the 2,539 unemployed people in Rockhampton who would have dearly loved a job at our Lakes Creek Meat Works but find themselves not skilled for these positions. Based on that, there is no reason for me to have confidence in the government's new proposals for this training scheme to replace the system funded through ANTA. I raised those examples to provide the context in which we are debating this bill. The government is talking about scrapping the training system that has been in place since the Labor government introduced it in 1992. The government has a record of not properly funding the training system in Australia, and the skills shortage that we see now is a direct consequence of that neglect and indifference for training. The result is the kinds of skills shortages that have been identified, by the Reserve Bank in particular, as creating capacity constraints in our economy and threatening higher inflation and interest rates. The government's answer to this, over the last couple of years, has been simply to look to skilled migrants as an answer. As has been demonstrated in my local area, that displaces local people who, with the proper training and appropriate support, could be filling these positions. In Rockhampton, the unemployment rate is some eight per cent, which is three per cent higher than the national average. For the government to sit back and say that it has been doing all it could to skill up local people and to fill the positions that are in desperate need of filling, in both the mining and the meat processing industries, is just another example of this government's total complacency and neglect of regional Australia. Nowhere is that more clearly apparent than in this skills area. This bill focuses on the government's ideological obsession with the industrial tions agenda rather than addressing the skills shortage in Australia. Nothing in this bill help the people of Rockhampton who need the skills to take up the opportunities that exist in our local economy.",88
137,Mr HARTSUYKER,NOES,"If you go back 20 years, a view prevailed that somehow a trade qualification was of less value than a university degree, that a trade qualification was something that you only did when you could not get into university. How wrong that view was. I regularly attend TAFE graduations in my electorate. It is certainly an uplifting experience to see the sense of achievement for the young people-and the not so young peopleassembled there, as they receive their qualifications and acknowledgement for the hard work that they have put into their own training and the great effort that they have put into get a much needed TAFE qualification. Neil Black, the director of the North Coast Institute of TAFE, refers often on such occasions to the room that the function is being held in. He acknowledges the fact that without trades skills there would not be any windows in the building-there would be no floor, no roof and no walls. It is an important point. Trade skills play a vital part in everyday life. Trade skills are involved in the design and construction of the furniture that we sit on, the floor coverings and the curtains. Virtually every aspect of our day-today lives is influenced by people who possess trades skills-the electricians, the plumbers, the boilermakers, the chefs. Wherever we go, there are trades skills enhancing the quality of our lives and advancing our economy. The members opposite always seem to refer to this notion of a skills crisis. Indeed, when they were in government there was never a shortage of skills or labour, be it skilled or unskilled. With one million people rela- out of work there was never going to be a shortage of labour in virtually any class. The will members opposite dealt with the problems of unemployment through make-work programs and placing people on the DSP to hide the magnitude of their economic mismanagement. They had people out there painting rocks white, building pine log fences-you name it; a whole raft of enterprises that were not related to economic prosperity. This government believes that a more flexible work force is a more productive work force. This government believes that a highly skilled work force is a more productive work force. This government is committed to work force reform. This government is committed to trade skills. We believe that skills and trade training are the very foundation stones of our economy. Trade training is certainly not producing the number of graduates we need at the moment. If we look around we see that, as a product of our booming economy and strong employment growth, there is strong demand for all classes of labour, particularly skilled labour and trade skills. The bills before the House are part of this government's response to enabling us to meet the challenge of the need that this economy is generating for those trade skills. The government has introduced a range of interim measures such as increasing the level of skilled migration. But with a view to a long term solution to the economy, and with a view to a long-term solution for our trade skills needs, through these bills we are reviewing the way in which we meet the challenge of trade skills. We had the organisation already in place, ANTA, which was set up some 12 years ago. It is time to take a new look at that, time to refresh that. When ANTA was set up there was an unemployment rate of some 10 per cent. That has been almost halved across the country. But we still need to cope with advances in technology, with a need for sophisticated skills and with the fact that many people are changing careers several times. There is a need for retraining, to direct people to where the shortages in our labour market are and to train them so that they can meet the challenges of those labour markets. These bills provide for a coordinated and modernised approach to Australia's skills needs to ensure that we have the level of skills that we need to meet the challenges of Australia in the 21st century. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 will be the vehicle for the government's new national training arrangements for the period from July 2005 to 31 December 2008 following the abolition of ANTA and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Education, Science and Training. The new training system will build on the achievements of ANTA and the training sector in establishing the foundations of an industry led national training system. The key elements of the current arrangements, such as a national approach and industry leadership, that we have will be strengthened. The bills will provide some $4.4 billion as the Australian government's contribution to the states and territories for vocational and technical education for the period from July 2005 to December 2008. This is in addition to the $577 million already paid to the states and territories for the first six months of 2005, so it is indeed a substantial commitment. It takes the total funding for the quadrennium to $4.9 billion and includes an additional $175 million compared to 2004. It represents an average real annual increase of 3.2 per cent on that year. The Australian government has also called on the states and territories to match that additional $175 million. If they were to do so, that would provide sufficient funding for up to 116,000 additional training places over the funding period. A key feature of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill will be improving the government's capacity to influence the training sector through a funding framework that ties funding more strongly to a range of conditions and targets for training outcomes. That is very important. This government is very focused on achieving outcomes. The government will drive genuine reform by requiring the states and territories to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the sector; by maximising the choice for employers and new apprentices to enable them to select the most suitable training provider for their needs; and by implementing the work force reform in TAFE, including more flexible employment arrangements such as AWAs and performance pay. It is vitally important that we reward quality teaching through performance pay so that it is more responsive to local employer and industry needs. The bills provide for the removal of impediments in state awards so that training qualifications are based on competence rather than length of time of service. The bills increase the utilisation of fully publicly funded training infrastructure by providing third-party access to that infrastructure on a commercial basis and ensuring that the payments received under the act are not used for providing vocational education to overseas students or for private recreational pursuits or hobbies. These requirements will be introduced in the legislation as statutory conditions for receiving funding. The reforms will be supported by bilateral agreements specifying targets, national priorities and performance levels relevant to each jurisdiction. This will result in a significant shift in Commonwealth-state relations and provide the Australian government with a more significant leadership role. Through its budget this government has also shown its commitment to trade training. Within the budget we gave effect to our commitment for 24 Australian technical colleges. The budget provided for 4,500 new prevocational training places in trades, 7,000 school based new apprenticeships, 20,000 more places in the New Apprenticeships Access Program and the provision of toolkits worth up to $800 for 34,000 new apprentices a year entering areas of trade skills shortages. There will be an extension of the living away from home allowance for new apprentices in their third year and there will be scholarships for apprenticeships in skills shortage areas. This government is absolutely committed to the provision of trade training, and to the need to upskill our work force and provide our young people and those who are going through a midlife career change with the skills they need to be productive workers into the future. We see trade skills as a vital part of our formula for the future. If you look at the members opposite, they are very retrospective in their views. They always look to what we did in the past: ‘How can we solve the problem? Let us look back to what we did in the past.' This government is very much forward focused. It is focused on the importance of trade skills and giving our young people and workers being retrained the training that they need to be vital, productive members of our work force. I certainly commend the bills to the House.",93
138,Ms HALL,NOES,"If this government were so forward thinking, why did they allow such a skills shortage to develop under their watch? They are responsible for what is happening in Australia today. It is under their watch that this chronic skills shortage has been allowed to develop. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 that we are debating in the House tonight, abolish the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, repeal the Vocational Education and Training Program Funding Act and establish a new system for Commonwealth funding of VET. The funding will be tied to statutory conditions, including the provision of AWAs and increased flexibility and competition for TAFE. We all know what ‘increased flexibility' means when this government use that term. It usually means lower wages for the workers and poorer services and educationor poorer courses as it is in this case-for Australian students. Unfortunately for Australia, this legislation is driven by a government of ideologues who are in turn driven by a philosophy that conflicts with Australia's best interests. proceed through this speech, I will point out to the House just how that is. Under the Howard government, we have seen the emergence of chronic skills shortages. These skills shortages have been well documented by industry, employers and employer groups, workers and worker organisations, as well as by a wide range of experts and studies. Yet the Howard government ignored this shortage and put our economy in jeopardy. One of the first acts of the Howard government was to slash funding to TAFE colleges. If any act could put in jeopardy the training and skills of our work force, it is the slashing of funds to TAFE. You can hardly say that that was the act of a government committed to ensuring that we have a skilled work force here in Australia. Rather, I see that as an act of a government that are opposed to the best training interests of Australians and probably opposed to the TAFE sector. Day after day we hear the minister ask in this House, ‘What's wrong with young people leaving school in year 10 and pursuing a trade?' I agree with the minister. In this liament I represent an area where there are many thousands of young people who would like to undertake an apprenticeship, gain the skills they need to be qualified tradesmen and fill some of these skills shortages. Unfortunately, under this government there is a shortage of places in our TAFEs. They are not adequately funded because of the actions of this government back in 1994. There is no commitment to the training of our work force. In an area that once boasted some of the highest levels of apprenticeships and tradesmen in Australia, it is very sad that very few of our local employers are in a position-because they do not have the support they need-to undertake apprenticeship training. I direct my criticism at some of the local government authorities and some of the electricity providers just as much as I direct As I my criticism towards the government. It is imperative that large employers make the commitment to the future of Australia by being prepared to train apprentices. As I have already said, this legislation abolishes ANTA and establishes a new system to grant financial assistance to the states and other vocational education providers. One aspect of these bills is to increase competition and flexibility in the TAFE system by the provision of Australian workplace agreements and full competency based training. I find that a very retrograde step. On 1 June, my office was visited by teachers from Belmont TAFE, my local TAFE college. They requested my support in opposing the Howard government's VET bill-the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005. I told them that I was quite happy to give them that support. They are very upset that the linked funding for states and territories has a wide range of conditions and targets for outcomes of courses. They are quite happy to be outcomes based in the provision of courses and to expand the kinds of courses that they can parprovide at this TAFE college-they have been fighting to be able to do that for some time-but they do not believe that the linkages that are outlined in this legislation will deliver the best results. I want to share with the House the issues that TAFE teachers in the Shortland electorate are concerned about. In a letter to me they have expressed concern about changes that include ‘the offering of Australian place agreements in TAFE' and ‘increasing the funds allocated to private providers under user choice arrangements'. In other words, they see this as a de facto way of further recting funds away from TAFE colleges. They are also concerned about ‘opening up public TAFE facilities to third party access'. In other words, within the same TAFE college, a private provider comes in, uses the equipment that belongs to the TAFE college to provide courses, while the TAFE college itself is not being funded to provide those courses. Once again it is pushing TAFE teachers into the background. They also mention ‘performance management systems, including performance pay for teachers', and ‘giving more authority to Institute Directors for recruitment and remuneration of employees'. This is of great concern to many of the teachers working within the system, because they see this is a way of changing the mix of skills that teachers provide to TAFE colleges and that it is a way of deskilling and lowering the level of training of tutors within the TAFE system. They also mention ‘removing the requirement in State awards for timebased training' and ‘a requirement that colleges must neither encourage nor discourage union membership'. Here in this place we have become very familiar with the government trying to do everything it can to undermine union membership, but by undermining union membership in TAFE colleges they are undermining the security and working conditions of all those people who are employed within the TAFE system. The representatives who came to my office believe that VET funding should be there to ensure that teachers in the TAFE colleges and campuses are able to effectively develop quality education for a wide range of students across a wide range of areas and that courses need to meet the needs of industry, the community and the future economy workof Australia. At a time when we have massive skill shortages it is imperative that additional funding be channelled into TAFE education in programs in all areas to develop dithese skills. The teachers see in these changes the government seeking to undermine the work of TAFE teachers, attacking their working conditions and rights and preventing their union representing them effectively in the workplace. This letter, parts of which I have shared with the House tonight, was signed by a number of teachers at the TAFE college in Belmont: Michael Salani from Redhead in my electorate, Alan Giblin from Charlestown, Trevor Eggins from Belmont, Trevor Howard from Whitebridge, Philip Mitchell from Redhead, Steve Waye from Floraville, Peter Crawford from Gateshead, Catherine Oswald from Whitebridge, Dan Miller from Jewells and Peter Morris from Valentine. I share their concerns. I hope that the government listens sympathetically to the issues that they have raised, because this legislation is a retrograde step at a time of chronic skills shortages. It is interesting to look at some of the people who are calling for more action in the area of skills. The Australian Industry Group have been one of the greatest proponents of skilling up our work force. In their report World-class skills for world-class industries: accelerating reforms to vocational education and training they say: World-class industries demand a world-class training system. In their report they highlight the shortage of skilled labour across Australia and make the point that, for some time, industry has identified this as an emerging problem. They say that the DEWR skilled vacancy index for 2003-04 demonstrated that there was going to be a skills shortage and that in some occupations vacancies could not be filled. The index showed that there had been a 21 per cent increase in vacancies in the metal trades, a 38 per cent increase in the electrical and electronic trades, a 45 per cent increase in the printing trades and a 17.9 per cent increase in construction trades. It is also appropriate to put on record that there has been an 8.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the past 12 months. In a survey done in the Hunter region, 61 companies reported a total of 805 vacancies in 2004, 85 per cent of the companies surveyed were experiencing skills shortages-that is a very significant skills shortage-and 633 vacancies were at a trade level and above. This says it all as far as I am concerned. TAFE trains our qualified tradesmen and tradeswomen and it has the runs on the board. TAFE has worked very hard and demonstrated over the years that it can train the trades people that we need in Australia. I see this legislation before us as being an attack on an institution that does not fit into the government's little box. It has been three years-going on for four now-since the emergence of a shortage of skilled labour in the Hunter, and that has impacted on the ability of the Hunter to tender for contracts, particularly in areas where a skilled work force is needed. As I have already mentioned, in 2004 there was a total of 805 skilled vacancies, with 61 employers employing 6,400 people within the Hunter region. That is a vacancy for every eight employees in the work force. There are vacancies for electricians, boilermakers, fabricators, labourers and engineers, but applicants with the right qualifications or the right skills cannot be found. The vacancy rate is higher in smaller firms-that is, firms with fewer than 30 workers-with a vacancy for every four workers. This is very significant, and it is hardly a proud record. Medium sized firms have one vacancy for every six employees; and large firms, with 100 or more employees, have one vacancy for every 10 employees. I think it is an absolute disgrace that these skills shortages have been allowed to develop, and I worry that this is going to be exacerbated by the legislation that we have before us today. Recently I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, and we did an inquiry into increasing participation in the work force. The second recommendation of the committee's report is: ... that the Australian Government in cooperation with the State and Territory governments, industry, unions and educational bodies expand programs to maximise the uptake of apprenticeships in areas of skills shortages and ensure that the training is relevant to the apprentices, the businesses and industry. The one place that training is relevant to all those people is within TAFE colleges-our great TAFE colleges, which are in each and every electorate throughout Australia. The third recommendation is: ... the Australian Government establish, as a priority, a dedicated cross-portfolio approach to develop a coordinated long-term strategy, including a series of newly funded programs and defined outcomes, to address national skills shortages. This legislation will, I think, inhibit those recommendations to some degree. What concern me are the linkages that are required in this legislation. I see it as a cost-cutting move by the government. Included in these workplace reforms is TAFE's capacity to generate revenue; TAFE will be required to develop a commercial business plan that will enable government funding to be reduced. In other words, it is all about cost cutting; it is all about taking money away from the TAFE colleges and changing the focus of the way our TAFE colleges operate. Another aspect of this legislation that I find quite concerning is the fact that the Commonwealth will have the power of veto over state and territory VET plans. Previously this process was conducted by ANTA, and now we have that power being shifted to the Commonwealth. I know that the TAFE colleges that are operated by the state and territories are very receptive to the needs of their communities. They are a lot closer to the people; they are a lot closer to the communities that they represent. They know the skills shortages that exist in their areas, and they know about the young people coming to them each year, trying to enrol in courses and being turned away. I find it appalling that the government is seeking to introduce AWAs into the TAFE system and is seeking to put in place legislation that I believe will lead to a poorer outcome for all the people in the community that I represent here in this parliament. It lead to a poorer opportunity for them to undertake the training they need to develop the skills that Australia needs to move us forward into the next century.",95
139,Mr HENRY,NOES,"It was very interesting to hear the previous opposition speaker talking to the legislation and talking about cost cutting and the impacts on TAFE colleges and their ability to deliver. I recall that in the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the budget speech he spoke about deception and suggested that there was a fair amount of deception on the government's part with respect to the growth in our economy et cetera. He should have spoken about self-deception, because I think that is the reality that we see coming from the other side of the House with respect to these matters. The future prosperity of our country and indeed the continued growth of our nation's economy depend in large part upon the availability of a skilled and flexible work force. The work force must not only be world class in terms of its quality but also be capable of meeting the needs of Australia's industry, which operates in an increasingly aggressive and volatile environment in terms of competition both at home and abroad. The resource and construction sectors are great examples of this. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the associated Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 are the vehicle for this government's new national funding arrangement for vocational education and training over the next four years to the end of December 2008. Taking into consideration the $577 million already paid to the states and territories during 2005, the legislation represents an investment by this government of nearly $5 will billion in the future of skills training and skills development for all Australians. This government's commitment to vocational and skills based training is very real. The $577 million paid this year represents an increase of $175 million over the 2004 figures and equates to an increase in real terms of 3.2 per cent, giving the lie somewhat to the words of the previous speaker. The $5 billion provided by the government builds on other vocational and training initiatives already announced by this government, which over four years will together amount to a record $10.1 billion. This is not legislation that provides funding irrespective of what outcomes might be achieved; it is in fact legislation that provides funding with strings attached. In my view this is rightly so, as those strings are tied to extremely desirable training outcomes to be achieved by the states and territories, which will benefit from the funding. Why? Because we need to ensure that the significant investment by the government produces the best possible outcomes for the people of Australia, particularly for our young people who are seeking to embark upon vocational training and for employers looking to develop their work force for the future by taking on trainees and apprentices. The legislation therefore seeks to achieve some genuine and much needed reform by requiring states and territories to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the training sector by such measures as maximising choice for trainees and employers, implementing workplace reform within TAFE and ensuring that various state awards and legislation such as the Industrial Training Act in Western Australia reflect actual competencies rather than the length of time served as an apprentice in the training system. There have been a number of attempts in Western Australia to amend or repeal the Industrial Training Act to allow apprentice training to be more responsive to the needs of employers and industry generally. The Master Builders Association of Western Australia would like to see the introduction of a trowel hand traineeship or apprenticeship as the first step in a bricklaying apprenticeship. The Industrial Training Act prevents this occurring. I call on the state minister in Western Australia to take immediate action to repeal or amend the Industrial Training Act to allow for appropriate flexibility in training arrangements to be put in place across a range of industries for the benefit of all. In this legislation, these requirements will be introduced as a condition of receiving funding, and the reforms that are needed will be supported by the bilateral agreements reached with the states and territories involved. These bilateral agreements will include specific targets and identify national priorities as well as performance levels to be achieved. No doubt the reform outlined by this legislation will have its opponents, as we have seen from speakers on the other side. For instance, I am sure that there are members on the opposition benches who will criticise the need for workplace reform within TAFE and, in particular, requirements for workplace agreements. But, with the TAFE system delivering around 85 per cent of all publicly funded training, the reality is that vocational and skill based training cannot be made more flexible or responsive without TAFE reforms and the introduction of the AWAs, creating a more responsive and flexible learning environment. Yet we have heard speaker after speaker from the opposition wanting to protect their union mates in TAFE and to continue to entrench ineffective and obsolete work practices. This legislation will help to strengthen Australia's economic base by helping to provide a highly skilled and flexible work force that will meet the future needs of Australia's industry. It will also promote a national approach to the delivery of vocational education and training that in my view will be very welcome. It will make the skills of those who have undertaken vocational training more transferable between the various states and territories involved. It seems ridiculous that in 2005, because of the state systems and the vested interests of unions, tradesmen such as carpenters, refrigeration mechanics, electricians, welders or indeed hairdressers in one state should have difficulty in having their qualifications recognised in another. Such a situation, where a hairdresser cannot move from Victoria to New South Wales because each does not recognise the skills of the other, after more than 100 years of federation, does indeed seem farcical. It is interstate rivalry taken too far. It is not in the national interest or in the interests of the Australian people to allow such a situation to continue unresolved. I am pleased that at the recent COAG meeting this seemed to be recognised by state premiers. Australian skills are in demand across the world. It therefore seems bizarre to me that a skilled worker can take his or her trade fication overseas, where Australian vocational training is recognised as being amongst the finest in the world, but that they should have difficulty transferring that skill from one state to another in their own country. A national approach with the federal government taking a leading role is needed, and the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 helps to deliver just that. The Commonwealth-state agreement that will emerge as a result of this legislation will have at its heart a strong theme of developing multilateral agreements on vocational training and qualifications between states and territories. The agreement will focus on national cooperation to deliver, in my view, a better, more integrated approach to building a skilled, flexible and mobile work force. That is important for a modern economyand for an economy which, thanks to the good management of this government, is continuing to experience strong growth and low levels of unemployment. In fact, these are the lowest levels of unemployment for some 30 years. But that growth brings with it a number of challenges, and we must not allow it to be threatened either by an unwillingness to reform workplace relations or by a lack of investment in developing the skills of the work force of tomorrow. Thankfully, this government is prepared to commit to both-unlike the opposition, which seems to have an ‘it's all too hard' policy and a lack of stomach for confronting its union mates and supporting workplace relations reform. The Leader of the Opposition argues that no further productivity gains are possible. This attitude is symbolic of a party bereft of ideas and initiatives, with no answers and no solutions other than to look at its union mates and provide protection for them. As the Australian economy continues to quali- grow and expand, so does the need for a work force that has all the skills necessary to meet the demands of industry. That the skills shortage is real should not be doubted. It is already a factor in helping to drive up wages within the construction industry within my own state of Western Australia. The skills shortage has been cited as a significant factor with the potential to slow local economies and deter developers from moving ahead with new projects. The message is further reinforced in an article that appeared on 20 May in the Australian Financial Review entitled ‘Workers in the driver's seat as skills shortage bites'. In Western Australian terms, the article highlights the fact that, with the resources and construction sectors both experiencing strong growth, skill shortages are starting to push up wages as employers compete for the finite pool of skilled labour available to them. I am delighted that this government has committed, through the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and other measures, to making such a massive investment in vocational training for young people. I also welcome this government's commitment to helping mature workers to reskill or upskill through programs designed to get people back into work as part of such schemes as the Welfare to Work initiative announced by the Treasurer during his budget speech. As part of that package the government will be offering the states around $42.6 million to create 12,300 skills training places to encourage people back into the work force, where their contribution to the economy is so badly needed. Indeed, I am greatly heartened by this government's commitment to further skilling Australia's work force through such initiatives as setting up the 24 new Australian technical colleges and extending the entitlement to Youth Allowance and Austudy to full-time apprentices. These are very welcome steps, but a sea change in attitudes towards vocational training is also necessary within the country as a whole. It is my belief that the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 will help to deliver that sea change. I look forward to the day when young people, in terms of their career aspirations, will recognise the value of vocational training as being on par with that of a university degree. The funding that is being provided through the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 is a tangible demonstration of this government's continued commitment to a robust, nationally based vocational education and training system. The bill sends a strong message to the Australian people that vocational and skills based training is valued and is indeed vital for the future prosperity of this nation. In developing this bill the government has consulted with key stakeholders and has received strong support for the direction and strong leadership for vocational training provided by this legislation. In my view, the bill provides a sound footing for taking vocational and skills based training in this country forward and for helping to tackle skill shortages in industry. These bills have my wholehearted support and I recommend them to the House.",99
140,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,NOES,"In finishing his contribution to the second reading debate on the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 the member for Hasluck made reference to the fact that there were key stakeholders involved in the process of developing these bills, which will be enacted if passed by both houses. However, one thing he failed to mentionand indeed all members of this parliament who belong to the political parties currently in government have failed to mention thisis that there has been no proper consultation with the states. This is an area where the states provide more funding than the Commonwealth. The employees of these institutions are not employed by the Commonwealth. With regard to the two major components of the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 the Commonwealth has shown an utter disregard for the states, an utter disregard for cooperation between tiers of government and an utter disregard for a collaborative approach to education and training. Earlier, in her contribution, the shadow minister made it very clear that this is a watershed. This is a watershed because it is the death knell of cooperation between genuine stakeholders who are concerned about educating and training Australians. Those stakeholders realise that there is a causal link between skill acquisition and productivity in the workplace and are concerned that those important innovations that must be brought about in this key area of public policy are done so genuinely in a collaborative manner. These two bills before us today are an assault upon states' rights. They are an assault upon what has been, for at least 13 years, a collaborative approach to training. One of the reasons that the government has chosen to do this-and this is the primary reason that the bills appear in the form they do currently-is that from 1 July the coalition will have effectively a majority in both houses of parliament. It seems to me that, given this rare occasion where a government manages to find itself in the position of having a majority in both houses, it no longer has regard for states' rights. Indeed the Prime Minister has shown his disregard for reconciling differences with the premiers and the respective state governments in relation to very important areas. The community is sick and tired of governments blaming each other in areas of public policy-blaming the states or blaming the Commonwealth for a particular failure to meet the expectations of the citizens of this country-but Labor do not believe that the best approach is to attempt to grab all of the jurisdiction in this area. As I said earlier, legislation is an extraordinary assault on the states, given that most funding in this area is in fact not provided by the Commonwealth. We are seeing the end of what has been a collaborative approach. Through the passing of these bills we will see the end of the Australian National Training Authority. I am of the view that ANTA had flaws and that it could always be improved. When I was working with and was a member of, for example, the Australian Local Government Training board and dealing with ANTA, I held the view that there were better ways in which we could be developing competencies-that is, measurements of skills. I did not always agree with the way in which ANTA approached matters, but I do not think it is right to throw the baby out with the bathwater in this area, because what we had with ANTA was a tripartite approach to vocational training to ensure that the skills of this country were suitably high for us to be able to compete globally. That was the expectation and the intention of ANTA. It did not always meet its mark, but we have been left instead with nothing. We have been left with an absence of policy to bring together the relevant stakeholders of vocational training to work out what is required by workplaces in this nation. Over the last five or more years every objective commentator has been warning this government about Australia's lack of workplace skills. There are skills we have that are currently not in demand-and that happens from time to time in an evolving economyand there are skills we do not have that are currently in demand. But the government has failed to anticipate those skill requirements and, as a result, has left us short of the skills that are required to compete internationally. Every objective commentator has remarked upon that. When listing the priorities of orthis ganisations, surveys conducted by employer bodies have found on each and every occasion that the No. 1 problem confronting employers is a lack of skills in areas of demand, in the new economies. These failures by the government are not going to be solved by bashing ANTA, by abolishing a tripartite body or by obsessing about the government's industrial relations agenda. We know that this Prime Minister and this government like to obsess about industrial relations. This government has a hatred of and an enmity for unions that has been unparalleled since Federation. Since Federation no other government has shown such contempt for the entitlement of employees to organise collectively if they so wish. Indeed, that is written in this legislation. It has again insidiously found its way into an education and training bill. It is quite remarkable. If I were to think about the minister who may have been involved in drafting this bill, I might have thought it was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I may reasonably have been mistaken and thought that this bill on education and training is a bill about industrial relations because one of the fundamental planks of this bill is a provision that will force employers in a given industry-in this case, the education sector-to offer Australian workplace agreements to their employees if they want their funding. Indeed, they will not get their funding, I would contend, if they do not accede to the provisions of this bill. That is a very serious step, even for this government. When I compare its record and its attitudes towards working people and unions, I do not compare them with those of Labor. I do not compare this government's views with our views of a fair system, which believes in tripartitism, fairness and having decent and independent umpire. To get some measure of its radical attitude and its hostility towards organised labour, I compare this government with recent coalition governments, including the Fraser government and the Menzies government. I conclude-and I am sure it is very hard for anyone to argue otherwise-that this government stands out as being one that is clearly obsessed about destroying the right of employees to collectively bargain. As has been alluded to by the shadow minister for education and other speakers on this side of the House, proposed section 12(1)(b) effectively means that all TAFEs will be forced to offer Australian workplace agreements to their staff. That is interesting, because another Commonwealth law says that, pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act, the instrument to be used to settle pute or to make an agreement is to be determined by the parties to that agreement or dispute. I am paraphrasing, but in effect the Workplace Relations Act says that it is not for third parties-not this Commonwealth government, nor indeed any other party-to compel parties to an agreement as to what agreement that would be. It does not place Australian workplace agreements above collective agreements, whether they are non-union or not. I understand the media-some deliberately, probably some unwittingly-quite often think this is an argument between the right to a collective union agreement and the right to an AWA. I am suggesting it is more than that. This is a right to choose a section 170LK agreement, which is a collective non-union agreement; a section 170LJ agreement, which is an agreement to which a union or unions are a party; or an AWA. What the legislation has never said and still does not say is that another party can bribe, compel, force or bludgeon parties to an agreementa whichever instrument they choose-into picking a certain type of agreement. This is a very unusual bill but it may well be one of many we will see this term that force parties to enter into arrangements they do not want to enter into. The Prime Minister likes to get up on his soapbox-and he is of a stature that probably makes that all the better for him-and say, ‘Third parties should not intervene in agreements between industrial parties.' But here we have a government introducing a set of bills which, if enacted, would compel another party to offer AWAs to their employees. We have a remarkable, and I would say unprecedented, situation of using education and training to force through an IR agenda. We have seen a pattern of this being foreshadowed since this parliamentary term commenced, and we have seen the same sort a disof approach mentioned by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Indeed, we have seen the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education attempting to spend Commonwealth moneys-taxpayers' money, by the way; it does not come out of their back pockets-in a way that would force people into a contract-because that is what a registered agreement effectively is that they may not want to enter into. It is a very coercive and prescriptive approach to legislation, and it will sully any positive impacts that the government may have in areas of public policy. If they are always trying to push an IR agenda in an area of policy that is not related to IR then I think they do themselves and this country an injustice. It is also important to note and to return the fundamental problems confronting this country in relation to skills. The abolition of ANTA will clearly occur as a result of the enactment of these bills. The imposition of IR dogma upon other parties will of course occur if these bills are passed. But what we need to know is: what measures are in place to meet the skills crisis we have in this country? That is what the government should be focusing on-not on what mean and tricky ways they can find to force parties into agreements but on how to fix the skill shortages. Working for Australia's future: increasing participation in the workforce was tabled in this House in March this year but has yet to be debated fully. This is a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. Much of the work of the inquiry that culminated in this report was done in the last term, and a lot of the hard work in collating the evidence and putting it together into a report was undertaken by the committee members early in this term. I have already commented on the efforts made by government members and Labor members in coming together to produce what I think is a very important document. I probably do not have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that the area where we differed was industrial relations. There were a few efforts to find ways to, as I think the government likes to call it, make ‘flexible' workplace arrangements. We know that the word ‘flexible' is pretty much a one-way street. But there are a number of areas-and I have commended the government members on this, and in particular the member for Deakin, the chair of the committee-where we agreed. Overwhelmingly, we agreed in relation to some of the problems confronting increasing participation in the work force. At to page 97 of the report, under the heading ‘Skills shortages', the committee members unanimously made a number of points. Firstly we indicated, following on from an earlier chapter: Another important trend in Australian employment has been the emergence of a number of skills shortages which place a substantial burden on the economy through lost productivity. Manpower Services (Australia) believes that Australia risks economic irrelevance in the global economy and a lower quality of life. Manpower Services was one of the witnesses we had before the inquiry. The report continues: Increasing educational participation is an important factor in increasing labour force participation. There has been an increase in the proportion of higher skilled jobs as a share of employment growth in recent years. The report goes on to state: Service industries have increased in importance to the Australian economy while the goods-related industries have decreased in importance ... In rural and regional areas, the importance of agriculture, forestry and fishing industries in particular has decreased, which means that people often need to learn new skills to remain competitive in the labour market. The report then goes through further evidence about the deficiencies of skills in this country. This is the work of 10 members of this parliament, six of whom are government members. The committee recommends: ... that the Australian Government in cooperation with the State and Territory Governments, industry, unions and educational bodies expand programs to maximise the uptake of apprenticeships in areas of skills shortages and ensure that the training is relevant to the apprentices, the businesses and the industry. Further, the report states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government establish, as a priority, a dedicated crossportfolio approach to develop a coordinated long term strategy, including a series of newly funded programs and defined outcomes, to address national skills shortages. There is not a dearth of ideas on the other side; it just seems to me that they are not able to get through the Prime Minister and through the minister's own obsession with industrial relations. If we started to embrace some of the ideas that government and Labor members have discussed in this report, it would go a long way to fix the problems we have in this country. (Time expired)",102
141,Mrs HULL,NOES,"This evening I am happy to rise to support any move to focus on training, particularly in the trades and services areas and particularly in rural and regional areas. The Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia's Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 will establish a new training system-a national training system-and put in place arrangements to ensure a high-quality, flexible and responsive system which will meet the challenges that are facing Australia today. I listened to the member for Gorton with much interest when he talked about a skills crisis. ‘Skills crisis' is the term that he Let me remind the member for Gorton and the opposition that it was the opposition's obsession with the ‘clever nation' during the time of the Hawke and Keating governments that has seen a skills shortage, particularly in rural and regional areas. Time and time again I have come into this House and heard the opposition scream about the rise in HECS fees, but there is never one word about technical college and training fees, which have increased by 300 per cent in some trades in cross-TAFEs, particularly in the Riverinaso much so that even TAFE teachers went out on strike, as I have mentioned in this House before, because they felt that it was unrealistic to see these fees increase by such an amount. Again, the kids that were undertaking these trades and services courses were paying for their training up front. In many cases, their employers were paying for their training up front. This was jeopardising any possible options that these young regional people might have had for a future that could keep them in rural and regional Australia. I have been calling for some response to the issue of the depleting skills in trades and services, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and I have been calling for this obsessiveness with higher education and academia to cease, in the interests and for the benefit of all Australian people. We need builders and tradesmen; we need electrical contractors, plumbers, fencers and concreters. We need many people to build this nation in the future. The focus on these trades and services has been lost for a long time. Finally this government has seen that the focus needs to be restored if we want to have a competive nation into the future. The new training system means that new hope and opportunity will be provided for country kids. It will be my fervent hope that our kids will no longer have to be exported to cities in order to gain an occupationused. simply because at many times our children were thought, and meant to feel, to be not worthy if they were not taking on an academic post. Ultimately they travelled to the cities to find themselves an occupation in a retail outlet or some other area where they felt they would not be ashamed to work. It is the highest honour to work in a skilled trades and services area. To hold a ticket in your chosen profession is something that we should look up to. We should certainly aspire to having a tradesman's certificate. That is the way in which this nation will continue to be built. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education spoke of the importance of building on the success of our national industry led training system. It is essential to deliver skilled workers to our rural industries and to experience economic growth that we all want now and into the future. The only way that we can do this is to train and secure trades and services in our young people-and in mature aged apprenticeships and training. People are never too old to learn a new trade. I have seen many people in my electorate who have retrained in a trade and who are thoroughly enjoying not only the success of retraining but also financial success in a trades and services area. It is a vital investment for our social prosperity, particularly in rural and regional areas, and it is also a vital component of the survival of many small communities. It is also required in our larger communities, because many of our larger cities-regional cities-are finding it very difficult to provide the work forces to build and grow their population in order to assist the smaller communities that have become dependent on the larger regional centres. For rural and regional communities it is true that a sustainable community depends on a healthy local economy and access to services, including training services. The new national training system will support this in a variety of ways. In particular, it support it through its new structure for channelling industry leadership and engagement in line with the national agenda. As part of the new system, a national industry skills committee will be established to provide the Ministerial Council on Vocational and Technical Education with highlevel advice on key issues such as work force planning and future training priorities. It is pleasing to see that the membership of this committee will include a range of peak employer groups, including none other than the National Farmers Federation. The National Farmers Federation oversees a huge industry providing agricultural opportunities and employment. This is an exciting industry that is all too often forgotten-never taught and never exposed in our education system. It is exciting to see prospects for employment and careers in our agricultural industry. It is great to see that the National Farmers Federation will ensure that these agricultural and rural and regional issues are represented at the highest level in this new national training system. Industry skills councils will also be maintained, under the new arrangements, as sources of expert industry advice in the development of training packages and skills forecasting. The agrifood industry, one that my electorate relies on enormously, will have the Agri-Food Industry Skills Council-one of 10 industry skills councils that will provide specific advice on a range of regional and rural industries, including farming and meat, seafood and other food production. This will ensure that training courses are relevant to the workplace, whether that workplace be out in a paddock, in a saleyard, at a local cannery, at the local abattoirs, in the local food production chain or in any other rural industry. It is very valuable and very worthwhile-particularly in those rural areas such as the Riverina, where agrifood will industries dominate much of our growth and much of our prosperity-and it is good to see that the interests of these industries will be taken into consideration through the AgriFood Industry Skills Council. The Australian government has a number of important initiatives that support the training needs of our rural and regional communities. These include the National Skills Shortages Strategy, which will address the needs of regional communities. Under this strategy the Australian government will continue to work with industry, education providers and communities to profile existing and potential industries in a region; to identify common skills, training needs and solutions; and to pilot practical strategies which could be used in many regions right across Australia. I have seen an enormous increase in the number of our community representatives outside capital cities undertaking training over the last few years. It has been a dramatic increase; we now have over 39 per cent of students in training. I recall at one stage giving an address to the motor vehicle industry and being extraordinarily proud of the incentives that were being offered by the government to ensure that trades and services, particularly in the motor vehicle industry, were getting the support-not only in dollars-that the industry leaders and business owners required to continue their training of apprentices in order for them to become fullyfledged tradesmen that would keep the motor vehicle industry functional. It is not until you have nobody to repair a smashed motor vehicle, an engine that has broken down or air conditioning units that have broken down, or until there are no electrical engineers around, that you realise the value of trades and services. I include in that truck driving. One thing we find in this nation is the undervaluing of our truck drivers. Too many times, I feel, truck drivers are taken for granted. Hopefully these new skills and trades areas will recognise the absolute need to focus on and concentrate on being able to relieve the shortage of truck drivers into the future. It is an enormously skilled vocation and profession, one that you should be very proud of being involved in. Without truck drivers doing the daily grind and the daily tasks that they do 24 hours a day, this nation would come to a standstill, an absolute halt. Something that is not recognised enough in this House or outside is the major role that truck drivers play in the economy of Australia every single day. It is great to see that more of our students are currently undertaking training than ever before, particularly compared to the 13 years of life under Labor's rule. People in rural regional areas have significantly increased their participation in new apprenticeships, and we now have more than 150,000 places, compared with around 54,000 places in 1995, just prior to this government coming into play in 1996. Things have moved a long way. With absolute dedication and commitment to the task, we have seen the recognition of the true professions in trades and services right across Australia starting to get the respect that they should have been receiving in all of the previous years. They have now been put back on the agenda, and it is a great feeling to stand here and to laud the professions and to espouse the benefits of having a trade certificate-it does not matter in what area you choose to be a tradesman. I have said time and again in this House that it is these tradespeople who will be the futurenot just the builders of the nation but the economic players in the nation, because, by gee, you will need to start to pay tradesmen a lot of money in the very near future because otherwise you simply will not get anybody to come and build houses, workplaces or a whole host of different areas, because they simply will not be available. I congratulate the Howard-Anderson government for their continued commitment to regional areas. They have put in place additional incentives for employers in rural and regional Australia who commence a new apprentice in an occupation experiencing skills shortages. They have also established the Australian technical colleges, which will deliver additional training facilities and opportunities in many regional areas that are experiencing skills needs and which also have higher rates of youth unemployment. I would desperately love to have one of those technical colleges established in the western Riverina, and I have constantly put my hand up for the western Riverina to be considered for a technical training college. I think it is a and perfect environment and a perfect setting to establish such a college, to ensure that the vibrancy of the Riverina region is continued. It is a strong, vibrant community, experiencing the ravaging effects of the worse drought in 100 years. But still, week after week, we open new businesses with consumer confidence and business confidence in our communities. They are not going to lie down and be defeated by the elements of nature; they are going to get up and continue to try to survive in these very difficult times. My western Riverina area around Griffith and Leeton would be a perfect place to establish a technical college, as I said, to ensure the vibrancy of the agricultural industry, the production area and the many manufacturing industries established there. Only a few weeks ago, I had the good fortune to open a climate house in Wagga Wagga; it was from Celi Melmat. Ted Celi and his family have taken enormous steps of growth in a holistic air conditioning approach. It was just amazing to see the confidence that this family has to continue to contribute to regional Australia. The majority of their employment is in rural and regional areas and certainly there also some significant employment in Adelaide. It was brilliant to see somebody who had started in their backyard working on refrigeration units and then expanded with such confidence into the community, while continuously training people in this very valuable area. The western Riverina is a great area in which to have a technical college and I hope that at some stage we will be able to secure such a college. The government will also continue to provide funding to our schools, our industry groups and our Indigenous organisations to develop or refurbish vocational and technical education facilities, including those many mobile training units that get out and about in rural and regional areas. Since 1995, nearly 200 training facilities have been established or redeveloped by this government in rural and regional areas. This is an extremely significant and important outcome, as I have said, for the social prosperity and invigoration of our communities. Not only are more people able to access quality training locally without having to go off to the city to determine a future vocation but also these industries are being better supported and our regional and rural economies are being sustained. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I support this Howard-Anderson government, which single-handedly has reinvigorated vocational and technical education after it had not been on the agenda for a significant number of years. It is so pleasing to see the numbers now participating in vocational and technical education. They have grown from 1.27 million in 1995 to 1.72 million nowan increase of around 35 per cent. Those increases can be seen because you can observe people who are out there employing trainees and apprentices and taking them through to fulfilment of their trade certificates. We need a more responsive and flexible is training system. We need to deliver higher quality and nationally consistent qualifications, regardless of whether our training is in rural and regional Australia or in a capital city. In this legislation, it is good to see that regional areas have not been forgotten. Through these bills, the government can really drive genuine reform to achieve the capacity and ability that for so long rural and regional people have been crying out for. It is true that the interests of our regional industries will be well represented under these new arrangements. I give great support to this legislation. I commend the Howard-Anderson government and the minister on their attention to what certainly is very meaningful, in particular to my area, the Riverina, and in general to rural and regional people and communities.",106
142,Mr HAYES,NOES,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to support Labor's amendments to the Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005 and cognate bill. These bills, being considered as a package, abolish the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, and establish a new system to grant financial assistance to states and terriing tories for vocational education and training. In the light of our growing skills shortage and this government's desperate attempt to paper over the cracks of its serious lack of investment in education and training by increasing skilled migration, this package, on the face of it, may seem to be reasonable. Over the next few years, the government will contribute $4.4 billion to fund the states and territories-and the minister uses terms such as ‘high-quality', ‘flexible' and ‘responsive' to describe the brave new world of funding-for vocational education and training. Again, on the face of it, it sounds reasonable. However, like always, the devil is in the detail, and it is the detail that I am concerned about. Before turning my concerns to a number of statutory conditions attached to the allocatorate tion of financial assistance, I will provide some insight into my history and experience with the vocational education and training sector and, in particular, the Australian National Training Authority. It is important ANTA's significant achievements are not ignored in this debate. Considerable achievements in reform of Australia's vocational education and training have occurred over the last decade and a half. The Hawke government recognised that Australia needed to build its skilled work force if it was to maintain its competitiveness in the global economy. Reforms in vocational education and training were driven by ANTA to assist with the achievement of democratised skill recognition-a scheme of national and portable qualifications, which are now within the reach of every worker in every occupation and industry-the provision of learning and development pathways for all workers from entry level to managerial and professional ranks, equipping workers with the skills needed to remain competitive and encouragflexibility and responsiveness in TAFE and other VET providers to meet the needs of industry and of the students.",110
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The debate is interrupted. The honourable member will have the right to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed. NA,110
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Lo Family",110
145,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I take the opportunity in the adjournment debate this evening to raise the case of the plight of the Lo family, who live in my elecof Throsby. Edward and Carol Lo arrived in this country in September 1989 from Hong Kong. They have two children, Lawrence and Langland, who were both born here and are Australian citizens. These two that children are facing the prospect of being separated from their Chinese parents, who are now facing the possibility of deportation by this government to Hong Kong. The parents came to Australia believing they faced possible persecution due to their involvement in protest activities aimed at the Chinese government. Their applications made for protection visas have so far been declined. As far back as July 2003, I wrote to the then immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, requesting reconsideration of the Los' application to be granted residency in Australia. Almost two years later, on 6 May 2005, another minister, Minister MCGauran, advised me that he had declined to exercise his powers under the legislation to allow the parents to remain in Australia with their two children. It took two years before I received an official reply. One might ask: what is going on in the immigration department? It is certainly a question many are asking in the community. Subsequent to the receipt of his letter, met with the minister here in Canberra on 31 May, urging his reconsideration of the plight of this family. I told the minister that I found it very disturbing that two children, Australian citizens who know no other home but Australia, were now faced with two unacceptable options: either be sent to Hong Kong with their parents or remain in Australia, as 10and 12-year-olds, without their parents. I urged the minister to exercise his discretion under the act and allow the Los to remain as a family unit in Australia. The issue now is not just about the rights and wrongs of the parents' actions over the past 16 years. The issue now confronting the government is about two children who are being punished for doing nothing wrong. I submitted further material for the minister's consideration on 9 June. This material included an open letter signed by a range of significant local church leaders, including the Anglican and Catholic bishops in Wollongong, and a petition organised by Reverend Lukins from the Los' church, the Dapto Uniting Church. This petition was signed by some 1,500 local people in the short space of three days. As well, this further information to the minister provided an assessment from a clinical psychologist reporting on the adverse impacts of this government's hard hearted decision with regard to these two young boys. In that submission to the minister, I requested that he agree to meet with a small group of local representatives, including Reverend Lukins from the Uniting Church in Dapto. Again that request for ministerial intervention failed. His office advised me last Friday: ‘The minister will not be intervening.' This minister's response shocked and saddened many in my community who have been touched by the plight of the Lo family. I We certainly have not given up hope. I have again asked the minister to exercise the discretion that is available to him under the legislation and, as an act of compassion, at least allow the children's mother, Carol Lo, to remain in Australia with her children until such time as they finish their schooling and turn 18. I sent that letter to Minister MCGauran on Friday the 10th and to date no official reply has been received. I want to conclude by quoting Reverend Lukins: In recent times, as a nation we have expressed a desire for the authorities in Bali to show compassion and mercy to an Australian citizen found guilty of drug trafficking. Yet now in Australia we have two Australian citizens ... who find themselves trapped in a situation not even of their own doing at all. Surely it is in the interests of these two young Australian citizens and of our whole nation that the government act mercifully and compassionately towards them. (Time expired) Mrs Kerrie Nairn",110
146,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.05 pm)-Regularly members in this House rise to speak, quite appropriately, about the contribution that particular constituents who have passed away have made to the community. Tonight I rise to do just that, but in this circumstance the constituent was also my wife, Kerrie. As most members may be aware, Kerrie passed away peacefully at home on the evening of 26 May. She was first diagnosed with advanced cancer just two days before last Christmas. Unfortunately, the chemotherapy she undertook over a 2½-month period did not do the job we had hoped. However, I stress that she received excellent medical assistance over the period of her illness. Sometime in the future I may speak further on the subject of her illness and associated issues. Kerrie was a remarkable woman who added enormous value to the work I did in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. That was an additional, unpaid job that she did not choose. She was a professional speaker, a corporate MC and author. But she was also a wonderful mother to our children, Ben and Deborah. As I said at the celebration of Kerrie's life last Friday week, she had also been my business partner, my travelling companion, my confidante, my closest adviser and my mate. Throughout her life she was also a teacher, an entrepreneur and a businesswoman. She was a highly creative and innovative person, particularly when it came to business. When our children were going to school she wanted a situation where she could be at home when they were home from school. She said, ‘That's easily fixed. I'll just create a business that I can work from home,' and she went about doing it. She did not talk about it. She did not go out looking for support or various other things; she just did it. And she did it quite remarkably, creating quite a number of businesses, including a business that won many national awards for marketing and sales. I think she learned a huge amount through that process. This was in the days when home based businesses were not thought of. I think she was a real pioneering woman in developing that sort of lifestyle so that the children could be looked after as well as having her own professional needs satisfied. The culmination of many of those businesses was a book that she wrote a few years ago called Up for Grabs, which was about business creativity. I still pick that up occasionally and read parts of it. Every time. I do read it, even though I read it over and over again as an extra editor for it at the time, I find new little nuances that I did not really pick up before, which is certainly very useful. One of the things that Kerrie did was instigate some dinners at our place on the odd Wednesday night. A number of members in this House came along to those. She instigated that because she felt very privileged by the fact that I could go home at night when parliament sat. It is a matter that I really did not fully appreciate myself until the former member for Isaacs, who tragically passed away, used to say to me constantly, ‘You are so lucky that you go home at night.' While I spend a lot of time away from home when parliament is not sitting, it was an aspect that Kerrie really appreciated. That is why she instigated those dinners. Can I put on the record tonight my thanks for the wonderful support I have had from colleagues from all sides of this House, not only over the last five months but particularly in the last few weeks. That support has been superb. I particularly thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their kind words a couple of weeks ago, in particular the Leader of the Opposition's phone call of apology when an unfortunate press release arrived at a similar time to Kerrie's passing. I also thank the many members who came to her celebration. It really was a celebration of her life, and I thank them for that support. On behalf of my children, Ben and Deb, we thank everybody, particularly my staff, for the wonderful support that they have given over the last five months and the last couple of weeks. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Neighbourhood Watch",111
147,Mrs ELLIOT,ADJOURNMENT,"Richmond) (9.10 pm)May I, firstly, extend my condolences to the member for Eden-Monaro. That was a very moving tribute to Kerrie. I rise tonight to pay tribute to the fantastic work of the local Neighbourhood Watch groups within my community. There are 19 Neighbourhood Watch organisations throughout Richmond, including Tweed Heads Central; Tweed Heads West; Bilambil area; West Banora Point; Palm Lakes Resort; Terranora; Kingscliff; Fingal, which is just starting up again as a Neighbourhood Watch area; Murwillumbah; Murwillumbah Area 14; Condong, Nunderi and Keilvale; Tumbulgum; Chillingham; Bayside; Wardrop Valley; Pottsville; Billinudgel; Casuarina; and Flame Tree Park. They are ably led by local district coordinator and volunteer in policing, Gordon Levenson, and Senior Constable Stuart Crawford. As a former police officer, I know the value of Neighbourhood Watch. During my time in the police I assisted in setting up Neighbourhood Watch programs and spent a great deal of time meeting with Neighbourhood Watch groups. The program involves the police working closely with volunteers to prevent crime. These volunteers are instrumental in minimising the incidence of preventable crime, increasing the incidence of reporting crime to the police, improving the level of personal and household security, encouraging people to engrave their property for ease of identification if stolen and improving the relationship between local police and the community. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending the meeting of the West Banora Point Neighbourhood Watch group. Like the other groups in Richmond, they are community minded people who are committed to keeping their neighbourhoods safe. Senior Constable Murray Baker from Tweed police came along and gave a very informative talk on local youth crime and police efforts to address concerns of local residents. Having worked in juvenile justice as well, I know that this is possibly one of the most challenging areas of law enforcement. Senior Constable Baker made himself available to the Neighbourhood Watch meeting to discuss their concerns fully. I congratulate both him and the local area command on the work they are doing to address youth crime in our community. It was wonderful to attend their meeting and listen to their views on community safety and crime prevention. In conjunction with other groups, they are distributing a newsletter with important safety information. It is vital that the wider community is kept informed and stays alert to the incidence of crime. I know that local police regularly attend Neighbourhood Watch meetings and that their contribution is greatly valued by the local community. Recently, Tweed/Byron local area command held a community safety forum in Tweed Heads. I was pleased to attend along with 60 people from local Neighbourhood Watch groups and the general community. Local area commander Tim Tarlington was on hand to answer questions and hear the views of the community. It was a fantastic initiative and gave me and our local police an opportunity to hear about community concerns. I congratulate all of those involved. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the local proprietors of the Good Guys. Their support of Neighbourhood Watch in our area is vital to keeping this important community organisation up and running. Through their Tweed Heads South store they are selling ultraviolet pens that can be used to mark personal property. Properly marking property can be vital in making sure that any recovered stolen property is returned to its rightful owner. Any profits made from the sale of these pens goes to supporting local Neighbourhood Watch groups. I encourage people to support Neighbourhood Watch and help protect their property by using one of these special pens to mark their TVs, videos, DVD players and stereos. I know from my time in the police that having properly marked property can lead to identifying that property if it is stolen and later recovered. is wonderful that the community is right behind this initiative and that local businesses are assisting as well, in conjunction with the police. Our local police do a fantastic job and I know that they are committed to working closely with the community. But they simply cannot be everywhere. That is why Neighbourhood Watch is so important and why I have taken this time to recognise its efforts. I know from my time in the police, seeing Neighbourhood Watch groups grow, how effective they can be and how important they are in the community in keeping an eye on what is happening within the neighbourhood. I encourage anyone who is interested in community safety to join their Neighbourhood Watch group and become involved locally to keep their community safe. Water Recycling",113
148,Mr TURNBULL,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Thursday at 3 pm Sydney's dams were less than 39 per cent full. Decades of neglect of our water infrastructure and decades of complacency have brought our greatest city to the point where it could literally and imminently run out of water. The state Labor government has delighted in talking about green issues and climate changetalking, talking, talking, but doing nothing except practise the art of spin and selfdelusion. The water plan put forward by the New South Wales Labor government last year assumed that the sustainable yield of Sydney's dams was 600 billion litres. That is already six per cent lower than the current demand. By 2025, it will be 38 per cent less than that demand. But that assumed yield itself is based on a fallacy. It is based on a century's average rainfall and run-off. Yet we know from the National Climate Centre that rainfall in Sydney in the last five years has It been 20 per cent less than it was in the 30 years to 1990. We know that the reduction in run-off tends to be twice the reduction in rainfall. So it is no surprise that in the last five years there has been roughly a halving of run-off into our dams because of this drop in rainfall-a decline seen right across southern Australia. In other words, the assumed sustainable yield from our dams is almost certainly a false assumption. Sydney Water's solutions seem to be limited to praying for rain, lowering the level of the pumps at Warragamba so the dams can be pumped completely dry, praying for rain again, plundering more water from the Shoalhaven where the locals are already up in arms, finally doing a rain dance and then talking-but just talking-about desalination. But the most obvious and compelling answer is the one which has been resolutely ignored: recycling. Right now, 450 billion litres, 75 per cent of Sydney's annual water usage, is flushed out to sea after minimal if any treatment. This has always been environmentally irresponsible, but it is also a colossal waste of water. Sydney recycles less than three per cent of its waste water. Sydney Water is Australia's leading polluter. It dumps more than seven times the amount of primary sewage into the ocean than any other water utility in Australia. Yet all of that water could and should be recycled. Recently I visited Israel's largest waste water recycling plant, a simple operation at Shaf Dan which recycles 125 billion litres of sewage a year. The resultant grade A water is used for irrigation and other non-drinking uses. While in Israel, I also visited the world's largest desalination plant. It was common ground there that the cost of recycling is about half the cost of desalination. To the Israelis it was blindingly obvious that the first measure to be undertaken was recycling waste water; that is why they recycle 70 per cent of their waste water. Of course they are not alone-recycling is common and increasing in the United States, Canada and Europe, almost everywhere in the world except Sydney. The big question, the big mystery, is: why is Sydney Water turning its back on recycling? Many would say it is because recycling has been championed by a private company, Services Sydney, which the New South Wales government has sought to obstruct at every stage of its effort to compete with Sydney Water and so disturb that lucrative state government cash cow. A desalination plant is talked about as though it is something which can be set up and used only when other sources of water run short. The Israeli plant I visited had a capital cost of $A250 million. It will produce about 100 billion litres, less than 20 per cent of Sydney's demand. The idea that a $A250 million plant could be set up and then only run when conditions require it is ludicrous. Once an investment on that scale is made there will be an irresistible economic imperative to operate the plant continuously. I read today the guidelines for the Water Smart Australia program administered by the Australian government water fund. I noted that one of its objectives is that by 2015, Australia will have ‘reduced ocean outfalls through greater reuse and recycling of water'. There is nowhere in Australia where there is a greater need for the realisation of this objective than Sydney. National Infrastructure",114
149,Ms GRIERSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to discuss the critical task, both for my electorate of Newcastle and for the nation as a whole, of investing in our national infrastructure. In particular, I would like to remind the House of John Anderson's recent comments that Newcastle's Port Waratah was ‘our premier coal exporting port' and an example of ‘very good practice.' I could not agree more, though I am surprised to hear praise for our region from a Howard government minister. Newcastle is more used to having its university kicked by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and having its ASIC office closed by the Treasurer, so Minister Anderson's praise is rare but certainly warranted. It has been a continuous effort for almost 200 years to turn Newcastle Harbour from a shallow estuary into one of Australia's major deepwater ports. It has involved among other things the state government reclaiming and merging six islands to make Kooragang Island-a deepwater access complex that now hosts many major exporters. This continuous effort was enhanced by the $700 million spent by Port Waratah Coal Services Ltd to expand export capacity between 1992 and 2002, the $500 million announced by the state government for a third coal loader and the port authority's plans for increasing the channel depth. This continuous effort now sees around 900 ships loaded each year with a total of 82 million tonnes of coal, making Port Waratah Australia's largest coal export facility-an outcome achieved in spite of capacity constraints in the coal chain and the huge growth in demand. When demand outstripped capacity, a Port Waratah Coal Services' quota proposal was approved by the ACCC so that all coal exporters could share equitably in access to the port. The Hunter Valley Coal Chain Logistics Team achieved a 20 per cent increase in throughput by system planning the movement of coal from the mine to the port. Our local approach is successful because of the cooperative culture that has existed for many years between all regional stakeholders: Port Waratah Coal Services; the mining, maritime and transport unions; Pacific National; Queensland Railways; coalmine owners and operators; stevedores; Newcastle Port Corporation; and the port users group. Now that the federal government has finally located our port on the map, $270 million from its Australian Rail Track Corporation and additional rolling stock investment by Pacific National and Queensland Railways will hopefully increase rail capacity to 102 million tonnes per annum to meet the expanded capacity of the port terminal by 2006. However, with local opinion suggesting that it will take more than $270 million to finance the rail bottlenecks, it remains to be seen whether there will be anything left in the federal treasure chest to properly fund the job. This government's neglect of its responsibilities is clear when you consider that its share of public infrastructure investment has dropped from 56 per cent in 1998 to 30 per cent this year or when you consider recent estimates that Australia now needs $25 billion worth of investment in infrastructure to make up for that neglect. It is a shame that, having been woken from its nine-year slumber by criticism from every credible economic organisation in the land, this government's only response has been to try a hostile federal take-over of the nation's ports. But would you hand control of your best practice port to a bunch of pirates more intent on plundering than on building for the future? No way. Minister Anderson is right to think that Port Waratah works well, but he is wrong if he thinks his flattery can hide the fact that he has sailed too late into this debate for anyone to take him seriously. If the government were serious about emulating Newcastle's success at other ports around the nation and about tackling our nation's other critical infrastructure needs, it would actually get involved in some real consultation and some real investment. I do not mean the kind of investment that depends-like ‘Admiral' Nelson's flagpoles or ‘Captain' Costello's GST loot, or Howard's IR reform-on marching in step with the government's ideological agenda. Labor's approach complements what has worked in Newcastle. It actually involves real consultation with the states and industry and it actually invests real money. Labor's Infrastructure Australia, an independent statutory authority, would, in partnership with state, territory and local governments and the private sector, develop a blueprint for our future infrastructure needs. Labor would provide real investment through the establishment of Building Australia, an intergenerational fund to enhance the productivity of our economy through investment in priority infrastructure projects. This country desperately needs Labor's national leadership on infrastructure planning-not the kind of adhoc infrastructure piracy attempted by Minister Anderson when he last sailed into Newcastle harbour.

151,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"In the member for Perth's electorate-absolutely. For nearly 20 years I was involved with, and a strong supporter of, WorldSkills Australia, a not-for-profit, independent organisation whose mission it is to far promote excellence in vocational training, at which they excel. At its heart, WorldSkills Australia acts to match the skills provided by vocational education and training providers with the current and future needs of employers and industry. It does so through the provision of exciting and innovative skills based training that challenges and inspires our young people-a program of skills competition that is organised at a state, national international level. Indeed, I was very pleased to see the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, farewell 25 highly skilled young Australians who have excelled in their chosen trade who were off to compete in the 38th WorldSkills International Competition in Helsinki, Finland. Team Australia competed in some 20 trade categories including welding, bricklaying, plumbing, painting and decorating, refrigeration, cabinetmaking and hairdressing. This international skills competition was held from 25 May to 1 June. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to extend my congratulations to all of those young men and women who so ably and professionally represented Australia. Team Australia excelled at the 38th International WorldSkills Competition. Team Australia walked away from Helsinki with three gold medals, two bronze medals and 15 medallions of excellence. Australia was awarded ‘Best Performing English Speaking Nation' and retained our ninth place out of the 43 member countries of International WorldSkills Competition. Gold medals were awarded to: Jeremy Gransden, New South Wales, for welding; Jarrad Langdon, New South Wales, web design; and Robert Peel, Victoria, Andrew Moore, Tasmania and Brent Butler, New South Wales, for the manufacturing team challenge. Bronze medals were awarded to: Craig Dearden, New South Wales, for restaurant service and Thomas Walton, New South Wales, for cookery. Medallions of excellence were awarded to: Rebecca Lord, New South Wales, for IT software applications; Anthony Micari, New South Wales, wall and floor tiling; David Robilliard, New South Wales, plumbing; Ben Page, Queensland, electrical installations; Jared Boyle, Queensland, industrial control; Kris Laws, New South and Wales, cabinetmaking; Daniel Collings, Queensland, automotive technology; Jonathon Balfour and Simon Mudd, Victoria, landscape construction; Hayden Caine, Tasmania, refrigeration; and Michael Shankster, New South Wales, graphic design. Jarrad Langdon was also awarded the ‘Best of the Nation' for Australia. In anyone's language, it was a fantastic effort and a great performance by these highly skilled and capable young Australians. They are a great credit to themselves, their employers, their trainers and to Australia. I am very pleased that the Australian government provided some $175,000 to WorldSkills to assist the team to compete in Helsinki. This was in addition to the $750,000 recently approved for WorldSkill's operations for 200506. WorldSkills Australia has announced their intention to bid for the 2011 International WorldSkills Competition. I look forward to the Australian government and all Australians supporting this bid. I had the pleasure of attending one such international competition that was held in St Gallen, Switzerland, in 2003. The 37th WorldSkills competition was all about 1,500 young people from 38 countries coming together to test their vocational skills against each other in an atmosphere of friendly competition. It attracted over 180,000 spectators. In the words of Mr Pascal Couchepin, chairman of the 2003 WorldSkills Patronage Committee: Young people's sound vocational training is an indispensable pre-requisite for a competitive economy and a country's prosperity. Today's solidly trained apprentices are tomorrow's experts; they constitute a link between the generations. He also coined the phrase: ‘A trade in hand finds gold in every land.' Of course, he is absolutely right, particularly in resource rich Western Australia. WorldSkills Australia has over many years carried out an exemplary job in providing an opportunity for young Australian men and women to showcase their skills locally and internationally.
