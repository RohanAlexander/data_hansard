6,Ms GILLARD,MIGRATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workor ethplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.03 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to reintroduce a bill to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent national body whose role will be to improve occupational health and safety (OHS) outcomes and workers' compensation arrangements across Australia. This bill is being reintroduced because I am obligated under an intergovernmental agreement to use my best endeavours to deliver Safe Work Australia in the same terms as the intergovernmental agreement. The bill is also being reintroduced to normalise the operational arrangements for Safe Work Australia and to establish these arrangements under statute. In July 2008, for the first time in the tory of our federation, governments from each state and territory and the Commonwealth formally committed to the harmonisation of occupational health and safety legislation through an intergovernmental agreement. The Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety commits the Commonwealth and all states and territories to the adoption of the approved model legislation and, in a demonstration of the new spirit of cooperation, the agreement also vides that the body to progress the harmonisation of occupational health and safety and workers' compensation arrangements, Safe Work Australia, will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The government set itself the important task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. Occupational health and safety is a key area requiring regulatory reform. Tragically, more than 260 Australians are killed each year at work. Many more die as a result of work-related disease. Each year over 135,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy has been estimated at $57.5 billion per year. Obviously, the cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends is beyond measure. As I have previously stated in the House, Safe Work Australia will be an inclusive, tripartite body comprised of 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two representing the interests of employers and the CEO. The members will be supported by the CEO and staff who together, will form a hisstatutory agency under the Public Service Act. The body will be subject to Commonwealth governance regimes and will be a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in realising the government's commitment and the commitment of all state and territory governments to work together to achieve harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws. It will have the important task of developing the model Occupational Health and Safety Act, model regulations and pro- model codes of practice for approval by workplace relations ministers. Safe Work Australia will also take forward the initiatives of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to streamline and harmonise workers compensation arrangements. The government sought to have this bill passed last year but three times the Liberal Party proposed unacceptable amendments to this bill. The Liberal Party stood firmly in the way of this crucial reform, reform which the business community has demanded of governments across the country for over two decades. When I took the extraordinary step of laying this bill aside late last year I said that the Liberal Party were economic vandals. I do not retreat from that view. The Liberal opposition continually stands in the way of this government's efforts to achieve a reform that will significantly advance a seamless national economy. You ask yourself: why this economic vandalism? Is it because they talked about this reform for 10 years but could never achieve it or is it simply because they just do not understand the magnitude of the risk that the global recession presents to Australia's economic well-being? In the face of this opposition the government has not been idle. The important task of harmonising occupational health and safety has continued. With my state and territory colleagues on the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council, we have administratively established the Safe Work Australia Council and have asked the council to commence drafting the model occupational health and safety legislation. Despite the default position tion to oppose all government efforts to improve Australia's productivity and to assist the economy, we are still on track to deliver uniform occupational health and safety legislation by the end of 2011. States, territories, employers, workers and their families understand the importance of a single occupational health and safety system for Australia. They understand that the reform of occupational health and safety and workers compensation is too important to be stymied by the opposition any longer. They understand that workers' lives and the efficiency of our economy are at stake. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect lives and health of Australians. This reform is clearly good for business, good for workers, and importantly good for the national economy when every ounce of effort by Australian businesses and workers is vitally important. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA (NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT) AMENDMENT BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Albanese. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
7,Mr ALBANESE,NATION BUILDING PROGRAM,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.11 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) of the opposi- Amendment Bill 2009. It renames the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005 (the principal act), as the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. This bill is central to the effective delivery of the government's road and rail infrastructure investment through the Nation Building Program-a program currently worth more than $26 billion. In New South Wales we are investing over $8.7 billion through the Nation Building Program. We are making a record investment in the Pacific Highway which will see a range of projects delivered, including: The Ballina bypass; the upgrade to the the Sapphire to Woolgoolga section; the Banora Point deviation; the Bulahdelah bypass and the Glenugie upgrade. We are also investing in the Hume Highway to finalise its duplication by 2012. The final work on the Hume Highway is the construction of the bypasses at Tarcutta, Woomargama and Holbrook. Due to the funding the government brought forward in its December 2008 nation-building package, the Tarcutta and Woomargama bypasses will commence earlier and be completed in late 2011-more than six months ahead of schedule. The Holbrook bypass is scheduled for completion by 2012. Further projects in New South Wales include: - the Alstonville bypass on New South Wales's mid-North Coast. - the duplication of the Great Western Highway from the M4 at Penrith to Katoomba. - the upgrade of the Great Western Highway between Katoomba and Lithgow. - a package to improve road and rail ac- cess in Port Botany. - an investment towards freight rail upgrades between Sydney and Newcastle-a future northern Sydney freight link - Works on the Geelong Ring Road Stage - An investment towards a new intermodal facility at Moorebank In Queensland we are investing $7.3 billion through the Nation Building Program We are investing in the Pacific Motorway, including the Daisy Hill to Springwood South upgrade, the Robina and Varsity Lakes interchanges and the Nerang South interchange. We are making a record investment in the Ipswich Motorway, including the upgrade between Dinmore to Goodna, Wacol to Darra and the Logan interchange. Our record investment in the Bruce High- way includes: - The upgrade of the southern approach to Cairns - The Douglas arterial duplication - The Cardwell Range realignment - The work on the Townsville port access road - The upgrade of the southern approach to Mackay - The Calliope crossroads upgrade - The upgrading of the southern approaches to Gin Gin - The upgrade of Cooroy to Curra (section B) - The upgrade of Caboolture to Caloundra. In Victoria we are investing a record $4.3 billion through the Nation Building Program. Projects in Victoria include: The Western Ring Road upgrade - The West Gate Bridge strengthening - Works on the Princes Highway East between Traralgon and Sale 4A (Anglesea overpass) Works on the Geelong Ring Road Stage 4B (Anglesea Road to Princes Highway) Realignment of Anthony's Cutting on the Western Highway - Duplication from Ballarat to Stawell on the Western Highway - Upgrade between Stawell and the South Australian border on the Western Highway - The Nagambie Bypass on the Goulburn Valley Highway The Kings Road interchange on Calder Freeway - The rail upgrades at Geelong Port and on the Melbourne-Adelaide line - Funding towards the Dandenong Intermodal Terminal - Funding towards the Somerton Intermodal Terminal - The duplication of the Princes Highway from Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea - The upgrade of the Springvale Road intersection - The Clyde Road upgrade In Western Australia we are investing $2.8 billion through the Nation Building Program. Projects include: - Works on the Great Eastern and Roe Highway interchange - The upgrade of the Great Eastern Highway from Kooyong Road to Tonkin Highway - Works on the Bunbury Port Access and Outer Ring Road - The duplication of Dampier Highway - Works on the Mandurah Entrance Road - Works on the Reid Highway and Alexander Drive Interchange - Works on the Esperance Port Access Road - The Daddo Road grade separation - The extension of Hepburn Avenue - Works on the Ocean Reef Road In South Australia we are investing $1.7 bil- lion through the Nation Building Program.

Projects include: - The Brighton Bypass - Rail capacity improvements at Rhyndaston - Planning for Bagdad Bypass and new Bridgewater Bridge - Upgrade of the Midland Highway - Work to improve capacity on the main north-south rail line - The Kingston Bypass - The upgrade of north-east freight roads - The upgrade of Illawarra Link Road In the Northern Territory we are investing over $580 million through the Nation Building Program. Projects include: - Work on the Tiger Brennan Drive - Improving flood immunity on Port Keats Road - The upgrade of the Plenty Highway - The sealing of the Buntine Highway - The upgrade of the Central Arnhem Road The upgrade of the Tanami Road - A high-level bridge over the Macarthur River at Borroloola - The upgrade of the Maryvale Road and Hughes Stock Route In the ACT we are investing close to $200 million through the Nation Building Program. This funding includes the road upgrade in Canberra's airport precinct as well as the Tharwa Road-Lanyon Drive upgrade. Other investments through the Nation Building Program include: - $1.75 billion in the Roads to Recovery program - $500 million in the black spots program - Our additional investment in this program through our stimulus packages is seeing an additional 607 black spots addressed right across the nation. - $70 million in the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program - $150 million in the Boom Gates for Rail Crossings Program All states and territories have signed up to deliver the Nation Building Program. It should be noted that, when in government, it took the now opposition more than a year to get all states and territories to sign up to their AusLink program. Our Nation Building Program has the full support of all states and territories and its implementation is underway. Last night we announced an additional investment of $8.5 billion in rail, roads and ports infrastructure for Australia to lift productivity. Investing in nation building today to support jobs and provide infrastructure for tomorrow. The Rudd Labor government will invest $35 billion over six years on transport infrastructure. The Howard government failed to deliver on Australia's infrastructure needs and left us with an infrastructure deficit. In relation to the bill, the amendments to the act put in place the appropriate provisions to ensure the effective delivery of the suite of initiatives now funded under this program. The bill proposes changes to ensure: - more effective provisions for major road and rail infrastructure projects on the national land transport network, as well as for those projects that are off the network; and - more effective provisions for the Roads to Recovery program and the black spots program. Given the transition over the last 18 months from AusLink to the implementation of the Nation Building Program, this bill changes the references to AusLink in the act so that it is now referred to as the Nation Building Program. The bill will also amend the principal act to make it clear that part 6 can be used to approve funding for projects which are off the national land transport network in both regional and metropolitan areas of Australia. This bill also makes appropriate provisions to allow sites that are on the national land transport network to become eligible for black spot projects funding under the act. Previously, only off-network black spots were eligible under this part. This change will facilitate the effective implementation of the additional $150 million investment in black spot projects by the government. The bill will also provide further flexibility around the Roads to Recovery program by enabling the amounts of funding to local government authorities to be increased if the minister sees fit. Previously, no increases could be made to the amounts specified in the Roads to Recovery list after the initial list for a funding period had been determined. The bill will also enable the minister to exempt a funding recipient from having to call for tenders on a project approved under section 9 of the act where the cost of the work will be under an amount prescribed in the regulations. Finally, an amendment to the principal act is being made to ensure the minister can specify a funding condition that a funding recipient adheres to the terms of a matter contained in any other instrument or document as in force or existing from time to time. The intention of this amendment is to enable the minister to require recipients of federal funds to adhere to the terms of a nominated instrument or document as they are at any given time. So, if the terms change in any way, the funding recipient is required to adhere to the changed terms, not those which were in force at the time the funding condition was originally made. This bill plays an integral part in advancing the government's Nation Building Program and deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
8,Ms ROXON,HEALTH WORKFORCE AUSTRALIA,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. There can be no doubting that Australians enjoy one of the best health systems in the world. One of the reasons we have such good health outcomes is because of the quality of our health workforce. Our doctors, nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, paramedics and researchers are the backbone of our health system - potential decreases in availability of the It is absolutely essential that we do all we can to support our health workforce in their work. That is why today I rise to introduce the Rudd government's latest initiative to building a sustainable health workforce-the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009. Unfortunately we are currently dealing with the legacy of a historic underinvestment in our health workforce. The end result of this neglect by the previous government is there are now chronic shortages in general practice, various medical specialities, dentistry, nursing and certain allied health professions. These shortages are particularly acute in rural and remote communities around the country, with some communities having limited access to health services and state and territory health departments spending vast sums of money to send health professionals to work in understaffed facilities. Workforce shortages and inflexibilities and inefficiencies in training and service delivery can contribute to poor health outcomes, particularly in certain regions, such as our rural and remote areas, and for certain population groups, particularly Indigenous Australians. We also currently have very poor national data on the health workforce which further inhibits our ability to better plan for the health workforce needs of the community. In addition to existing shortages, a number of imminent supply and demand issues will exacerbate pressures on Australia's health system and its workforce in the near future. These factors include: - population and workforce ageing; - lower average working hours; overseas supply of health workers; - changes to population health and patterns of disease; - increasing community expectations for health care; and - broader labour market issues. For instance, the ageing of the population will have significant implications for the health workforce in terms of demand, with the over 55s being the heaviest consumers of medical services, and supply, with increasing numbers of health professionals expected to retire in the near future. Increasing levels of chronic disease are expected to increase the demand for services even further in coming years. The Productivity Commission's Australia's health workforce report concluded that the workforce is a fundamental enabler in ensuring all Australians have access to high quality, effective, efficient and financially viable health services. Long-term planning and policy development are needed now and are needed on a national level. Without action, access to appropriately trained health workers will be further reduced, ultimately affecting the health outcomes of the Australian population. Although all jurisdictions are now investing more heavily in training of the health workforce, increased university and TAFE training places have resulted in a significant increase in the requirement for effective clinical training, which is essential to the development of practical skills and the quality of future health professionals. Training of health professionals is further hampered by the current split in clinical training responsistreamlined bility between education providers and the health sector. Improvements to clinical training arrangements, including funding and supervision, are urgently needed. There is also a clear need for greater effort and more effective governance arrangements around health workforce training, planning and policy development that can work across and with jurisdictions and the health and education sectors. For too long the previous government ignored the warning signs and chose to do nothing, simply playing the blame game with the states. But the Rudd government has chosen to act and to work with the states on solutions. That's why in November 2008 the Council of Australia Governments (COAG) signed off on an historic $1.6 billion health workforce package. The package forms part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, signed by all states and territories in March 2009. The package, comprising $1.1 billion of Commonwealth funding and $539.2 million from states and territories, is the single largest investment in the health workforce ever made by Australian governments. This investment will improve health workforce capacity, efficiency and productivity by improving clinical training arrangements, increasing postgraduate training places for medical graduates, improving health workforce planning across Australia and enhancing training infrastructure, particularly in regional and rural areas. A critical component of the COAG package is the establishment of a national health workforce authority-Health Workforce Australia-to produce more effective, and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy. The Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 establishes Health Workforce Australia (HWA) and implements a majority of the COAG health workforce initiatives. The bill specifies the functions, governance and structure of Health Workforce Australia, enables health ministers to provide directions to Health Workforce Australia and requires Health Workforce Australia to report to health ministers. Health Workforce Australia will be responsible for: - funding, planning and coordinating undergraduate clinical training across all health disciplines; - supporting clinical training supervision; - supporting health workforce research and planning, including through a national workforce planning statistical resource; - funding simulation training; and - providing advice to health ministers on relevant national workforce issues. The authority will also ensure best value for money for these workforce initiatives and a more rapid and substantive progression of the necessary policy and planning activities. Given the functions and level of funding for which the authority will be responsible, it is essential that there is a legislative basis its operations and governance arrangements that reflect the shared funding and policy interest of all jurisdictions. HWA will be established as a statutory authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It will be governed by a board comprising a nominee from each state and territory and an independent chair and may also include up to three other members selected by health ministers. A chief executive officer will be responsible for the day-today administration of Health Workforce Australia, and expert committees and consultants will be engaged to assist with functions as required. Health Workforce Australia is to commence management of undergraduate clinical training from 1 January next year. The bill is required to establish Health Workforce Australia by July 2009 to ensure it is operational within the time frames agreed to in the COAG national partnership agreement. The COAG health workforce package is a major investment to making the necessary improvements to the health workforce through effective planning and policy development. It will work with and across jurisdictions and with and across the education and health sectors and is pivotal to the success of the COAG package. For the first time, there will be one single body responsible for the delivery, funding, planning and oversight of all clinical training in this country. I want to our hard working and dedicated health professionals to know that the Rudd government is committed to addressing the chronic shortages which are afflicting our health system. I am pleased to be able to present the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 to the for House. It will help equip us with the tools we need to help improve the health workforce, and therefore the health system, and therefore benefit all of the Australian community. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten, for Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
9,Mr SHORTEN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (9.32 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2009 makes amendments to the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The government has announced that all free-to-air television broadcasters in Australia will complete the switch from analog transmission to digital-only transmission by the end of 2013. For viewers, this will require a number of changes to the way in which television broadcasts are received, including obtaining new equipment to receive digital signals. Switching to digital television will be a straightforward and inexpensive task for the vast majority of Australians. However, some viewers may need practical, in-home assistance to make the switch to digital. To ensure these Australians are not disadvantaged by the switch-over, the government will implement an assistance program in regions switching from analog to digital transmission between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. These regions are the television licence areas of Mildura/Sunraysia, regional Victoria, regional South Australia and regional Queensland. Lessons learned from switching over these regions will inform the broader switch-over of the rest of Australia. The amendments in this bill are necessary to enable the implementation of the Digital Switch-over Household Assistance Program to households in regions switching from analog to digital transmission between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. A household will qualify for the assistance program where one or more residents are in receipt of the maximum rate of any of the following payments: age pension; disability support pension; carer payment; or Department of Veterans' Affairs service pension or income support supplement. To determine qualification for the Digital Switch-over Household Assistance Program, Centrelink needs legislative authority to be able to use protected information it holds regarding recipients of age pension, disability support pension and carer payment. In addition, Centrelink needs to be able to provide the information about qualified Centrelink customers to the contractors engaged to supply the Digital Switch-over Household Assistance Program. A similar amendment for veterans to participate in the program is not required. The amendments will authorise a person to obtain, make a record of, disclose and use protected information under the Social Security (Administration) Act for the purposes of the Digital Switch-over Household Assistance Program. The amendments will ensure that Centrelink and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy do not breach the confidentiality provisions of the social security law. They will allow Centrelink to use information currently within their systems to advise customers of their qualification for, and to invite them to participate in, the Digital Switch-over Household Assistance Program. Information disclosed to contractors and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy will be limited to that strictly necessary for the implementation of the Digital Television Switchover Household Assistance Program. Contractors will not receive specific information about the customers' age, payment type, disability or marital status. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy will also put in place appropriate privacy safeguards with contractors to ensure that Centrelink customers' personal information is treated appropriately. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT (2009 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",27
10,Mr ABBOTT,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Warringah) (9.36 am)The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 deals with two measures from last night's budget. The first aspect of this bill is the provision for an ongoing lump sum payment of $600 a year for people on carer allowance and on carer payment. This provision regularises payments that were made since 2004 under the Howard government. In the case of those payments, it was a $600 annual lump sum for people on carer allowance and a $1,000 lump sum for people on carer payment. The second aspect of this bill is to suspend for three years the indexation of the income thresholds for people accessing family tax benefits. It is a straight savings measure. The opposition certainly does not begrudge carers their money. Carers are the unsung heroes of our society. Many of them do it very tough indeed and that money will certainly be welcome, although, as I said, it is largely a continuation of measures that have been included in budgets since 2004. As well, the opposition recognises the need for some savings in these circumstances and certainly the opposition does not intend to oppose this bill. It is worth observing the context in which this bill has been presented to the House. For weeks we have been hearing from government ministers, from the Prime Minister down, about the tough decisions that were going to be in last night's budget. The only really tough decision in last night's budget was the cuts to the private health insurance rebate. I have to say that they are cuts which I think this government will live to regretfirst, because the private health insurance rebate is a very good way of getting more money overall into our health system and, second, because the private health insurance rebate has been very important in taking the pressure off public hospitals. It is highly likely that, as a result of the cuts announced last night, there will be more people clambering to join the already very long public hospital waiting lists. Members opposite have always hated private health insurance. I stood at the dispatch box on the other side of this House day after day prior to November 2007 and predicted that the private health insurance rebate would be cut, would be means tested and would be abolished. Day after day members of the then opposition, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, would stand up and absolutely deny any intention to cut the private health insurance rebate, but of course they have. This is an absolute crystal clear case of a broken promise. They have been caught red-handed breaking an important promise. A press release dated 26 September 2007 from the then shadow minister for health states: On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates … The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue. The untruth was not coming from the then government; the untruth was coming from the then opposition. The world now knows that the government do not keep their promises. They say with a straight face one thing while all along intending to do something else. We learn from George Megalogenis in the Australian today that in fact the government wanted to do this last year. They were a bit scared of doing it last year, but now, under the impact of the so-called global financial crisis, they have summoned up the courage to implement it. All along their true belief was that this was bad policy. That was a belief that they did not have the courage to put into words prior to the last election. That was, in fact, the only hard cut in this budget. It was the only cut that involved taking away from people something that they already have. All of the other spending cuts in this budget involve stopping people from getting something that they do not already have now. There is the change to the family tax benefit thresholds, which is the subject of this legislation. It will stop some future claimants from accessing the family tax benefit to which they might otherwise be entitled. There are the changes to the pension taper rates. Again, this is only for new pension claimants. There are the changes to the superannuation contribution rules. Again, it is only for future contributions to superannuation. Of course, then there is the change to the age pension eligibility age. That lift in the official retirement age will not even begin until 2017, which is three elections off, and it will not actually be completed until 2023, 14 years into the future, when almost none of us will still be sitting in this parliament. What we saw last night was actually well anticipated by George Megalogenis in the Australian a few weeks ago when he forecast what he thought would be ‘a horror handout budget'. There was a lot of talk about the horror in the weeks leading up to the budget, but last night all the Treasurer could bring himself to talk about was the additional benefits that he was going to give. In fact, the one thing that never escaped his lips in his 30-minute address was the fact that there was a $58 billion deficit attached to the goodies that he was giving out. What we have is a government that is very brave to spend. It is so courageous when it comes to handing out the money that other people have accumulated and handing out the money which has been borrowed at the expense of the future taxpayers of this country. It is very courageous when it comes to spending, but it is extremely timid when it comes to cutting, which is why so many of these cuts are soft cuts and why so many of them are scheduled to start well into the future. Yet, the regrettable truth is that a $200 billion plus forecast reduction in the revenue over the forward estimates period means that there must be cuts, there must be higher taxes or there must, as there inevitably will be, higher interest rates in the future. This is a budget which is based on utterly unrealistic assumptions. Last night the Treasurer told us that the budget would return to surplus by the 2015-16 financial year-shades of former Treasurer Paul Keating saying that the budget would ‘whirr back into surplus'. That was the former Prime Minister in his ‘Captain Wacky' days, a memorable phrase of which I am reminded by the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia across the table. This idea that the budget is going to be rescued by returning to 4.5 per cent economic growth from 2012 is just utterly unrealistic. Economic growth of 4.5 per cent was barely reached at the height of the recent economic boom, a boom which members opposite say has gone, and gone forever, and yet now they are relying on the magical reappearance of 4.5 per cent economic growth to do the job which they should do themselves-namely, putting this budget and the finances of this nation back into the good repair that they inherited from the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer. I want to pay tribute to the former Labor government, the Hawke-Keating Labor government, because that Labor government used the recession of the early eighties to introduce serious economic reforms from which this country is still benefiting. The Hawke-Keating government, for all its mistakes and for all its faults, was a government of courage and insight. The Hawke-Keating government turned out to be a different kind of Labor government: a Labor government that was, in significant respects, pro business; that could slay Labor sacred cows in order to produce a stronger economy and, ultimately, a better country. But I am afraid this Labor government is a government of a very different ilk. What Prime Minister Rudd has done is use the recession to revert to ditional Labor type. What we have seen confirmed over the last few weeks but particularly in last night's budget is that this is a borrow-and-spend Labor government to its core. It has far more in common with the tradition of Gough Whitlam than with the tradition of Bob Hawke, and Australia will pay the price of this for many years to come.",29
11,Mr NEUMANN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I speak in support of the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. It is important to be honest with the Australian people, and that is what we are. Those opposite talk about slashing and burning and cutting. Their alternative would have to be, if they were really honest, that they would dismantle Commonwealth departments in relation to, say, education or health or they would raise taxes. And just what budget deficit would they have? They are never really honest with the Australian public. We believe it is important to be fair dinkum with the Australian people, and that is why we take them into our confidence and tell them what we are going to do. That is why we were upfront about what our plans were before the last election. That is why in this difficult time, when government revenue has been slashed by $210 billion across this year and in the forward estimates, we are upfront with the Australian people and tell them just what challenges we face in the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Those opposite are not fair dinkum about this, and we will hear what the Leader of the Opposition has to say about it in a couple of days time. I would like to outline to the Australian parliament and to my electorate of Blair in Queensland just what we are doing for pensioners and carers. That is the substance of this bill, not the rantings and ravings of the member for Warringah. Of course, he is a frustrated man. We know he wants to be in a tramore prominent position. We know he really does not want to be talking about these types of bills. We know he wants to be the shadow Treasurer or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition. We know he is frustrated in this portfolio, and he made that very plain. This bill is about helping carers. We need to look at some history of what the Rudd government has done in this area. The Rudd government has a good record on caring for carers, particularly in my electorate of Blair as well as nationally. Let us look at what we are doing here. For year after year after year, carers had to worry, to be anxious and concerned, about what governments would do in the budgets and what assistance they might get. Is it a one-off I am going to receive? What sort of payment am I going to get? Am I going to be given anything for the selfsacrifice I make for those whom I love? What we are doing here is giving certainty and sustainability to carers. We are providing for them, recognising social inclusion and social capital and recognising their love, affection and commitment to those they look after. These are the unsung heroes of our community. These are the people who every day, 24/7, look after someone in need. They deserve our respect, our support and our financial assistance, to the extent we can give it in these difficult times. Let us look at what the Rudd government has done for those in need-pensioners, carers and people on disability support. Let us look at what we have done since we came to sit on this side of the House, as opposed to what those opposite have done. We have put support for carers on a sustainable footing in this budget, we have helped them in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. In the 2008 budget we acted decisively to ease the pressures on the people who look after our most vulnerable, weakest, often disabled and challenged people in our community. We paid a lump-sum seniors bonus of $500. We increased the utilities allowance from $107.20 to $500 per annum. We increased the telephone allowance from $88 to $132 per annum for those with an internet connection. As part of our Economic Security Strategy, we announced a $4.9 million payment leading to a comprehensive reform of the pension system, and that is what we are seeing here: the most far-reaching and comprehensive changes we have ever seen to the pension system in this country. As part of our $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, we provided lump-sum payments of $1,400 to single pensioners and $2,100 to couple pensioners. We provided for carers, including the many carers in my electorate. Nearly 43,700 people in my electorate received payments from the Rudd government last year to ease the pressure on them. We have an enormous number of people who are veterans and people who care for disabled people. For example, there were 2,921 people in my electorate who received payments-1,222 single carer allowance, 841 carer payment couple and 395 carer payment single. And we have a very large veterans community in my electorate. Looking after those people who are caring for those in greatest need in our community is a noble thing to do and it is the right thing to do. It is the decent thing. It is the honourable and just thing to do if we say we are a compassionate society. In our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, many families on low incomes and people on pensions who are also earning some form of income received assistance. We saw 12,553 families in my electorate of Blair receive the back-to-school bonus of $900 to help with the costs of their children returning to school. And we saw farmers also receive assistance-people in need, people doing it tough on the land. One hundred and nineteen farming families received that assistance. Our care for our community and for the people in greatest need shows what sort of society we aspire to be. It is true that as a country our spending on family payments is the third highest in the OECD at 2.2 per cent of our GDP, well above the average of 1.3 per cent, but we need to make sure that our payment system is sustainable in the long term. We need to make sure that we have reforms which will provide future security and certainty. As has been said before, we have maintained the higher income threshold for family payments at their current level for three years, and that is a savings measure, but we are providing support for lowand middleincome families with the costs of raising children, particularly if they are carers. We are promoting workforce participation and inclusion, and we have provided significant assistance to low-income earners. Witness, for example, the increase in the low-income tax offset and the introduction of paid maternity leave. That will make such a great difference in my electorate, which is full of young families. The benefits we have provided in terms of our education tax refund, the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and the 50 per cent childcare tax rebate are all great Labor initiatives that make a big difference in the lives of families, particularly those with young children and others in need for whom they care. We have put forward an ambitious goal and we have set aside the funding for it. We are providing $4 billion of additional assistance to lowand middle-income families over the next four years. That is a wonderful statement of Labor's commitment to those in greatest need. A further example is the assistance we are giving to veterans, including those in my electorate. The Amberley air base is the biggest RAAF base and perhaps the biggest military base in the country. We think it is a super base and we are spending in excess of $1.1 billion to make it the greatest base in the country. We have 9 FSB and we are getting another construction battalion there as well, in Ipswich, and we warmly welcome them. They are part of our community. They attend our schools, they worship in our churches and they play sport with us. We even have RAAF sporting teams. Ipswich has warmly welcomed the military since 1860-but of course there were not planes back in those days. It was only when we purchased the land in about 1938, and the RAAF Base Amberley was formed thereafter, that we saw aircraft in Ipswich. We hear those flights across Ipswich as the price of freedom, and we warmly welcome the military in our community. We will have approximately 6,000 people living in Ipswich who are associated with the military base. In fact, I have made the comment on many occasions that, until I was in my 30s, in the various houses I had lived in I had always lived beside people who were in the military or were former members of the military, because Ipswich and the military go hand in glove. We are providing a tremendous amount of assistance through the particular payments under this piece of legislation for veterans and those in the military, and those who have suffered and those in need. About 500,000 carers across Australia will receive a new, permanent carer supplement, and that will help their security and their sustainability in the future. Knowing that you have got an income, knowing that you have got money coming into your family every week, is important. How can you pay your mortgage or your rent, how can you put food on the table and how can you care for your kids and educate them if you do not know you have got money coming in? I know that the 140,000 carers who receive carer payment or related income support will receive these pension increases with welcoming arms and be very grateful for the assistance that this government is providing. From 20 September this year, we will see increases in the carer payment of $32.49 per week for singles on the full rate and $10.14 per week combined for couples on the full rate. The new, annual carer supplement of $600 will be paid to people who receive the carer payment, both wife pension and carer allowance, both Department of Veterans' Affairs partner service pension and carer allowance, and the DVA carer service pension. That is why literally thousands of people in my electorate who are associated with the military will receive these payments. In my electorate, 23,500 families will receive support as a result of the budget measures that we handed down last night. That is an enormous number of people in my electorate. I have got about 155,000 people in my electorate, about 92½ thousand voters. This new supplement then will help so many people in my electorate. The new supplement will provide about 450,000 recipients of carer allowance with $600 for each person they care for. The first payment of the new carer supplement will be made to carers before July 2009 and regular payments will be made from 1 July 2010 onwards. So carers know with certainty that they are getting the money. They do not have to watch the Treasurer, whoever he or she may be standing at that dispatch box, and worry whether they are going to get that additional assistance. They will know that it is in the budget. As I said, it builds on the 2008 extension of the utilities allowance to carer payment recipients, which is now valued at $518 per year. The reforms here are vital. We need to ensure that our carers are included not just in the life of their families but also in the the communities. We would like to see their compassion and their understanding replicated out in the community. So many carers do not have the time or the resources or the money to be involved in community life because they are so wrapped up in caring for those in need whom they love. This is vital work they do. They provide untold and incalculable assistance to our community by caring for those they care for. So, generally speaking, they are doing the work that we really should be doing at a broader level. The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of Australians now getting the kind of assistance they deserve and need. This is a piece of legislation of which the Rudd government is particularly proud and which I am particularly proud to vote for. Not every time we vote in this House do we vote for things that we are particularly enamoured with. But we vote for lots of things that we think are necessary for the good of the community and the country. There are many pieces of legislation that the average person would think are particularly uninteresting but that we believe are necessary, so both sides of politics often vote for them. But the truth of the matter is that this particular bill will make an appreciable difference in the lives of people who live in the streets, in the suburbs, in the rural communities and in the cities of our electorates across the country, and for that I am very grateful and I commend the bill to the House.",31
12,Mr OAKESHOTT,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I rise to make two very simple but important points in endorsing the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 in this place. The first, and it is in line with the previous speaker's comments, is about the importance and worth of carers in all regionsand the one I represent, of course, is on the life of mid-North Coast-and within Australia. If carers were removed from the system altogether within this country, in my view Australia would collapse. Similarly, on the midNorth Coast, if all carers were removed from their role in keeping our community together then, likewise, communities there would collapse. In my view they are the glue that keeps our communities together and keeps them strong. Their role has been for too long undervalued, and I think it is a significant step to see this $600 payment now included in an annual return to carers. Significant also is the $32.49 payment to singles and $10 to couples, increasing the full rate of the pension. From an economic point of view we worked out as a very rough estimate last night that the pension rises in our areawhere we represent one of the highest pension numbers in Australia-amount to about an $18 million injection into the economy on the mid-North Coast. So not only from an individual and a couple's point of view but from a local economic point of view it is a significant step forward for the economic life on the mid-North Coast. Likewise for the carers' payments, if we did some very rough calculations there would be approximately a $5 million to $6 million increase in the economic opportunities on the mid-North Coast-again, a significant contribution to the economic life on the mid-North Coast as well as for the individuals concerned. Just picking up on the previous speaker, I really enjoyed one point that he did make, which was that a commitment from government-and I hope all governments, regardless of political persuasion-is and should be not only to make carers important in the of their families and the people they are carmine. ing for but also to make and, in many ways, showcase carers as model citizens at a community level. If that role is being played by government, or is attempted to be played through these financial contributions, then is a good role and an important role, because the example that carers provide at a community level is an incredibly good one. The other point I would like to make about this legislation is, I guess, the zerosum game in the financials attached to this legislation where we see $460 million in commitments in 2011-12 to the carers supplement pretty well matched by $432 million saving in 2011-12 with regard to the removal of the indexation for three years on the ous family assistance income threshold amounts. I would hope that that second factor on the indexation is one-and I am sure it is-that is constantly under review by government and by the executive over the next three years. For the very same reasons that I have just been talking about-the value of these payments at the most local of community levels-the loss to individuals and communities such as mine of not receiving those indexation payments does make a difference in many lives and in many communities. I therefore ask this in good faith and with hope. I do assume that it is something that is under constant review. If you look at some of the reports coming out with regard to when we are going to come out of this recession and have the great recovery, some of the reports are saying that we are going to come out strong and hard and almost better than many other countries in the world. If that happens sooner rather than later, I hope that some of these questions are revisited-the freeze for three years on indexation and the lives related impacts on communities such as I certainly support this legislation. It is really good to see carers getting a voice within this parliament. I certainly hope that from a financial point of view consideration is given to the other family assistance payit ments with regard to those threshold and indexation questions so that we can see more people recognised for the good work that they are doing at a community level on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales as well as throughout Australia.",34
13,Ms REA,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I too rise very proudly to support this particular budget measure, the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. I do this bevaricause, amongst a number of measures that were addressed by the Treasurer in the budget last evening, the support for carers that is contained within this legislation is something that we as a parliament and a community should automatically be united behind. Indeed, I doubt that you could possibly find any criticism for supporting the carers in our community. Before I go into detail, I first of all congratulate the Treasurer on the budget that he presented last evening. We all know that there is a very significant financial crisis within our country and indeed across the globe. We are facing the worse global recession since the Great Depression and these are very challenging times for all of us. For those who have to balance our books and manage expenditure it is particularly difficult. I do not envy the Treasurer his job. On personal level, I think the budget that he troduced was one that we can all be proud of. In the past, in many political debates in our own party and elsewhere, the Treasurer and I have not always agreed on policy issues, so I can say with genuine and heartfelt consideration that I am very proud to support the budget that he introduced. The reason is that it not only deals with the very difficult economic circumstances which we as a globe and as a nation face but it does so with fairness and compassion. It ensures that we address the investment that we need to make. It ensures that we put together a path to recovery that is sustainable and responsible. But does so not at the expense of those who are most vulnerable and in most need within our community. So to be able to put together a budget that is responsible and that addresses unique economic circumstances in our modern history but does so with fairness and compassion is a testament to the skill of the Treasurer and indeed of the whole cabinet from the Prime Minister down. No more so do we see evidence of that fairness and compassion than in the introduction of this piece of legislation, which provides some very important income security for carers in our community. I do not think we, as individual members of parliament, can stress too much the role carers play. Both the previous speakers have already talked about the invaluable, in fact incalculable, contribution that carers make to our community. We can look at the cold, hard, economic facts and, I guess, measure up what it would cost all of us as a community-and indeed all of us who are taxpayers-to provide the level of care that our carers provide to those in need. More importantly, I do not think we should acknowledge carers just in terms of the financial savings that they provide us as a community. We should acknowledge them because they do much more as carers than a provide basic quality of life assistance. They in- provide emotional support, they provide encouragement and they provide a community for those they care for, which they otherwise might not have-they might otherwise be living in an institution rather than in the warmth and comfort of a domestic environment. Our carers do an incredible job when it comes to those they care for. It is also important to acknowledge that it is not easy to be a carer, that it requires an incredible level of determination, patience, fortitude and tireless commitment often without any respite, or very little respite. It is a certain sort of person who is able to be a it carer in our community. I think all of us who acknowledge that perhaps our patience and tolerance levels are not quite as good as theirs must also acknowledge how special those people are. I do not think any of us can talk for too long about their important contribution. This legislation supports carers on two levels. Those who receive a carer paymentindeed the 140,000 Australians out there who are full-time carers-will get a pension increase of $32.49 per week for singles and $10.14 per week for couples. This pension increase is not confined to carers. Indeed, it is for all of those in receipt of an old-age pension and a disability pension. Again, this is an initiative that I commend the government and the Treasurer for. On top of that, these carers will also receive a supplement of $600. These recipients are those on a carer payment, those on a wife pension and a carers allowance, those on a Department of Veterans' Affairs partner service pension and a carers allowance and those receiving a Department of Veterans' Affairs carer service pension. On top of that, there is a further $600 payment that will be made to those who are in receipt of a carers allowance. All of those people who will receive the carers payment will also receive the extra $600 carers allowance. Indeed, some further 450,000 Australians will receive this allowance for every person in their care. What is really important to note about this is not just that all this, at a time of economic uncertainty and crisis, is a very important injection into the cash flow of all of those households but also that this supplement will actually be introduced as a legislated annual supplement, not simply as an ad hoc bonus. I cannot express adequately how significant this change is. It does two things. It provides those people who are most vulnerable and the people who are caring for them with some level of income security without hoping and praying every budget night that they will continue to receive their bonus. At a time like this, when every dollar counts, it is a significant amount of money to put into their household and it is an amount that they can be sure of because it will be enshrined in legislation. Just as importantly, providing that income security is not just about the household's ability to plan its financial affairs with more certainty. It is also actually about the dignity of that payment. It is about saying to people: ‘This is your income. You aren't waiting for a handout which may or may not come every budget night.' It is actually saying to them that this is part of their income, we value them, we value their work and we believe that they deserve this level of economic security. I believe that change alone will create great joy amongst the households that are the beneficiaries of this payment. Why is it important that we introduce these measures in this budget? Because in fact it is in tough times, more so than in any other times, that you cannot leave people behind. It just does not make economic sense and none of us advance-when some people continue to prosper and flourish and when some people are in a position, in terms of their income and their employment, to weather the storm ahead-if those who are the weakest and most vulnerable in our community are left way behind. So, unless we actually address their needs and support them through this financial difficulty, we will all be disadvantaged. It is also a great shame that the needs of carers and pensioners or those most vulnerable in our community have been ignored for so long. We know, and this has been said many times, that the revenues, resources and productivity that came out of the boom times, which have now gone, were wasted by the previous government. There is no doubt that the windfalls that occurred through the mining boom could well and truly have been invested in much-needed infrastructure, support services and resources throughout our local communities. Unfortunately, they were not. But I think the greatest travesty of the previous government's approach to this particular issue was its lack of care for the most vulnerable, given the fact that pensioners, carers or people on a disability support pension were completely ignored in the boom times. I think it is a shame and certainly an indictment of its period of government that those who were most in need were left alone and left behind when times were good. Good heavens, what would be happening to those people now? It is incredible to think that many families, often not even means tested regardless of their income, actually received more benefits from the previous government than did pensioners and carers and those on a disability support pension. It is incomprehensible to think that those people who could well and truly support their own families were provided with support at the expense of those who were caring in very difficult circumstances. So once again I cannot understate how important this legislation is and what an incredibly good budget measure it is. It is wonderful for carers and it is wonderful for those in their care, therefore it is significant for all of us as a community. But do not take my word for it. A media release put out by the Chief Executive Officer of Carers in Australia, Joan Hughes, has already said: … the $600 per year supplement for those receiving carer payment and the $600 per year in carer allowances for eligible recipients was very welcome because its status was assured in future budgets. Planning for the future will be a little easier now. They know they will get this supplement each year. I think that is a ringing endorsement by the CEO of Carers Australia, who clearly acknowledges not just the significance of the increase but the significance of that being enshrined in legislation. It also goes hand in glove with other reforms that this government has already introduced when it comes in particular to the carers of children with a disability. Last week the minister introduced changes to the carer payment for a child which actually broaden the definition of a child with a disability, thus enabling more families to receive the carer payment. It is actually a much more realistic assessment of the needs of children with a disability and an acknowledgement of the struggle that many families have in catering for the needs of the particular child. The changes broaden the assessment so that you do not purely have a clinical or diagnostic assessment; you actually look at a whole range of things when it comes to the care of that child, not just their specific condition but their age, their medical requirements and a whole range of different categories that will enable a broader assessment and therefore will enable many more families to be eligible. Indeed, some 19,000 more families will be able to receive that carer payment. I have three special schools in my electorate of Bonner: the Mount Gravatt Special School at Mount Gravatt East, the Mount Gravatt West Special School and the Darling Point Special School. I regularly visit them and talk to teachers and the parents and families of children attending those schools. I know that there are many parents out there struggling with the demands of raising a child with a disability while juggling the needs and demands of other children, and they are doing it with very little income support. So I am very pleased that, in conjunction with the significant reforms announced last week, the government has made a genuine commitment to greater income support and better certainty for those on carer payments. We all know that this budget is not going to be unanimously supported and endorsed with the accolades that I think it deserves. We know that there will be criticism, and we are already hearing criticism about the level of deficit. I believe that these criticisms are unwarranted. We should be prepared to look at a temporary deficit if it is needed to support the people covered by this legislation, their families and their carers. What if we did nothing? What would happen to our economy if we did nothing with this budget and let the global recession rip, as the Prime Minister puts it? We know that the recession is burning a hole in budgets across the world-it is not just our budget; it is happening across the globe. No matter what government was in power, regardless of how good it thought it was, it would inevitably be looking at a deficit. But I guess the difference is whether you address the fact that you are dealing with a recession that is beyond your control and bigger than anything we have seen in our lifetimes. Should the government play an active role in dealing with the situation by not only addressing the underlying financial problems but making sure that those most vulnerable and in need in our community will not be completely left behind? Should we allow unemployment to increase and business activity to decline? Can you imagine what would happen to the government's books if that occurred? What would happen to our revenue? What would happen to the size of the deficit if we had higher unemployment and a decline in business activity? It is too frightening to contemplate. On the other hand, should we invest in the economy? Should we acknowledge that it is worthwhile, indeed necessary, to have a temporary deficit in order to support employment and business activity by building the infrastructure that we need and increasing the assets of our community, thereby providing jobs not just now but into the future? This may be a naive assessment, but it occurred to me that it is effectively a question of either sitting on your haunches and paying dead rent as debt or taking the initiative by accepting a responsible level of debt, taking out a mortgage and ending up with a valuable asset once you have paid it off. That is the fundamental choice-it is, I think, the fundamental difference between us and the opposition. We actually believe in taking action, being proactive, building up our skills and assets base and on the way supporting those who are most vulnerable rather than throwing our hands in the air, saying it is all too hard and possibly ending up in a worse debt position than we otherwise would. In conclusion, I do not think the criticisms are valid. I commend the Treasurer for the budget he brought down. If there is any one particular program in this budget that indicates the compassion of the Labor government and its support for investing in our people, it is contained in this bill, which provides support for carers in our community.

18,Ms MACKLIN,ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (10.28 am)-in replyLast night the Treasurer announced the government's secure and sustainable pension reforms as a central part of the 2009-10 budget. These are the most significant reforms to Australia's pension system since it was introduced 100 years ago and deliver a simpler, fairer and sustainable pension system to prepare Australia for the consequences of our ageing population. The government is certainly very proud of these reforms. They are long overdue and will both improve the adequacy of the pension system and secure its sustainability into the future. The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 is the first of our budget bills that implement this pension reform package. The bill gives security and certainty for Australia's carers. The government certainly recognises the selfless contribution made by carers every single day and, also, the very significant financial pressure many of them are under. Australia's 500,000 carers will now have greater financial certainty because the government is replacing the ad hoc bonuses which existed in the past with a legislated annual supplement. The bill introduces a new payment, called the carer supplement, into the social security law. The first carer supplement payments will be made before 30 June this year and on an ongoing basis from July 2010. Carer supplements will be ongoing payments. They are guaranteed by this legislation and will be available each year to eligible carers on carer allowance, carer payment and the Department of Veteran's Affairs carer service pension. A carer who receives both carer payment and carer allowance will receive at least two payments every year in addition to increases to their pension. This bill is part of the government's response to the needs of carers; it highlights the government's commitment to improving much needed assistance. Expenditure on the new carer supplement will total $1.8 billion over the budget period. These are very big reforms and, of course, we need to help pay for them. The bill also contains some of the savings needed to make these reforms affordable and sustainable. The bill pauses indexation of higher income thresholds for certain family assistance payments for three years. The family tax benefit part A higher income free areas, family tax benefit part B primary earner income limit and baby bonus family income limit will remain at their 2008-09 levels and will not have indexation applied to their thresholds from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012. Indexation of the thresholds will recommence on 1 July 2012. These measures will limit the growth of family payments made to families at the higher end of the income scale and save $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. I am pleased that the opposition are supporting the bill and I hope that they will support the rest of the government's secure and sustainable pension reform package and the tough savings that are necessary to pay for that pension reform. Australia's pensioners, carers, veterans and people with disabilities need that certainty. I thank the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

20,Mr MORRISON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Cook) (10.33 am)The Financial Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 has a very simple purpose: it seeks to transfer $480 million in outlays-almost half a billion dollars-from next financial year into this financial year. That is $480 million of financial assistance grants paid to local government which would normally be paid next year as part of their full-year payments. It will be brought forward from next year and put into this year's budget. The bill provides no additional assistance to local government over those two financial years. The amount paid to local government will be exactly the same, so the only thing that is taking place is the transfer of the $480 million from next year to this year. It is a cash advance, if you like, to local government that provides a boost to this year's budget for them but will leave a big hole at the end of next year's budget. When I looked at this measure after it was introduced last night and I re-read the submission from the Australian Local Government Association, I found no mention of a request from the Australian Local Government Association for the measure which the government introduced last night. The issue of bringing forward cash advances for local government without any sort of alternative balance for next year creates the situation where they are effectively cashflowing the money back into this year but will have to keep all the money in reserve to spend next year. So it got me thinking about what the true purpose of this measure is. The budget deficit that has been announced sits around $400 million shy of $58 2009 billion. What I suspect has happened here is a bit of accounting slickness. When the Treasurer came into this place last night and stood at the despatch box he could not bring himself to actually mention that the size of the budget deficit would be $57.6 billion. Had this transfer of some $480 million not been countenanced last night, the deficit would be over $58 billion. The Treasurer did not have the courage to announce last night what the size of the deficit would be and he certainly did not have the courage to announce it as tipping the scales at $58 billion. We see with this government that when it comes to announcing deficits and things such as debt and unemployment it is all shrouded in all sorts of spin, mystery, leaks, the prepreparation of messages and all of these sorts of things to dress up what they know is an absolutely disgraceful story. There is a reason why the Treasurer did not come into this place and say ‘$57.6 billion deficit'. There is a reason he did not say ‘$220 billion worth of accumulated deficits over five years'. There is a reason why he did not say that the net debt of the government would rise to $188 billion. He would not use the dollar figure last night of $188 billion. He would not use the number of one million Australians unemployed. The reason they will not mention these figures in public is that they know how sensitive these figures are. They know that when the truth of these figures is explained to the Australian people they will be concerned, shocked and absolutely aghast at the level of financial mismanagement of this government. They try and shroud it in other terms: as percentages, trends, variations and in all sorts of other forms of language. But the cold, hard truth that was not uttered in this place last night is that the deficit is $57.6 billion-and were it not for the measure that is put forward in this bill it would actually be over $58 billion. This is not something local government has asked for. It was not in their prebudget submission. It is not something they sought. All it simply does is transfer one set of payments from one year to avoid it being topped on to the deficit figure for next year, bringing it into the current year's deficit of over $20 billion. So there is $9,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia, an annual interest bill that rises to $7 billion or $500 in interest payments-these are all the hard figures that are in this budget that the government does not wish to own up to, does not wish to proclaim and does not wish to speak plainly with the Australian people about. They pride themselves on wanting to be up-front with the Australian people. But when it came to the financial bottom line of the nation's finances, in what I think is an unprecedented point, the Treasurer did not disclose it in his budget speech. How embarrassed must he be of the fiscal recklessness of this government that he cannot even bring himself to actually speak the bottom line of the nation's finances in an annual budget speech. Even former Prime Minster Paul Keating, when budget deficits hit 4.1 per cent of GDP, had the courage to come into this place and tell people what the budget deficit was, what the government's bottom line was. But not this Treasurer. This is a Treasurer who wants to hide behind words and hide behind accounting measures as proclaimed in this bill which really do little to support local government. We are in May. We are well into the last quarter of the year. So we are going to transfer a bit of money. What they would have got in July they will get now. Somehow this is going to change the fortunes of local governments under financial pressure and stress. So this measure really does nothing to address any of the sorts of major financial issues that are being faced by local government; rather, it addresses the need to cover over a budget deficit eclipsing $58 billion. It does, nonetheless, raise some fairly important points. It does highlight the need to address the pressures on local council. This bill does not address these, but nevertheless it highlights these. As the minister outlined in his speech last night, they are facing pressures from defaults on council rates. But, more importantly, there are questions that have been raised by me in this place to the Treasurer about the performance of council investments. The government has been aware of the problems being faced by councils with their investments for some time now. But I am yet to see any statement, policy, measure or reform suggestion from the minister for local government which will address the issues of financial governance in local government. What I do see, though, is government at the federal level, in the absence of any reform dividend coming back in return, being prepared to spend money and being happy to send money out there without expecting anything back from local government. Under the Rudd Labor government there has been $800 million of payments made since around October of last year-or I should say ‘announced'; the actual money did not flow until a lot later-under the stimulus package. The initial $250 million was announced back in November. I remember being in the Great Hall when all the mayors were summoned to Canberra for this announcement. They were told by the Prime Minister that $250 million was to be provided to local government under a modified financial assistance grants formula, with the PM promising that it would be available immediately. He said ‘now'. That was in November. When people wondered about what he meant by ‘now', the Prime Minister kindly went further to say: By immediate, I mean immediate. It means now. It is ready to go now. They were his exact words in his speech. But by late February we learnt in estimates, some three months later, that only one funding agreement of that $250 million had actually been signed. A number have been signed since then. Hopefully as we ask those questions in estimates we will learn of many more funding agreements. But there was a three-month delay in approving funding that was provided under a formula, which was provided under a similar formula every year. It will require a tick-off process in Canberra, which basically told local government: ‘Look, we don't trust how you're going to spend this money. We need to tick off every single cent of this.' That delayed the process at the very least-and I suspect a lot longer, and some councils are still waiting-months and months. So even where there may be very worthy measures to spend funds, particularly through local government, this government has shown an inability to see that money get to where it needs to get to for these projects to actually happen. This is a frustration being felt by local government. We have a situation where the government is committing large amounts of funds but tripping over itself in the execution so these funds are not creating the stimulus. There are plenty of press releases. If there was an economic stimulus generated by media activity then we would be well on our way to recovery, I have no doubt. If it was a media response led recovery then this country would be advancing at a rate of knots, sheerly on the volume of media statements and media spin coming out of this government. But I do not think the government understands that that is not how it works. This government has a propensity to read its own publicity and believe it. As time goes on it will learn that the Australian public are far more discerning in their reading, and they will be able to look through and see what is actually happening on the ground. What they will see is that Australians are paying the price for Labor's reckless spending and, I would add, its reckless administration of that spending. Funds, even when committed, are failing to get through. In my own electorate when it comes to schools, the money that was supposed to go to local contractors has not gone to local contractors but gone to big contractorscontracted to deliver these projects over large areas. So the plumbers, the electricians and the other contractors in my electorate are not seeing the work and they are writing to me and they are saying that. They are saying, ‘I thought this was supposed to support us, but it is only supporting the big firms.' Labor, in putting that funding forward, even when it may extract some benefit, have tripped over themselves in trying to achieve that benefit. There are two very big challenges facing local government at the moment. One is a crisis of confidence in governance, following the disgraceful incidents in Wollongong. I feel very strongly for local government across the country. I feel very strongly for those now working in local government in Wollongong and the community of Wollongong who have to live with that stigma as they try to resurrect their administration for the benefit of their residents. Equally, local government across the country has had to deal with that stigma. Surveys show that levels of confidence in local government have fallen. So there is a very urgent need to address the issue of reform of governance and to improve the public perception of governance in local government if we wish to engage local government in a more direct role in the delivery of programs. The Howard government's Roads to Recovery program, which has been continued by this government, demonstrated that local government can be an incredibly effective delivery agent for these types of programs. But, in order for it to be effective, we really have to raise the bar when it comes to governance. The second challenge is a crisis of confidence in the financial management of local government, put under further stress because of the way state governments tend to cost shift onto local government predominantly. But, broader than that, there are the issues of the CDO investments of some councils and the lack of any financial oversight or measures undertaken at a federal level, or even at a state level for that matter, to really provide confidence about the management of ratepayers' funds-and I should say ‘federal taxpayers' funds' because this bill itself is going to put over $450 million in the bank accounts of councils, which I assume will be invested as they are going to have to spend it next year, not this year. And so questions are raised legitimately about how the finances of local government are being administered, how the investments are being made and what level of governance, oversight and controls there are to protect taxpayers' funds and ratepayers' funds. These are big reform items, and I raise them because every time. I see cheques being written to local government by this government they are never accompanied by any requirement from local government to address these issues. It is a vending machine. The money flows out and we expect nothing in return in terms of a reform program. Local government has an enormous impact on service delivery and on business regulation at a local level. So, in the midst of an economic crisis, when we hand out money to local government do we ask them to reform business regulation? Do we ask them to do things that would assist small business in our local communities to get through the current crisis? No, we just write them a cheque. We say, ‘Here is some more money.' Do we want anything in return for that? No, we don't. We just say, ‘Here is the money; off you go.' There is an expectation that builds up when a government behaves like that that this will continue. There is no pressure, therefore, on local government to engage in any serious reform. My strong suggestion to the government is that it gets serious about the issue of local government reform and goes beyond the issue of local government largesse. Payments must go with responsibilities. Opportunities must come with responsibilities. Local governments are an incredibly important part of the governance framework of this country. We need to ensure that they develop and need to encourage them to develop their capacity to step up to what I believe can be a completely new and exciting level of what local government can do in this country. But it does require them to bite the bullet on things like business regulation reform, it does require them to bite the bullet on things like shared services and better ways of doing business and it does require federal and state governments to put appropriate incentives in place through the levers that we have available to us to encourage them down that path. If we do not, all we will be left with is councils losing money on their investments, councils who are not in a position to support and encourage small business in their local communities and councils that are unable to meet the growing demands of their communities because of cost-shifting with state governments. The state governments have to be brought into this as well. When I talk to local governments about regulation, they express their frustrations at the regulations they are required to administer. With a government that is pledged to end the ‘blame game', these forms of regulation reform at a local council level must be paramount, whether it is in the land use and development approval process, or whether it is in basic areas of food certification, qualifications, other forms of licensing and so on. These things need to be addressed to ensure that small business in this country can get a go. The measures that have been introduced by the government through the stimulus are concerning from many perspectives, but one is-as I have tried to make the point todaythat they have been a lost opportunity, I think, to engage the attention of local government on reform. The government have put their hand out with a cheque and they have offered no other incentive, encouragement, support or requirement to actually get on with the job of improving governance and financial management within that sphere. I suppose if you are going to be into the grand gestures and not reform, which is what we have seen in the budget announced last night, then I surely should not be surprised. If we are going to have a government which is big into the big announcements but which fall shorts when it comes to the hard lifting of reform-as this budget, I think, will be widely seen as doing-we really should not be surprised. When in government, we undertook the business of paying back $96 billion of debt-all paid back through surpluses, all paid back through hard decisions opposed by the then opposition. That was hard reform. That was hard reform which took a lot of work from the previous Prime Minister and the member for Higgins and their cabinet over many years-hard decisions, hard reform. They did not inherit the legacy that government inherited. They did not inherit a legacy of a surplus budget and many surplus budgets, of money in the bank, of the soundest set of books almost anywhere arguably in the developed world-and within the space of 18 months we are back in the pack. If you think that all the hard-won gains of the last 10 years simply fell from the sky, I suppose you can be forgiven for thinking that the budget will return to surplus with the casino-like projections in this budget. These things just happen to go in cycles. It does not require any effort to turn these things around. So on a wing and a prayer we will hope that the budget will return to surplus on the basis of a level of growth which is simply unprecedented over the sort of period outlined by the Treasurer. In conclusion, this bill simply tries to mask, rather pathetically, the size of this budget deficit. Through this bill, the government have kept it under $58 billion$57.6 billion. The true figure, if this measure had not been brought in today, would be over $58 billion. Whether it is $57.6 billion or $58 billion, or if it is $220 billion over the five years, it is a level of deficit which the Treasurer does not want to own up to and refuses to speak of in this place. It is time that this government started to be honest about the state of the nation's finances.",41
21,Ms KING,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Financial Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I welcome the contribution to this debate by the member for Cook. I suspect his saying that he believes the government's economic stimulus and the unprecedented level of investment we have made to local government has really just been a vending machine is going to go down just a treat with local government. This bill amends the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 and the Local Government this (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 to provide greater flexibility in assisting local government. The bill provides greater flexibility in the way in which grant payments can be made to local government through the states, increasing the capacity of the Commonwealth to respond to unique or special circumstances by making payments timelier than is currently allowed. Recent examples of the need to do this have included the bushfires in Victoria and the floods in Queensland. More broadly the global recession is placing added pressure on local governments. We have reports from the Australian Local Government Association that councils are facing increased defaults on rate payments, putting pressure on councils' revenue base and capacity to invest in infrastructure, particularly those sorts of projects which we know will stimulate local economies, ensuring that they are making their way through what is an unprecedented global recession. Local governments have a critical role to play in supporting local economies through this recession. Local government is a large employer, employing council workers from planners to rubbish collectors-around 168,000 people nation wide. Local government engages hundreds of independent contractors. Local government builds and maintains largeand small-scale social and community infrastructure and local government delivers vital social services from child care to home help and Meals on Wheels. This government has already made unprecedented levels of investment in financial assistance to local government, whether it be through increases in the Roads to Recovery program and in the Black Spot Program, where funding has nearly tripled, or through the one-off $800 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, with councils receiving a direct share of 137 strategic large-scale projects now being rolled out across the country. The act that provides Commonwealth funding for local government has, however, lacked the means to allow the Commonwealth to bring forward payments from a future year to the current year-a measure which, in times of crisis, helps local government to manage cash flow. As I stated earlier, the recent bushfires in Victoria and floods in Queensland are examples of a time when local communities need increased support and flexibility from the Commonwealth to help them deal with an unprecedented crisis. The councils affected warmly welcomed the opportunity to have funds brought forward to assist them. This bill seeks to address a new challenge-that is, the global financial crisis. The proposed amendments in the bill increase the government's flexibility to provide additional funding in a particular year, including by, in effect, bringing forward funding from a future year, when economic or other special circumstances arise. In the 2009-10 budget, the Rudd government has allocated $1.9 billion in financial assistance grants to assist councils and shires across the country to provide local infrastructure and other services. As a result of this bill, $479.7 million will now be brought forward and paid in the 2008-09 financial year to support local government jobs in this time of global recession. Local councils and shires will now be able to use these funds when they need them most to support their local economies, which are doing it tough in the global recession. Already across my electorate, and those of all members of parliament, councils and shires have been taking full advantage of the increased funding that this government has provided. A perfect example in my electorate is the progress of many projects that are already well underway. Across my electorate of Ballarat we have allocated unprecedented levels of funding: $2.2 million towards a community recreation facility at the Doug Lindsay Reserve in Creswick; $5 million towards the Eureka Centre for Democracy in Ballarat, which will form a partnership with the Australian Centre for Democracy in Canberra; $5.3 million extra to fix 18 black spots across the Ballarat electorate; $563,000 for 21 local infrastructure projects across Moorabool shire; $425,000 for four local infrastructure projects across Hepburn shire; $1.5 million for 11 local infrastructure projects across the City of Ballarat; and, under Roads to Recovery, $4.8 million for Ballarat, $3.5 million for Hepburn, $4.5 million for Moorabool and $4.9 million for Golden Plains. This funding is not just being rolled out across my electorate but in every electorate across the nation. The amount of funding which has been channelled through local government for local and community infrastructure, for road projects and much needed black spot funding, is unprecedented, more than we have seen in a very long time. It is on top of the financial assistance grants that are also provided to every council and shire across the country. With the introduction of this bill, councils and shires will now have Financial Assistance Grant payments accelerated. In my electorate this means over $2 million for the City of Ballarat, around $800,000 for Hepburn shire, over $1 million for Moorabool shire, and over $1 million for Golden Plains shire-much needed funding coming into the local economy, once again from the federal government, to stimulate our local economy. These funds are untied and can be used as determined by shires and councils on local priorities. The spending of these funds is in the hands of local government. This is good news for councils and shires right across the country. It will provide local economies with a boost in funds in the short term to assist in tackling the global recession. The government have introduced these changes because we know that no community is immune from the impacts of the global recession, and this is no more evident than in rural and regional Australia. We know that by assisting local councils and shires in a time of need we can support local jobs and local economies right across the country. The government showed in last night's budget that we are working to support every local economy across that nation. On top of the $1.9 billion in financial assistance grants, we also announced a record $350,000 for Roads to Recovery and $310 million to be allocated to major community infrastructure projects being delivered by councils and shires. Let me reiterate that no community is immune from this global recession. The government understand this, and I will continue to support measures that move to address this challenge right the way across our economy. I commend the bill to the House.",45
22,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (11.00 am)-in reply-The Financial Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 makes amendments to two acts. It amends the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 by providing a mechanism for the Commonwealth to make payments to states and territories to assist local government as soon as possible. The amendments provide a flexibility that is lacking in the current act. That flexibility is important. Local government faces its own challenges meeting the demands of the global economic recession. Our capacity to bring forward one quarter of the 2009-10 payments immediately, when the funding is most needed, is an important part of the government strategy to provide a targeted and timely economic response. Next year's payment will then be reduced by the same amount, with the grants paid over four quarters. This will ensure that local government will have a steady and predictable income stream from the financial assistance grants over the course of 2009-10. The second act amended by this bill is the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. The amendments will increase the general drawing rights from the COAG Reform Fund for the purposes of making grants of general revenue assistance to the states. The government looks forward to the passage of this bill within the current sittings of parliament to enable the Commonwealth to meet its budget commitments to provide general purpose financial assistance to the states and to help local government meet the economic challenges before us. I thank the members for their participation in the debate. The member for Ballarat has played a critical role as the chair of the House of Representatives committee which has considered funding for regional Australia through community infrastructure. That has been an important process in reforming the way that we deliver community infrastructure support in local communities. In the past we have not gone directly to local government; it has been bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra who have determined the outcome of programs such as the former government's discredited Regional Partnerships program. We on this side of the House have reformed this process so that local communities have their priorities heard by the federal government through their elected local representatives in local government. That has been an extremely important reform which has been welcomed by local governments right across the nation. The shadow minister made some comments, once again being critical of the regional and local community infrastructure program. I remind the House that every single local government area in Australia has benefited from that program, with $800 million record funding. There was $250 million allocated under the first round to all councils and shires across the country. Applications from all 565 councils and the ACT have been approved, and 3,220 community infrastructure projects were approved to the value of $250 million, with contributions from local government achieving a much greater economic stimulus than just that figure, but as part of the strategic component of that program we have also allocated $550 million for 137 projects around the nation. Those 137 projects have produced an economic stimulus of over $1½ billion. Each council was asked to submit their one priority to a value greater than $2 million, and projects right around the nation benefited: in cities, in regional communities, in every state of the Commonwealth and across all political affiliations-unlike the way the former government's projects were instituted through the Regional Partnerships program. The shadow minister was not there when I announced the project in Cook, in the Sutherland Shire, but in coming months when he walks outside his electorate office in Caringbah, he will see work taking place to upgrade the very suburban centre in which he has his electorate office. That is a part of the Sutherland Shire Council's project under this fund. That will stimulate jobs in the Sutherland Shire, stimulate the Sutherland Shire economy and make of Sutherland, Caringbah and that area a much better place for the community, and particularly for the small businesses in that area. But of course projects have been approved right across the board. Those opposite voted against this program. It was part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, the economic stimulus we put forward. They voted against it, but right around the country they have been turning up at launches. When they turn up at launches-whether it be the Leader of the Opposition with the Waverley pavilion refurbishment or whether it be the member for Gilmore, the member for Mallee or the member for Mayo-they are acknowledging that these local projects are a good thing for their local communities, which they are, but they voted against them. And still the shadow minister has come in here and been critical of this program. Their opportunism is there for all to see. The shadow minister also made a comment that this legislation which we have put forward was not asked for by local government, which of course would imply that somehow local government was not supportive of this reform. The ALGA press release of 12 May 2009 states the following: Local government funding weathers tough Budget Councils will also welcome early payment of the first installment of $479.7 million of $1.9 billion in Financial Assistance Grants to local government. As Local Government Minister Anthony Albanese said tonight: ‘No community in Australia is immune from the impacts of the global recession.' They then went on to say: In relation to community infrastructure, Australian communities are already beginning to reap the benefits of the $800 million Community Infrastructure Program, providing better facilities while stimulating local economies and creating jobs. That is what the peak organisation of local government has had to say about this legislation and about our financial support for local government at this difficult economic time. It contrasts markedly with the performance of the former government, which chose to fund private enterprises such as, infamously, the Indigo Cheese factory, which had shut down. It chose to fund that rather than fund community infrastructure through local government. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

24,Mr ROBB,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak on the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009. This bill is designed to strip $2½ billion out of the Education Investment Fund, a fund established with much fanfare last year. It is a bill designed to strip $2½ billion out of this education fund and direct those moneys to the funding of the new Clean Energy Initiative. The Education Investment Fund was explicitly created just 12 months ago for universities and for vocational education and training-two areas absolutely critical to our nation's capacity to increase productivity so that we can rebound as quickly as possible in the future from this economic malaise and repay the massive home-grown government debt being incurred by this reckless and panicked government. As well, universities and vocational education and training are two areas we were told ad nauseam were absolutely fundamental to the government's so-called education revolution. The government would not see this bill as anything of great moment. In the face of a $200 billion debt created in 12 months by this government, the government would say this bill is neither here nor there. But as one of the first bills introduced after the budget was brought down last night it is an ironic and powerful piece of symbolism. It captures the very essence of the budget. It is a snapshot, if you like, of the government's wider problems. This bill in a sense symbolises the loss of control of the nation's finances by this Labor government, the sense that this budget lacks coherence and gravitas, lacks any sense of the real problem that they are charged with tackling. The bill demonstrates the impact of Labor's reckless spending spree. The bill highlights one of the many ways our children will quickly start to pay the price of this massive debt with the lower priority given to education. The bill confirms Labor's lack of any long-term coherent plan for infrastructure. There is no sense of priority from one year to the next. The bill says that Labor's commitments cannot be trusted, even after being put into l-a-w law. The bill betrays a great measure of confusion and panic about this government. You get a sense of a government looking for a $2 coin under the lounge cushion, a government raiding the kid's piggy bank. You get this sense of panic and confusion. This government has lost control of the nation's finances. This bill flies in the face of all the government has said about infrastructure funds over the last 12 months. We had the Prime Minister on 25 August saying: … one of the main vehicles for turning ity around in the Budget was the announcement of a Building Australia Fund and an Education Investment Fund. Of course, these have been massively underspent compared with the handouts that have been provided over the last few months. So much for priority. And now they are raiding these very funds. On 21 May last year the Treasurer said: The fund will … ensure our education and skills needs are met in the long term. Of course, that was 12 months ago. The fund is now $4.5 billion smaller than provided for in the Treasurer's last budget. So much for those commitments. The Minister for Education on 13 May last year, in announcing this Education Investment Fund, said: The Rudd Labor government will transform Australia's higher education and vocational education and training … institutions over the next decade with a new $11 billion Education Investment Fund. Of course, it never got to $11 billion-$2 billion was taken out of it in the early stages. And now another $2½ billion is being stripped out of this fund. The minister went on to say: The Education Investment Fund is a major component of the Rudd Government's Education Revolution. It was a cornerstone of the education revolution. So much for these pious sentiments, these strong commitments. They have lived off this sort of rhetoric for 12 months, and then quietly, in a deep night, they run this bill into the House, 20 or 30 minutes after the budget has been released. The Minister for Education went on to say last year: This means that substantial investment can be made in our educational institutions in the coming years, transforming the capacity of these sectors productivto educate and train Australians. The bill totally undermines the minister's comment. It also undermines future comments by this minister and by the government and their commitment to the educational revolution. Having made a monumental mess of the introduction of computers in schools, they are now stripping fundsgenerated by the previous government, I might add-to use for other purposes. The funds are being used to cover their excessive, wanton and reckless spending; the tens of billions of dollars of handouts. We are now seeing the price being paid by our kids, by future generations, because of the lack of commitment and spending for university and vocational education. The minister also said on 13 May last year: Decisions about annual disbursements from the Education Investment Fund will occur through the annual appropriation process, which would ensure transparency and allow parliamentary scrutiny. Some very high sounding sentiments-the sorts of sentiments we have heard ad nauseam from all those on the other side, from all the ministers, on and on, about how they will ensure transparency and allow parliamentary scrutiny. These commitments are meaningless. How can you trust this? At 8.30 last night, this bill was introduced, half an hour after the budget was brought down. The bill runs counter to everything said for 12 months by this government about the priorities they are giving to education, how they will manage the finances of this country, about the commitments that people can assume are going to be followed through and about how they can plan future investments and other commitments because of the existence of these funds, which are now being stripped away for other purposes. This was all said for 12 months by this government and now, 15 hours after the budget, this bill is being rammed through this parliament. It makes a mockery of the commitments made by this government. This is Labor-style transparency and parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister for Education said on 13 May last year: The Future Fund Board of Guardians will sponsible for managing the fund. Well, the guardians have had the rug pulled from underneath them. Nearly half the money has gone from the fund without any commitment of those funds for education and vocational education. What is more, we are told in the budget papers, in the most sanctimonious terms, that the $2½ billion of funds being transferred to the Clean Energy Initiative will only be used: … subject to endorsement by the Education Investment Fund Advisory Board once suitable projects are identified. It is not apparent to me, and I suspect to the advisory board members themselves, what particular expertise these education advisory board members have with regard to carbon capture and storage, solar energy generation and any other clean energy project that may be identified in the future. As it stands, only $400 million of the $2.5 billion being stripped out of the education fund is committed to particular projects. The remaining $2.1 billion is yet to be allocated. I can sense, at the very least, major confusion having members of the education board-people presumably highly skilled and experienced in about education matters-now being required to endorse any transfer of funds ‘once suitable projects are identified'. What a nonsense. It does betray the confusion running through this government on all sorts of matters at every level. It is either confusion or a major snow job in the making. All of this demonstrates the impact of Labor's reckless spending spree. The $13.8 billion committed in last night's budget to be spent in total from the three infrastructure funds-$3.2 billion from the Health and Hospitals Fund, $3 billion from the Education Investment Fund and $7.6 billion from the Building Australia Fund-is less than two-thirds of the $22 billion spent in recent be remonths on Labor's cash splash, less than two-thirds of the $22 billion spent on handouts. The handouts have forced Labor to raid these funds for other initiatives. How short sighted to run out there with the handoutsthe cheques are still going out-and then be forced, in a matter of not even months later, to raid funds that were put in place 12 months ago which have been, in a rhetorical sense, committed to ever since. They are giving with one hand and taking away with the other. It makes a mockery of all that the minLabor ister has said about the education revolution program. The handouts have forced Labor to raid these funds for other initiatives. It demonstrates again the impact of Labor's reckless spending spree-what it has done to long-term planning, what it has done to sensible management of finances and government. Labor cannot even manage moneys given to them. Every dollar in those fundsevery dollar of that $13.8 billion-was generated and gifted by the Howard government to this government. They cannot even manage moneys given to them, much less generate moneys themselves. No fund or funding commitment anywhere across this government can now be trusted. Moneys could end up anywhere. Commitments, even commitments that have been legislated for, as we have seen with the education fund, are meaningless. Given that much of the foreshadowed investment takes place over the next seven, eight, 10 years, a lot of those commitments last night are many years away. With this money promised, committed, for long-term projects, what confidence can the community have that these projects will not be dropped or modified or dealt with in all sorts of ways in the years ahead in the wake of incompetent financial management? This bill also highlights how our children will start to pay the price, as they will for decades, for this massive debt. This is just one example-unanticipated, but one of many. Not only will the $9,000 debt hanging over every man, woman and child need to be paid off in the decades ahead but diminished investments and services will also eat into the opportunities and quality of life of our children and their children, as signalled by this raid on the education funds. This bill also confirms Labor's lack of any long-term, coherent plan for infrastructure. told us endlessly before the last election that they had a coherent, well-developed plan for Australia's major infrastructure. We heard it time and again, as it was one of their four planks on which they sought to win government. It was one of their major commitments-along with the education revolution, which is in tatters after last night's announcements. Here we are, 18 months later, seeing the first decisions about any major infrastructure-18 months after they said they had a plan. They said that they had worked out a plan, a comprehensive, welldeveloped plan for Australia's major infrastructure. We have lost 18 months during which major infrastructure projects could have been committed to and major infrastructure spending could have been well on the way. Last night's budget represents the first decisions about any major infrastructure project since this government took office, and most of the projects announced last night as being under consideration were advanced by the former government. The only money being spent is money generated and gifted by the former government. And the total spending on major infrastructure announced last night is dwarfed by the total moneys sent out in cheques as handouts. Where do the government's priorities lie? What is their focus? How can you have any confidence that this government understands the significance of spending every dollar as wisely as possible, during the worse financial crisis in 80 years, if we are to see maximum impact on productivity to help us to come out of this crisis-whenever the end occurs-and enable us to rebound quickly, ahead of the rest of the world? Now the funds that were to go towards advancing the productivity and the human capital of our young people are being raided, despite the comments of the Minister for Education after last year's budget: One measure in last week's budget-establishing the $11 billion Education Investment Fund-is indication of the long term perspective we are adopting. Labor has no coherent plan for infrastructure and no long-term perspective that anyone can have any confidence in. The approach of the government, as characterised by this bill, is no way to run our country. While the coalition will not stand in the way of this bill, we do express great consternation about what it represents. It represents the government's lack of any plan for recovery. It represents the government's lack of priority and its flip-flopping under pressure. The content of this bill demonstrates the impact of Labor's reckless spending spree. The bill represents the confusion and panic that appear to be gripping this government. The government's loss of control of the nation's finances is symbolised by this bill.",49
25,Ms BIRD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 before the House today. Before I proceed to discuss the reasons why I support the bill, I would like to address some of the issues raised by the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, particularly the way he addressed this bill and couched it in terms of what he claimed was the government's lack of coherence and planning in addressing the global economic crisis. I would say to the previous speakerexcept that he has now left the room, so I will say it on the record-that, in fact, quite the opposite is true. Let me deal firstly with his criticism of what he described as wasted cash payments-that is, the cash bonus payments made at the end of last year and in April this year. There is one reality about hard times, and that is that the confidence of the people in the community, on the ground in streets and suburbs, is one of the most critically important aspects of getting through difficult an economic times sustainably. If people are walking around their suburbs seeing shops boarded up and shutting down, if they are walking around seeing houses on the housing market sitting there with the ‘for sale' sign out the front month after month after month, unable to be moved, then the message at the community level in the towns and suburbs in which we all live will be that times are terribly hard and that they should contract their own engagement in the economy and their own spending in particular. It is critically important that governments intervene early to retain confidence amongst the population about our capacity to work through these difficult times. I have no doubt that the circumstances we face would have been far worse going into this budget if people in our communities had seen a large number of retail and hospitality workers out of work. Often employed as casual workers, they needed to get a level of income up to sustain them over the Christmas and Easter periods, the most critically important times for them, and their employment was supported by that cash bonus system. It may not be the employment area given the most attention, but in my area, in the seat of Cunningham, retail is the biggest employer. We talk a lot, and quite rightly so, about the challenges facing our steelworkers and our coalminers, but the largest employer in my region is retail. Those retail workers are by and large some of the most vulnerable workers in our communities. They are women and young people in particular. They have as much right as any other worker in our economy to expect the government to support and underpin their employment during difficult times. That is exactly what that injection of money did in our economy-it supported those workers and those sectors of our industries in every one of our electorates in an important way, and that was reflected in our quite amazing achievement of growth in the retail sector compared to the rest of world. So I really challenge the previous speaker's argument that that was wasted and I think it is a complete abrogation of responsibility to the retail and hospitality sectors, industries and small businesses, and the workers that are engaged in those sectors. The previous speaker did also say that we have lost 18 months in which we could have been progressing major infrastructure. I would simply say that I think that we have lost the last 14 years, during 12 of which they were in government. That is why it has taken us 18 months to progress on this stuff-because there was nothing done on infrastructure for so long. So it is a challenge sector. this government has taken up, and taken up successfully. This brings us to the bill which is before us today. The purpose of the bill is to repeal the credit of $2.5 billion from the 2007-08 budget surplus in the Education Investment Fund that was to have occurred on 30 June 2009, in order to make that finance available for the Clean Energy Initiative. This is an important commitment by this government and it does require, obviously, a redirection of funds. I think that the important thing to understand is that it does not, as the previous speaker claimed, indicate any lack of commitment to education and innovation by this government. There is still more than $6.5 billion in the Education Investment Fund for education and research infrastructure, of which $4.1 billion was committed in the budget last night, and also in the nationbuilding package that was announced by the Prime Minister in December 2008. The balance of $2.4 billion, plus investment earnings estimated to be around $630 million over the forward estimates, will be available for future education and research projects. I want to put on the record today my great pleasure in the important commitment in the budget last night to the University of Wolthe longong of $43.8 million for an Australian Institute of Innovative Materials at their Innovation Campus. This particular investment will have so many flow-through benefits to my own local area, where we are struggling with the impacts of the global economic crisis, because it does a number of things. Firstly, it strengthens the position we have been developing as an area of innovation in manufacturing technology. We have a great manufacturing base. We have tremendous manufacturing skills. We have a world-class university, and we are matching all those in order to develop a region people will look to for innovations in manufacturing across the I am a firm believer in the future of the manufacturing sector in our community. I was part of the economics committee that looked at a report for the former Treasurer before the election called Beyond the mining boom-and how little we understood how prescient the choice of that particular investigation was. One of the clear things that came out for manufacturing beyond the mining boom is that Australia is well positioned in problem-solving manufacturing. We will not compete on mass production manufacturing but in terms of specific projects, problem-solving projects, high-end technology based manufacturing, we are well positioned to be world leaders with our absolutely tremendous tradesmen-trained, I will plug, through the world-class TAFE system we have in this country and also extended through the solid engineering programs at our universities. This extension of that in our region will start to take that research at the university and turn it into generic prototypes which actually have the potential to develop new export markets and new manufacturing processes for our industry. This is a really important initiative. This budget delivered the most in one hit to our region that has ever been delivered in a budget. We do not often see solid amounts of investment into the Illawarra region-certainly not in recent times-but this was a real commitment to our region and it was very welcome. It should be noted that the government has also provided for a $12.4 billion long-term investment under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. It is very welcome in my area and across my electorate and Jennie George's electorate, with $50 million for our local primary schools. As a former teacher I am a profound believer that the environment you provide for young people in their schools sends a very strong message to them and their parents about how you value that education, and the facilities that they are working in are a major part of that. Full commendations to the Prime Minister for recognising that it is time to move the physical structures of our schools into the 21st century-it is a tremendous program. Also important is the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. Again, that provides $2.5 billion over the 10 years to enable all secondary schools to apply for funding for trade training centres. The Prime Minister was telling the Wollongong forum he attended on Monday with Jennie George and me about how he and Wayne Swan went back to the old trade centre at Nambour high and were quite horrified to discover it had not changed a single bit since they had been in it. I think he did say that Wayne Swan had passed that particular program and he had not. But it is very true: if we want young people to engage in the modern manufacturing development and trades sector then we have to provide them with modern facilities in the schools to do that. That is a tremendously important program. The reallocation of funds to the Clean Energy Initiative that is encompassed by this bill is really a significant direction for this country to go in. The government will be using this money to stimulate economic activity in a sector that will support new greencollar jobs. I want to commend that. In my own area, the South Coast Labour Council, under the leadership of Arthur Rorris, has been developing in conjunction with and with the support of the state government a green-collar future for the Illawarra positioning paper. I am sure Mr Rorris will be keen to have the federal government look at that as well. It is about, for example, creating industries in the manufacture of wind farms in the Illawarra region-matching our steel, our trade skills and our ideal positioning with port access with the capacity to be part of the growth of the wind energy sector. There are some really good initiatives, and this is exactly what the Clean Energy Initiative is about. It will support clean technology in industries and assist Australia's transition to a lower emissions path, a very important part of delivering on our commitment for 20 per cent of Australia's electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020. This objective supports the Renewable Energy Fund and the Energy Innovation Fund by efforts to encourage deployment of renewable technologies, including through the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, which I know is very welcome in our area and is part of the proposal of the Labour Council for developing some important pilot programs in our area. An important thing to acknowledge is that this component also includes $2 billion towards industrial scale carbon capture and storage flagship programs. My own area is a major coal mining area. While the vast bulk of our coal is utilised in the steelmanufacturing sector and not the energy production sector, we do understand how important this sector is to local economies and the need to find new, cleaner ways for coal fired power to be part of the solution into the future. That is what the development of these flagship programs delivers. I commend the bill to the House. I think it is a really important initiative. It does not indicate a lack of commitment to education at all; I would be the first to say so if I thought it did, given my background. It is an absolutely important initiative and I commend the bill to the House.",53
26,Mr OAKESHOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to also support the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009. I want to raise some points of concern for consideration, not so much by government but by the community, with regard to a lost opportunity over the last 12 months which is now seeing a significant amount of money-$2.5 billionset aside for the Education Investment Fund being redirected. I think it raises very real issues for Australia that the government should consider if they are serious and genuine with regard to the education revolution. The language I hear from this place, from peak organisations involved in the education sector and from many international voices in the education field is proving to be on many occasions at odds with and significantly different from the language that I hear in my home electorate from teachers, students and those who are, on a day-today basis, delivering on the front line of education. I am not giving an opinion one way or the other regarding which language is right, but there seems to be a significant disconnect between what is happening on the ground and how the government would like to see education delivered in Australia today. I therefore look at this shift of $2.5 billion as a lost opportumuch nity in the education field. Whether it is, once again, due to the lack of quality of submissions that have been put forward by the various education sectors throughout Australia in trying to tap into the mindset of government on the education revolution or whether there are other reasons is unbeknownst to me. But I do think it raises the point that here was an opportunity for good money to be spent doing good work in an area of much-needed government reform, the education field. We are now seeing that money being redirected away from an area in need of great support. Much is being done in the education field. In fact, from the various voices on the ground in the Lyne electorate, it would seem there is a deal of difficulty keeping pace with the amount of money that is being offered by government and the opportunities that are presenting themselves. It is certainly the desire of government to have the education revolution; however, as we are seeing with this bill, opportunities are being missed by communities such as mine on the mid-North Coast. So I hope this is not a dropping of the ball on the concept of an education revolution. I hope that what goes with this $2.5 billion redirection in the education field is instead some greater assistance to those on the ground to produce quality submissions, some greater assistance to the states and some pushing of the states to really consider the options now available in the education field as to how it is delivered. Hopefully, we will live in an era where the focus becomes more and more on student needs and student wants and on flexibility in delivering education in all its forms to students. Whilst I will be one accepting this shift, I am certainly disappointed that the shift is away from an area which is much needed within my region, so so that in my first eight months of being the federal MP we have set up two midNorth Coast education and skills forums, one in Hastings and one in Manning Valley, to try to really up the ante on the importance of education and skills development within our region. As I say repeatedly, our area has a comparatively low education level-and we do need to do a lot of work to improve thatand I do think it has direct correlations with our other comparative disadvantage figures. We have comparatively some of the lowest income levels throughout Australia. We have comparatively one of the highest unemployment rates throughout Australia-it is over the 10 per cent mark at the moment. We have comparatively some of the highest poverty levels in Australia-we are in the top 10 electorates on the poverty scale. These are all directly linked. The role that education can play is to offer that long-term structural meal ticket out of the poverty, unemployment and low-income traps. So I hope this is not a dropping of the ball by government on the value and importance of education to this country's future. As for the money that is going into the Clean Energy Initiative, I also hope that this is a genuine attempt by government to shape a future for this country that is as much as possible a clean and green energy one and to start a shift from a brown economy to a green one. I would be deeply distressed and concerned if it was about vested interests getting their claws into environmental policy, in particular the vested interests in the coal industry getting a green win through this redirection of dollars. I have raised this issue in the Main Committee in regard to $100 million in a recent appropriation bill being put into the carbon institute. I raised the question of the process of a significant amount of taxpayers' money going into what is at this stage still an unproven science. I was interjected upon by someone saying we need to prove it and that is why we are spending the money. I think an approach to public policy by government where significant taxpayers' dollars, 100 million of them, go into what is still an unproven science creates an extraordinarily poor precedent. I could come into government with a tray of cow manure and say: ‘I can turn this into gold. It is an unproven science at this stage but give me the money and I'll prove it up.' That is the type of logic behind what we are seeing and therefore I hope that this is not, once again, a failing, through poor public processes, in handling taxpayers' dollars. I hope that this concept of carbon capture and storage is not about vested interests but about the long-term future of this country. There are areas that deserve funding support for future activity. I mention Copenhagen in that context as I think there is some great potential as to that. If one thing comes out of that meeting at the end of the year it will be that a thing such as a tree in the ground prior to 1991 does have a value and that these arbitrary lines that have been drawn by developed nations-by which, for example, a tree only has value if it is planted post 1991, which I think came out of the Bali agreements-are flawed logic and do nothing to protect biodiversity, and therefore carbon storage, on a global scale. I note that there are various projects like the REDD projects around and that, for example, Macquarie Bank is investing in one in Cambodia. It would be great to see some of this activity happening in Australia. If this investment by government facilitates greater attention for the role of the public tree-its worth in being in the ground as well as its worth in being out of the ground, and its role not only in carbon capture but also in protection and promotion of biodiversity-then we are getting good economic and environmental outcomes all at the same time. It is the mandate of government, as part of the budget process, to see this redirection of funds. It is not for me to oppose that. I do think it flags some issues on both the education and the energy fronts. On the education front, I really hope, regardless of the global economic times or whatever else, that the language that we have heard and the commitment that we have seen in the first 18 months of this government continue. There is at times a need to drag the states and various providers by the ear to the table of genuine reform in the education sector. But it is important and good work-in many ways, the most important work that government can do for the future of this nation. So I hope this redirection away from the education field is not a dropping of the ball. I also sincerely hope that this redirection of money is focused on sequestration or pasture improvements, or what I have talked about regarding the public tree and the role that it plays in carbon capture and storage, rather than, once again, some vested interests getting a green-brown win out of government. In no way am I saying that the coal industry does not have a role to play or that the coal industry is not of value in Australia. But, if we are serious about shifting the direction of our economy to meet the needs of the future, vested interests must be kept at bay in this process.",56
27,Mr DREYFUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009. I think it is important that the context for this legislation and indeed the context for the budget that the Treasurer delivered last night be considered. We are experiencing the deepest global recession since the Great Depression and there are a few basic facts to be considered. The world economy will contract by 1.5 per cent. Other advanced economies are in deep recession. Australia is in recession. The economy will contract by 0.5 per cent in 2009-10. Unemployment is going to rise and the terms of trade are to fall significantly. The reason I start with those basic facts is that it is not possible or appropriate to approach legislation like this without considering the economic context that gives rise to the legislation and to the framing of the budget. This budget is about choices and priorities. Far from this bill exemplifying something wrong, as the member for Goldstein attempted to say, about the approach that the government has taken to the framing of this budget, this bill exemplifies the very stark contrast between the opposition and the government in relation to dealing with the economic crisis, difficulties and challenges that the government and the country are confronting. The Treasurer has delivered a budget that is designed to support jobs now and deliver the investments to increase Australia's productive capacity for future prosperity. I listened with care to the speech that was given on this bill by the Liberal infrastructure spokesman, the member for Goldstein, today. What was striking about it was that not once did the member for Goldstein talk about jobs. Indeed, the member for Goldstein spent the 15 minutes for which he spoke talking about debt and attempting to create the impression of confusion, lack of coherence or recklessness-those were the words that he repeated over and over in his speech. We had to wait until the very end of the member for Goldstein's speech to hear the economic context this budget consideration is about, not about debt or creating some spectre of confusion, but rather a response to a crisis. We had to wait until the last minute of the member for Goldstein's speech to hear him use the word ‘crisis', when he spoke of ‘enabling us to rebound out of this crisis'. The starting point for considering legislation such as this is the economic context-it is the fact that there is a global economic crisis. That is why I start my speech by referring to that economic crisis, because it is that which gives rise to the decisions that are reflected in this budget. It seems that those opposite are having a great deal of difficulty in facing up to the economic challenges confronting the nation. Only last week we heard from the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, who, extraordinarily, said: ‘It is inconceivable that we could have such a deterioration of employment in such a short time.' It is not inconceivable-because it is in fact happening. The response of those opposite would appear to be one of disbelief in the economic events that are unfolding across the world, which are having a far worse effect on other developed economies than has yet been experienced in Australia. We hope that, as a result of the decisions that are reflected in this budget, that will continue to be the case. But for those opposite the deterioration of employment, and apparently many other economic events, is inconceivable. We are yet to hear even the slightest level of coherence in any response by those opposite to this budget or to the economic decisions that have been taken by this government in recent months. Indeed, one would have to say that the response of those opposite to the present economic crisis is eerily reminiscent of the response of conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s, includingMr Katter-Hear, hear-absolutely correct. History repeating itself.",58
28,Mr DREYFUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is always nice to have agreement from the member for Kennedy. It is eerily reminiscent of the response of conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s-conservative governments, including in this country, which wanted to cut taxes, reduce government spending and allow wages to fall to, as they would have put it, ‘clear the labour market'. It appears that the conservatives on the other side of this House want to leave it to the market to sort out this crisis. They want to leave it to the market to do its worse to working families. That is not the response of this government; the response of this government is a coherent one which recognises a role for government and for economic stimulus and, in particular, recognises that economic stimulus can and should be delivered through infrastructure spending. This government understands the need to invest in infrastructure to improve our productive capacity. Again, it was striking, if not a little puzzling, to hear the member for Goldstein referring to ‘the lost 18 months when major infrastructure spending could have been committed to'. That is what the member for Goldstein said, apparently forgetting that after almost 12 years in government the record of the former government was one of near complete failure to invest in the infrastructure of this country at a time, indeed, of boom economic conditions. It needs to be recognised by those opposite-and indeed many of the commentators are recognising this-that Australia's fiscal response to this economic crisis has been heavily tilted in favour of investment spending. That has been confirmed by the OECD economic outlook interim report, released in March 2009, which said that the Australian fiscal response had been tilted in favour of investment spending to a much greater degree than in any other OECD economy. Under this budget, the government will deliver further infrastructure spending to protect jobs now and to build our economy for the future. It is worth mentioning a few examples of that. In relation to rail, $4.6 billion will be spent on more efficient metropolitan rail networks, which will deliver significant economic and social benefits through less road congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions and faster travel times for commuters. It is worth mentioning the $3.4 billion which will be spent for the Network 1 road freight corridor linking Melbourne and Cairns and the $389 million for port infrastructure to improve access to global markets for our export industries. These projects and others like them at a national level will reduce economic inefficiencies caused by the failure of the former government to invest adequately in the infrastructure platforms that Australia needs to build our future prosperity. I will now go to the local level, because there is no doubt of the worth in my electorate of the economic stimulus package and the infrastructure programs that have been announced and are being embarked on. There is no doubt in my electorate about this government's commitment to education. I will start with the first announcements that were made about larger buildings in schools under the Building the Education Revolution program. Schools in my electorate have received almost $22 million in funding under round 1. It is worth bearing in mind that those opposite in this House-the Liberal Party and the National Party-are opposed to this program. They are opposed to the construction of new buildings in every single primary school across Australia. They are opposed to the construction of new buildings in primary schools in my electorate, but the students, parents and teachers-the entire community-of my electorate have no doubt about the worth of that infrastructure spending or about the commitment of this government to education. I should mention also the local infrastrucfor ture spending that is being delivered in my electorate through local councils. On Monday last week we announced that the City of Greater Dandenong has been given $7.27 million for a complete reconstruction of the Noble Park Swim Centre. No-one in my community is in any doubt about the worth of that kind of infrastructure spending. This is a pool which was built some 50 years ago, and very little has been done to it since that time. It is very much an important centre for community activity. It is much loved and is well used and it will be rebuilt in its entirety as a result of infrastructure funding that has been made available by this Labor government. Another of the councils in my electorate, the City of Kingston, has been given $2.97 million for the substantial improvement of an equally valuable existing facility: the Kingston Heath Soccer Complex. Through that improvement and rebuilding work, the usefulness of that facility to the community will increase. There are other programs that are worth mentioning that demonstrate the commitment of this government to providing infrastructure funding. This infrastructure funding not only provides an immediate economic stimulus, which is an approach to the management of the economy that is accepted by governments of developed countries across the world, but also provides valuable infrastructure that will serve our country in the future. In last night's budget, it was announced that funding will be made available for the Altona-Laverton precinct, which is on the western side of Melbourne, and, connected to it in a functional sense, the Dandenong intermodal terminal, which is in my electorate in south-east Melbourne. That is a very important project. It demonstrates a commitment to planning, to foresight, to thinking the long term about the urban infrastructure and the transport infrastructure of Melbourne. It looks at the long term in relation to possible projects such as the expansion and development of the port of Hastings, a project which recognises the growth constraints and limitations that are faced by the port of Melbourne. Part of that long-term thinking involves developing a Dandenong intermodal terminal, which is a project that already being worked on by the state Department of Transport, partnering with the Commonwealth government and the private sector on the development of what will be a Melbourne freight terminal network. It is going to involve the enhancement of rail connectivity to the Somerton and LavertonAltona intermodal terminals, the port of Melbourne and a new Melbourne freight terminal in the Dandenong area. This is not in anyMr Katter-What is exported through those areas?",59
29,Mr DREYFUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am asked by the member for Kennedy what is exported through these areas. The port of Melbourne is recognised to be Australia's largest port in terms of freight. It has reached its limitsMr Katter-Importing, but not exporting.",61
30,Mr DREYFUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Exporting as well as importing. The Port of Hastings, of course, is very important for exporting as well. The manufacturing products that are exported from the very large manufacturing centres in my electorate, both in Dandenong South and Braeside-to answer the member for Kennedy's question-use the port facilities in Melbourne. In the next decades when the Port of Hastings is expanded they will no doubt be able to use the facilities of the of Hastings as well. This is long-range planning. The government is showing its commitment to forming relationships with private enterprise and with state governments to ensure infrastructure is well planned vided for. There are other aspects of this budget which demonstrate the government's commitment to providing economic stimulus and at the same time useful infrastructure for Australia. I could speak of the Clean Energy Initiative, which shows how the bill that is presently before the House, like the budget is as a whole, is about priorities. The Labor government understands the need for Australia to shift to a low-carbon-pollution economy, to help build an economy with green jobs for the future. We see in the Clean Energy Initiative a commitment of $2 billion for carbon capture and storage and clean coal. Carbon capture and storage demonstration projects will support the development of industrial scale use of carbon capture and storage technology in Australia. There should be no doubt about the commitment of this government to using infrastructure funding, economic stimulus funding, for this kind of purpose. The budget also contains renewable energy projects, which includes $1.5 billion for up to four large-scale solar electricity generation projects and $465 million to establish Renewables Australia, which is an independent body which is to be set up to support leading-edge renewable technology resources. Those two initiatives will help to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will come from renewable energy by 2020. Concentration on building those renewable sources is a key part of a response to climate change. Those are initiatives that build on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, legislation for which is now being considered; the $500 million Renewable EnPort ergy Fund to develop, commercialise and deploy renewable energy in Australia; $150 million for solar and clean energy resources; and more than $500 million for the Solar Cities, National Solar Schools and Green and pro- Precincts initiatives. It would seem from the response of those opposite-as indeed it would seem from their response to the budget as a whole-that they are unable to consider the full economic context in which this bill and the budget measures as a whole have been framed. Those opposite, it seems, cannot lift their eyes beyond the government benches, where they would like to be. They cannot look beyond this House to the wider world-indeed, to beyond our shores-where there is a global economic crisis occurring that is affecting the Australian economy and will continue to affect the Australian economy. The government is engaging in prompt and decisive action on the effects of the global economic crisis on Australia. This bill is part that response. I commend the bill to the House.",61
31,Mr KATTER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I was very pleased to be able to listen to the speech of the previous speaker, the member for Isaacs. He is an intelligent observer and an intelligent member of parliament, and I think he is very conscientious as well. But he has said that the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 will mean less time wasted in cars, that car-idling time will be saved, that there will be more of a free flow of information via the broadband, that there will be swimming pools, that there will be more space in our classrooms, that there will be better traffic flows in outer Melbourne and that there will be more port facilities exported manufactured goods. I am rather curious to know what manufactured goods we export and what we would have in the past. Clearly we cannot compete against cheap labour in a lot of the Asian countries. They still have very cheap labour. They have economies of scale that we can only dream of. They have captive home markets, through tariffs, of hundreds of millions of people. We have no captive home markets. We have no tariffs. But, even if we did, we only have 20 million people. So we have no economies of scale. They have government-provided capital. If they want to build a factory, the government provides them with the money to build it. We have got none of those things. We cannot possibly compete in manufacturing. To say that you want to expand a port for manufactured items is quite ridiculous. To give you specifics on my contention, I can talk about the motor vehicle industry. Seventy-two per cent of the motor vehicles purchased in Australia were Australian made in 1984, before that ratbag Mr Keating introduced his free markets. It was not a ratbag of idea but it was a ratbag idea when nobody else in the world was doing it. It was an incredibly disastrous move when nobody else in the world was doing it. But he could not be told, he would not listen to reason and he would not look at reality. So now we have only 19 per cent-I have not got the latest figures but two years ago only 19 per cent of the cars purchased in Australia were Australian made. Over the next 10 years, on present trends, it will be only five per cent. So I do not know why you are expanding the port down there. The Liberals told me when they were building the railway line through the centre of Australia that it was going to cut the cost of imports dramatically. I said, ‘Oh, it's a subsidy for imports,' and no-one at the for table laughed. It was quite extraordinary to me. I thought it was quite a good joke. But nobody laughed. They took it quite seriously. Was the previous speaker erudite? Yes. Intelligent? Yes. Conscientious? Yes. I turn to the issue of green jobs. You must understand that if you want solar powerand I am not saying it is not a desirable social or environmental aspiration-you will be less competitive and all of your industries will be running on an extra handicap. Not only do we not have the cheap labour, not only do we not have the economies of scale and not only do we not have government investment but now we are asking them to run on a handicap. Let me be very specific. I was the Minister for Mines and Energy in Queensland and I secured the national prize for science in 1985 or 1986. As the minister, I personally won the national prize for science for the solar energy that we put into the first stand-alone system in the world on Coconut Island. So I speak with some considerable authority in these areas. I had a $30 lion decision to make, which in terms of today's money would be probably the best part of $100 million, in electrifying the Torres Strait islands. In that situation it is cheaper, on an isolated island in the Torres Strait, to put in solar power. But $140 to $200 a megawatt is the cost of solar or wind power. The cost to grid system power is $40. If you want to render every single industry in this country non-competitive, then go down that pathway. We have people who stand up here and say, ‘Oh, we will have 20 per cent renewables; isn't that wonderful and marvellous?' Yes, it is, but you just put the job of every single person in this country at risk. This is because you have made their industry-whether it is manufacturing, mining or agriculture-less competitive. You have put another handicap on the runners here in our country. Just how much burden do you think they can carry before they fall over? Look at the car industry and look at the agricultural industries of Australia and you will see that the last government, and the government before it, placed such a burden upon our industries that they are now falling over. It is no use the opposition coming in here and saying what remarkably wonderful economic performers they were. Yes, they balanced the government budget, and they deserve credit for that, but did they balance the country's budget? No, it was the most unbalanced budget in Australian history. The current account deficit was running at levels that simply could not be comprehended by anyone that had followed Australian economic history for any period of time. The previous speaker, the member for Isaacs, also commented upon that fact. It troubles me deeply that the opposition is constantly attacking the government for spending money and deficit budgeting. I do not know whether these people are economically illiterate, but let me just compare three mil- countries: Canada, New Zealand and Australia-dummies. The colonial pock marks were flashing in neon lights in 1932. Hjalmar Schacht took the Germans on an expansionary policy, John Maynard Keynes took Great Britain on an expansionary policy and Shikata, the Japanese economist, took Japan on an expansionary monetary policy. America, belatedly, went on an expansionary policy. The only three countries on earth that did not-the three dummy countries-were Canada, New Zealand and Australia. You can go down to the library and get any of the books out on the Depression and look at the graphs for those three countries. The last speaker said that they are advocating exactly the same policies that they advocated in 1932. That is correct. It is really scary. They have learned absolutely nothing. They plunged Australia into the worse possible depression on earth. There is not another country in the world where anyone is advocating deflationary or non-spending policies. If the opposition were concentrating their attack upon the government and this nationbuilding amendment, as a government you have really got a hide to call this ‘nation building'. Building bikeways and putting insulation batts into your roof is not nation building. It is anything but nation building. I have just done a series of interviews with the media-I do not know how much media we get out of these things-and I have said that if you want to see whether this is a nation-building budget look no further than the allocation of money for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. That is a nation-building department, a producer department. It has been reduced from $3,000 million to $2,000 million. On the other hand, an anti-nation-building department is the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, whose job it is to stop us from building anything in this nation. I can give you a thousand examples from my own backyard without drawing breath. The department that stops things from happeningand, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would be an expert in this area-has had its budget increased from $4,500 million to $6,000 million. So we have a budget and an amendment in the House touted as nation building which increases the money for the anti-nationbuilding portfolios and decreases it for the nation-building portfolios. This is Nineteen Eighty-Four-the brave new world is with us. If ever there was a case of doublespeak, it has to be calling this ‘nation building'. It behoves me to point out to the House what nation building is, because clearly the opposition have no understanding of it whatsoever. In 13 years they never did one single dollar of nation building. The government have been there now for half their term, 18 months, and they have clearly demonstrated in this budget and in this amendment before the House that they simply do not understand what nation building is. I will tell you what it is. Nation building is Ted Theodore, the most important man in Australian history, using government money to build all of the sugar mills in Australia. They were almost all built with government money. That is nation building. There are 40,000 Australians employed in those sugar mills today as a result of the great wisdom and perspicacity of that one man and his enlightened governments, the early Labor governments of the last century. Ben Chifley-probably the greatest Prime Minister we have had in this country, excluding Jack MCEwen because he was there for only a brief period-built the Holden motor car factory with government money. It was not GMH money; it was government money. That was nation building. That factory is still there today employing 5,000 or 6,000 Australians. It is still making most of the cars produced in Australia. The building of the Snowy Mountains hydro, which is producing cheap, clean energy for Australia-and will do so forever-was built by Ben Chifley and government money. Governments do not build power stations in Australia any more. If you ask commerce to build a power station, it will build a power station where it has customers. There were no customers for the Snowy. It was built in the hope that customers would come. Massive areas came under irrigation. The great agricultural juggernaut of Australia took off with the diversion of those waters providing secure water supply to all the farmers along the Murray River. The vast bulk of Australia's agricultural production comes from that area and security of production was provided by water from the Snowy. It was all government money, but in the last 22 years we have not built a dam in Australia-not one single dam. Not one single factory of any significance has been built with government money in this country. When I was a young man, just elected to parliament, the government of Queensland was in the process of building a giant power station that did not have a single customer. Not one single megawatt of that 1,400 megawatts of electricity had a customer. Queensland built a giant railway line to a little siding called Blackwater. There was not one single mine out there to service that railway line. That would be unthinkable today. People would expect private enterprise to build it. In that day and age, governments built them because they had confidence in our country. That was nation building. As a result of that giant power station and that giant railway line, Australia today has a coal industry and an aluminium industry. Ms George-And a steel industry.",62
32,Mr KATTER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is a very good contribution from the honourable member for Throsby, who knows this well. The steel industry is there because the federal government of the day, under John Button-who was sacked really for what he did here, I might add-put some $500 million behind John Prescott and his initiatives in conjunction with the steel industry of Australia and made us the most competitive steel industry in the world. They took us from 70 tonnes per man per year not to the world's best of 240 but to 700 tonnes per man per year. That is how efficient that industry was under the enlightened government. That is nation building but there is nothing in this budget. The member for Isaacs went through it all. There is solar and wind power-that is very nice, it will help the environment. I am not condemning it; I am just saying do not call it nation building. It is a lie to call that nation building. Do not say that green jobs are nation building. That is nation destruction. That will take jobs away. If you demand that we do it this way, when the electricity costs are going to be $200 instead of $40 a megawatt, you will be closing industries all over Australia-if you proceed down that path, which the government seems determined to do. And sure, it is nice to have bigger classrooms for our kids-although, when we are having fewer kids, I would wonder about the wisdom of going in that direction. It is nice to have swimming pools, it is nice to cut our traffic flow times in the cities-those are all nice things, but do not call them nation building. They are not nation building. Let me tell you what nation building is. Nation building is just providing approval for us to build a dam where all the water is in Australia. Three-quarters of our water is in the north of the continent, which, except for a tiny belt of sugar cane on the coast, produces virtually no agricultural production. We are trying to do all the agricultural production down south where there is no water. This is extraordinary. Just give us an approval for 120,000 hectares of irrigation and let us be nice to the greenies and the environment because it will be producing ethanol. As Mr Gore said in his book An inconvenient truth, his first solution is ethanol. He said it reduces CO2 by 29 per cent. Sugar cane does not reduce CO2 by 29 per cent; it reduces it by 194 per cent because we do not plough. We do not put the steel through the ground or we do it once every six years. Unlike growing corn, where you have to put the steel through the ground four or five times a year, with sugar cane we put it through once every five or six years. So the benefit for the environment is ginormous here-ginormous! Just as good, the bagasse-what is left after you take the sugar out and turn it into ethanol-is then burnt to produce power. We can produce 25 per cent of North Queensland's power and about four per cent of Australia's power, which would be clean renewable energy. Bagasse is like ethanolyou burn it, CO2 goes up, but the next year every hectare of sugar cane pulls 73 tonne of CO2 back down out of the atmosphere and into the ground. So instead of it going up and staying there, it is now going around in a circle and that is what we mean when we talk about renewables. Just give us the approval because the project will pay for itself. It would be nice to give us some of the superannuation money and to give us 10 per cent ethanol in our petrol instead of what the last government did, which was to give us a tax on ethanol-and Australia is the only country in the world to tax ethanol. We can do this one ourselves. Just give us the approval. Probably everyone in this chamber would be familiar with Joe Gutnick. He is a very prominent man in industry and commerce in Australia. He wants to build a phosphate mine with money from India. India has a huge population to feed. They must fertilise their fields every year. They do not particularly like the Americans; they do not buy fertiliser from the Americans. They most certainly will not buy it-for religious and conflict reasons-from the Moslem or Arabic countries. They buy most of it from Russia at the moment but they are going to buy it from Australia. They are going to buy it from their own mine, which Joe Gutnick is setting up here in Australia. That is where they will get their superphosphate from. Even if dumb government does not force them to do some upgrading in Australiaeven if that does not happen-we will still probably get $3,000 million a year out of this project. If it is done the way that I would to see it done, with a third of that being forced to be processed here in Australia, we will get $5,000 million a year. But that mine cannot go ahead without increasing rail capacity through an upgrading of the line from Mount Isa back to Townsville, and it cannot be done without north-west Queensland-the biggest mineral province on earth, producing $15,000 million a year-getting electricity capacity. What we say is: ‘Give us that transmission line and we will give you an extra $5,000 million a year in income for the Australian economy. Give us that rail capacity'-and both these things will cost no more than $200 million or $300 million-'and we will give you $5,000 million a year in income for the Australian economy. That will give you back in taxation revenue $1,500 million a year, at the very least.' That is the sort of logic used by the great men of Australian history-the men whose pictures we have up on our walls, like Theodore, Ben Chifley, Jack MCEwen and Bjelke-Petersen. Those were great men who created the wealth that we enjoy here in Australia today. (Time expired)",65
33,Ms GEORGE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is always a difficult challenge to follow the member for Kennedy. There is much in what he said that I share concern about, and I am pleased that the member for Kennedy, like the member for Throsby, has in mind other major important national infrastructure projects that we hope one day will see the light of day. But at this point of time we are debating the commitments that the government made in terms of giving priority to the major national projects that have been recommended by an independent statutory authority. I think the member for Isaacs was right about this debate on this bill: we have to like consider the economic context in which these commitments are being made. And shame on the opposition for their huge emphasis on the issue of debt rather than understanding that the nation needs major productive investment in infrastructure to address precisely the impact of the recession on our nation. We are not immune from it. And, very importantly for regions like mine that are very reliant on the trade exposed sectors-particularly in coal and steel-those impacts are being very severely felt. This government's main objective, as has been stated repeatedly, is to do whatever we can to protect the jobs of today while building the productive capacity of the nation's economy into the future-a task which was beyond the wit of the Howard government for the 12 years that it was in office. Very importantly, the government has made a substantial investment as part of the long and proud history of Labor governments investing in important nation-building projects. The Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 gives effect to the commitment that was announced by the Treasurer last night. I certainly beg to differ with the member for Kennedy; of course you have to describe it as nation building, because the $22 billion has been allocated to build the transport, communications, energy, education and health infrastructure that this nation desperately needs to ensure a healthy and vibrant economy into the future. It was because the former Howard government was asleep at the wheel-and did nothing in a fundamentally important way to tackle the constraints on economic growth that were so obvious in all the bottlenecks around the nation-that we moved very quickly, through the infrastructure minister, to think about planning, financing and building vital economic infrastructure for our nation. I think it was one of the greatest achievements in the early days of our government to introduce the legislation to create the independent statutory authority, Infrastructure Australia. That legislation was sented to this parliament in our first 100 days. And I think it is a great achievement that in a very short period of historic time12 months or so-Infrastructure Australia has undertaken the first ever economic audit of the nation's key economic infrastructure. Last night we saw the end result of an assessment process that looked at more than 1,000 possible projects. The fact that 1,000 projects were submitted to Infrastructure Australia for consideration surely highlights the huge deficit in investment in infrastructure that we had under the former government. I am delighted that through our Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 we will give effect to very important infrastructure projects. There will be $4.6 billion invested in improving metropolitan rail networks in six major cities. I sat with the now Leader of the Opposition on the environment standing committee of the House of Representatives, and we produced a very important report called Sustainable Cities. We did not have the courtesy of a response from the Howard government to the recommendations in that report but I think everyone on that committee understood the importance of investment in public rail networks. And, finally, $4.6 billion will see six major cities being able to address the very important issue of rail networks. A further $3.4 billion will be invested in Australia's busiest freight route-the links between Melbourne and Cairns-and key roads feeding into that national highway also get a substantial boost in the announced priorities of yesterday evening. Three hundred and eighty-nine million dollars is allocated to lifting the export capacity in two of our ports-one in Western Australia and one in the Northern Territory. I was particularly interested because I think this is a critical element of nation building, and I was interested to the extent that my pre- colleague the member for Cunningham has taken the lead in getting community support and an analysis of what we believe will be a very important rail freight link for the Illawarra region, known as the MaldonDombarton rail freight link. Of course, in the 12 years of the Howard government there was no mention of what we might do to expand the export capacity of the port at Port Kembla, nor any consideration of the important road and rail linkages that would need to be provided to ensure a bright future for that region and a meaningful economic investment. It was only this government, in the lead-up to the election, that committed itself to a prefeasibility study, which has been worked on. Like the member for Kennedy, we cannot have every project funded immediately, but my understanding is that Infrastructure Australia will continue to consider projects of national significance, and it is certainly our intention to do what we can to provide the arguments in support of projects that we believe will be of lasting benefit to the Illawarra region. The member for Isaacs indicated in his contribution that we have to acknowledge that this is the third tranche of the government's economic stimulus strategy, and my region has benefited enormously from the investments we have made to date. In the first round of the community infrastructure funds, the three local councils received $3.3 million for a range of infrastructure projects. In my electorate there were nine projects funded. On the boundaries of the Wollongong City Council and in the electorate of Throsby, there are important upgrades for Dapto plaza and for sporting facilities, with commitments to upgrade lighting at Reed Park and Darcy Wentworth Park. The Shellharbour local government area will receive almost $900,000, again for a very important community project, the Myimbarr Community Park. Seven projects in the Kiama local government area will be funded. Last week we were very lucky to have the Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery come to announce even more funding-another $5.2 million for our region. Shellharbour City Council is receiving $2.3 million for a much overdue upgrade of the streetscape and the business centre at Albion Park, and the Wollongong City Council will get $2.9 million for the Blue Mile project. Although it is a little bit out my area, let me say that even though the member for Gilmore, along with her colleagues, voted against our economic stimulus package I was pleased that she came to the announcement of $4 million for Shoalhaven City Council for a youth centre in Ulladulla dedicated to the memory of two young men from that area who tragically perished in the Bali bombings. So in the order of $8.5 million has been provided and invested in local community infrastructure that will not only improve the amenity for the people that we represent but, very importantly, provide a stimulus for sustaining and wherever possible creating employment opportunities. On top of that, Illawarra has been designated as one of seven priority regions because of our high rates of unemployment, and already both the member for Cunningham and I have been meeting with a range of groups to progress further funding to address the unemployment issue. Some of those projects will no doubt be infrastructure projects that will be available under the announced jobs fund. So that is going to be very, very welcome. On top of that, within this bill, there is the Education Investment Fund. I want to particularly mention the enormous contribution that the commitment to Building the Education Revolution is having in my electorate, as the member for Isaacs pointed out for his electorate too. Last night we were delighted to hear that the University of Wollongong was to receive $43.8 million for a state-of the-art building for our renowned Institute for Innovative Materials in Wollongong. That comes on top of an earlier commitment of $38 million to build for this nation the first-ever tertiary institute known as the SMART Infrastructure Facility, which I think is going to be of enormous benefit, attracting academics under the one roof to focus on of methodologies and the science of infrastructure development and funding. So one university alone in our region will receive $82 million in the space of a few months. I know from the vice-chancellor that last night's announcement will immediately lead to about 200 jobs in the construction phase and probably 100 to 150 sustainable jobs, apart from attracting the brightest minds to our region with the prospect of commercialisation of the wonderful innovations and technologies that are being developed at the university. For my local TAFE, the Shellharbour TAFE-good on you, folks-there is $6½ million. You are a great institute and we are going to develop a top rate children's services facility at that campus. That is going be of great benefit to school leavers in the Shellharbour area, where we suffer high rates of youth unemployment, because, as people would be aware, if you are undertaking a diploma course in children's services the government will waive the state training fee. I could not be more happy about that. This comes on top of almost $50 million that we have announced in the last couple of weeks for 23 schools-10 in my electorate, 13 in Cunningham; 23 schools-in those two electorates. That was for round 1, for 20 per cent of primary schools under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. I would imagine that somewhere in the order of $250 million all up will flow through rounds 2 and 3. So people need to realise that this investment in our university, in the Shellharbour TAFE last night and in our primary schools will, conservatively, inject $340 million into education infrastructure in the region of Illawarra that we represent. That is a huge investment. It is going to be a huge stimulus for local jobs, for local tradesarm's people, for local small businesses, for local suppliers, as well as leaving our schools in a state where they are better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. I want to place on record my acknowledgement of the enormous importance of that kind of stimulus through education that we are seeing in our region. It is interesting, the papers only think about infrastructure in terms of roads and railways. And yet, if I had said last $340 million for a local road, it would have been front-page news. While $340 million into education infrastructure probably does not register to the same extent, we should understand that investment in infrastructure under this government goes way beyond just the traditional notions of road and rail. Finally, I want to also indicate that I am very pleased that, in the context of this bill, to we are going to substantially increase our investment in the clean energy and renewable sector. As members would be aware, I represent a region that is heavily reliant on coal and steel, but do not underestimate the intelligence of people in those industries about the need for this nation to move to a carbon constrained future. Because of our manufacturing expertise in the Illawarra, we are going to be very well placed as we move in that direction-that is, providing the know-how through our university and our technical skills and hopefully growing new orders for our steelworks, which will go to the heart of moving the economy into a more carbon constrained future and, with that, seizing the enormous opportunities that will come from the growth of the renewable energy sector. You cannot fail to recognise the enormous potential that is going to be created by the world moving in that direction, and we want to maximise the capacity for sustainable green jobs in our economy. The Renewables Australia body will be at length from government and will be particularly focused on matters relating to the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energies. Let me just say, our university is doing wonderful things in solar technology, so they will be pleased to hear this announcement. It will give them some impetus to continue on in that work. We will invest in four new commercial scale solar flagship projects; the contribution that night solar can make, among a raft of renewable technologies, is incredibly important. Very importantly for a region like Illawarra and other regions heavily reliant on coal, the commitment to the technological breakthrough in carbon capture and storage is very important. It is important to our nation's economic well-being, it is important to our export trade and it is important for sustaining regional communities and regional employment. So I am very confident that we can protect the jobs of today, that we can begin to transform our industries so that they meet the challenges of a more carbon constrained future and that we can generate new green jobs into the future. The commitment to a 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020 is just the kind of impetus that sector needs. In conclusion, full marks to the Treasurer, to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and to the Minister for Education and Deputy Prime Minister. Well done in showing the community that despite the worse downturn we have seen in 75 years, this government will not be deterred from investing in the infrastructure vital to Australia's term economic prosperity. The former government was asleep at the wheel; this government is determined to ensure that the productive investment that underpins our prosperity and underpins jobs is centre stage in this budget and in our commitment into the future. I hope that, despite the negative commentary we heard this morning from the member for Goldstein, the coalition is sensible enough to understand that this package is all about supporting jobs at a time when that support is needed most, as well as boosting productivity in the longer term. I am enormously proud that our second budget builds on Labor's proud tradition and proud history of nation building. I commend the bill to the House.",66
34,Mr BILSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Dunkley) (12.50 pm)The opposition will not oppose the Nationbuilding Funds Amendment Bill 2009, but it will certainly open people's eyes to what the bill is actually about. Those listening to the broadcast or reading Hansard could be forgiven for wondering just what the bill is supposed to be achieving. For the purposes of assisting the House, I remind people that this is not about many of the things that many people have talked about; this is actually a raid on the Education Investment Fund, taking money out of that fund and putting it into the clean energy initiative special account. That is essentially what this bill is about. The rest of the discussion and book-ending of that very simple proposition-using the flowery rhetoric and bold ambition and postit note politics that we have come to recognise from the Labor Party-have not disguised the fact that that is what the bill is about. The bill is about taking that money, which is money that, just a year ago, we were told in this parliament was going to achieve all of the things that now it obviously does not need to achieve because there is some other longway of going about it. It is quite a remarkable transformation in the rhetoric of the Labor Party, and it underlines the fact that this is a government with a plan for its own political interests but no plan for the country, no strategy for our nation, its economic recovery and its future prosperity, only a strategy to save its grubby political soul. That is all we see, and this is another example of it. Let me illustrate that point. This bill takes funds out of the education infrastructure fund. The $2.5 billion that was credited to that fund under the 2007-08 budget surplus-a surplus built on Howard government economic management, a surplus that has given scope for the Rudd government to do many things that they would never have been able to do had they been at the helm of our economy-and was to have been transferred by 30 June this year is now going not to the Education Investment Fund but to a new fund. The original decision and announcement that were made 12 months ago and then backed up by successive pronouncements by the Rudd government ministers were designed to recognise, and I quote from the Treasurer, ‘a strongly held conviction of the Rudd government that education is the engine room of a more productive, more modern economy'. There is example after example of Rudd government ministers and the Prime Minister himself going on about just how crucial, just how fundamental, just how conviction-driven they were about the Education Investment Fund being the engine room for a more productive, more modern economy. What we are seeing in this bill is money coming out of the fund that was supposed to be the engine room for a more productive, more modern economy, the main vehicle for turning around the economic fortunes of the country, or so the Rudd government said less than a year ago. That money has now been pinched and it is going into something else. Why would that be? Could it be that, maybe, the rhetoric was a tad overblown, that the plan was not clear? The powerful words, ‘The Education Investment Fund would be the horsepower in the engine room for a more productive, more modern economy,' are what we were told. The Treasurer said that in May last year, successive ministers went on about it throughout the last quarter of 2008, and you even saw some of those themes recurring over and over again in the political line of the Labor Party. Obviously that is not the case anymore because the money is going, it is getting pinched and not going to that purpose. It is no longer the engine room of a more productive, more modern economy. That is not what the Education Investment Fund is about, as the money going to it actually presents a ferent picture. There is now another purpose. You have heard Labor members in this place talk about a whole range of other things that that money would be spent on to achieve that purpose. What are we to take from that? Are we to take it that there is not great coherence in the Rudd government economic strategy? I think we can. How can something be so profoundly true, accurate and insightful-and shouted from the rooftops of this parliament and from any stump that Rudd government ministers could get on-a year ago and yet not be now? I think it highlights the fact that the Rudd government do not have a coherent economic strategy. Their tactics are to keep announcing new things so that there is never any analysis, never any reflection, never any assessment of just whether the words actually mean anything and whether the actions follow up this soaring rhetoric. This is further evidence that Labor can talk a good game but cannot manage the economy. If we needed any more stark evidence of that, last night's budget gives Australia a very, very open-eyed look at just what kind of government we have at the moment. Last night's budget takes Australia from being alert and anxious about the Rudd government's economic competence and their ability to manage our nation's finances to being genuinely and justifiably alarmed-so frightened that the Treasurer tried on an old television ‘time to look away' warning so that viewers who may have found some of the images disturbing or some of what is really going on in the budget profoundly distressing had time, a chance, an opportunity, to look the other way. Treasurer Swan's ‘look away' try-on was to not even mention the actual financial position and operating outcome for the nation's budget in a budget difspeech. Isn't that the point? Don't you present budgets to inform stakeholders of the financial position and performance at the end of the year, of what the bottom line outcome is? Apparently, in every other effort or enterprise on the face of the planet you do that, but not in the Rudd Labor government-you talk about everything else around the financial position and operating outcome except the consequences of the Rudd government's tax and spend binge. For those people who listened to the budget speech last night from Treasurer Swan and were wondering what the net outcome was, let me provide some insights. The budget reveals the high price, as our shadow Treasurer said, that all Australians will pay for the reckless spending by the Rudd Labor government over the past 18 months-those fundamental economic indicators of performance, the statement of our financial position, the consequences of our actions as a nation, overseen by the Rudd government. We will see one million unemployed by 2010-11, a record $58 billion deficit and a record net debt of at least $188 billion by 2012-13. They are the key metrics about economic management and budget performance, but you would not have heard them last night as Treasurer Swan did his ‘look away' routine. Part of that ‘look away' routine is what this bill aims to do here, with the government shifting money around after having earned and pursued the political benefits of the edusome cation innovation fund, after having made all the rhetorical statements and put the post-it notes up saying: ‘Isn't the Rudd government clever? We are going to invest in education infrastructure because'-as they said over and over again-‘that's the engine room of a more productive, more modern economy.' They made that claim, they created that impression with the public and then they went and shifted the money. This is not like your pea-and-cup routine where the trickster tries to make it seem there is no pea under any cup. This is the Rudd government's pea-and-cup routine where the trickster, the Treasurer, makes it seem like there is a pea under every cup when really there is not. This is what we are seeing through this budget and this is what we are seeing through this bill, shifting money out of something supposedly aimed at achieving a ‘more productive, more modern economy'-and that is a quote from the Treasurer-and into something else that now is obviously more fashionable, more funky, more spunky. That is what we are seeing from this government. There are funds going into the newly created special account for the Clean Energy Initiative, although it is not clear at this stage how that will work out. There is so little information available and the information that is available, as the shadow minister pointed out, suggests a rather interesting governance arrangement, where education experts will have some oversight role on the Clean Energy Initiative. I trust that that was an error in the budget papers and that it will be remedied at some point. The opposition is not opposing this bill but opening everybody's eyes to what is going on, to the need to recognise that we are in a difficult situation, largely created by the Rudd government, that will be with us for time to come. I tried to alert people to this in early February. Remember that debate we had all night, when we were looking at spending $42 billion and we had 48 hours to discuss it-an amount of money that was greater than the entire budget of the state of Victoria? I was fortunate to speak a little after I am. I tried to caution people about the risks of sleepwalking into a poorly designed, irresponsible and unsustainable package dreamt up by a panicked government, where the only certain outcome of those actions like was waking up to the nightmare of decades of excessive debt and deficit. Sadly, this is what we are facing. At a time when we should be working to ensure our nation is making wise choices, the right choices, in the face of the current global economic challenges, we are getting this post-it-note politics from the ALP, where they talk about initiatives and plans and get press statements out there but do not have the sound public policy to see the implementation completed and the outcomes that they talk about delivered for the country. What we are seeing is the Howard government legacy of surpluses and savings being grabbed in both hands by the Labor Party. Despite their opposition to every budget restoration and fiscal strengthening action that was pursued by the coalition, Rudd Labor government are grabbing the fruits of sound economic management, delivered by the Howard government, with both hands and swallowing them whole as part of Labor's reckless spending spree. What we are seeing is the Howard government gift of surplus and savings transformed into the same old story: a Labor legacy of debt and deficit. That is what we are seeing here. To a great extent, it was highlighted in some very insightful writings today by Lenore Taylor. She was quite perceptive in identifying that the so-called centrepiece the Rudd budget-a big-ticket spend on infrastructure-is actually funding squirrelled away from the budget surplus created by the Howard government policy settings and repackaged. As she described it, it has had a makeover-it is like last year's dress with new buttons and bows on it. She described how some of this nation-building infrastructure spending is not the amount that has been talked about by Labor members of parliament and Rudd government ministers, because some of it goes well beyond the four years of forward estimates. I highlighted in my earlier remarks how the assertion, the conviction, that the education innovation fund would be the engine room of a more productive and modern economy did not last 12 months because that fund is being raided. You wonder how deep these convictions are when we are talking about budget measures that are way outside the forward estimates of the budget. Some of them will not be brought to bear for some elections to come. You wonder how many of these things will actually be delivered when a key hallmark of the Rudd government's in its first budget was that it did not implement what was in the budget. The government will not actually be held accountable because it does the not do those things; it quickly moves on to announce something new. As the media falls over itself to stay current and relevant and report the news of the day, there is no analysis of the announcements of yesterday or, if you aggregate all these media stunts and post-it-note-politicking ideas, an assessment of whether they actually amount to anything. We are still not sure. Lenore Taylor identified where that money had come from: more than half of it was a direct result of Howard government actions, many of which were opposed by Labor in opposition, and the rest of it came of from a budget surplus on Howard government budget settings. Those Howard government budget settings are interesting. My colleague and neighbour, the member for Isaacs, sought to assure the parliament that the Rudd government is pursuing a coherent economic strategy, despite the complete lack of evidence to back that up. He is a very learned lawyer and I would never profess to have his sharp legal mind, but a simple assertion does not make it a proven point. So coherent is that strategy that we have been hearing about how the investment in infrastructure to increase capacity is what this budget is about and yet, when we look into it, we see a different story. So coherent is the Rudd government's economic strategy that we were told we needed to tackle the inflation genie and that it was running amok, and you saw the Prime Minister and the Treasurer shirt-front the Reserve Bank and tell them how they had to put up interest rates to mug our economy-so risky was the inflation genie escaping the bottle. Mug the economy they did, and now we are wearing the consequences of that reckless politically inspired action. The Deputy PM sought to pat herself on the back in international fora about the strength of our economy and our banking system and how reforms put in place were delivering that. Those reforms were implemented by the Howard government, only to be confronted by a juvenile and shrill attack on neoliberalism as if this were an unregulated jungle, when everyone I talk to points out that there is quite a degree of regulation in Australia and the United States-those terrible neoliberal economies that have been overseen by governments of all political persuasions! So coherent is the strategy that the Treasurer recognised the strength of the financial position he had inherited from the Howard government and how that gave him a very strong foundation-in one of his more measured moments, he was ready to acknowledge that point-and now, apparently, all the woes that he faces are a consequence of those same policy settings that he endorsed just a few months earlier. We talked about the education innovation fund. I have talked about the lack of coherence and how conviction-driven the government was on it being the engine room of a more productive and more modern economy, yet we are now seeing that very fund raided to apply money in other areas. The member for Throsby made, I suppose, a gutsy effort to defend the Rudd government's infrastructure credentials. She talked about transport and rattled off a range of jects. I actually thought that she was talking about the next bill that will be debated, which was introduced just this morning, the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill 2009. Amongst a range of things that bill actually seeks to rebadge projects done under the previous government in order to give them a new tag so that the current government can claim them. You can understand that, to an extent, because AusLink has been downgraded. Those road and rail investments under the coalition would have been $31 billion over five years, but under Labor it will be $26 billion over six years. So you can see why there is a need for re-badging to try to maintain this fiction that, in transport, Labor is somehow doing something quite remarkable when in fact it is actually performing at a far lesser standard than the previous government. We heard about communications and Labor's credentials there. They put up a Mugabe-esque tender process that, understandably, ended in shambles and hardship. Where the telecommunications industries and organisations of the world cannot do it we will have Ruddcom. There is no proposition about how to finance that, and in fact the only direct financial contribution is less than the amount that was put aside by the Howard government to make sure that the digital divide did not punish rural and regional areas. That Communications Fund was raided as well. For a bold plan where you would have room left on an envelope even if you wrote the economic case in crayon, so detailed and rigorous is the analytical process that, if a private sector person went out and sold that to people to invest in, they would probably be locked up. That is what we have got as a communications vision. I want to turn now to energy infrastructure. I am very interested and keen to learn more about what will happen with the Clean proEnergy Initiative. It sounds as though it has the right flavour, but, again, the execution will be everything. What really must have amazed people is how the discussion then shifted to Infrastructure Australia, to how this independent statutory authority pored over these 1,000, I think, proposals to spend money on infrastructure and how central and crucial their role is, yet in the communications infrastructure spend they are frozen out. They are not even allowed to participate. On energy infrastructure we have no oversight indicated in the material available from Infrastructure Australia, and even though it is ‘energy' infrastructure we have some suggestion that people from the education sector will have an oversight. Then we have in the budget announcements, which are said to be ticked off, endorsed and advocated by Infrastructure Australia, no mention of the ones that Infrastructure Australia recommended; they did not appear. There is no clarity about that. There is no transparency. So much for a coherent strategy! All we know from this government is that this nation is on a pathway to debt and deficit that will cruel us and our prospects into the future for not only this generation but some generations to come. We need to be focused on getting a proper strategy in place. (Time expired)",70
35,Mrs HULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to follow the shadow minister for sustainable development and cities. The issues he referred to over the period of his contribution were expansive, and I congratulate him for covering so many areas that we would all like to cover. The Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 is required to give effect to the infrastructure spending in the government's budget announced last evening. It is intended to redirect that was set aside for the EIF to the Clean Energy Initiative, announced in the budget. I am told, and we are led to believe, that will encourage further research and innovation in clean energy generation and low-emission technologies. I wonder exactly just how relevant and reflective that will be in delivering job creation projects across Australia. When I say, ‘delivering job creation projects across Australia', I primarily would like to speak about the opportunities lost in this budget to deliver job creation across rural and regional Australia. Whilst other speakers have covered a whole host of issues, and I have listened very carefully to them, I too would like to cover issues I see as being important and which may have been overlooked. If they were overlooked, as per the infrastructure needs of regional areas, then we can pretty much guarantee that those regional areas will be overlooked even when these funds are directed away from one fund and into another clean energy fund. I know there are many projects out there involving clean energy initiatives, and I am hopeful that they will be looked at on merit rather than in relation to the electoral value they might have in a particular member's seat at the time. I have had concerns generally about infrastructure requirements in regional Australia since the announcement of the $22 billion so-called Building Infrastructure Fund. The previous government had the same fund, and in fact had more money in their fund than the current government has in its fund. When the Rudd government took this fund forward and looked at the projects, it developed a bureaucracy to determine how the investments put up for funding would create jobs and provide sustainability and economic growth-all of those good things that you require in order to kick-start the country and to assist in getting us through some of the the $2.5 billion challenges we have. I looked at the Infrastructure Australia list of projects on the website. I wanted to see where projects in my electorate sat and whether or not there was a clear understanding of the jobs that would have been created in the region if any the projects had received support. Wagga Wagga is the largest inland city in New South Wales and it is a major hub in my electorate. Many of the services are in that one area, and there is a hub-andspoke effect out to the regional communities that it supports and assists. A lot of employment opportunities emanate out of those areas and they support infrastructure right across the electorate. I have some very proactive councils. There is an intercouncil agreement between Albury City Council, Griffith City Council and Wagga Wagga City Council. They have come together not to compete with each other but to be formidable regional promoters and to position themselves clearly as a region that is relevant to the nation's future. When I looked at the Wagga Wagga project and the Griffith City Council project-and they came out of the three regional cities combination-I saw the Bomen rail and road intermodal hub. It would be an excellent project. It was costed out. The application went to Infrastructure Australia. Wagga Wagga City Council costed out their involvement in that project. It would be a $30 million project. Wagga Wagga City Council were looking at putting in almost $4 million. That railroad intermodal hub would have created significant numbers of jobs and ensured that we got product to port in the most effective way possible. Then you could have started to build distribution centres right in rural and regional Australia. There was also the Ross Road project in Griffith. The last government said it would provide $10 million for the Ross Road development project. Yes, it was an election promise and, no, we were not elected. But, of course, I will still pursue that project because it would be valuable and deserves funding. I looked at what that project would do in the heart of the MIA, where there is the most extensive horticulture production area. There are major industries-De Bortoli and Cassella wineries-that have significant exports. There is SunRice, which up until the drought years was the largest exporter from the port of Melbourne. You have to have essential infrastructure to create jobs, solve production issues and make us efficient and effective at what we do. These projects went to Infrastructure Australia and missed out, as many other thousands of projects across Australia did. I recognise that. But I am concerned about the electorate that I represent, and I know the disappointment that many people would have felt at this budget. Knowing that it was a tough budget, we all understood that not everybody could get funded. I was most disappointed about this. I looked at two rail projects. One would have got B-doubles out of the main street of Griffith. There are 150 B-double vehicle movements per day in the CBD. That was a project proposed for Griffith. It stands to reason that in such a highly productive area we needed to solve this massive safety problem and efficiency problem. There would be efficiencies gained with the Bomen rail-road intermodal hub. It would be situated directly on the Sydney to Melbourne rail line. There is already an industrial park. It is focused on environmentally sustainable industry. It has biofuels. It has best-practice industrial development. It has Vinidex, which is a magnificent, environmentally friendly company that turns waste into active and productive reusable products. It is a tremendous, large scale industrial park that is primarily focused on environmentally friendly outcomes. It desperately needs that rail corridor and intermodal status. I looked at what was funded in the budget and at the regional rail express. I congratulate those on the Werribee to Sunshine, Victoria, rail line project. Obviously it was something that they wanted. But when I looked at what the project involved-that is, extension of platforms, other capital works to enable eight-car trains to operate on the Geelong and Bacchus Marsh lines, a new station, duplication of existing tracks et cetera-I wondered what the correlation in jobs, outcome, production et cetera on such a massive spend in that area would be. As I said, I am not complaining about that, because everyone deserves their own funding, but most of this funding has gone to urban and metropolitan projects. I found that really disappointing in the rail infrastructure program. Then I looked at the Wagga Wagga Airport expansion. We have a significant airport that is looking at expanding. We would like to include a business centre at the Wagga Wagga Airport and build a centre of national aviation significance out there. That would all be to capture jobs. It would back onto private investment. It would back onto the investment by Regional Express Airlines whose heart is in the country, whose home is in Wagga Wagga and who have ports elsewhere across Australia. They have invested a huge amount of their own dollars to have a pilot training centre at the airport. When you have people coming in with private investment looking to build the centre, to build aviation credibility, to solve the shortage pilots across Australia et cetera and you see that private money stacked up time and time again, you would think that the government would want to develop and assist those communities in rural and regional Australia relevant in future Australian growth and prosperity. I was sitting here in the House last night looking at the Brisbane inner city rail feasiinitiative. bility study and the works in Perth in Western Australia and I wondered: when do rural and regional people ever get recognised? When does our relevance ever come to the fore? I am concerned about the way in which the money is being allocated. I was concerned to read an article by Adele Ferguson in the Australian today. She alludes to the fact that, after going through thousands of projects, Infrastructure Australia, which is headed by Rod Eddington, had identified a list of 100 projects. That article in the Australian today states: To that end, IA identified a list of 100 projects in December with a view to creating a short list of priority projects in time for the budget. The deal was that the Government would take IA's advice seriously, rather than do what politicians usually do-spend the money on projects that run through certain electoratesand everyone is guilty of that. It continues: The global financial crisis was always going to put the squeeze on the Government's nationbuilding plan. That's why it is surprising that the Government has ignored some of IA's priority projects to do its own thing. She goes on to say that the $488 million Bruce Highway project in Queensland and the $339 million port project in Western Australia are two projects that failed to appear on IA's short list. They did appear on IA's other list, but they certainly did not make the short list. Exactly what is taking place when these projects are being determined? These properly costed proposals from rural and regional of areas that demonstrate their job creation capacity, their future nation-building capacity, how they will serve the nation and how they will position regional Australia to be relevant in the nation's future just got passed over. to be This is terribly concerning. I am confused by having this bill come up today that clearly focuses on just moving one fund to another to focus on this clean energy I do wonder-and I am very sceptical-how much of the funding in this bill will filter out to rural and regional Australia, will actually deliver benefits to those people who are also entitled to share in the nationbuilding programs. I am concerned and really disappointed to say that I can hardly see in this budget any sharing with rural and regional areas, not just in my electorate but in many other electorates as well. That will not stop us as members from trying to get our share of recognition. We will always keep coming back for more. We are always going to ask for more-I am certainly always going to ask for more. I can tell that many members on the other side of the House will also be back to ask for funding for the good projects in their electorates that could have been funded this time but did not get funded. I am sure they will come back for more for rural and regional areas as well. Long hail and let us rail for rural gional Australia. We are relevant in the scheme of things. We need to have the support of every agency, department and decision maker possible. We should not have to constantly overcome hurdles; we should have projects that can assist us to be relevant in this nation's future building.",75
36,Mr WINDSOR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I congratulate the member for Riverina on her contribution, a lot of which I identify with and I am sure many other country members would as well. I know exactly the point that she was making about the political decision-making process and how from time to time it does not take an objective path; it takes a political path. I am aware of that on a personal level, as the previous government often used a political agenda within my seat. I congratulate the member for Riverina on the way in which she represents her people. Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, I am pleased to see that you are in the chair because, if I could move outside the bounds of the Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 for a few seconds, I would like to congratulate you on the role that you recently played in relation to obtaining funding for a very worthy group called Youth Insearch. If we are talking about nation building, youth are particularly important in relation to any nation that is developed long term. As you are well aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Youth Insearch program works with troubled youth. As a magistrate friend of mine said one day: ‘These aren't the captains of the schools that we are dealing with. These are the young people that I'll be locking up next time.' This particular program, out of all the programs that I have had any association with in my time in politics, is one that is incredibly effective. So I congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on your role in this. and reI know many members of parliament were arguing the cause of Youth Insearch and I would particularly like to thank the Prime Minister for his role in this as well. Our young people are critically important in any nation that we attempt to build. The particular piece of legislation we are debating is about nation building. I was not here in the chamber to support him but I listened with interest to the member for Kennedy when he made his contribution, and a very good contribution I thought it was too. He went to the definition of what nation building is essentially about. Whilst it is very rare that I would disagree with the member for Kennedy-partly because of safety reawell sons!-there are a couple of things on which I would take issue with my Independent colleague. I am not so much arguing against what he was saying-I thought the points he was making were very valid; I am just not sure about the conclusion he arrived at in relation to the shifting of these funds from one bucket to another, from the education area into the clean energy area. I am not quite sure that the two things he was talking about, the need to nation build and his definition of nation building, actually rule out the potential for the transfer of this money to become a very important part of the future of this nation-and I am referring to clean energy. The member for Kennedy made the valid point that government invested in the major sugar mills in Queensland many years ago, and I think he said that something like 40,000 people were employed because of that government investment. In his mind, that was nation building. He made the point-and a very valid one-that the Snowy Mountains Scheme was built as part of a nation-building scheme even though there were no major users of electricity in that particular area. He also made the point: ‘Build it and they will come.' The energy they were producing was clean energy and still is clean energy and will go on forever if the maintenance is correctly done and if government does not sell it out to private enterprise, as the former government attempted to do. I would hope that this government would not go down that road, particularly when the issue was about maintenance of turbines rather than about any commercial advantage that could be obtained further down the track. In relation to the sugar mills, the member for Kennedy mentioned, as I said, that the government built those sugar mills and now we have a viable sugar industry. Part of the reason we have a viable sugar industry in Australia now is because of clean energy. The Brazilians, the Argentineans and others in different parts of the world have moved into biofuels. So some of the competitor nations that were producing sugar at a much cheaper cost than we could produce it, and putting enormous pressure on the very important industry that the member for Kennedy spoke about, have shifted into the energy business from the sugar business, because there was a surplus in the world. That has removed some of the supply pressure on the global market and, as a consequence, our sugar industry is much more viable than it was even a few short years ago. I know there are some indirect allegations in relation to that, but there is no doubt in my mind that the development of the biofuels industry, a clean industry, has had a positive impact on the viability of other industries within this country. The point I would make to the member for Kennedy, and to others, is that the development of clean energy will almost by definition have to be located in country areas. This could be a way of creating that nation building by creating new businesses in country areas. They may or may not be based on agriculture-in some cases they would be; in other cases they would not be-but most of them would have to be in country locations, so in some senses we may well be able to value add to some of the clean energy business alternatives that are out there. Obviously, solar energy is one for which governments in this country have done very little. Even though this is a start, I think we have to encourage the start and hope that this government is serious about promoting research and development on solar energy. Previous governments have not been; on this government, the jury is out. Wind and geothermal are mentioned in the budget, and this particular amendment bill refers to the transfer of money into those areas. Second-generation biofuels are also mentioned in the budget documents. For those who do not know, that is the production of biofuels from cellulose, not from grain based biofuels, which some people in this House agree with and others do not. The secondgeneration research is into the enzymes that are used to break down the material in the fermentation process so that you end up with a clean, renewable fuel from plant waste. I would encourage the government to look very closely at the technology that is out there, particularly given our dependence on carbon based fuels. Here again we have a mixed message, something the government is developing a format for, in a sense. For example, we originally had a message encouraging people to shift to solar energy in their homes, and then it became means tested. There have been a number of issues like that. I notice in the budget documents that, on the one hand-and that is what this bill is about-the government is encouraging research into second-generation biofuels because they are clean, they are renewable and they could create some future in terms of nation building, and not only the building of factories et cetera. Then, on the other hand, the budget papers mention that the taxation arrangements for fuels, particularly biofuels, will run out in 2011. So people doing this sort of research-and maybe Minister Albanese could comment on this in his reply-will be wondering: which is the message that we should be picking up? Should we be picking up on where this money is going to be invested, with the encouragement of research and the promotion of biofuels? In 2011, are biofuels going to be taxed the same as carbon based or fossil fuels? That is the question that really needs to be answered. Or is this a bit like the solar energy promise that only became a promise with the addition of means testing: ‘We're encouraging it, but we don't want much too much of it if it starts to cost us too much money'? I think the government has to start to address these signals, because these mixed messages are out there, and if there are mixed messages in terms of environmental issues people do not move. We have seen it before. People got solar energy established and then, to their detriment, when they wanted to put excess power back into the grid, they were paid less than what they had to pay for the original power, so the incentive is not there. I am very much for promoting some of these alternative energies that the bill talks about, but the government has got to straighten out its message and work out what it is in fact encouraging. There are a number of clean energy initiatives that this bill will allow to be funded-and, as I said, I will be supporting this bill. A number of speakers have spoken about what they believe nation building is about. With the minister in the House, I would like to congratulate him on a recent announcement within our greater region-and one last night, in terms of the $1.5 billion announcement of the F3 connection through to the New England Highway. That is not directly in my electorate, but the New England Highway crosses seven electorates, and that connection will be a benefit to all of them as well as a benefit to the nation. Cutting about half an hour off a trip from Armidale to Sydney will obviously have some impact on transport as well. So, in a very real sense, that is what nation building is about, in my view. Then there is the $1.2 billion package that the same minister, Minister Albanese, announced some time back. I think about $580 million went into that Hunter northern corridor: in terms of rail freight, the Ardglen tunnel got $280 million, I think, and there was another $280 million for associated loops and bypasses et cetera to concentrate the export effort on the Newcastle Port, and obviously a third coal loader and a whole range of other things happening there as well. That is something that was long overdue. I know there are many members in this building who support the inland rail concept, as I do. You need to look at where the freight in the eastern part of Australia is. The Ernst & Young inquiry into the inland rail arrangements that took place a few years ago, under the former government, identified the potential market for freight. In Victoria, New South Wales and southern Queensland there have been 220 million tonnes of freight. It also identified that 110 million tonnes, or 50 per cent of the total freight load, was between Newcastle and Moree. That is why I believe that this development of the Ardglen tunnel-the Liverpool range, as they call it is a very important addition in terms of nation building in my state and indeed on the eastern seaboard. There are some collision points, in my view, when we are talking about a clean environment for the future, clean energy and clean food-and all of those debates are currently happening in this building. We have got the carbon debate, the emissions trading debate, the food security debate and the global emissions debate. We have got the economic debate and the carbon capture debate, which is trying to maintain an interest in fossil fuels while being able to sequester the carbon. We have got the methane and nitrous oxide debate, which impacts on agriculture. And we have got various announcements in terms of the research money going into those areas. But a particular collision point that is occurring in my electorate at the moment-and I mentioned it to the minister for resources yesterday by way of a question at question time-is the proposal to develop a coalmine on the Liverpool Plains, which is underpinned by magnificent and massive water resources as well as being part of some of the best land in the world, an alluvial floodplain. The issues here blur the debate particularly if you start, as the government is, putting a carbon footprint over food or food production, and that may or may not become part of the emissions trading arrangements as time goes on. I would urge the infrastructure minister to really look at this particular issue on the Liverpool Plains. There again, we cannot keep running these mixed arguments and end up at the same destination. If we are serious about clean food and clean water we should not be allowing quite dangerous mining practices in an area where there is potential to do massive damage to the hydraulic nature of those groundwater systems and their interrelated connectivity issues with the river water system when-in the budget and in this very funding arrangement-we see time and time again reference to saving the Murray-Darling system. The issue here is really about the different portfolios. I was pleased with the answer that the Minister for Resources gave to me yesterday. He actually crossed the boundary of defending his own portfolio area and moved-and I do not want to verbal him-to virtually saying that this was an issue that he and I and the Minister for the Environment should sit down and talk about, and I think that could well be productive. The point I am making is that if we are serious about all of these issues we have got to start sending a clear signal so that the constituency can pick it up. I am encouraged by the words in the budget documents in terms of where this money that we are absconding with today is going to go. There are a lot of good words on solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels et cetera, and clean coal technology which just seem to be added into things these days. Whether it is feasible for the long term or not, let us have a look at it. But don't encourage some and discourage others. Don't let the interplay of big business and shortterm politics interfere with the long-term agenda that these words in the budget documents actually put in place. I think that there is no better example of that than this collision point between clean food and clean energy on the Liverpool Plains. If we are serious about going to second-generation biofuels, and the government in its own documents says it is, some of those areas not only have the capacity to produce clean, environmentally friendly food but also the capacity to produce clean, environmentally friendly fuel. But if you endanger those things through the practice of mining on these very sensitive lands you remove both options and you have a situation which could develop into a short-term economic gain for the nation and eventually a long term loss for the nation and, potentially, a long-term loss for the globe. I would urge the minister to take some of those comments on board. I personally thank him for his attendance in Tamworth last week. The people of Tamworth enjoyed his company and they particularly enjoyed his announcement of $5 million for a new indoor sports centre, which will provide a very important platform for the most important ingredient of our nation, our young people.",78
37,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (1.49 pm)-in reply-I thank those members who have contributed to this debate, particularly those who were constructive in their comments. Certainly I wish to refer specifically to the comments of the member for New England, who pointed out that infrastructure is about nation-building infrastructure but it can also be about community based infrastructure. The people whom he represents in New England will benefit from both as a result of the Rudd government's budget last night, which confirmed the $800 million for the Community Infrastructure Program including $5 million for the Tamworth Indoor Sports Centre that I announced with him in Tamworth on Saturday afternoon. I thank him for his warm reception in the fine regional city of Tamworth and I particularly want to acknowledge the fact that the young people from the basketball club were out there in big numbers. When we talk about infrastructure we are talking about taking action today supporting jobs in order to create infrastructure for tomorrow, whether it be a community infrastructure facility such as that in Tamworth or whether it be the $1.5 billion that we allocated last night to the Hunter Expressway. That will be added to by $200 million from the Rees Labor government in New South Wales to total a $1.7 billion commitment over four years to build the Hunter Expressway. This is an expressway which has been identified as a priority project by Infrastructure Australia. It will add to the productive capacity of the nation, will benefit freight and will benefit motor vehicle passengers who live along the route of the New England Freeway. It is a project that will add to this government's vision-and was one of the centrepieces of our budget last night-of the N1 from Melbourne right up to Cairns, with feeders such as the New England Highway, the Hunter Expressway and the Ipswich Motorway, making sure that whether it is moving people or freight we do so in a way which is as efficient as possible and, importantly, as safe as possible in order to maximise the capacity of the economy to grow. That is the government's vision of nationbuilding infrastructure. The budget we announced last night included a $22 billion investment in nationbuilding infrastructure. This investment will provide that economic stimulus in the short term which is needed but also the long-term benefits for the economy as it recovers into the future. The Nation-building Funds Amendment Bill 2009 is required to give effect to the infrastructure spending announced in last night's budget. As well as investment in transport infrastructure, ports, road and rail, hospitals and higher education, the government will also invest $4.5 billion in a new Clean Energy Initiative, which will encourage further research and innovation in clean energy technologies that will play an important role in Australia's transition to a low-pollution economy. The Clean Energy Initiative will help accelerate the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage, and it will assist solar energy and other forms of renewable energy. To provide funding for these priorities, the bill repeals the crediting of $2.5 billion from the 2007-08 budget surplus to the Education Investment Fund that was to occur by 30 June 2009. This amount will be made available for the new Clean Energy Initiative. There will still be more than $6.5 billion in the Education Investment Fund for education and research infrastructure, of which $4.1 billion has been committed in last night's budget and in the nation-building package announced by the Prime Minister on 12 December 2008. The balance of $2.4 billion plus investment earnings, estimated to be around $630 million over the forward estimates, will be available for future education and research projects. Last night's budget was a budget of which those on this side of the House are extremely proud. We are proud because it builds on the history which our great party has of nation building. It is a stark contrast with the failure of those opposite to invest in nation-building infrastructure over 12 long years. The fact is that we are investing more money over six years than those opposite invested over 12 long years. We are investing more in rail in 12 months than they invested in 12 years. Just think about that statistic-more in 12 months than they invested in 12 long years. It is only this side of the House that have ever been committed to nation-building infrastructure. Last night's budget builds on our record and this bill is a part of ensuring that the proposals put forward in last night's budget can be turned into action. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",82

39,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister now tell the House what last night the Treasurer could not bring himself to say, that the government is budgeting for a $57.6 billion deficit next year at 4.9 per cent of GDP, the largest deficit in over 60 years?",83
40,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is correct: the budget deficit will be 4.9 per cent of GDP. Opposition members-What's the figure?,83
41,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the figure that I said on radio this morning, 57.6. Can I say to those opposite the government welcomes a debate on debt and deficit, a debate which those opposite have joined with such vigour and clarity this morning; there has been such a sterling performance on the part of those opposite in having a uniform position on debt and deficit. You see, the position of the Liberals on this question is actually directly relevant to the question just asked by the Leader of the Opposition, because what they do in the Senate directly affects the shape of the deficit. We know from the last budget what happened with the blocking of various measures, both on the expenditure side and on the revenue side. We do not know from any of the statements which have been made so far what will happen in the Senate on this occasion and therefore the extent to which that affects what the government has by way of the final content of its proposed borrowing and deficit. Therefore the position of those opposite is not just of academic interest; it of direct interest to the bottom line which will be delivered to the public revenue of the Commonwealth of Australia. But there we were this morning-can you just picture it?-with those opposite signalling loud and clear: ‘We're about to have a fusillade on debt and deficit today.' You are over there in Fort Turnbull in the bunker and you are working out what is going to happen on this day, the first day after the budget. You are going to have a complete blitzkrieg on debt and deficit. So the whistle blows at 0700 and out you go and over the top and you have the field commander out there, the Leader of the Opposition, and the regimental sergeant-major, the member for North Sydney. Out they have gone ready to whack as one and at 0800 the shrapnel starts to fly. What happens then? The regimental sergeant-major is on Channel 7 and is asked a very direct question and that question is along these lines, so this is what Joe was asked: ‘How much debt would you support and how big a deficit would you support?' The answer is as follows: ‘I'll give you a figure as a starting point, at least $25 billion smaller.' So thank you, Joe! Joe has given us a definitive number, 25 billion. Well, thank you very much.",83
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer to members by their titles.,84
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They may be equivocating now but it is $25 billion. Dr Stone- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Can you ask the Prime Minister to properly address the member's question.",84
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I already have. I reminded the Prime Minister that he has to refer to members by their titles.,84
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So the member for North Sydney is out there delivering with crystalis clear clarity for the first time the position of the opposition on their debt and deficit strategy; that is, the government's minus $25 billion. That is at 0800. At 0816 the regimental field commander himself takes position with the artillery barrage to come and the artillery barrage commences with his time on Sky Television, so Sky actually does an interview with the regimental field commander over there and he is asked the following question about debt and deficit. The Leader of the Opposition says: If we were in government today revenues would be higher. That is an interesting proposition: you get your magic wand out and you say, ‘We're going to create more tax.' It is just by waving the magic wand. Let us leave that one to one side for the moment. Revenues would be higher as a product of a direct administrative‘decree', I presume. spending would be lower, therefore debt would be much lower and the deficit would be much lower. Now the reality isand here the journalist, David Speers, asks: But you can't say what figure? Then the Leader of the Opposition says: Well, no. You can't because you, because you, I mean you, you could sit down, you could work out a model. But as we see with all of these financial models, you know, each assumption becomes fairly subjective. So that was at 0816. At 0800 this morning the whistle has gone, the shrapnel is flying and the shadow Treasurer says government debt and deficit minus $25 billion. Sixteen minutes it took for the Leader of the Opposition to say, ‘I haven't got a clue. I refuse to name a number.' Well, there we have the regimental field commander and the regimental sergeant-major out there in full flight against the government, saying",84

55,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So there we have the RSM, the member for North Sydney, out there confirming it, using his gross debt figure this morning-$300 billion minus $25 billion, so $275 billion-with absolute clarity and, 16 minutes later, the Leader of the Opposition saying, ‘Oh, no, I couldn't possibly confirm a number.' But the supreme irony is this: they chose the terrain of battle. This is what left! they wanted to fight us on today and, 16 minutes into the fray, you have got over there Captain Confusion and Colonel Chaos, who could not agree on a single number in terms of their assault on the government. In this entire debate on net debt and on deficit and on borrowing, there are some very basic questions for the Leader of the Opposition to answer when it comes to his budget reply tomorrow night. Question No. 1: will the Leader of the Opposition confirm what the member for North Sydney has said and therefore borrow in order to meet the $210 billion plus collapse in tax revenue? Question No. 2: to what extent would he in addition fund discretionary stimulus and on what projects? Question No. 3: which of the government's spending proposals and investment proposals do they support or reject? Question No. 4: which of the $22 billion worth of savings measures do they accept or reject? Unless these questions are answered, what we have from those opposite is just white noise. It means nothing. It is pure political spin-that is all they are engaged in. Less than 24 hours after the budget, we have seen the single greatest disintegration of an opposition attack on an element of fiscal policy that we have seen in this place for decades. They should be ashamed of themselves. This used to be the once great Liberal Party. It has collapsed in a heap.  of order.

60,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the key components of last night's budget, how it fits into the government's broader economic strategy, and reaction from economists and industry?",85
61,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly thank the member for Page for her question. The central task of this budget is nation building for recoveryan unprecedented $22 billion of investment in infrastructure, an investment in infrastructure that those opposite could never commit to in their whole 12 long years in office. These investments will bring jobs and they will bring productivity for the long term. They are important investments for the long term, not just in hard infrastructure but also in the best human capital: investment in education. These represent the building blocks for the future. The budget includes $8.5 billion of investment in economic infrastructure. This will mean that when the recovery takes hold our ports will not be straining and our rail networks and roads will not be clogged, and it means we will be much better positioned to take full advantage of the global recovery when it comes. Critically, these investments support jobs now and they will employ thousands of Australians. Nothing could be more important in the current environment than putting in place policies in the short term, medium term and the long term to support jobs, because these unprecedented investments in nation-building infrastructure are the third phase of our economic stimulus package. The first phase was payments to support jobs; the second phase was the shovel-ready projects that are now taking off right around the country. Thirty-five thousand projects have been launched right around the country and including in Page. This is important investment in schools and social housing that those opposite seem to think does not matter-does not count as infrastructure-but it is a lasting legacy for our communities and it is for support of jobs that those projects are taking place right around the country. Now, of course, we have the commitment to big infrastructure. We have a commitment to a fair go for pensioners. We have the investments in our health and hospital system. We have a historic paid parental leave scheme, something that those opposite could not bring themselves to come to in 12 years of office. And, of course, we have a 50 per cent small business tax break for eligible investments. This is a budget that charts the way back to surplus. It puts in place the necessary savings that are required. Those opposite are talking about deficit all the time, but they cannot nominate one saving they will make. The weight is on them now. There has been a record $210 billion write-down of the revenue over the forward estimates. They say they support pensions. If they support the pensions and the good things that come with the budget, they will have to support the savings that come with it. The weight is on the opposition to nominate where they would make savings-the weight is on them. But, for our part, we will chart a course back to surplus. We will make the long-term savings the that they could not make in all their long term in government. Budget",86
62,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain to the House why, if the International Monetary Fund's recent World economic outlook shows the Australian economy growing at only 1.1 per cent in 2010, his budget projects growth in Australia only a year later to be 4.5 per cent, more than four times the IMF's projection?",86
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to the forecasting methodologies used by the Treasury, which have been the subject of some debate in the last period of time. The first change which is evident in the way the Treasury has presented its forecasts and its projections for the years ahead is to add one extra year-that is important to note. It is to bring it into consistency with international practice. For example, in the United States there are three estimates years and seven projection years. In New Zealand there are five estimates years and 10 projection years. In Sweden there are four estimates years and three projection years. In Australia there are three estimates years and two projection years. That is a change that we have made because it is useful in terms of long-term economic planning and long-term economic forecasting to bring these practices in Australia into conformity with emerging practice abroad. That is the first point. The second point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition goes to the question of the underpinning of the growth forecast in the two outyears of the forward estimates. First, it should be noted by those opposite that the three years of below-trend growth occur in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 201011-that is, these are all below-trend growth. The two years above trend are the two years at the outer end of the spectrum-that is, 2011-12 and 2012-13, where, as the Leader of the Opposition has just indicated, real GDP is assumed to grow at 4.5 per cent. However, here is the point I would draw to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition: growth is forecast to remain below trend for three years-that is, longer than during the downturns of the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s you had below-trend growth for a year following that recession; in the 1990s, it was below-trend growth for two years. Here is an assumption on our part that it will in fact be a slow return to above-trend growth. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. The Prime Minister has not even mentioned the IMF. The question relates to the mismatch between his forecasts and the IMF's.",86
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I have been listening closely to the Prime Minister and he is responding to the question.,87
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So on the whole question of where this fits-that is, Treasury's projections for the two outyears of what is now the forward estimates-it is in fact more conservative than the projections by the then Treasury concerning recovery from the two earlier recessions, one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s. There is also an important point to note and it does go to the question that the Leader of the Opposition raised specifically in reference to the IMF and to others who make projections and to the attitude of other commentators on these growth projections. I would draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to comments this morning by the Chief Economist of CommSec, Craig James, by the senior economist of Icap Australia, by US and by Westpac in its Australian federal budget report, all of which have described the federal Treasury's forecast in the budget papers as being on the pessimistic or bearish side. That is what they have had to say. Obviously there is going to be debate among forecasters on the question of methodology, but the government believes in the independent advice of the Treasury and I would say to those opposite that they should respect the independence and integrity of the Commonwealth Treasury. The importance of these forecasts goes to how we actually project ahead with growth.  of order. The Prime Minister was asked about the IMF's projections. He relies on the IMF when it suits him but he has not mentioned it yet in his answer.",87
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,88
67,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, there are a range of views about the future shape of growth. I have just referred to four market economists who actually believe that those contained within the Treasury forecast are on the bearish side. But, again, the reason that this is relevant is that it goes to the whole question of how we structure our public finance of the future and how we structure debt and deficits into the future and, therefore, the relevance and role of the Liberals in the Senate. I referred before to what was an exercise in policy confusion on the part of those opposite on the question of debt and deficit. That was volume 1. But as they say in the steak knives advertisement, ‘There's more,' because later on this morning, at 8.23 am-remember, the charge is on in the question of debt and deficits-we have the Leader of the Opposition on AM on the question of how he would have done this budget differently. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a specific question about the IMF's projections. He has not answered the question. If he does not know the answer he should sit down.",88

76,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is it necessary to accept temporary budget deficits and, further, why would a contractionary approach to this year's budget have a negative impact on the Australian economy?",89
77,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The government's budget strategy is focused on sustaining jobs and economic activity in the shorter term, investing in nation-building infrastructure and skills for the recovery and for longer-term productivity and jobs, and starting the work of repairing the structure of the budget after the damage that has been done by the huge drop in revenue, courtesy of the global recession. All you have to do is look at the data in the budget to see that the reality of overwhelmingly driven by that huge drop in revenue. In fact, the total drop in revenue across the four years of forward estimates is slightly higher than the total amount of deficits over that period. So what we are seeing is a huge hit to the budget as a result of that drop in revenue, and it is the government's position that the most appropriate economic strategy in this circumstance is for us to allow deficits to unfold and to borrow to cover those deficits for a period of time. The budget does of course contain a number of very substantial savings measures which are designed to commence the process of returning the budget to a surplus over time. There are very significant changes with respect to health requirements, family tax benefits, pension entitlements and matters of this kind, and that will start the hard work of returning the budget to surplus. The government has already been criticised by the opposition for the allowance of the budget being in deficit for some period of Budget time. Therefore it is worthwhile scrutinising what the alternative might be, the contractionary alternative. It is, admittedly, difficult to discern precisely what the opposition's position is. Today's examples that the Prime Minister cited are yet another instalment of that. We have seen over the past 12 months many new commitments on the part of the opposition for new spending, we have seen many new promises that they have made to increase the spending hit on the budget, we have seen them blocking the government's savings initiatives in the Senate and we have seen not one single new savings initiative. Yet, at the same time, they claim that they would have lower deficits and less debt. So in other words the proposition from the opposition is that they would spend more, tax less and have lower debt and lower deficits. Only an investment banker could offer you that kind of deal: more spending, less tax, deficits is lower deficits and lower debt. In spite of the confusion, we are today finally getting some indication of the true opposition position. I note, as the Prime Minister indicated, that the member for North Sydney stated today that they would run a deficit $25 billion lower than the government's projected deficit. The Leader of the Opposition said on Sky News, ‘If we were in government today, revenues would be higher, spending would be lower, therefore debt would be much lower and the deficit would be much lower.' In other words, there would be higher taxes and less spending, although he did not quite say that, but that is what it means. I got a further insight into this this morning debating the shadow minister for finance, competition policy and deregulation, Senator Coonan, at an accountants breakfast. I am sure everybody in this House knows who the shadow minister for finance is. Senator Coonan opened her contribution by quoting approvingly a quote on the evils of debt from none other than Herbert Hoover at the 1936 Republican convention in Nebraska. Herbert Hoover, of course, was the President of the United States from 1928 to 1932 who relentlessly, rigorously, did absolutely nothing in the face of the Great Depression in order to avoid debt and deficit. He did absolutely nothing, while the unemployment mounted, the businesses failed, the misery",89

80,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the alternative, contractionary approach to the budget, and of course the high priest of this approach was Herbert Hoover. He put his theories into practice and produced the Great Depression in the United States. It is worth noting that at this particular Republican convention in 1936 even the Republican Party realised that Herbert Hoover was a dud and decided not to renominate him for the presidency. But the Liberal Party is still sticking with his views 70-odd years later. Although, to cut Senator Coonan some slack, I am not quite sure that she knows who she is talking about, because later in the speech she referred to the quote again and called him J Edgar Hoover. Perhaps now the Liberal Party is getting its economics policies from the FBI!",90

82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Tanner-Unfortunately for the member for O'Connor and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition and the entire opposition, there is a very serious side to this. That is, they are adopting a position that implies massive job losses, massive business failures and huge economic contraction. If you took $25 billion out of the budget now, guess what that would do: it would devastate economic activity in this country. It would trash min- jobs. It would trash employment. It would trash economic activity. Thousands of businesses would be bankrupt. They are adopting the economic policies of Herbert Hoover that directly led to the Great Depression. That is the serious side that I would urge the memis ber for O'Connor to look very closely at, and I would urge the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly is totally confused about their position, to get with the government's position, which is that deficits are unavoidable in order to sustain jobs and economic activity in the Australian economy.

Given that in the last 30 years there have only been five years in which GDP has grown at 4½ per cent or more, how can the Prime Minister expect Australians to believe that two years from now we will enjoy six consecutive years of growth at 4½ per cent? Will the Prime Minister table the economic advice from the Treasury upon which, he asserts, his incredible forecast is based?",90
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Once again, what we have seen in the debate in the last 24 hours or so is a direct assault on the integrity of the Treasury. This is exactly what they did last year. When they are not attacking the Reserve Bank governorMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a direct attack on the intelligence of the House. He must answer the question",90
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has been on his feet for 18 seconds.,91
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government takes seriously independent advice it has obtained from the Treasury-the same Treasury which advised the member for Higgins, has advised previous treasurers and, through their treasurers, the Prime Minister of the time as well. That is the first point. The second is: whenever those opposite dislike what is produced by way of projections or data, they attack the originator. Last week, you did so in relation to the ABS dataMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: they are the Treasurer's budget papers. I ask the Prime Minister to respond to the question from the Leader of the Opposition about tabling the methodology used by Treasury.",91
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,91
88,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government relies on the independent advice of the Treasury as it has done in the past, as it will do in the ture and as governments of all persuasions have until this most recent opposition has decided to release a series of attacks directed at independent agencies-the Treasury, the Reserve Bank and, most stunningly last week, the Statistician over the unemployment data when the member for Wentworth mysteriously went missing in Western Sydney, as he described yesterday. Well, the member for North Sydney said yesterday",91
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,91
90,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why are they turning off the broadcast? Ms Julie Bishop-Why are the broadcasting lights off?,91
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"From time to time, there are things that happen in this place that amaze even me. There is little that I thought could amaze me about the behaviour of members. The Manager of Opposition Business, in a quite correct manner, has approached me to ask me to find out what is happening. I do not need people carrying on in the way that they have been about the technicalities of the broadcast. My understanding, and I am having this checked, is that question time is being broadcast in the Senate. The House is then on replay and, on the replay, points of order are not part of the re-broadcast. What I",91
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The conspiracists sometimes really upset me, too. There is no change in any policy. I am endeavouring to find out why, on this occasion, the light is flashing on and off, because I agree that that has not happened before. But I ask people to just relax a little bit. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is highly provocative of the Prime Minister to continue to make derogatory remarks about the fact that the Leader of fu- the Opposition was at the Salvation Army in Parramatta for the Red Shield Appeal. He made a personal explanation about it yesterday, and yet the Prime Minister continues to make these provocative and derogatory comments",91
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat.,91
95,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whenever the data does not suit those opposite, they attack the agencies which produce it. That is a constant thematic. It has been the approach they have adopted with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank more broadly, and, on the part of the member for North Sydney, in relation to the attack on the independence of the Australian Statistician last week on the unemployment data. On the matter which has just been raised by the member for Curtin, the member for North Sydney indicated last week, when the unemployment data came out, that the Leader of the Opposition would be fronting afterwards for a press conference. He did not. On this matter concerning the Treasury: they provide advice; the government receives that advice; and, accordingly, the government acts and incorporates that advice within the government's budget papers. I would say also to those opposite that, when Senate estimates approaches, there will be ample opportunity to quiz the relevant officials as those opposite have done in the past and, I am sure, will do in the future. Budget",91
96,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline the government's strategy to return to surplus and the hard decisions necessary to achieve that goal?,92
97,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for her very important question. Since last year's budget, government revenues have been written down by $210 billion. That is the biggest write-down in government revenues in living memory. It equates to something like the entire Commonwealth health spend over the forward estimates-just a huge, huge contraction in government revenues. And, of course, that contraction in government revenues is responsible for something like two-thirds of the write-down in the budget position. That is the enormity of what has occurred through the global recession. In 2010-11 alone, revenues have been written down by $55 billion. That is why we have said that there are no easy answers in this situation and it is why we take our responsibility very seriously to engage in borrowing for a temporary deficit, because, if we did not do that, taxes would have to rise or services would have to be massively cut. We took this issue very seriously and we put in place in the budget serious long-term structural changes to expenditure, rebalancing sustainable support for private health insurance and ensuring that families on increasingly higher incomes do not receive family payment benefits-a whole list of things which we went through last night, a list where everybody has to do a bit to make up for this huge cut in revenue which has come to national income. So we do take our responsibilities very seriously. As the finance minister was saying before, what is the alternative to not running a temporary deficit? Massive cuts to services or massive increases in taxation. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation was talking about events that occurred in the 1930s. Herbert Hoover responded by doing precisely that-absolutely nothing. And, of course, the sit and wait and see attitude of Herbert Hoover is the attitude of those opposite. In fact, if you want to equate the Leader of the Opposition to somebody in those days, he is the Otto Niemeyer of Australian politics because that was the recommendation-that governments should not stimulate the economy, that governments should raise taxes and that governments should cut back on services. Mr Hockey- Sir Otto. He was knighted!",92
98,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sir Otto over there had this to say about what his position would be. The Leader of the Opposition was asked on AM this morning: But just quickly, you would have engaged in some stimulus spending and there would have been a deficit? He replied, ‘It may have been in deficit by a small amount or it may have been in surplus by a small amount with different policies.' If he was going to have it in surplus, he is proposing spending cuts in one year alone of $50-odd billion. What a massive hit that would be to the economy, what a massive hit that would be to employment, what a massive hit that would be to businesses in the Australian economy. The sensible thing to do in this environment is to run a temporary deficit. If those opposite were in power, they would have to borrow to meet revenue writedowns. But what we get from Sir Otto over there is this deficit and debt con job, pretending somehow that they would not have to borrow to meet these circumstances. Well they would and it is about time that those opposite nominate where they would make their savings in these circumstances.",92
99,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the statement he made in his speech to the National Press Club today: It will be years before Australians are as well as they were two years ago. Will the Treasurer advise the House how many years it will be?,93
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we have is more voodoo economics from the shadow Treasurer. He wants to pretend there has not been an unwinding of the mining boom. He wants to pretend that there has not been a terms of trade collapse. He wants to pretend that we are not in the midst of a global recession.  Speaker: because we followed your advice, we have made this question entirely specific. It is a quote from the Treasurer and it asks him: how many years? It has nothing to do with anything else that he is talking about. I would ask you to direct him to be relevant to the question, as you asked us to tighten up our questions in the past.",93
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As members know, occupants of the chair have, in the past, indicated that there is no provision, regrettably, for the chair to be able to indicate the manner in which questions should be asked. Whilst I appreciate the member for Sturt indicating the care with which the question was framed, my obligation is to adjudge whether the Treasurer is being relevant in any manner to the question. I will listen carefully to the Treasurer's answer.",93
102,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last night we put in place a plan, a nation-building budget for recovery, a budget to support the economy in the face of this global recession and to support jobs and Australian businesses in the most serious global economic event to occur in 75 years. That is the thrust of the budget delivered last night and it is something that this country Budget desperately needs in the circumstances in which we find ourselves internationally. There is a lot of support for what the government has had to say about the need for temporary borrowings. The forecasts are off there in the budget for everybody to read. It is going to take some time for growth to come back to trend but growth will come back to trend because recessions do end. When they end, there is a lot of spare capacity and that is when economies begin to grow quickly. This is what Standard and Poor's have had to say about last night's budget, given all the claims we have had from those opposite about deficit and debt. Mr Hockey-I rise on a point of order as to relevance, Mr Speaker. I asked the Treasurer how many years it will be until we get back to the position we were in.",93
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer has the call.,93
104,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is what Standard and Poor's have had to say about the budget: We believe the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances. This is underpinned by the strength of the government's balance sheet … And our return to surplus, our return to paying off debt and our investment in the nation will bring back growth as soon as we possibly can. Employment",94
105,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the recent announcements to invest in jobs for today and drive productivity in the future?",94
106,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for his question. I know that he is concerned, in his constituency, about supporting jobs today and about ensuring that this nation wins the global competition for the jobs of the future. Jobs today and jobs of the future are at the heart of the budget announcements made by the Treasurer last night. This is a budget that delivers support for jobs today whilst building the infrastructure and policies we will need so that Australians can have the skills that they will need to win the global competition for the jobs of the future. At the heart of this budget, of course, is continuing stimulus through capital investment-a $22 billion capital investment program to support jobs today. And much of this investment is directed towards renewing places of learning around the country, because we know how important those places of learning will be to Australians getting the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. Our capital investment goes to schools, trade training, technical and further education and, as announced last night, a major capital investment into universities and research infrastructure. As the member for Forde said in his question, this budget not only delivers on that kind of support for jobs today but, through stimulus, capital investment and the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, it provides direct support for jobseekers. It particularly provides direct support so that they can gain the skills they need for the work opportunities to come. This budget presents an interlinked set of policies-through our jobs compact with retrenched Australians, with young Australians and with local communities. That is an investment of $1.5 billion. There are interlinked programs to support apprentices and related programs in the order of $5 billion and a $2 billion investment in productivity places. Those are record, huge investments in skills and opportunities for Australians. Some of the highlights of these packages-they are displayed comprehensively in the budget papers-include assistance to unemployed Australians to train, through our training supplement of $41.60 per fortnight; the training and learning bonus; the education entry payment and funding for training in productivity places. The government will provide people on Newstart Allowance and parenting payment who are undertaking a 12-month course, with the equivalent of an additional $43 per week in financial assistance. The government in these packages is also assisting apprentices and their employers to complete their training through the Securing Australian Apprenticeships and Traineeships initiative. But the budget does more. It provides cash payments of $3,800 to apprentices and trainees by redoing existing incentives and making them more efficient. An additional 14,000 apprentices will receive this support. Payments to mid-career apprentices will be extended to 25-to-29 year olds, entitling them to an extra $7,800 in the first year of training and $5,200 in the year after that. This budget, beyond supporting jobs today and delivering assistance to jobseekers through our jobs and training compact, through our productivity places and through our support for apprentices and related matters, also invests in the jobs of the future. There will be nothing more important to Australia gaining its fair share of the jobs of the future than the performance of our higher education system as it leads us into the knowledge economy. That is why the government in this budget delivers a comprehensive response to the Bradley and Cutler reviews, with a $5.7 billion package to transform our higher education system into a system that responds to the needs of studentswith places following student demand-and transforms our system. It does that by ensuring that there is money in the system and incentives so that universities partner with schools to create new opportunities for Australians from low-SES backgrounds to go to university. This is a measure to ensure that the sons and daughters of Australians, no matter what household they are born into, have an opportunity to go to Australia's universities-not by reducing standards, but by having our universities and our schools work together to create an educational pathway for those children to deliver on the promise of this nation that every child deserves the best possible start in life. In this budget we have restructured student assistance, student income support, so that it better supports Australian students and particularly targets that assistance to where is most needed. We have put in this budget a landmark increase in indexation for universities, performance funding that will make a difference to quality and a new national system of quality regulation, and we have delivered major new capital investments. This is a transformation of our university system so that it can lead this nation in the knowledge economy of tomorrow for the jobs of tomorrow whilst we deliver on providing support for Australian jobs today. Budget",94
107,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer him to Budget Paper No. 1, 3-23, the medium term analysis of the budget. This is the so-called plan for the government to repay debt. I ask the Treasurer: given that the projections go out to 2020, in what year will the Australian people finally pay off Rudd government debt?",95
108,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, what I can say is what is in Budget Paper No. 1. We do get it down, I think, to about three per cent net debt over that time. We will continue to pay it down from that period, because that is the responsible thing to do.",95
109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
110,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This juvenile behaviour is just extraordinary. It is absolutely juvenile. The estimates are all there; the member has just quoted from them. What I can say is that we are engaging in temporary borrowing to meet the requirements of this economy because of the very sharp contraction that has taken place. Those opposite want to pretend that somehow, if they were in government, they would not be borrowing and they would not be paying down debt, but they will be, and that is the particular game that they are playing today. This government's medium-term fiscal strategy is to pay down debt as quickly it as we can. That is what the budget papers say and, as the member opposite knows, it gets down to the minuscule level of three per cent in the year that he mentioned. That is what happens-the minuscule amount compared to what is going on internationally, where comparable advanced economies in countries around the world have levels of net debt at about 80 per cent. So they should stop playing their silly political game and admit that debt is necessary to support jobs and that a medium-term fiscal strategy requires some long-term structural savings. So there is a moment of truth approaching for the shadow Treasurer, because he is going to have to show how he would pay down debt, and so will the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow night. Budget",95
111,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.53 pm)My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Leader of the House. Would the minister advise the House of budget initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs and boost productivity through nation-building infrastructure? How can interested members of the public gain information about the budget initiatives?",96
112,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wills for his question. This year's budget provides an additional $8.5 billion for nation-building transport infrastructure, bringing our total investment in nation-building infrastructure to $35 billion. This includes the most significant ever investment by the federal government in rail for our major cities-nine out of 15 new projects announced last night. There is support for rail in Perth, in Adelaide, in Melbourne, in Brisbane, on the Gold Coast and in Sydney-right across the nation. There is an engagement in urban rail that will provide cleaner, greener, faster public transport services to those who live in our major cities. It is good policy in dealing with urban congestion but also good policy as part of the fight to tackle dangerous climate change. But we have also delivered for regional Australia. Of the $35 billion, some $21.2 billion, or 60 per cent, will directly benefit those living in regional communities through projects such as the Hunter Expressway in New South Wales. We will be fixing the Cooroy to Curra, section B-ignored by those opposite, even when the transport minister was the local member. There have been 13 fatalities on this section of the road since July 2002. It took a Labor government to fix it, and fix it we will. We will be dealing with ports, dealing with nation-building infrastructure, supporting jobs today but building the infrastructure that the country needs tomorrow. The centrepiece, the largest single infrastructure project, is of course our $43 billion commitment to fibre-to-the-premises broadband. We believe that this is absolutely critical. It is through information technology being available that we are communicating the message of last night's budget to our constituents and to the population in general. I would encourage people to log on to the website, www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au, to see the direct impact that our plan is having right around the nation. But they do not have to just log on to our website, because many members of this House are using information technology to send a message about jobs. There is one member opposite who is sending a big message about a particular job through the internet. People can log on to the new website that has just gone live in conjunction with the budget, www.petercostello.com.au. It went live today, in conjunction with the budget. We have heard about the confusion of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer when it comes to budget initiatives. Well, it is not just our side that agrees it is inadequate. Pete clearly thinks they are not der. The minister was asked a question about infrastructure in the budget. He was not asked a question about every member of parliament's website, as we all have websites. It is completely irrelevant to the question. It is not Vaudeville day; it is the day after the budget and it is an important day. The minister should be called back to answer the question about the budget.",96
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The minister for infrastructure will relate his answer to the question.,97
114,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, absolutely, because I was asked a question as the Leader of the House by the member for Wills about the way in which members are communicating about the budget with members of the public, and I am doing just that. I can understand why those opposite are sensitive, given the sophistication of this budget site with videos, indeed with information about Higgins. He could not turn up to the community infrastructure program launch I did in Higgins last week, but now he has a new-found interest in his electorate. Of course, the member for Higgins could have been a bit more imaginative when he decided the title, because people might not be able to find this website. Perhaps he could have named it noticker.com.au. Perhaps he could have called it ‘Plan C.org'. Perhaps he could call it imavailable.com.au. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is three o'clock the day after the budget and they have already given up defending this budget. This kind of trivia is not working",97

116,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks, Mr Speaker. The fact is that those opposite are characterised in their attitude towards this budget by opportunism.

120,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to his own Budget Paper No. 1, 323, and I refer to the fact that his budget papers are predicting above-trend growth in Australia in 2017, which would be the longest above-trend growth period in living memory. My question is: Treasurer, what will be the debt of the nation in 2017?",97
121,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. As I said before, we have a very clear strategy that will begin returning the budget to surplus and pay down debt as the economy recovers, and the budget delivers on that strategy. We put in place the structural saves that are absolutely essential over the long term, we have offset new spending by the final year of the forward estimates and we have held real growth in spending to under two per cent in the years the economy is projected to grow above trend, in 2011-12 and 2012-13. And, of course, this strategy is expected to see the budget return to surplus in 2015-16 and reduce the levels of debt to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. Budget",97
122,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How will the government's secure and sustainable pension reforms support pensioners and prepare Australia for the challenges of the future?",97
123,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question and for his long-time campaigning for the pensioners in his electorate. There are around 30,000 pensioners who will benefit from the decisions the Treasurer announced last night. Yesterday was a historic day for Australia's pensioners. More than three million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veterans service pensioners will get a pension rise. From 20 September this year, single pensioners on the full rate of the pension will receive a $32.49 increase per week. Pensioner couples will receive a $10.14 increase per week. The increase will bring the single rate of the pension to two-thirds of the rate of couples combined. There will be an increase in the base rate for single pensioners and a new pension supplement for all pensioners to simplify the complex maze of payments. All existing pensioners will receive an increase in their total pension payments. These are the most significant reforms to our pension system for 100 years. These reforms will help to cushion pensioners from the impact of the global economic recession, but they will also deliver a stronger, fairer and now a sustainable pension system into the future. Of course, the reforms have been welcomed widely, both by pensioners and by pensioner groups. I will just quote from a few of them. Michael ONEILL, from National Seniors, says: We think (the pension rise) is a very good outcome. It delivers relief for the most vulnerablesingle age pensioners … From the Council on the Ageing, Ian Yates says: After years of unfair treatment for single sioners, they have been recognised and large steps have been taken to rectify it. The new pension system is simpler, which is most welcome. And Val French, from Older People Speak Out, says: Recognition and understanding as last, and cheers in lifting the age eventually to 67. Those of us on a pension have greeted the budget with relief. She goes on to say that she congratulates the government on its decision to move towards increasing the pension age to 67. That decision on the pension age has also been welcomed by business. If I can just quote Heather Ridout from the Australian Industry Group, she says: I think it is a very sensible decision and it really addresses those intergenerational problems that are coming down the track. As I said, these are major reforms and they have involved very tough decisions to make sure that the pension is sustainable for the long term. I am pleased to tell the House that we have state governments also getting behind these reforms. Just this morning the South Australian Treasurer-I am sure the member for Port Adelaide will be pleased to hear this-has confirmed that the South Australian government has agreed to the Prime Minister's request that the pension rise flow through to pensioners in public housing so that the pension rise is not gobbled up by rent increases. These reforms are essential. They are long overdue, decisive action to prepare Australia for the future. Budget",98
124,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that the government has announced $124 billion of new additional spending since the last election. Isn't it the case that, by spending at a rate equivalent to 29 per cent of GDP age penthis year, the Rudd government is now the biggest spending government since World War II?",98
125,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. One of the reasons why we have been so serious about savings in this budget is precisely that we understand that we have to move, first of all, to economic stimulus to support the economy, to support jobs and, as the global economy recovers, to step down on our spending and return the economy to surplus-which is why we have put in place these long-term structural savings. That is why, in this budget, we have delivered something like $22.6 billion in savings over the forward estimates, with no new spending in the final year of the forward estimates. We absolutely understand that, on a temporary basis, we have to spend to stimulate the economy; then we have to bring the budget back to surplus as the global growth returns. That is very important, and it has involved hard choices-hard choices the government has not been afraid to make in this budget. Of course, net spending in this budget is $13 billion over the forward estimates-so I do not know what calculations the shadow Treasurer is using-and the great bulk of that is in the first two years, when is most needed in terms of economic stimulus. Real spending growth has been held to under two per cent in the years the economy is projected to grow above trend. That is what we have done. So do not come in here and continue to fiddle the figures, as you have been doing. Why don't you come in here and be honest about what you would do in these circumstances? Be honest about it and stop playing these silly political games, because we are very serious about supporting our economy, about supporting jobs in this economy and about nation building for the recovery. It is just a pity that we do not have an opposition that has a clue about it. Budget",98
126,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the importance of supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow through the government's budget?,99
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bonner for her question. It is plain to all members of the House and, I think, to all people across the nation listening to this debate today that we have faced an enormous challenge in the preparation of this budget, delivered in the worse economic crisis since the Great Depression. Therefore, the challenge which the government has been seized with is: how do we construct the building blocks, the foundation stones, upon which economic recovery can be constructed? That is why we have embarked upon nation building for recovery. I would encourage all members of the House to get behind this national effort, this national campaign, to build the economy with positive ideas, positive engagement, and take the positive lead of many out there in the business community-out there making hard it decisions to support growth and employment in the most difficult of circumstances. Our overall principle is this: to support jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by building the infrastructure our nation needs for tomorrow. That is why we are investing $22 billion through this budget in roads, rail and ports in practically every state in the Commonwealth. That is why we are investing in a national broadband network right across the nation in order to connect our regional centres and our smallest towns with a proper, modern information superhighway for the 21st century. That is why we are investing $3.6 billion in clean energy projects, including a $1.5 billion investment in what will become, we are advised, the nation's and the world's single largest solar power plant. On top of that, we are investing $3.7 billion in education and research, and supporting also superscience projects right cross the university infrastructure of our nation-in nanotechnology, in biotechnology, in the marine sciences and in climate change science, as well as in space science and astronomy. On top of that, we are investing $3.2 billion in health and hospitals, including investment in some of our nation's most important hospitals, those in particular need. Furthermore, we are investing in critical areas of research, including $1.2 billion for an integrated cancer care network across the country, led by great institutions in Sydneywhat will become Lifehouse at the RPA, in honour of a person respected by both sides of politics in this place, Dr Chris O'Brien-and a project such as that at the Peter MACCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne and right across the nation as well so we have got proper, integrated cancer care for this disease which remains the nation's single largest killer. We are investing in all this infrastructure to create what we need to turbocharge productivity growth in the future for the recovery but also, critically, to support jobs on way through and to make a difference in the impact of this recession. Then, we are out there supporting small business. The temporary investment allowance, a 50 per cent deduction for small business through until the end of this year, is a positive step by the government to assist small businesses facing real problems now out there in the economy. I was surprised and disappointed this morning when I was advised that the member for North Sydney had attacked this initiative which had been put forward by the government. Furthermore, there is the extension of the first home owners boost by a further three months, until 30 September, then staged down by one step before returning to where it was as of 1 January. We know from the housing data the impact that that has had on the residential construction sector in the country and all those jobs that depend on it. We have done this, this investment in infrastructure in the future, as well as provided jobs and support for small business in the here and now, in a fiscal strategy, a fiscal plan for the future, which is sustainable into the forward estimates and beyond. Our plan, very simply, is to have the temporary deficit in three years and return the budget to surplus in six. It is a very clear-cut plan. That is what we have articulated in the budget papers. I again challenge the Leader of the Opposition to produce similar clarity in his budget reply tomorrow night. If he fails to do so, it will be simply white noise. In this budget, we are delivering on this plan also through $22.6 billion in savings this year, coming on the back of $33 billion of savings which were delivered in the 200809 budget. If you put those figures together, the two budgets that we have presented as a government, that is $55 billion worth of savings. Contrast that with the last two years the that those opposite were in office. They delivered a total max of $7.5 billion in savings across their last two budgets when the member for Higgins was sitting there awash with cash flowing in from the mining boom-the mining boom which all of them over there hoped would last forever, deriding those of us on the other side of the House when we dared ask when the mining boom would come to a close. We are therefore framing a strategy of fiscal sustainability based on hard savings-$22 billion this year and $33 billion last year, something like eight times the total amount of savings which those opposite delivered in their last two budgets. I also draw the attention of those opposite to how, therefore, our temporary borrowing for temporary deficit strategy rests with international comparisons. Those opposite squirm when they hear the comparisons that our temporary budget deficit will be less than half that of the major advanced economies in the year ahead. They squirm about the fact that for the question of our temporary budget deficit for a temporary debt that will flow to the economy, we will have a temporary debt for Australia which will be the lowest by a country mile compared with all other major advanced economies. Furthermore, when you look at when our temporary debt will reach its height at 13.8 per cent of GDP, that will represent about one-seventh of the debt of the major advanced economies across the world. I would simply draw the attention of those opposite, as they try to score political capital out of this point and this necessary intervention in the economy at this stage, to what Standard and Poor's have said overnight. They said: Tonight's Commonwealth budget is consistent with Australia's triple A long-term rating for the country. The triple A rating is the highest rating assigned by Standard and Poor's. They go on to say: WeThat is, Standard and Poor'sbelieve the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances. This is underpinned by the strength of the government's balance sheet, which provides flexibility to absorb debt levels and cyclical deficits of this nature. That is what the ratings agency Standard and Poor's has concluded about the budget we delivered last night. It also rests on the comparisons which exist between Australia's net debt over time as being lower by a country mile than the net debt of the other major advanced economies and, as I said, one-seventh of that when we reach the peak of our net debt at 13.8 per cent of GDP. Bearing in mind what the member for North Sydney has confirmed today, which is that his debt for this country would be $25 billion less than that which we are providing and proposing by way of the government for our plans going forward, I would suggest that the member for North Sydney reflects long and hard on the observations from Standard and Poor's and Moody's and the other agencies as well. When we are out there investing in construction for infrastructure for tomorrow to support jobs and small business and apprenticeships for today, let us also reflect on this point. When a future generation of kids looks back at the time when their state-of-the-art 21st century library was built in their primary school they will point back to the actions of this Labor government which used this recession in order to invest in that library. Mr Costello interjecting",99
128,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice that the member for Higgins regards such an investment as humorous. He regards as an object of ridicule the building of state-of-the-art science centres in secondary schools right across regional Australia, which are somewhat removed from the type of school he attended himself. Also with our investment in state-of the-art science centres and language centres you will have a generation of kids looking back and saying, ‘These advances in our schools, these investments in modernising our schools, came off the back of a Labor government. It is prepared to get in there and have a go, investing in the infrastructure we need for the future while providing jobs, apprenticeships and support for apprentices here and now.' This government has crafted a strategy for the future, which we believe is robust and strong. It is a nation-building plan for recovery, a nation-building plan for the future, as opposed to the cobbled-together ‘Hoover' plan being advocated by those opposite, if ever they could possibly harness their act and get it together and coordinate a position, at least for a 30-minute stretch of time.

129,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and I refer him to his Budget Overview, appendix F: Major Savings in the 2009-10 Budget. I refer him to the Prime Minister's last answer and his own answer, saying that they had made tough decisions. Why is it that if you are spinning tough decisions the total savings over five years represent one per cent of all your expenditure?",102
130,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We cannot wait to see how much more he is going to cut. If he thinks we have not cut enough, he is now confirming that he is going to cut a lot more. Of course he has got to confirm tomorrow night what they are going to save in the budget to pay for the pension increase. That is a very big task that is building up for the shadow Treasurer. But as I said before, in the 200910 budget there are savings of $22.7 billion. In the 2008-09 budget there were savings over four years of $33 billion. That is a very substantial effort. Mr Hockey-But you say it is a tough budget!",102
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney has asked his question.,102
132,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this budget what we put in place was absolutely essential economic stimulus to support jobs, to support businesses, to support households and to support regions, because of what has been imposed on this country by the rest of the world. And what he is confirming again is that the official position of the Liberal Party is to do a less-not to borrow and therefore to savagely put up taxes or to savagely cut services. That is the position of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is not a position even shared by the business community that are normally more supportive of those opposite. The common sense proposition is that when you have such a sharp contraction of private demand the government has to move into stimulate demand to support jobs, to support households and to support businesses. That is something that simply does not occur to them. What we have got is an opportunistic play here from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer-a whole heap of confusion and fuzziness-because they are not up to the job. Environment: Alternative Energy",102
133,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism. How will the government's $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative accelerate Australia's transition to a low-emissions energy pathway?",102
134,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for the question because she, like many in this House coming from Tasmania, understands the importance of energy transformation in Australia. I say that because, coming from northern Tasmania, she comes from a state which has historically made a major contribution to the renewable energy market in Australia-historically Hydro Tasmania and in more recent times the development of wind energy through the assistance of Roaring 40s. That is why the Clean Energy Initiative of the government is very important. It is about building the energy infrastructure of tomorrow. That is exceptionally important to Australia at the moment because it is about not only energy lot security but also putting in place the necessary investment to enable Australia to achieve its ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions. On that note, it is an absolute priority for Australia to front up to the need to make a complete transformation of energy technology as we know it. That is not just about our traditional reliance on coal-fired power stations; it is also about bringing through new investment in areas such as renewable energy, aided and assisted by the implementation of a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 and in association with finalising the debate-which goes to investment security in Australia, something that is expected by the private sector-with respect to putting a price on carbon. Hence the importance of resolving, this year, the debate concerning the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme because it actually finalises an investment horizon which enables us to achieve energy security in the 21st century. This energy security debate, in association with our Clean Energy Initiative, is very central to the debate with respect to jobs. We talking about an investment of $4.5 billion but, through a new partnership with the private sector and state governments, we will be able to leverage over $10 billion in Australia. This initiative will make a further major tribution to the issue of job creation as we go through this global financial crisis. It is about nation building for recovery. the context of carbon capture and storage, we are talking about a $2.4 billion investment which is going to bring substantial investment by the private sector and state governments in resolving what is all important to Australia both from an energy security point of view and from an export point of view, as we are a major exporter of coal. Carbon capture and storage is a must for Australia. very important both from an energy security point of view and from the point of view of reducing our carbon emissions. Our carbon capture initiatives are a world first. We have already put in place offshore storage capacity-world-first legislation-and we are now in the process of considering commercial investment in that offshore storage capacity. The new part of the investment strategy, as embodied in our Clean Energy Initiative, of this budget goes also to a world first in terms of solar technology. We have placed on the table for consideration by state and territory governments in association with the private sector an investment of $1.6 billion to be invested in large-scale power generation in a solar flagships program. The target of 1,000 megawatts of solar power represents three times the size of the largest solar energy project in the world today. It means that potentially we in Australia will put in place in the foreseeable future four individual power generation projects, solar thermal, in association with the further development of solar photovoltaic opportunities in Australia-important from a baseload point of view. In association with our focus on solar are energy, we are looking at other renewable sources, such as geothermal, wave and biomass. Renewables Australia represents an overall investment of $465 million to support leading-edge technology research, developcon- ment and demonstration projects. In conclusion, the Australian community expects this investment horizon. The key to In any economy is energy security, and in order to maintain energy security in Australia in the 21st century we have to appropriately focus on the transformation of energy technology to achieve a reduction in carbon emissions. The nation building for recovery program of the government will enable us to build the energy infrastructure of tomorrow and in doing so not only ensure energy secuIt is rity but also lower emissions and, importantly, assist in job creation in a very difficult economic circumstance.

135,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Given the government has spent a record $220 million a day in new initiatives since it was elected 18 months ago, how can the Australian people believe that there will not be one new spending initiative between now and 2017?

140,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have put in place an expenditure cap once growth returns to trend of two per cent. It is going to be a very, very tough discipline for this government or any other government into the future-a very tough discipline. That is why we have put in place our long-term savings. That is why we took our savings responsibilities so seriously last year and why we have taken them so seriously this year-this year particularly because of events in the global economy and particularly because we had to make some room for the pension increase. We had to make some long-term structural saves, and we have done that. We have a responsible course of action but the weight is now on those opposite: where are they going to make the savings? They say they are not going to run a deficit, they say they are going to support the pension increase, so where are the savings? They are simply not credible. Budget",104
141,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. How is the government investing in jobs, skills and productivity in the budget? What has the government done to invest in tertiary education infrastructure in the budget?",104
142,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she and members of the House who are interested in jobs today and jobs of the future will be very interested to see this part of the budget documents, Transforming Australia's higher education system, which delivers the government's response to the Bradley and Cutler reviews and which charts a future vision for Australian higher education and also records our infrastructure spend for higher education for universities and vocational education and training to support jobs today. This is the next chapter of our education revolution, to ensure that our universities can be a world-class system receiving the resources that they need to offer the quality that Australian students want, to increase the number of Australians with qualifications at the undergraduate level or beyond, to increase the participation of Australians from lower income backgrounds in Australian higher education, and to chart a new vision for research and for innovation. It is this blueprint for reform which has been hailed by the Group of Eight universities as ‘visionary'. It is this blueprint for reform that delivers $5.7 billion to our higher education and innovation systems over the next four years. Detailed in this document is our major infrastructure investment to support jobs today in the institutions which will matter so much for the jobs of tomorrow. In this budget we announced almost $3 billion for infrastructure in universities, vocational education and training, and research from the Education Investment Fund. This investment included an announcement of $934 million for 31 projects from the Education Investment Fund for round 2. Twelve of the successful projects are in vocational education and training, 11 are for higher education teaching and learning facilities and eight are for research. Taking into account funding that is also being provided by the project proponents, the total value of these projects is $1.8 billion. I am not surprised that the member for Cunningham asked me this question because she would have seen in this document a major new investment in the University of Wollongong: $43.8 million for the Australian Institute for Innovation Materials. I am sure that there are members on this side of the House, including the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo, who would have looked at this list last night with some sense of excitement about the possibilities that it meant for their local universities. The budget also provides a further $500 million for the Education Investment Fund round 3, and $200 million of this round will be to support the structural adjustment of Australian universities as they move towards a demand driven system for the future. The government has also announced a sustainability round worth $650 million, with $400 million to be dedicated to research infrastructure related to the Clean Energy Initiative, which my colleague the minister for resources has just been outlining to the House, and a $250 million investment for vocational education and training, higher education and research infrastructure related to climate change and sustainability activities. As part of the Australian government's commitment to creating and supporting the jobs of the future, there is the planned allocafiscal tion of $2.5 billion of funds into the Education Investment Fund, to be allocated to the groundbreaking Clean Energy Initiative, clean energy obviously being such an important part of the jobs of the future. I wait interest, like other members of the House, to see whether tomorrow night we will find out that all of the money to support Australia's universities and vocational education and training institutes will be cut by the opposition, as they are part of the things that the shadow Treasurer will cut, because we do know of course that the track record of the Liberal Party is not to support higher education. I will be waiting to see whether that is one of the things that they will be saying they will take a saving from. Budget",104
143,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's words in this place during the last recession: We will continue to worry about the deficit because we want to promote long-term sustainable growth. That can be provided only if we have a disciplined fiscal strategy; if we raise our taxes and spend to accommodate the revenue available. Given that the Treasurer is now the biggest spending Treasurer in modern Australian history and given that he is overseeing the biggest deficit in modern Australian history and he is the Treasurer delivering the biggest debt in modern Australian history, isn'the embarrassed by his previous words?",105

146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked. Those on my left!,105
147,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister and I and the finance minister are committed to discipline, which is why we have put in place our budget rules, which I was talking about before-unlike those opposite, who, when it was raining gold bars during the mining boom, could not find enough with money to put a basic pension increase in for single age pensioners. Shame on them! They could not find enough money to invest in basic infrastructure. Shame on them! They had an absolutely appalling record of not finding savings. They spent like drunken sailors at the top of the boom and now the global recession has shone a very bright light on that. Let us just look at the savings record of the government compared to that of the previous government. This government has found savings over two budgets of $55 billion, $22.6 billion in this budget and $33 billion in the last budget. This is the record of the previous Liberal government: last budget $3.2 billion in savings for 2007-08, in 2006-07 only $4.3 billion, and in 2005-06 $4.6 billion. They were there at the top of mining boom and it was raining gold bars and they could not look after pensioners, they could not invest in infrastructure and now they have got the hide to come into this House and claim they know what fiscal discipline means. They have not got a clue, and the country is now living with the consequences of some of the practices of those opposite as well as the global recession. We will deal with the global recession in a responsible and mature way, and we have done that, and we will chart the course back to surplus in a fiscally responsible way.",105
148,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Will the minister advise the House of the benefits in the budget for Australia's 1.9 million small businesses and of what has been the reaction to the budget?",106
149,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her contribution to small business development in this country, because she ran a small business for seven years and an association that represented small businesses. So I say thank you very much to the member for Parramatta. This is a budget of nation building for covery. The budget is supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. The Commonwealth Treasury advises that up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work if not for the stimulus packages that we have initiated and for this budget. We have made the tough savings to deliver the lowest level of net debt of all major advanced economies. In respect of small business, the budget boosts incentives and support for small businesses by well over $500 million. I will go through some of the measures. The government will increase the small business tax the break from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and extend it from 30 June this year until the end of the year. Small business owners around Australia in the forums that I have been doing for the last few months tell me that what they really need is some extra advice during the global economic recession, and we are responding to that with a small business support line at a cost of $10 million so that they get that timely advice and support that they need. The budget also provides another $10 million to establish a small business online program-maybe the member for Higgins could Budget take advantage of that with his new, youbeaut website-so that small businesses are really well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the National Broadband Network. There is a new research and development tax credit, which will double the incentive for small businesses to undertake research and development in this country. I remind members here that when the Howard-Costello government came to office in 1996, they cut that R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. This restores the effective rate of support for small businesses to undertake research and development back up to an effective 150 per cent. That is very good news for small busire- ness. I could spend more time going through a whole range of other initiatives that are contained in this budget for small business.",106

152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would ask the minister to ignore the encouragement. The minister will return to the question.,107
153,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and I think, in deference to you, Mr Speaker, I should not spend another quarter of an hour going through that, which would be a mercy to the coalition. But I do make this point: the initiatives contained in the budget build on the $42 billion stimulus package-a nation-building economic stimulus package which we call a ‘tradies package' because two-thirds of that stimulus is to build infrastructure in Australia, whether it is in our schools or on our roads or local council infrastructure. That is very important to support our tradies. I am very disappointed, again, with the shadow Treasurer, who said that this is far too much money and that the coalition would not spend anywhere near that money on supporting tradies and supporting small businesses. Of course, we know that the Leader of the Opposition will put into his budget reply speech tomorrow night some references to small business-how they love small business and how they support small business-but we have the shadow Treasurer saying that, no, they would not put anywhere near the sort of money that we would put into the tradies package to support our small businesses. He has been a constant carping critic of our small business ‘No-one will take that up.' An Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey for the March quarter shows that 31 per cent of businesses have said that they will bring forward investment in plant and equipment to take advantage of that tax break. If they were doing that when the rate was 30 per cent, imagine what they are going to do when the rate is 50 per cent. This is a very strong initiative for small business. It is not just me saying this; it is the Council of Small Business of Australia, who said that ‘small business is recognised as the backbone of Australia's economy in budget 2009'. We have the Master Builders of Australia saying that they ‘welcome the increase in the small business investment tax allowance from the current level of 30 per cent to 50 per cent'. Mr Ciobo interjecting",107
154,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, why don't you get on board? You have the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry saying that ‘the extension of the investment allowance to 50 per cent for small business until December 2009 is an excellent initiative' and ‘a stimulus measure first proposed by ACCI and our members'. We have the farmers again supporting Labor's initiatives. The farmers are saying, ‘Farmers will also welcome the small business tax break increase on capital works investment'-the very tax break increase that the coalition criticises and says, ‘Farmers won't take it up; no-one will take it up.' Let's ask the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. In a release just out, hot off the press, they say: The Federal Government's Budget decision to increase and extend the investment tax break for small business provides a valuable incentive for new vehicle sales. The tax break will help stimulate the new vehicle market and support jobs in tax break, saying, the industry There you go-supporting our jobs; supporting our tradies. But what is happening on the coalition side? It is an unfolding tragedy because, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, the Leader of the Opposition has said, on cue of order. Members of this House had thought that the Prime Minister was somewhat boring, but the minister for small business really takes the cake. Please put the House out of its misery and sit him down.",107

I was asked about reactions and I have been explaining some of the reactions to the budget, but there are other reactions to the budget. The opposition leader has said that he would have a small deficit or a small surplus-that is $50 billion worth of increased taxes or $50 billion of cuts in expenditure. What did we have on the same day, within 18 minutes? We had the shadow Treasurer saying that it would be $25 billion smaller. So we have one saying $50 billion to be cut and another saying $25 billion. And, of course, my counterpart, the shadow minister for small business, independent contractors, tourism and the arts, got into the act, saying just the other day that for this year the deficit will be 50 per cent lower.

Are you aware that the station selected by the ABC to broadcast proceedings of this place is ABC NewsRadio, which provides approximately half of its daily program content from the British, American, German and Dutch public radio system and would therefore appear to have ample time to provide the Australian people with full coverage of the recording of question time, not a censored version? Today's issue also raises the question as to why in fact ABC NewsRadio does not play a full recording of the proceedings of the non-direct broadcast chamber and the Main Committee upon the completion of proceedings of the relevant direct broadcast chamber, instead of overseas based broadcasts? As the Presiding Officer in this House, would you please consider this issue in the interest of publicising all proceedings of this place in full.",108

A joint committee on the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings is appointed in each parliament pursuant to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946. Everything that flows from the rebroadcast by radio is as a result of decisions of that committee. I will take on board some aspects of what the member has put to me about whether there are other times that could be used to rebroadcast beyond one hour, but the so-called ‘censorship' that the member refers to is as a result of decisions of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings over several parliaments. In relation to the incident today, I think we can safely say there is a member of staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services who, whilst we should admire them for being creative and showing initiative, learnt a valuable lesson and will not be so creative without consultation with others. The lights should not have been switched on and off. That has not been the practice, as members have indicated to me.

After leaving out my references to Labor's abolition of temporary protection visas and the contraction of resources, Senator Arbib claimed that I was indicating that there was no difference between the government's and the coalition's border protection policies.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",109
168,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Last night I heard a member of the Labor Party describe this budget as a traditional Labor budget. I thought how true that is-big deficit, big debt and more people unemployed. This is the Labor way. It is like groundhog day in this place. The Labor Party comes in and Australia heads towards recession. The Labor Party comes in and we reach record levels of deficit and debt. The Labor Party comes in and spins fiscal responsibility, and yet they have become the biggestspending government in modern Australian history. There is a lesson here: you always have to look at what Labor does and not at what they say. For months now, the Labor Party has been telling us that the decimation of the budget, the massive debt that is being accrued as a result of significant deficits, is all caused by the collapse in revenue. And yet, when you have a good look at the budget papers, you can identify this: finally the truth emerges during the lock-up that the Labor Party, through its unbelievable expenditure to since the Rudd government was elected, has become the biggest-spending government since World War II. Of the $188 billion of net debt, two-thirds of that is directly linked to new spending initiatives by the Rudd government. They are not just new spending initiatives but reckless spending initiatives. They are reckless spending initiatives that not only blow the proceeds of the last mining boom but seek to spend all the proceeds of the next mining boom. This is reckless fiscal management. It is an assault on the public finances of Australia that we have not seen in generations. They have done it wilfully and they have done it without any care for the future. On each day that they come into this place and lecture us-the Liberals and the Nationals-about fiscal responsibility I want everyone to remember that in 1996, when the coalition were last elected into government, we inherited a debt of $96 billion. We inherited a $10 billion black hole. We were left with nothing in the can. We had to make hard decisions to repair Labor's mismanagement-they were damn hard decisions. I was elected in 1996. There was hardly a government service left in my electorate in North Sydney after that budget. It was a budget that had to be done by the former Treasurer up there, the member for Higgins, who had to make the hard decisions. Let us remind Australians for the record that the Labor Party opposed us on every single decision, root and branch, that would get the budget back into surplus and that would pay off Labor's $96 billion debt. The more I hear these sanctimonious fools lecturing us about responsible opposition the more I reflect on the fact that when they left us with $96 billion of debt, when they left us with a black hole of $10 billion, they voted against all the tough initiatives, such as the reform of higher education, a tough initiative; the PBS reform, a damn hard initiative; changes to the disability pension; and HECS increases. They voted against privatisation not once but on a number of occasions over the whole 11 years. They voted against the super surcharge levy, and then they voted to try and keep it some years later. They voted against the closing down of Working Nation, where they fiddled the figures about the real impact of the Keating budget. And then it came to structural reform, the stuff that lays the foundations, the important stuff, the important initiatives that actually make a difference to the fabric of the nation-tax reform. How hard was that? I remember sitting in this House day after day, arguing with the then shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, as they were tearing apart the hardest structural initiative in modern times. It was major tax reform, and they voted against it. Even though we won an election with a mandate they voted against it. Even though at every election we sought a mandate and even though we won a mandate on privatisation, they voted against it. Even today how ironic it was to see the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy coming to the dispatch box and saying, ‘We have fixed the R&D tax concessions.' The coalition reduced it from 150 per cent to 125 per cent but-good news, Australia-it's back at 150 per cent. Do you know why we reduced it? Because we ran out of money. Do you know why we ran out of money? Because of Labor. Mr Truss-Labor had spent it.",109
169,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Labor had spent every dollar in the can and, what is more, they had hocked the future. We are in a situation today where the Labor Party is back in government. And what happens? Groundhog Day; it all happens again. They not only spend the money that was there, but they actually spend all of tomorrow's money as well. I think it is the first time in my recollection that a Treasurer actually stood up to deliver a budget speech and did not tell us what the budget was. I cannot recall-and in fact a number of members of this House and outsiders actually could not recall-a situation where the Treasurer did not have the courage to come into this place and give a fair dinkum assessment of the real impact of the budget. Do you know why? Because the Labor Party were desperate to spin this budget into total confusion. And in some way they got away with it. They talked tough before the budget came down. They leaked all these figures out to pretend that it could be terrible, far worse than anything that happened. Of course, when they delivered it, it was better than expected and they said: ‘Isn't it great we've got only 8½ per cent unemployment? Isn't it fantastic? We've done so well. It could have been 10. It could have been 15 per cent. But you know what? We're delivering 8½ per cent unemployment. We're so good.' That is what the Labor Party say. That is great, isn't it. It was four per cent 18 months ago, and the Labor Party take pride in one million Australians being unemployed. They are saying the budget deficit could have been $70 billion next year: ‘And you know what? It's fantastic. Aren't we great? We've delivered $58 billion. Haven't we done a wonderful job? Forget that it's the largest budget deficit since World War II. Forget that. That's irrelevant.' This is the 13th episode of Fawlty Towers. I am having terrible flashbacks of Manuel and Basil Fawlty-all of them, the whole team. I am reminded of that song Ship of Fools because it is a ship of fools over there. The problem for us and the problem for all Australians is this: the ship of fools is running the country. The ship of fools is running up the biggest deficit in modern Australian history. The ship of fools is running up the biggest debt in Australian history: $9,000 for every man, every woman and every child in Australia. And you know what? It will be bigger. I am prepared to bet everything I have that the Labor Party deficit and debt will be far bigger than what we heard last night, because that is how they do it. The Labor Party has no restraint; the Labor Party has no control. It is very interesting, isn't it? They come in here and selectively quote from so-called authorities about how they have got a plan to get out of it. There will be the usual sycophantic so-called business representatives that will say that the Labor Party has a plan to get out of debt and deficit. But I tell you what: the ANZ described the budget as having ‘optimism' around the economic forecasts, suggesting there is considerable scope for slippage. ‘Slippage'-this is a new one! And the National Australia Bank said: Our real concern is that the budget does not lay out a credible medium-term policy to return the budget to a more sustainable footing … Damn right-the NAB is absolutely right. In perhaps the most truthful analysis of the forecasting and the Labor Party's so-called plan to get the budget back into surplus, JP Morgan says: Swan Diving into the Red Sea … … … Crucially, the Treasurer's “cross your fingers” strategy for returning the Budget to surplus relies principally (and optimistically) on a return to strong, above trend economic growth, rather than the “hard decisions” he promised. Amen. Hard decisions represent one per cent of all expenditure over the five years that they are citing. One per cent-that is the ‘hard decision'. If you believe the Labor Party's commentary, our position on that is going to decide the future of the nation's finances, with one per cent-one per cent!-of total expenditure going to be saved. That is the big political issue today. That is why they are a ship of fools. They do not understand that it is the structural issue that is the problem. When you give people a so-called plan, it had better have credibility. The Labor plan has no credibility. It is based on assumptions that the IMF and the RBA do not agree with-not that the IMF and the RBA are always right, but there is a level of credibility associated with them, as there is with JP Morgan, the National Australia Bank and everyone else who says that these figures are rubbery. Do you know what? Underpinning this estimation-that they are going to get out the deficit, and that is not even the debt but the deficit-is an assumption that Australia is going to come out of this recession faster than anyone really thinks, but we are also going to have the longest period of abovetrend growth than anyone can remember. It will be the mining boom on steroids that gets these guys out of a deficit and a debt. The problem is that every Australian is going to have to pay for this. And, lo and behold, out of all of this the key issue is-we believe it when the government says it, as does everyone else-that this government will not make one new spending decision between now and 2017. Do we believe that?",110

173,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No-one believes it. Here is a Prime Minister that has committed over $200 million a day in new spending initiatives since he was elected, and they are asking us to believe that the deficit will be no worse because they will not have one new major spending initiative between now and 2017. They are a ship of fools. If they believe the Treasurer, who is the navigator on the ship of fools, and if they believe the Prime Minister, who is the captain of the ship of fools, then they deserve their place that ship. The challenge for us is to keep this government accountable. The challenge for us is to stand true-which we will do-to our core principles. You should aim to spend only that which you collect, you should aim to create jobs not just for today but for tomorrow, you should be fiscally responsible, and, most importantly of all, you should not leave the next generation of Australians with a level of debt that will be a ball and chain around their legs and will prevent them from seizing the opportunities that the coalition have worked so hard to deliver over 11 years of government.",112

175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney was heard in silence.,112
176,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is another example of the Liberal mythmaking machine in overdrive. As we have seen in the last 24 hours, it is another example from the member for North Sydney. According to the Leader of the Opposition, according to the member for North Sydney and according to the other spokespeople, if only the Australian people had had the good sense to keep them in office everything would be rosy. Everything would be fine-the deficit would be lower; the debt would be lower; unemployment would be lower. According to their narrative, everything would be fine if only the Liberal Party had retained their rightful place as the born-to-rule party of this nation. But at the heart of their narrative there are two patently false claims-two claims so laughable that I would have thought the opposition would be embarrassed by the pauon city of their argument and by the plain sophistry of their narrative. The first false proposition is this: the deficits would be lower in future years under the opposition's plan, because they would not have made the direct payments to families that we made. That is proposition No. 1. They say, ‘We wouldn't have had the cash splash, we wouldn't have sent $900 to working families, so our deficits would be lower.' Let us put aside the fact that those payments have been so important in keeping the Australian economy as robust as it is, compared to the rest of the world. Let us look at the fiscal impact of that decision. We went down the road of payments to families because they were temporary and because they were targeted, because they would wash through the budget, because almost all the impact would be in the 2008-09 financial year and they would not be a drag in future years. And what did the opposition say at the time? They said: ‘We wouldn't do that. We'd oppose that. We wouldn't make the $900 payments to families.' Instead, they said, ‘We'd have tax cuts-permanent tax cuts.' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition called them ‘broad and sweeping tax cuts'. The Leader of the Opposition made a virtue out of the fact that they would be permanent. He even trotted out academics-John Taylor from Stanford University-to say that people need to know that the reduction in their tax permanent so that they increase their spending. Of course, a permanent reduction in tax means a permanent drag on the budget bottom line-a different approach from this government, not temporary, not targeted, but a permanent drag on the bottom line. That means that, while our stimulus payments to families have no impact on the budget in the outyears, theirs would have an ongoing impact. They come in here and claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. They say, ‘We stand for lower deficits; we stand for lower debt,' when their policy would directly mean higher deficits and higher debt. They are hypocrisy personified. Mr Robert interjecting",112
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Fadden is warned!,113
178,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are engaging in a blatant falsehood with the Australian people; they are taking the Australian people for mugs. The opposition's second false premise is closely related to the first-that is, that the increase in the debt and deficits over the forward estimates is not primarily due to the revenue write-down that the government has experienced. We have just heard the shadow Treasurer say again that the main impact on the deficit situation has been government spending. It has not been revenue writedowns, they say. This reached its most ridiculous last week on 7 May on the Sky News AM Agenda program in a debate between our colleague the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and the shadow minister for small business, the member for Moncrieff. I confess I did not see it myself; I heard about it. I have a bit of a soft spot for the member for Moncrieff, so I could not believe it. I thought the story must have been embellished. So I checked the transcript, ready to leap to the defence of the is member for Moncrieff, but unfortunately it was indefensible. He said this: We put forward our proposal for the stimulus package this year, which would be about 50 per cent of Labor's. Therefore, this year the deficit will be 50 per cent or less. Let us just think about this. He said, ‘Our stimulus would be 50 per cent less, therefore our deficit would be 50 per cent less.' There is a small problem with this equation, as the minister for small business correctly pointed out during the program, because it completely ignores tax write-downs. It completely ignores the wrecking ball that has gone through the Australian budget as a result of the global economic downturn, the fact that tax receipts have fallen so dramatically. The revenue loss in 2008-09 is $23 billion, but that did not happen according to the opposition. The member for Moncrieff says that it did not happen because he says that the only driver of the deficit is the stimulus program. If we have 50 per cent less stimulus then we would have 50 per cent less deficit. That is just not right, putting aside the fact that arguably they would not have had a 50 per cent smaller deficit because they believed in, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-who is present in the chamber-said, ‘broad and sweeping tax cuts'. Her economic narrative is that they would make the government money. Remember that? Broad and sweeping tax cuts would actually make the government money-just before she lost the shadow Treasurership of Australia without seeing one budget. I wonder why that happened, when they engage in voodoo economics. We cannot be too hard on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and on the member for Moncrieff, because it comes right from the top. It comes from the Leader of the Opposition himself. Even today, the Leader of the Opposition said to Sky News this morning: In 2012-13 there will be a net debt of $188 billion, an almost inconceivable figure. Since he was elected, Mr Rudd has spent $124 billion, so in fact about two-thirds of his debt is represented his spending since he got elected. Yes, the economic downturn has hurt us-no question. It has affected tax revenues, but the biggest contribution to that debt has been discretionary spending by the Rudd government. Let us have a look at the Leader of the Opposition's maths. He says that net debt in 2012-13 will be $188 billion. Yes, he got that from the budget papers. He says that the new government expenditure is responsible for $124 billion. If that is correct, that means the revenue write-down would be $64 billion, but we heard the shadow Treasurer last night say he accepts that the revenue write-down is $210 billion. The Leader of the Opposition needs to explain his maths. He needs to justify his sums. He needs to say how he came to that figure. If he cannot, he is clearly engaging in sophistry of the most wilful and disgraceful type. The Leader of the Opposition said on Sky News this morning, ‘You can't argue with the numbers.' Well he is arguing with the numbers and he has come off second best, just as he might argue with the numbers and come off second best in the Liberal party room in a couple of months, I suspect. We also had the official opposition response last night in the shadow Treasurer's press release. I thought that this would be good-two pages, obviously a considered press release with a great deal of thought going into his position. We would welcome that. The first page of the shadow Treasurer's press release condemns the government for the deficit. It says that the deficit is too high, that we should have been tougher, et cetera. If that is the line they are going to take, fair enough. But then the second page condemns our savings measures. It says we have saved too much. How dare we deal with the private health insurance rebate, how dare we deal with structural change to the budget deficit. But the best bit comes towards the end. This by is my personal favourite. I almost fell off my chair when I read this and I feel obliged to share it with the House. We come to education and training and the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney said-brace yourselves, this is good: … the Government is offering nothing new for Australian schools at all. I am not sure where the shadow Treasurer has been but I seem to recall the government delivering the biggest rebuilding program of Australian schools in our history-which the opposition opposes. Now he comes in-this is a press release-and says that the government is offering nothing new for Australian schools at all. So having opposed the biggest rebuilding program, now the opposition is calling for us to do more. But it gets better! The shadow Treasurer then goes on to say: Universities have been let down. Universities have been let down by this government! That is from a member of the only government in the entire OECD to preside over a reduction in higher education funding. This government has delivered in this budget $5.7 billion over four years for higher education, and the shadow Treasurer says that universities have been let down! So presumably he would like to see more spending. So they call for a lower deficit, they oppose the spending cuts and they call for more spending! I am not quite sure how that works. The shadow Treasurer says that universities have been let down. The chairman of the Group of Eight, Professor Alan Robson, said: In a difficult budgetary environment, Ministers Carr and Gillard are to be commended for their long-term vision and commitment to Australian higher education. And, close to home, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Professor Reid, said: This has been a landmark Federal Budget for university teaching and research funding-one that promises to transform Australia's higher cation landscape. So the shadow Treasurer says that universities have been let down. The universities do not agree. He calls for more, yet the opposition also call for a lower deficit and a lower debt. Is it any wonder that all the evidence is that the Australian people have lost all confidence in the economic management abilities of those opposite? If the opposition were in charge it is highly unlikely that we would have seen some of the endorsements of the budget that we saw last night. It is highly unlikely we would have seen Standard and Poor's saying: The budget articulates a plan for fiscal consolidation as economic conditions recover. The successful delivery of this strategy of returning the operating position to surpluses over the cycle and maintaining lower debt will be consistent with maintaining the AAA rating of Australia. I wonder if that would have been the case if we had had the voodoo economics of those opposite, with their voodoo dolls, saying, ‘How do we do this? I know what we'll do: we'll lower the deficit, we'll spend more and we'll oppose savings measures.' I wonder if we would have seen that sort of endorsement then. Why did we see that sort of endorsement? We saw it because the government was dealing with the long-term pressures on the Australian budget, including the long-term pressures of demography-not only the global financial crisis but the ageing of the Australian population and the pressures that that will place on the Australian budget in years to come. It has been said by many people that demography is destiny. That was said by the Leader of the Opposition. He said it in his first speech. I remember it well; it was the same day as my first speech. The Leader of the Opposition said: eduThe demographic storm is coming. How hard it blows and how well our children weather it will depend in large measure on the decisions we take today … Well said. It was a good contribution. It was a good first speech. I was sitting on the opposition side, listening to it. The issue of demography is why decisions that we have taken-like dealing with the age pensionare so important. People are living longer. The proportion of the population that is ageing is growing rapidly and unless we make decisions now about how to deal with the ‘demographic storm'-as the Leader of the Opposition calls it-we will be leaving it to our children and we will be doing them a disservice. Policy decisions about dealing with the age pension and dealing with the private health insurance rebate are the sorts of decisions that the government has had to make. They are tough decisions-decisions which were not made lightly; decisions which were not made with alacrity. They were decisions that were made over a long period of time in a careful and considered way. They are tough decisions. The opposition says that they are not tough decisions but the opposition are not sure whether they are tough enough to support them. They say, ‘You haven't made any tough decisions, but the decisions you have taken are too tough for us to support.' That seems to be the other confused narrative that we get from the Leader of the Opposition. Budget time is not a test just for governments. As much as it is a test for governments it is also a test for oppositions. And tomorrow night will be a test for this Leader of the Opposition. Last year it was a test for the member for Bradfield-a test that he failed, and he paid the price. Tomorrow night will be a test as to whether the Leader of the Opposition can live up to his title. Is he a leader or is he an opportunist? It will be a test as to whether he is willing to act or willing just to whinge. It will be a test as to whether he is interested in the nation's interest or in his own self-interest. It will be a as to whether he is up to the job of the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian people do not look just to the government for leadership in times like this; they also look to the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has been strong on rhetoric about bipartisanship in the face of this crisis. He has been very good at the rhetoric. Tomorrow night he has the chance to come in here and lend some bipartisan support for this government's efforts to keep the economy strong, to provide stimulus to the economy and to put us on a sound structural footing going forward. It is a test that we will wait and see whether he can pass.",113
179,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This government carved out a sorry place in Australian political history last night, for in just 18 months this government has caused the biggest budget turnaroundfrom surplus to deficit-in living memory and it has run up the largest public net debt since World War II. That is the legacy of this government. With apologies to Winston Churchill: never in the field of Australian government finances has so much been squandered so quickly for so little benefit. The Rudd government has outspent all that have gone before, with government spending now 29 per cent of GDP. It is the biggest spending government in over 50 years, with debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. For years the labour movement has been searching for a way to rewrite the disastrous and chaotic history of the Whitlam years. With the handing down of this budget last night the Rudd government has achieved what others have failed to do: it has made the Whitlam government now look fiscally responsible by comparison. The Treasurer was so ashamed of the government's mishandling of the country's fitest nances last night that he could not even say in the budget speech the phrase ‘a $58 billion deficit'. That is the first line he should have told the Australian people about last night. He could not bring himself to level with the Australian people and say ‘$188 billion of net debt', and he did not dare get caught on camera saying that there will be one million Australians unemployed under the Rudd government. The last time there were a million people unemployed in this country was under the Keating government. So now we have Whitlam, Keating, Rudd. Yes, this was a true Labor budget all right. Debt, deficit, recession: that is a Labor budget. The Treasurer knows that Labor have blown it. The Rudd Labor government inherited the best set of accounts of any incoming federal government in Australia's history. There was no government debt. There was money in the bank. We had savings and surpluses. We were living within our means. The Rudd government must have thought that it had hit the jackpot. It started spending. In the true Labor tradition, it spent all the taxpayers' money that had been saved away in government coffers. It spent all of that then started borrowing. It could not get enough borrowing onshore so it started borrowing offshore. But it kept on spending. The Rudd government has announced the equivalent of $220 million a day in additional spending. That is $220 million in additional spending initiatives every day since it came to office-$124 billion in additional new spending announcements in 18 months. This is a government that knew revenues were decreasing but went on a spending spree like there was no tomorrow. Of the $188 billion in net debt, $124 billion is as a result of the profligate spending of the Rudd Labor government. They remind you of Arthur, the black sheep playboy son of the billionaire. He squandered his entire inheritance, unable to control the spending. When this government ran out of money, it started borrowing uncontrollably. Gross debt is likely to top $300 billion. You did not hear the Treasurer admit that to the Australian people in his budget speech last night. This government has lost control of the nation's finances. No wonder the Queensland Media Club is pleading for people to attend the Treasurer's post-budget lunch next week; people just do not believe this budget. The government's so-called deficit exit strategy is as believable as a fairytale. Having run up the largest debt in Australian history with additional spending of $220 million per day, the government now wants Australians to believe it is going to return the budget to surplus, but it makes the following assumptions: first, that no government will undertake any new spending until 2017. That is what it wants us to believe. Another assumption is that there will be an unprecedented run of growth at 4.5 per cent for at least two years, and then there is a projection of above-trend growth for another four consecutive years. Colleagues, they are asking the Australian people to believe that there will be six consecutive years of growth at 4½ per cent. There have only been two periods in the last 50 or 60 years when growth of 4½ per cent has been maintained, and that has only ever been for two years at a time. This is simply unbelievable. This assumption flies in the face of forecasts from the IMF, the Reserve Bank and most respected Australian economists. The government have been selectively quoting, but it is interesting that they have not quoted from the rating agency Moody's. What Moody's said is: We do recognise the trend in deficit and debt is unfavourable and represents a weakening of the government's financial strength. Moody's went on to say-and I ask members of the government to listen to this: If deficits were to extend beyond the period Swan has projectedand of course they are, based on those wild assumptionswe would have to begin thinking about the manageability of the whole situation. That means the credit rating would be under question. So the government is saying, ‘There's no problem with the credit rating,' but that is based on these unbelievable assumptions of no new spending until 2017 and six consecutive years of growth, which we have never seen in the last 60 years. Make no mistake: this budget is a political document. The growth forecast has been adopted by the government to create a fantasy that it has a plan to restore the nation's finances. These assumptions are not credible and the government must release all of the Treasury advice and all of the options presented to the government. We know how the government chooses to portray Treasury advice. We know how the government shamelessly spins the advice it is given. Take the Prime Minister's bald-faced assertion that Treasury advised the government last year that the first cash splash of $10 billion would create 75,000 new jobs. When they were forced to reveal the actual Treasury advice through freedom of information, we found out that Treasury in fact provided a general formula linking employment and economic growth, with numerous optimistic assumptions about how much of the cash splash would be spent and how much would be saved. It was heavily qualified, yet the Prime Minister came out and said that Treasury advised that the $10 billion cash splash would create 75,000 new jobs. He knew that that is not what Treasury said. He knew it would not happen, it has not happened and it was never going to happen. So this government must take responsibility for the political decisions it has taken in framing the budget. The public deserves to know why the government has suddenly changed the way it predicts economic growth. Just as the government moved the goalposts last November in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook with regard to the assumptions on interest rates to suit the political purposes at time, it must also say why it has moved the goalposts this time on growth to suit its political purposes. It must stop hiding behind Treasury forecasts or projections and tell the Australian people that they are political decisions that frame this budget, and it must take responsibility for them. It is not the government that is going to pay off this debt and deficit. It is the young people of Australia, the young taxpayers of the future, who will be paying off this government debt for years to come. This government has no money of its own; it only spends what it takes from the people in taxes or what it borrows. The next generation will be paying. (Time expired)",116
180,Mr COMBET,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Charlton-Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change) (4.30 pm)There are two issues that I think are evident, listening to the opposition speakers on this matter of public importance debate. One is that it is apparent that the coalition does not understand that there is a global economic recession. It is almost as if the Australian economy is considered in complete isolation from what is happening internationally. The second issue that is evident from the contributions made from the opposition is that it has no plan and no idea how to address these circumstances-not one constructive idea to contribute to these difficult economic times. The fact of the matter is that this country faces the worse economic recession internationally since the Great Depression, and I think it is useful to contribute to the debate some of the figures that evidence that case, because they do not appear to have been considered by the opposition. In 2009 the budget has indicated negative growth in this country of 0.5 per cent, but for our major trading partners the recession will have the impact in 2009 of causing a two per cent contraction. In all the advanced economies the contraction is as great as 3.75 per cent. In the G7 economies, the economic that recession internationally is causing a contraction to the tune of four per cent. In Japan the figure is a terribly alarming six per cent. That is the international environment in which the government had to frame last night's budget announced by the Treasurer. We have experienced the worse fall in revenue since the early 1930s: $210 billion over the forward estimates. That contraction in revenue is the impact of the global economic recession on the framing of the budget, but none of the international economic circumstances seem to be considered in the analysis that the coalition has brought to bear-if you can elevate it to that terminology. The terms of trade have deteriorated significantly. Commodity prices have fallen extremely significantly, in many areas by as much as 50 and 60 per cent. Almost all of the major economies are in recession. This government is determined to make the hard decisions to confront this challenge. It has made decisions to formulate the budget by building the nation; to invest now to support jobs and to support the future economic foundation of this country; to shield Australian working families to the best extent the government possibly can from the harsh impact of this recession; importantly, given the terrible impact that unemployment has in our society, to fight unemployment and build for the future; to stimulate economic activity; and to take the hard decisions to bring about savings over the forward estimates. If you look at some of the key budget measures, they underpin the decisions that the government has taken or are clear evidence of them-and the coalition will need to consider its position on these measures as we head towards the parliamentary processes in this place and in the Senate for the passage of the appropriation bills necessary to implement them. Key measures are a $22 billion investment in building the nation's infrastructure, which includes $3.4 billion for roads, $4.6 billion investment in metro rail and $389 million for ports and freight infrastructure; a $4.5 billion commitment in the Clean Energy Initiative, which includes $1 billion of existing funds; a $2.6 billion investment in projects focused on universities and research from the Education Investment Fund, with a consequence that in the university sector 50,000 additional places for students will be created by that investment; $3.2 billion in projects focused on hospitals and health infrastructure from the Health and Hospitals Fund; and partnering with the private sector to build the National Broadband Network. In addition to those measures in infrastructure investment, the government has committed an additional $20 billion to rebuild our hospitals, extended the first home owners boost, provided an improved tax break for small businesses, increased the pension and built on the education revolution with a $5.7 billion investment over four years, as well as a host of other measures including the implementation of a paid parental leave scheme. These are enormously significant measures-decisions taken by the government in active consideration of the economic circumstances internationally and how they impact on our economy. What this is telling you is that this government is prepared to face the challenges and take the difficult decisions, not hide from them. And without this action, the contraction in our own economy undoubtedly would be far worse and unemployment would be higher. Now, is the coalition up to that challenge? We have heard nothing from the coalition to suggest that there is any plan to deal with the global recession. It is all political opportunism. The Labor government must have created the international recession! That is what you could conclude from the contributions of those opposite. There is no plan to support working families in this difficult period. There is no plan to address rising unemployment. It is a classic political opportunist strategy: ‘Blame Labor for the lot.' Ignore the fact that we have got a global economic recession; blame the Labor government. Oppose and complain about stimulatory investment and infrastructure spending, complain about the deficit and the borrowing to underpin nation building and economic stimulus, but turn up at media opportunities, of course. As the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has indicated on a number of occasions, ‘It's okay to oppose all this, but you turn up at a media opportunity to announce local infrastructure projects.' When under pressure about how they would meet a $210 billion collapse in revenue, the coalition pretend they would not borrow to fund the deficit. When under pressure about not borrowing, they try to avoid saying what services they would cut or what taxes they might put up. But you cannot have it both ways. If the coalition will not support nation building and economic stimulus to meet the global economic circumstances and their impact on our economy and if the Liberals will not support jobs and investment in the future of our country then they are ting that, under them, unemployment would be higher and the economy would contract further and be deeper in recession. That is the simple fact of the matter. You do not need to know too much about economics to work that out. And, if the coalition do not like of that analysis, the alternative conclusion could be that they too would be running a deficit and borrowing to fund it. The only other conclusion you could draw is that they would be making massive cuts. We heard today that the shadow Treasurer has forecast that the coalition would have a deficit reduced to the amount of approximately $25 billion; I think that was the contribution made. Tomorrow night, in the budget reply, it will be incumbent upon the Leader of the Opposition to declare to this place and the Australian people how that would be achieved. The shadow Treasurer has determined what the budget deficit would be under a coalition government. How would they fund it? What taxes would go up? Mr Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, has indicated that revenue would be higher under the coalition. What taxes would be going up? He has also indicated that expenditure would be lower. What savings would be made? What would be cut? What measures would they take? The fact of the matter is that I doubt we will hear anything too specific. The government has made hard decisions to meet the worse economic circumstances since the Great Depression, and there is clear evidence that the government strategy is working and will continue to work. The Treasurer has articulated a strategy to exit the temporary deficit situation by 2015-16. The Treasury has published the detail of the assumptions which underpin that plan. The government has set out a strategy for stimulating the economy, building the nation, supporting jobs and investing in the economic foundations of this country, and the coalition admit- should support it.

181,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we have seen in this matter of public importance debate and over the last 20 hours or so since the budget was brought down is the essential problem with this Rudd any Labor government: their problem with the truth. We saw scripted performances and the stretching of the English languageeverything possible to mislead or conceal the truth from the Australian people. When the Rudd government was first elected, we heard a lot about working families. Before that, before the election of the Prime Minister, we used to hear a lot about how the buck stopped with him-not a phrase you hear very often anymore. All of those opposite know that because they get the script from the Prime Minister's office. They must get cookies or Caramello Koalas for every time they say the word ‘decisive'; we hear them all saying it. We used to have a Prime Minister who said the buck stopped with him. We also used to hear another phrase more often than we do today: ‘working families'. We do not hear that as often today, as working famithis: lies become redundancy families. Exactly a year ago today, the first Rudd budget was brought down, and it is interesting to have a look at the language of that budget speech compared with the language absent from last night's budget speech. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out the astounding omission of the budget deficit figure from the budget speech last night. In over 30 minutes and around 3,000 words, the Treasurer did not mention the budget deficit figure. He thinks that, if he does not mention the figure, the Australian people will not know. It was interesting that last night he mentioned working families once in the speech. Last year, he mentioned working families 13 times-he even had ‘working families' as a heading in last year's speech-but last night just once. We have seen the ridiculous language of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in recent days about ‘temporary deficits'. These are temporary deficits that will last for six years if nothing goes wrong and everything they say is right, when almost everything they have said since the last budget has been wrong. ‘Temporary' for six years-let us think about that for a second. We should be glad that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan do not run a garage. When you put your car in for a service, you would get a temporary car, which you would normally expect to have for a day. Imagine turning up every afternoon for six years to get your car back, with the Prime Minister and his sidekick the Treasurer coming out with another excusethe excuse factory. This misleading language, this omission, this inability to say the most basic, truthful statement to the Australian public is catching up with this government halfway through this parliament. On the Neil Mitchell program this morning, the interview started like Mitchell-Will you apologise to the Australian people for directly breaking the promises you made before the election? Rudd-Neil, I accept full responsibility for that and for not being able to fulfil some of those policy commitments. Mitchell-No, it's not that it's the promises broken. Rudd-No, policy commitments. Mitchell-Promises broken, Prime Minister. Rudd-Policy commitments that we haven't fulfilled. (Time expired)",120
182,Ms REA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Once again I rise to contribute to an MPI put forward by the opposition that is flabbergasting in its audacity and hypocrisy. Many times in this House and in the media they have accused the Labor government of reckless spending, yet they were the government that presided over the biggest cash splash in our history. It lasted for about 12 years. It was not a cash splash designed to stimulate our economy. It was not a cash splash designed to support our retail sector and employment. It was not a cash splash to deal with unique economic circumstances. It was a cash splash designed to prop up their marginal seats. It was a pork-barrelling cash splash. So to have them coming in here and talking about government spending leaves me speechless. It is also amazing that they talk about government spending and that they were able to do this because they were such good controllers of finances. They managed to completely waste the incredible resources that we received from the most significant resources and mining boom that we have seen in this country and they sold off some of our most significant assets-the family silver. That is how they managed to keep a surplus and throw their cash around willy-nilly, and they did it to support marginal seats. It is incredible to hear the former governof ment, which had such reckless policies, come in here and not acknowledge the significance of the very carefully targeted spending program of this government. It is also incredible that for 30 minutes the opposition have been speaking about the Australian economy and not once have they mentioned the global recession. Not once have they even acknowledged that we are in the most significant global financial crisis since the Great Depression-and they pretend to believe that they are the alternative government in this country. It is an indictment of their role as parliamentarians and of their commitment to steering our economy and our community out of these very troubling and, indeed, very difficult times. This government has kept control of the finances and it has done it in a very responsible way. It has done it by supporting jobs, by investing in infrastructure and by ensuring that we do have community assets through projects out there that get people working on assets that we will have in this nation for the long term. Not once did they do that. Not once when they had incredible revenues did they invest in infrastructure or support our local communities. In this budget we have acknowledged that we have to face difficult economic circumstances and that we have to take them head-on. We acknowledge that it means going into debt and the budget being in deficit. But let us just get this one into perspective. Let us have a look at the situation around the world. Currently our net debt as a percentage of GDP is 4.6 per cent, and certainly no debt would be much better. But what is the situation in the United States? It is 61.7 per cent of GDP. In the UK it is 56.8 per cent of GDP, and in Japan, a nation that has such a long history of economic productivity and manufacturing, it is 103.6 per cent GDP. So I know that the Australian people will be much cleverer at understanding the crisis and putting our economy in perspective when they look at those figures. Basically, to me there is a choice-and it is a bit like buying a house or choosing somewhere to live. You accept the coalition's argument that you just simply pay dead rent because even if they were in government they would be in debt. What we are doing is taking the decision to responsibly invest in a mortgage, buy an asset and pay it off, because that will be there for the long term. (Time expired)",121

186,Mr CIOBO,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"The former member for Brand and former Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley once remarked of the Australian Labor Party that they were not a small business party and they never pretended to be. And yet, we see a subtle change has moved across the benches of the government, because they are still not a small business party but the key difference is that they now pretend to be a small business party. When we look at the announcements that were made in last night's budget, and in particular the bill that is before the House today, the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009, we see the Australian Labor Party doing their best to pretend that they have the interests of Australia's 2.4 million small businesses at heart. We on this side of the House have a rich depth of people who have been involved in small business-in running their own small businesses and in working in small business. That stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party, which simply does not understand small business, because, quite frankly, the closest the majority of the Australian Labor Party have got to small business is when they set foot inside one to buy a cup of coffee. That is the experience of the Australian Labor Party, which unashamedly is the political wing of the trade union movement. The announcement made in last night's budget was in effect a snowballing of an announcement initially made in December last year. On 12 December last year we had the first incarnation of the bill that is currently before the House. It was to provide a 10 per cent investment allowance for business. This morphed on 3 February 2009 into its second iteration, which provided a 30 per cent investment allowance for all businesses. Then last night the third incarnation was presented to the parliament: a 50 per cent investment allowance for small businesses. If we follow this same trajectory forward we can probably expect that by Christmas time, as this measure still fails to work, there will be something like a 125 per cent investment allowance for small business. The Labor Party has a problem: the Labor Party does not understand small business but it is desperate to be seen to be doing something for small business. We know that Labor Party policy is going to make it very hard for small business owners and operators to continue to operate. We know that, under the Australian Labor Party, occupational health and safety compliance costs are skyrocketing. We know that, under the Australian Labor Party's industrial relations reforms, the costs of the labour force are going to skyrocket. We know that, as a result of the Australian Labor Party's policy of so-called modern awards, the costs of employing staff are going to skyrocket. The restaurant and catering industry, perhaps one of the most densely concentrated groups of small businesses in this country, have outlined that, thanks to Labor's policy changes, about 8,000 jobs will go in their industry. In the retail sector we see that, thanks to Labor's policy changes, the retailers are expecting a 15 to 20 per cent increase in business operatple.' ing costs. The Pharmacy Guild is predicting about a 30 per cent increase in business operating costs thanks to Labor's changes. We know the Newsagents Federation has said that they are predicting somewhere between a 50 and 70 per cent increase in operating costs thanks to Labor's changes. That is what this government is doing to small business at the very worse possible time. It is the worse possible time because small businesses are under cash flow stress-sales are down and, thanks to Labor, business operating costs are up. Small business owners are doing it tough. But do you know what many are doing? Fundamentally, they are good people. They are good Australians and in most instances those small business men and women who employ the 3.8 million Australians who work in the small business sector are putting themselves second to the interests of their employees. That is the small-business culture that I have the opportunity and privilege of gaining insight into every day in my role as shadow minister for small business, independent contractors, tourism and the arts. Small business owners are putting themselves second in order to keep people employed, because they know that, as owners of small businesses, as employers, they have a responsibility to their employees to keep them on, help them to pay their mortgage and help them as much as possible to keep food on the table. I applaud that tenacity, I applaud that compassion and I applaud that understanding that small business owners have. That is why I get so irate when I hear the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, who is meant to be the advocate for small business in this place and outside it, make comments like, ‘The reason we need a fair dismissal code is that one day a small business owner might go into his business in a bad mood and fire good peoThat is the remark that the minister for small business in this Labor Party government made about those men and women across the country who own and operate small businesses, those 2.4 million small businesses that employ about 3.4 million Australians. That is the kind of casual disregard and the kind of ignorant understanding that the Labor Party have towards small business in this country. I have outlined some ways that the government's policy should reflect real initiatives to help small business in this country, and the coalition have done that on a number of occasions. Prior to Christmas we announced changes and reforms, albeit temporary, to the PAYG instalments system that we believed would assist small business. In addition to that we recently announced a detailed six-point small business action plan. It was launched by the Leader of the Opposition and me to reinforce to those small business men and small business women how vitally important they are to Australia's pathway to renewal and to economic recovery. Not one of those initiatives has been picked up by this government. Actually, I will correct myself. There was one initiative that was picked up by this government and amended. That was to do with the changes to the PAYG instalments payments. But the only other initiative that the Labor Party have come up with in 18 months, aside from all those initiatives which are pushing up small business costs, has been the announcement-in December, again in February and again last night-in different iterations for a 50 per cent investment allowance for small business. Do not get me wrong; there are some small businesses that will benefit from Labor's announcement. It is not all bad news. I am not going to be typecast in any way as being someone recklessly opposed to Labor's initiatives, because this is not all bad news. There are some small businesses that will benefit as a result of this announcement. But the problem is that so much more could have been done to assist Australia's small businesses by the Labor government had they simply understood the needs of small business a little better. The fundamental issue that Labor just do not get is that, when times are tough, when sales are down and when costs are up, what just about every small business is facing is cash-flow stress. That means they are not sitting there on a bank vault full of money with the tills full of cash. Rather, small business owners are working the telephone and calling in those debts that need to be repaid promptly. They need the cash, they are under stress, the payments are slow to come in and they are not as much as they used to be. The outgoings have increased and, of course, they have got to pay wages. Cash-flow stress is the most fundamental feature of small business during these tough economic times. So what do the Labor Party propose as their panacea for small business? The Labor Party's proposal is for a 50 per cent tax investment allowance. So how does this actually work in practice? The Labor Party say, ‘Well, what we're going to do to stimulate the small business sector is we're going to say to them, “Go out and buy small plant and equipment worth more than a thousand dollars and you'll get 50 per cent back upfront”.' As I said, there is some merit in that idea, but the fundamental problem is that if you are not sitting on cash, if you do not have access to credit and if you do not have a bank vault full of money then this kind of incentive is worthless. Unlike this government's approach to finance, most small business owners do not just go out and get what they want now and think to hell with how they are going to pay for it. They actually take disciplined, financially responsible decisions. They will look at plant and equipment that they would like to purchase and say, ‘I can't afford it right now.' I know that is a jarring realisation for the Australian Labor Party-the government that are putting us $188 billion in debt, the government that are driving up our deficit to a record $58 billion this year alone. I know that that is something that the government cannot comprehend, but let me inform the government that every small business owner out there knows this fundamental fact: if you cannot afford it, you do not buy it. A tax investment allowance of 50 per cent, as generous as it is, is useless if you do not have access to credit or are unwilling to use credit and you are not sitting on cash. That is why coalition representatives pleaded with the government and asked them to please look at what we had said in our six-point small business action plan and to do something to assist small business with cash flow. We outlined a series of proposals that we thought would be very good. These included, as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, a number of key commitments. I will run through them quickly. As an alternative to Labor's $42 billion cash splash, the coalition proposed that a more effective approach to support small businesses would be to reimburse a portion of the superannuation guarantee contribution for small businesses. We thought in the first year it should be three per cent of the nine per cent paid by small business. This would achieve two outcomes. The first would be to ensure that the costs of employing staff are reduced. We would make it cheaper to keep people on the books. That is something that is important when this government's forecasts are for there to be one million people unemployed. The second thing it would do is help small business with cash flow. Because they would no longer be required to make those payments to the ATO and the superannuation accounts, they could keep three per cent extra in their business to help them with cash flow. That would be a far wiser thing to do. A second thing that we outlined, a second initiative of the coalition, was a cash loss tax loss carryback. Again, this focused on bolstering the cash position of firms that have a solid operating history but are facing large operating losses in 2009 and/or 2010. The coalition recommended introducing a two-year window for businesses to offset the tax value of any losses they suffered in 2009 and/or 2010 against up to $100,000 of taxes that the businesses had paid over the previous three years, enabling those taxes to be refunded back to the small businesses. Let me explain for union members opposite what that would mean. Those firms would be able to offset their operating losses and retain staff by claiming back the taxes they had previously paid. The measure would only apply for businesses with at least one employee in each year a refund claim was made and in each year the tax was previously paid-again, an incentive to keep people on the books. The carryback would be governed by the same rules that currently apply when companies carry forward tax losses to reduce their liabilities in future years. Since the carryback refunds would over time be offset by lower losses that were carried forward, the long-run budgetary cost of this measure would largely arise from the changed timing of receipts and in fact would basically be nil. This is a measure that many First World countries are already instituting. Similar treatment of current losses to reclaim past tax payments is available to firms in the UK, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United States, where the Obama administration recently extended the carryback period from two to five years. However, again the Australian Labor Party has stubbornly refused to adopt this proposal. But it has not refused to adopt it because it would cost money-we know that the impact on the budget would be next to nil. It has refused to do it because it was a coalition initiative. and That is the reason this arrogant Labor government, which does not understand small business, has not instituted this reform that would make a meaningful difference to the cash-flow positions of small businesses today and help keep Australians employed. I would dearly love to hear from members opposite why they will not adopt the tax loss carryback initiative that the coalition outlined. There is no budgetary reason not to; there is just the simple pride of a Labor government that refuses to acknowledge it is getting it so very wrong. Another key aspect of our policy, because we are so often asked what the coalition would do, is to reduce the overall regulatory compliance burden on small business. We know the economic costs of meeting regulatory requirements are onerous for business owners. Time is money and currently time is spent and lost filling in forms and filing taxes. We recommended applying a comprehensive quantification to the full range of Commonwealth, state and local government filings that are required to start or expand a business. This regulatory burden needs to be reduced to at least match, and over the future years improve on, OECD best practice. Another aspect is to cut red tape. We outlined our proposal to deliver a one-stop business regulatory portal for small businesses which would provide integrated online access to all forms and filings regardless of which tier of government was imposing them, forcing local governments and state governments to work with the federal government to make sure that there is only one place that businesses need to go for their regulatory requirements. Cutting red tape and bringing these functions together requires substantial cooperation and does heavily depend on the accelerated replacement of traditional reporting methods with internet based alternatives, something that surely the Labor Party would be supportive of given their grand scheme for the National Broadband Network of some $43 billion. To make this one-stop shop for compliance and regulatory filings a reality, the coalition will ate a small business service delivery agency expressly charged with delivering integrated online access. Another key part of the initiative was the family business support. We identified that the new small business service delivery agency should also operate a program that could provide support and advice for family businesses on succession planning and family business professionalisation, working closely with a key advocacy group in the sector. This is not a large resource outlay, but it does represent an appropriate response to what is a vital issue for Australia's small businesses-so many of which, of course, are small family businesses. Of course, all of these initiatives have come about because the coalition, unlike the Australian Labor Party, has given small business a seat at the table where it matters. The shadow cabinet appropriately recognises small business's importance to the national economy. Unlike the minister for small business in the Rudd Labor government, who is sidelined in the outer ministry-and, we know, whom the Treasurer despises-as shadow minister for the coalition I sit at the shadow cabinet table because we believe, front and centre, that small business policy must be at the epicentre of decision making for the coalition. This six-point small business action plan is focused on supporting small business to help them manage their cash flow and keep staff on the books. There have been some very direct criticisms of this Labor bill. Indeed, there are many examples of businesses that might have participated but are excluded from doing so. That is one of the fundamental concerns that we have with the bill before the House. I encourage the government to run through the six-point plan that I outlined and use that information and those initiatives to crebolster support for small business. It is clear that the measures in the bill will not do enough for the small business sector, not only because it is already under cash-flow stress but also because a raft of problems with the legislation as it stands have been outlined. A number of groups have come to speak with me over past months in relation to this bill and its various previous iterations. The Australian Information Industry Association, Australia's peak technology industry body, has indicated that the exclusion of software and related services from the investment allowance effectively nullifies the potential productivity upside impact of the tax break. This is a government that says so much about productivity. This is a government that says that, wherever possible, we should be providing incentive to boost Australia's productivity. Yet in this very bill, when the government has an opportunity to provide an extension of this allowance to incorporate expenditure on things like software-which, of course, is a productivity boost-it does not take it. Again, the Labor Party is very quick to say one thing but very different when it comes to the follow-through. The AIIA believes that the exclusion from the operation of this bill decreases the attracing tiveness of this allowance to business taxpayers. In addition, it also fails to act as a stimulus for the Australian ICT software sector, which is increasingly being impacted by a slowdown in business procurement. In addition, the association has indicated that computer systems, which are eligible assets, are frequently purchased with software embedded in them. The administrative burden associated with separating the cost of those tangible and intangible assets in such a purchase will involve additional red tape for small businesses intending to use the allowance. I would say to the minister: ‘Please, exercise some common sense. Recognise that under your proposal those Australian small ICT software suppliers are excluded.' A business that purchases equipment with a software program already installed is somehow meant to split the cost between the eligible cost of the plant equipment-that is, the computer-and the ineligible cost of the software. This is the kind of madness that we see from policy directions given by the Australian Labor Party. I also know that Irrigation Australia have raised their concern with a number of members on this side, and possibly even with the government, that the bill specifically excludes water efficient irrigation equipment. Irrigation Australia has noted that such exclusion will not assist the irrigation sector recover from the prolonged drought conditions across Australia. Notwithstanding this, the coalition accepts that this measure would be welcome by small businesses. Moreover, we know that some businesses have made capital purchases based upon this tax break and are relying upon it to help justify the cost of the investment. Again, I implore the Australian Labor Party: think about which assets are included and which are excluded, because at the moment there is a snub to the entire agricultural sector that would be lookat purchasing efficient water irrigation equipment in order to take advantage of the allowance as it currently stands. In looking at the bill in to to, where do we actually see Labor's approach to small business reflected? As I said, it has been an interesting journey. Originally announced on 12 December last year, re-announced on 3 February and then last night reiterated once again, the bill is finally before the parliament for debate on 13 May. And bear in mind that prior to last evening, this allowance, as it was previously announced on 3 February, would have completed on 30 June of this year. After 30 June, the announced additional incentive as of 3 February would no longer apply. The first opportunity that the parliament has had to debate this bill, to demonstrate its intentions with respect to this bill, is now on 13 May. So it is little wonder that so many small businesses started contacting the opposition and asking if this measure would go through. They knew that they needed to have some indication from the coalition as to whether the measure would be passed. But the key point is that the coalition has done the government a favour. I took the decision to assist the government not because I was that interested in assisting the government but because I wanted to assist those small businesses across Australia for whom this piece of legislation was an importo tant aspect in their expenditure considerations. They wanted to know whether the bill would be passed, but, despite the many sitting weeks between 3 February and 13 May, despite the many opportunities that the government had to introduce this legislation prior to now and to ensure that the debate was had, that it was taken to the Senate and a position determined, this government refused to do it. It is little wonder that small businesses were calling up and saying, ‘If the Labor Party can't control their legislative agenda, how can we expect them to control the Australian economy?' I agree, and that is why I took pity on this hapless minister for small business and indicated to the media that we would not frustrate the passage of this legislation. Because otherwise this so called tax effective investment allowance would have been completely ineffective because businesses would not have dealt with the uncertainty that existed as a result of this government dragging its heels on this initiative and not even getting it into parliament for debate until 13 May. Talk about a government that has lost control. So vital is this piece of legislation according to the minister-and the Prime Minister referred to it numerous times today-so crucial is it to the small-business sector of this country that the government could not even get it together to bring it into the parliament for debate ahead of 13 May. What an indictment on the priorities of the Australian Labor Party. No wonder small business has a question mark over it. In fact, the minister should come into the chamber and acknowledge and thank the coalition for making his job easier by indicating that we would not frustrate the passage of this legislation-notwithstanding the fact that the six-point proposal that the coalition outlined is vastly superior, in initiayou. tives and support for small business and their cash flow, to this legislation before the House today. Finally, based on the amendments that the Assistant Treasurer has circulated, we know the bill will provide a 50 per cent tax deduction for assets costing $1,000 or more for small business with revenue of $2 million or less. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, such an allowance has some merit-I acknowledge that it has some merit-and it will be welcomed by some small businesses. However, this bill-and I should note that it forms the pinnacle in the Holy Grail of the Australian Labor Party's approach to small business-does basically nothing for the vast majority of small businesses. You do not have to take my word for it because according to the March 2009 MYOB Australian Small Business Survey, and the minister referred to this number today in question time, only 30 per cent of small businesses intend to take advantage of this legislation. For 70 per cent of the 2.4 million small businesses that employ around 3.4 million Australians, this bill will mean nothing. The reason it will mean nothing to them is this. Going right back to where I started in this debate, when times are tough small business owners know you cannot buy what you cannot afford. That is the fundamental issue that they have and that I have with this piece of legislation. Fundamentally we will not frustrate its passage but we recognise this bill will do very little for those small businesses that are struggling out there. This bill will do nothing for the 70 per cent of small business who simply do not have access to cash or credit to buy new plant and equipment. I implore the government to not be arrogant about their policy approach to small business. The coalition understand that Labor just do not get small business. That is why we are doing our best to make it easy for That is why the coalition has outlined a six-point plan. I would encourage the Australian Labor Party to copy our six-point plan in exactly the same way that they copied our PAYG initiative. I would encourage the minister for small business, perhaps the only person on the Labor Party front bench who has had some involvement in small business-albeit a consultancy back to the government-and the Australian Labor Party to copy these initiatives.

187,Mr ZAPPIA,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009. Whilst I certainly do not want to waste the time. I have in this debate to respond to the member for Moncrieff I will make two points. One of them is that, prior to entering this House, for some 40 years leading up to that time, I operated a small business, and I have been associated with small business since leaving school. I would also say that, when it comes to pretenders as the friends of small business, the pretenders are the members of the coalition. I want to reflect on a comment that was made by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government earlier on when he was speaking about nation building. He made the comment that in the first 18 months of this government being in office we have spent more on infrastructure than the previous coalition government did in all of their 12 years. The same statement could apply when it comes to small business. The Rudd Labor government have in fact done more in their first 18 months in office to support small business than the previous coalition government did in 12 years. I can say that, as I was a small business operator for those 12 years and was directly affected by the policies of the Howard coalition government at the time. As someone who does understand what it is like to operate a small business, I certainly welcome the initiatives of the Rudd Labor government, including the one I am about to speak to. This bill provides a temporary bonus income tax deduction of originally 30 per cent of the cost of an asset if the asset is acquired between 13 December 2008 and 13 June 2009 and installed ready for use before the end of June 2010. As we heard last night, when the Treasurer was delivering the budget, that 30 per cent figure has now been increased to 50 per cent for those businesses that have a turnover of less than $2 million per annum, and the offer of 50 per cent has been extended until 31 December of this year. The bonus tax deduction is in addition to the normal depreciation deduction for assets for which capital allowance deduction is available under the core provisions of division 40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act or new expenditure on existing eligible assets. To qualify for the tax deduction a minimum expenditure of $1,000 must be made by a small business and a minimum expenditure of $10,000 must be made by all other businesses. For business assets acquired between 1 July 2009 and the end of December 2009 a bonus tax deduction of 10 per cent of the asset's cost will be provided if the asset is installed and ready for use by the end of December 2010 and it is a business with over $2 million turnover per annum. These are very sensible and very welcome measures for the Australian business sector during the current economic downturn. It was interesting to hear the member for Moncrieff on the one hand telling us how he had been lobbied and pestered effectively by small businesses that he talks to about whether this legislation is going to get through, and then on the other hand suggesting that it has limited value. You cannot have it both ways. Businesses would not be contacting you wanting to know whether you were going to support it if they did not think it was legislation that was going to be in their interest. Mr Ciobo interjecting",130
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,Order! The member for Moncrieff has had the opportunity of making his contribution. I would ask him to contain himself.,130
189,Mr ZAPPIA,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"This is good legislation because it provides businesses with a much needed cash boost that can be used to purchase new assets which in turn will add to business efficiency and productivity and thereby further stimulate the economy. It was only last Wednesday that this legislation being discussed at length by financial commentator Paul Clitheroe and leading talkback host Leon Byner on Adelaide radio station FIVEaa. They were speaking of the benefits of this legislation to the business community generally with the only proviso that they not know whether or not the opposition was going to support it. Australia's 1.9 million small businesses employ almost four million people and their ongoing viability will be crucial to Australia's economic recovery and Australia's economic growth. The Rudd government understands the important role of small and medium businesses, and the provision of a bonus tax deduction for capital purchases adds to a number of other support measures for small and medium-sized businesses already committed to by the Rudd government. I want to go through some of those measures, which include reduced pay-as-you-go tax instalments in the year 2009-10 and $46 million funding for some 36 business enterprise centres around Australia. Again, this is something the previous government never ever did. It the first time ever that a federal government has supported small business through investing in BECs around the country. There is an on-time payment guarantee that commenced in December 2008, which means that small businesses that contract with government departments will be paid within 30 days or penalty interest may be charged by the small business-and we know how many small businesses are dependent on government contracts. I heard the member for Moncrieff talking about how red tape should be cut by targeting 27 areas of state and federal regulations affecting businesses. Again I ask the question: why didn't you do it in the 12 years your party was in office instead of talking about it now? Instead of giving lip service, you should have actually acted. I go on with was some of the measures introduced by the Rudd government: a simpler superannuation payment system for small businesses and the rollout of a national high-speed broadband network across Australia-and I welcome the $43 billion recent announcement by the did government in respect of that. I digress on that topic. The member for Moncrieff went on to talk about software. Where was his and his party's concern about software, broadband and computers when they were in office? I can tell him that, when I was Mayor of the City of Salisbury, we had to look for our own investment and go into partnership with a private company in order to provide the broadband services that small businesses in that community needed but could not get access to, thanks to the federal government's inaction on that very issue. I add to that list the announcement by Senator Kim Carr on 7 May 2009 that Enterprise Connect, a $271 million network of manufacturing and innovation centres designed to help firms become stronger by focusing on innovation, creativity and excelis lence, will join with up to 19 organisations, private and government, with substantial business experience to deliver 180 workshops across Australia. I welcome that because it is an attempt to reach out to those small businesses and give them the kind of assistance that in many cases they need. The workshops will be held at no cost to participants and will focus on topics such as managing cash flow and how to better generate sales. There was further support for small and medium businesses announced in last night's budget. There were measures such as, as I said earlier, the increase in the tax deduction from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for businesses with turnovers of less than $2 million who acquire assets before the end of December 2009; new research and development tax credits of 45 per cent available in 2010-11 for companies with turnovers of less than $20 million and a doubling of the research and development expenditure threshold from $1 million to $2 million for the years 200910; additional support services for small business, with $10 million for the Small Business Online Program and another $10 million for the Small Business Support Line, which will provide initial over-the-phone advice and put small businesses in touch with specialist advisers on matters such as cash-flow management, obtaining finance, marketing and personal counselling and support; an increase in funding for current programs such as the Export Market Development Grants Scheme; further cash-flow relief via the previously announced pay-as-you-go instalment adjustment; and $196 million for the new Commonwealth Commercialisation Institute to give small and medium-sized businesses the power to turn great ideas into reality. We have not even come to the $4.5 billion relating to the Clean Energy Initiative, which undoubtedly will be a huge boost to so many small businesses out there. Of course, the most significant boost to small and medium businesses came through the Rudd government's economic stimulus strategies: the investment of $14.7 billion in upgrading or building new facilities at every school; the construction of 20,000 new public and defence homes; an increase in the first home owners grant to $21,000 for newly constructed homes; almost $4 billion to insulate 2.9 million homes around Australia; and $800 million for 3,000 community infrastructure projects across Australia, such as town halls, parks, playgrounds and sports facilities. They are all investments that will ultimately provide support to small business. It will be small businesses that will get a rect and immediate benefit as a result of those commitments. In fact, it will be small and medium-sized businesses every step of the way that will deliver those projects for Australia. That in turn means local jobs, with benefits that flow through every sector of the community, from suppliers to tradespeople and through to the local lunch bar. How better can you support small business than to add expenditure in the very areas where they will get a direct benefit? I have had many discussions with school councils and local community groups about these commitments by the government. I have been incredibly impressed by the keenness of those local community groups to ensure that, when the work takes place, local people are contracted to carry out the work. They are as concerned as anyone else to ensure that their local people are the beneficiaries of these government commitments. On the specific issue of jobs, I understand that in some trades there is still a shortage of suitably skilled people. I want to talk about a conversation I recently had with a constituent. Graeme Parkin, one of my constituents in Makin, raised with me his concerns about finding suitably skilled tradespeople in the tiling industry and, more specifically, about the low number of apprenticeships within that industry. Tiling is not the most appealing vocation for a young person to pursue, but the real problem is that too few tradespeople are prepared to take on an apprentice tiler. As Graeme Parkin quite correctly points out, there needs to be a reassessment of the apprenticeship and training process relating to the tiling industry. The Rudd government is taking action to address these skills shortages with the delivery of 701,000 new training places over the next five years, the building of trade training centres in our schools and the $145 million for securing apprenticeship initiatives which support out-of-trade apdiprentices and trainees to remain connected to the workforce and maintain their investment in training. I said earlier that small and medium businesses will be critical in Australia's economic recovery and growing our nation. Small and medium business operators are accustomed to doing it tough-working long hours, taking risks and surviving downturns in business-so, in these tough economic times, it will be the resilience and the preneurship of the small and medium business sector that will be critical to our economic revival. I want to talk about a specific business. I was recently asked to speak at a launch at a business known as SA Motorcycles. The launch was for a new motorcycle, the Kawasaki ZX6R. This is a business that was established just over 10 years ago by a young person who had an interest in motorcycles and, along with a few friends who also had an interest in motorcycles, he put together a team of people who understood that particular sector. Today that business employs about 15 people, and it is still growing. The last two of those people were employed in recent weeks. More importantly, it has become the No. 1 Kawasaki dealer in South Australia. Evan Byles, the director of this company, deserves an incredible amount of credit. But he also deserves credit for being someone who is prepared to do all of those things I mentioned earlier-working long hours, taking risks-and he was quite proud to show me the amount of background work he had undertaken with his wife in the lead-up to getting that business up and going. It is a credit to him, and there are so many other small business operators just like Evan who are doing exactly the same thing and are prepared to work through the tough times and work the long hours that it takes to ensure that a business remains viable. For them, the tax deduction that is provided will give them the ability to invest in new assets, thereby reducing ongoing overheads and improving business efficiency while simultaneously creating flow-on benefits to those from whom those assets are bought. This legislation is good for business, good for the economy and good for jobs-just as the direct payments to Australian people in the Rudd government's economic stimulus entrepackage were. Those payments undoubtedly contributed significantly to the strong retail figures that we have seen over recent months. We have heard how the retail sector in this country employs some 1.5 million people. In my own state of South Australia, it employs 117,000. In my own region, it employs about 25,000. It is probably the single biggest industry sector employer in the region that I represent. I care about the people in the retail industry sector, and I care about the fact that they too, the retailers, are under pressure as a result of the economic downturn. But, thanks to the economic stimulus package, we have seen remarkably strong growth in the retail sector when contrasted with comparable overseas countries, and the situation is even more remarkable when compared with the previous month's figures prior to the economic downturn. That growth in retail spending has undoubtedly ensured that the jobs of those 25,000 people in my region who are employed in the retail sector have been secured. If it were not for that growth, I am sure that things would be much worse for them. It may well be the case that no-one can quantify with absolute certainty just how many jobs will be created or saved. However, there is no question in my mind whatsoever that that growth has contributed to employment certainty for those people-and their jobs are just as important as anybody else's. Let us look at some of the retail figures. Between November 2008 and March of this year, Australia has seen a 4.5 per cent increase in retail trade. This is compared to a 3.1 per cent fall in Japan, a 2.5 per cent fall in the US and a 2.2 per cent fall in Germany over the same period. The Rudd government's economic stimulus strategy is having the right effect, and the figures prove that. That strategy was the right thing to do for the nation, the right thing to do for the 1.5 million people employed in the retail sector and the right thing to do for the tens of thousands of small businesses in the retail sector. The opposition's attack on the government's direct payments to families is misguided. To claim, as the opposition has continually done, that the stimulus package has not worked not only is contradicted by the retail figures that I have just referred to but also demonstrates just how out of touch opposition members are with their communities, how little they understand local economies and how little they care about the 1.5 million people employed in Australia's retail sector. There is a similar story with respect this government's housing commitments. Total building approvals rose for the second consecutive month, in March, by 3.5 per cent and the increase in house approvals of 3.4 per cent is the highest monthly rise since March 2007. The National Australia Bank's April business survey, released yesterday, showed an improvement in business conditions and an increase in business confidence described by NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster as ‘the most encouraging set of numbers for some time'. What could you put that down to other than the government's stimulus package? It is small businesses in both the construction and retail sectors that will the prime beneficiaries of the Rudd government's housing stimulus package. There is a fundamental difference between small and medium-sized business and big business. Small and medium-sized businesses are primarily owned and operated by people who have invested their life and their future in their businesses. They have everything at stake in the success of the business and, unlike big business-where decisions are often made by highly paid executives who come and go, making decisions using investors' or shareholders' funds-owners of small and medium-sized businesses have a huge personal stake in the decisions they make. But they, too, are facing additional pressures because of the global recession. The Rudd government values the small business sector and, rather than just pay lip service to the sector, the government is providing real assistance with a broad range of policies that respond to key areas of concern raised by small and medium-sized businesses throughout Australia. The minister is listening to those concerns, and I am pleased that he attended a small-business function in my electorate only a month or so ago where the 120 small businesses that attended could speak directly to him. He listened to what to they had to say, and I did not hear one of them stand up and criticise the government for not doing enough. This is good legislation, and I commend it to the house.",130
190,Mr OAKESHOTT,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"I am already on the record as saying that, of all the measures contained in the stimulus response of around December last year, it is the 30 per cent small business tax break through to June of this year that I consider the best and most appropriate stimulus response of all. It was a pleasant surprise for me, and I can confirm for my small business community on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, to see it geared up another be level, up to 50 per cent through to December of this year. In light of that, of measures announced in the budget last night, and from what I have read and seen, I would consider this to be the best aspect of the budget last night, including as it does a stimulus response but also recognising the role to be played in the engine room of business in Australia, and that is the small business community. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, 95 per cent of the business community is small business. We are very much a ‘five employees or less' community. The businesses are family based. A lot of them are home based microbusinesses. Therefore, this is a nugget of gold from the federal government in directly assisting business activity and business growth in a difficult 12 to 18 months. My message for government while I am on my feet tonight is this. As I as a local member talk to business communitiesbusinesses that are connected to chambers of commerce and the various other business organisations, such as the BECs and the Australian business networks-I notice there are a lot of small businesses that for one reason or another still are not aware of this. Therefore, I hope that advisers in the boxes, government members and the executive can consider how this message can be got out to the small business community. In most cases they are head down and bum up doing the job of making a living and are not tuned in as clearly as we might like to think they are to messages that are coming out of this place. Selling this program is incredibly important, because it should be considered by every single small business. It should be deeply discussed with accountants. The fine detail and the future planning for potential capital purchases should be weighed up over the next seven months, because there will be no better offer from government. Probably the best budget one-liner last night was from a colleague upstairs, Senator Xenophon. He described it as the ‘Harvey Norman budget-the buy now and pay later budget'. This aspect of the budget has bargain basement, Crazy John elements to it. I say that in a positive, not a negative, way. We will see no better offer by government than a 50 per cent tax concession on capital purchases. Therefore, over the next seven months I would really encourage the small business community to look at this and to consider how it fits in with strategies within their businesses. If there are capital purchases to be made within the next couple of years-and I am sure there will be-why not make them in the next seven months while this offer is on the table? A substantial tax break has been put on the table by government. It is, in my view, the best aspect of the fiscal stimulus and the federal budget. I could not be hotter on this and I could not endorse it more. It fits in well with several programs that we are trying to get up and running on the mid-North Coast both with government and separate from government. I note the comments that have already been made about some of the small business aspects of last night's budget, such as the new support line and the online programs. I sincerely hope we see the delivery of the National Broadband Network both on time and to the home. To the extent that we are hearing it discussed, it will change the nature of small business in regional communities. In fact, it will change life in regional communities such as ours. In my community we are still reliant on dial-up. That might make people in this chamber laugh. We are not only reliant on dial-up but also frustrated by dropouts when we are trying to access what in a building such as this is considered a basic service. This is creating the haves and the have nots in the knowledge economy. The National Broadband Network and fibre to the home are absolutely crucial. Hopefully, over the next couple of years, we will see that not drop off the agenda but in fact be delivered in an even shorter time frame than proposed. I also note the doubling of the R&D tax credit in last night's budget. Among the small business community and former governments as well as the current government I would hope there was and is general consensus that the R&D tax credit program is excellent. It probably does not get the attention that it deserves within political circles. I noticed in my first eight months as a federal member the number of businesses that could and should apply but which are not aware of the programs offered and available from the government through AusIndustry, Enterprise Connect or other means. I was very pleased to see the Cutler review turned into a doubling of the R&D tax credit last night. Also, there were various aspects of the stimulus package for the local trades community through schools, home insulation, solar hot water or various other things. Those will and are making a difference on the ground. I would encourage government to stay committed to those programs through the next six to 12 months in particular. As well, regardless of the role of government, at the mid-North Coast level we are getting organised with the small business community. For the first time the mid-North Coast is participating in the Innovation Festival, which nationwide has been running since 2002. We are underway with the Innovation Festival in May. Hopefully that will engage small business in the creativity through to commercialisation aspects of their business that sometimes do not get the attention they deserve as people push hard just to make a living. Also, we now have up and running what I consider a very important step for our region-that is, a couple of education and skills forums within our local community. They are engaging councils, TAFE, the education sector generally and the business sector. The forums are just about getting everyone around the one table on a semiregular basis to try to sniff out the opportunities from government and other areas and seeing how we can improve our situation. Frankly, our situation on the mid-North Coast is not good. We have over 10 per cent unemployment, as of the last figures. That should not be lost on the government as we have make our way through a difficult 18 months. The mid-North Coast has pretty beaches and a lovely hinterland and there is the perception that we are the land of luxury, but we are one of the top 10 poverty areas in Australia. Unemployment floats between two and five per cent above the national averages. For youth unemployment, you can double that again and, for Indigenous unemployment, you can probably add another five per cent. Our income and education levels are some of the lowest in Australia. We have some significant structural disadvantage issues that we have to deal with if we are going to have equity of advantage and equity of services with the rest of Australia. Programs like this do talk to my region; they do talk to the mid-North Coast. They are incredibly important in addressing some of those fundamental structural issues that make life there somewhat different from life in other communities, such as this one that I have now started to visit. I sincerely hope that the government promotes this package to every small business operator in Australia. I sincerely hope that every small business operator does their bit and takes half an hour to read this, digest it, think about it and, if they can sniff out an opportunity, jump on the phone to the accountant and actually do it in the next seven months. This is a great window of opportunity for Australia at the most local level and at the small business level to kick some real goals. If we can do that, with the thinking that small business is the engine room of business and is the engine room of life in Australia, I think we will be no longer talking about recessions and sooner rather than later we will be talking about recovery, and strong recovery. I strongly support the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009.",134
191,Mr TURNOUR,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"Leichhardt) (5.54 pm)I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009. This legislation was announced as part of the Rudd government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This bill puts in place an important mechanism to provide immediate and short-term stimulus to the Australian economy and support for small business. It was great news last night that the 30 per cent tax break will be extended to 50 per cent for small business. Small businesses all across the country, including in my electorate of Leichhardt, are being impacted by the global recession. The Rudd government has had a stark choice: it could sit on its hands or it could act decisively to support small businesses to support jobs in the Australian economy. That is what we have done since the global financial crisis rolled out and impacted all across the developed world, creating a global recession. We moved quickly last year with our banking guarantee to restore confidence and ensure that we have confidence in the financial system. The banks are not often popular with small business, particularly at the moment-they would like to see them pass on some more of the interest rate cuts that have come through from the Reserve Bank-but the small and medium-sized businesses in my electorate understand how important the banking system is for a strong Australian economy and how important it is for them in their business operations. So supporting the financial system and producing confidence in that was the fundamental response that the Rudd government made. Similarly, we acted early and we acted decisively to support business by introducing some stimulus last year through bonuses and some other measures. This was to support jobs in the Australian economy. My electorate of Leichhardt has a lot of retail and pitality businesses. The area is strongly built on tourism. Those cash payments and bonuses, not only last year but also recently in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan that are flowing through now, are important to the retail and hospitality industries. Small businesses in my electorate have benefited directly from that stimulus. The government acted decisively. It supported the financial system and it is supporting activities within the economy through the stimulus measures last year and this year with the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. These have been important measures. Initially the opposition said they were supporting the stimulus measures, but then they sought to undermine them. The opposition's small business spokesman today spoke for 30 minutes on this legislation. It took us 27 minutes to work out whether he supported the legislation or was going to oppose the legislation. He took 27 minutes of his 30minute speech to say whether he supported it or opposed it. Small businesses in my electorate support this legislation. They are telling me that they are tired of the opposition opposing everything that the Rudd government puts forward to try to support them as they are dealing with these pretty tough economic times. I see the member for Blair, the member for Makin and other members here who also have businesses in their electorates that are struggling. Those businesses want the opposition to support the measures the government is taking, particularly measures like this one that is focused on small business. Many businesses in my electorate have said to me that they are really struggling finding the confidence to take up the 30 per cent tax break, and now we are going to see a 50 per cent tax break. They want to see this legislation go through the parliament before they hos- are prepared to make that investment. All they hear from the opposition is opposition for opposition's sake. The opposition is about opportunism. Businesses want this legislation to go through so they can have the confidence to make those investments. Businesses in Cairns are under a lot of pressure. Rio Tinto has had to cut 100 jobs in Weipa. That directly flows through to the Cairns economy. We saw in the tourist industry Qantas make cuts last year. There were a significant number of jobs lost in Cairns as a result of that. The federal government and the Minister for Tourism responded by putting in place a $4 million tourism support package. That has been welcomed. It has been invested in marketing to bring tourists back to Cairns. A recent report done as part of that package by Access Economics demonstrates that the Cairns region is the most vulnerable area around Australia as a result of the global financial crisis and as a result a downturn in the tourism industry. So we are hurting. The construction industry is a very important industry in my electorate. We have introduced measures in our stimulus package-70 per cent of our stimulus is infrastructure investment-to support the construction industry. But the construction industry has some difficult times ahead. Just last week it was reported that CMC, a major construction company in Cairns, were looking at potentially going into receivership and liquidation. They employ hundreds of people through their subcontractors and there is real concern in the Cairns community. But they are looking to government to act, not to sit on its hands as the opposition would have us do. And they are looking for the opposition to support the government in our measures to build confidence in the Australian community and in the Australian business community. There must be a concerted push from a range of angles to stimulate the economy. The government has carefully formulated and implemented a number of stimulus measures in recent months. Many of these have been centred on nation building or on investment in infrastructure. As I said, 70 per cent of our stimulus measure is investment in infrastructure. However, the small business and general business tax break is a critical element in this mix. The tax break was a big winner in last night's budget as well. The tax break was expanded-costing $141 million over the forward estimates-to build on the previously announced tax break, which now totals $3.7 billion of tax relief for small businesses and larger businesses. This is significant and it is also very well targeted. The expanded tax break will give small business an additional tax deduction when they acquire new assets or renovate an existof ing asset. Small business will now be able to claim a bonus tax deduction of 50 per centwhich is up from the 30 per cent that was announced in the February stimulus package-of the cost of eligible assets acquired between 13 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 and installed by 31 December 2010. An additional 50 per cent is a significant amount and, for example, should a business in Cairns-say, an engineering workshop-purchase a new welder that is valued at $12,000 and do this by the end of December this year, they can claim $6,000 thanks to the small business and general tax break. When lodging their tax return this engineering business would be able to claim this deduction in addition to the usual depreciation deductions in respect of the asset. It is clear that this will be a great benefit to businesses throughout Australia and in my electorate of Leichhardt. The small business and general business tax break is a major announcement for small business-that is, businesses that have turnovers of less than $2 million annually. But it is also important to note that larger businesses do not miss out under this measure. They can continue to access the tax break at the 30 per cent rate for eligible assets costing $10,000 or more that are contracted for between 13 December 2008 and 30 June 2009 and ready for use by 30 June 2010. They may also claim 10 per cent for eligible assets over $10,000 that they commit to invest in between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2009 and have ready for use by 31 December 2010. The tax break has been carefully developed. It specifically targets and it has been developed in consultation with industry associations, businesses and the accounting profession. I see that the Assistant Treasurer is here today. I congratulate him and the Treasurer on these measures and the work that they have done in bringing them forward. It is very important to note that second hand assets are not eligible under this bill. I have had some inquiries about that in my electorate. They are not eligible under this bill, nor have they been eligible under previous investment allowances. This bill is geared towards new investment that will upgrade and extend our economy's productive capacity as we are in the middle of a global recession. Clearly a recovery will not happen overnight. We need a clear long-term plan for the future, and new capital and new equipment are a fundamental part of gearing up for the future. We want to support small business in these difficult times to bring investments forwards and to make those investments that improve their productive capacity so that they can take advantage of the recovery. We are investing in long-term, nation-building infrastructure because we recognise that at this time we need to invest in the productive capacity of this nation, build infrastructurethe roads, the ports and the railway lines. That was a central part of our budget last night, in which we proposed a $22 billion further investment in nation building. In the same way that the government is investing at this time to build the productive capacity of our economy through investment in infrastructure, through support for skills and training in universities and TAFEs, and all the way through our schools with investment to support modernising our schools and early childhood education, this is a good time for small business to also make investments, and that is what this business break is about. Local small business representative organisations have supported this measure. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the following about the tax break: … the extension of the investment allowance to 50 per cent for small business until December 2009 is an excellent initiative, and a stimulus measure first proposed by ACCI and our members. So they supported it and thought it was an excellent initiative. The Chief Executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Andrew MCKellar, said: The Federal Government's Budget decision to increase and extend the investment tax break for small business provides a valuable incentive for new vehicle sales. The tax break will help stimulate the new vehicle market and support jobs in the industry. So they too support it. We have also got the Master Builders Association supporting it. The Master Builders Association also welcomes the increase in the small business investment tax allowance from the current level of 30 per cent to 50 per cent. So we have got the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the automotive industry and the master builders supporting this tax break. They understand how important this measure is for their members and they want to see this measure passed through the parliament as quickly as possible. I recently held a small business forum in Cairns. Over 80 local businesses attended to see how they could make the most of the government's $42 economic stimulus package. I am very committed to ensuring that businesses in Cairns have every opportunity to access and to take advantage of our $42 billion nation-building package. This business tax break at a 30 per cent level was a very popular item of conversation and there was quite a lot of follow-up in the media in relation to it. People want to take advantage of this investment. I understand from listening to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy in question time today that ACCI have done a survey showing that there are about 30 per cent or more people that are looking at taking advantage of this tax break. And that was at the 30 per cent rate. It has been increased to 50 per cent for small business, and no doubt larger sized businesses will also be taking advantage of it. So it is a welcome initiative by the small business and general business community. The Pressure Pumps NQ owner attended the business forum that I ran to keep Leichhardt working. Owner Derek Ross, who I met at the forum, has looked the global financial crisis in the eye and cast it aside. has taken the proactive approach. He is always looking for opportunities and is very positive about the future. He said that there were so many infrastructure projects in a number of government initiatives-just like the tax break-about at the moment that business can take real confidence and get a decent kick out of. So you have a fellow who is running a small business selling tools, compressors and other things to the construction industry, the other industry really taking benefit from this tax break and other measures and really supporting the work the Rudd government is doing to try and support business. A local medical firm in Cairns has similarly spoken to me about taking advantage of the tax break. They are introducing a new telephone system and computers, and putting in place an elevator to enable patients to better access their clinics. There is a range of different areas. PTS Traffic Management Services in Cairns have also moved on the tax break. They said, and I quote from a recent article in the Cairns Post: It's going to be a big saving and an enormous help. They have already purchased two new utes to improve their fleet and may add another two more before the end of June. They quote: Thirty per cent on $53,000 (for the new utes) is $15,900 and that's a big help. You have got medical industries, you have got small businesses selling tools, you have got people in the traffic management area all taking advantage of the tax break. They are going to go out and spend money in their local communities. I encourage people, when they are taking advantage of this, to spend money in their local communities and ensure He that we, wherever possible, buy Australian and buy locally. The car industry definitely needs support, and this announcement is no doubt welcomed by the automotive industry, as I have already quoted. I strongly support this measure. I say to the opposition: business want confidence to undertake this tax break, to utilise this tax break. They are only going to get that if this legislation is passed through the House and the Senate quickly. It is very important for business to have that confidence. Get out of the way, stop opposing, stop being opportunistic about the way that you approach our stimulus measures. Support these measures and business will welcome that. I really commend this measure to the House and again congratulate the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for the work they have done in bringing it forward.",137
192,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.10 pm)-I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009. This bill, of course, implements the small business and general business tax break, a key part of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan to help cushion Australians from the worse impacts of the global recession. As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech for this bill, this $3.7 billion tax break will help boost business investment, bolster economic activity and support Australian jobs. It is targeted towards encouraging Australian business investment in the face of the global recession. The response from business has been overwhelmingly positive. The honourable member for Leichhardt went through his experience. It has certainly been my experience and the experience of the Treasurer and of the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, as we travel around talking to businesses, that businesses are very keen indeed on taking up this proposal. I would like to foreshadow several amendments to the bill. Foremost amongst these amendments will be expanding the tax break to provide additional assistance to small business, as announced in last night's budget. I will also move several minor amendments of a technical nature. These will ensure that the legislation operates as intended. I recognise the support of the opposition. As the honourable member for Leichhardt said, it did take 27 minutes into the shadow minister's speech before he got to this particular piece of legislation, but he did indicate support. It was rather belated, because there has been some concern in the business community that the level of uncertainty about the passage of this bill was discouraging investment. Some small businesses were not prepared to make that investment until they were guaranteed opposition support so they would know it would pass both houses of the parliament. The shadow minister had previously indicated that they would not actively frustrate, but that was not enough for the business community. Understandably, given the opposition's opportunistic opposition to everything this government does, they wanted to see a very clear indication of support. That will no longer be an issue. I do, in fairness, acknowledge the opposition's assistance in having this passed through the House today. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",141
193,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS AND GENERAL BUSINESS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (6.13 pm)-I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. I ask leave of the House to move government amendments (1) to (4), as circulated, together. Leave granted.",141

(4) Schedule 1, item 4, page 8 (after line 30), after subsection 41-25(3), insert: (3A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) and subsection (2), treat yourself as having started to construct an asset at a time if you first incur expenditure in respect of the construction of the asset at that time. (3B) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), treat yourself as having started construction for an economic benefit at a time if you first incur expenditure in respect of the construction for the benefit at that time. There are three amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009. Amendment (2) provides a major boost for small businesses by increasing the bonus deduction to 50 per cent, as announced by the Treasurer last night. Small businesses will now be able to claim a bonus tax deduction of 50 per investment cent, up from 30 per cent previously, of the cost of eligible assets acquired between 13 condiDecember 2008 and 31 December 2009 and installed by 31 December 2010. I think most honourable members would acknowledge that small businesses are the backbone of the economy, employing millions of Australians, but many have faced some tough times during this global recession. The increased tax break provides small businesses with an even greater incentive to invest in new capital items such as computer hardware and business vehicles and to make capital improvements to existing machinery and equipment. The remaining amendments are technical in nature. In its current form, the bill precludes a taxpayer from claiming the 30 per cent deduction on a batch or set of eligible assets. A similar issue arises when an asset is jointly held by multiple taxpayers. This was not the intended outcome. Amendment (2) also ensures that taxpayers can claim a deduction at the rate intended. Amendment (1) ensures that taxpayers are not precluded from a tax break merely because they have a debt forgiven or replace an asset that was subject to an involuntary disposal, even if the cost of the asset is reduced to zero for depreciation purposes. Amendments (3) and (4) clarify the meaning of the term ‘start to construct' in the bill taxpayers who construct their own assets. This is a very important bill. It is an important measure not only to assist small business but also to stimulate investment in the economy. I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",141

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS-COST RECOVERY) BILL 2008 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time.",143
196,Mr DUTTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I rise to contribute to this debate on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. By way of background, this bill was implemented as a 2008-09 budget measure which Labor says was an election commitment, but we can find no such commitment. It will impose fees at three points: the original submission for listing, after successful application and at resubmission. The introduction of a cost recovery measure was expected to generate additional revenues of $7 million over forward estifor mates, with a net cost of $2.2 million. However, the EM states that, once fully operational, annual revenue from fees is expected to total about $9.4 million in 2008-09, rising to $14 million in 2009-10. Irrespective, savings are a very small proportion of the approximately $7 billion spent on the PBS. Indicative fees and charges proposed under the scheme as at June 2008 were as follows: a major submission, $119,500; a minor submission, $12,500; secretariat listing, $1,000; generic products, $500; and pricing arrangements, $25,000. This effectively means it could cost approximately $145,000 to make a single submission. To bring new drugs to the market, the costs are estimated to be approximately $315,000, providing there are no complications. Cost recovery measures were first introduced in the 2005-06 budget, with a proposed implementation date of 1 July 2007. Implementation was delayed due to consultations with the pharmaceutical industry about the PBS reform process during 2006. When originally proposed in 2005-06, there was concern that such measures were undermining the independence of the PBAC and might result in manufacturers declining to list drugs on the PBS. In 2005-06, Medicines Australia argued the operation of the PBAC was a Commonwealth government function and cost recovery measures would be inappropriate. Arguments in favour of cost recovery suggest that a pharmaceutical company receives significant benefit from listing and it is unreasonable that the taxpayer should pay the bill for listing. Manufacturers already incur significant costs in preparing a submission and, under such a proposal, the pharmaceutical industry would also have to pay the additional fee when the submission is considered by the PBAC. There are concerns that cost recovery could affect the independence of the PBAC and the PBS. Cost recovery has been implemented successfully in the TGA process, which has maintained its independence. However, the TGA and the PBAC have very different roles. The TGA decides whether a drug or medical device can be marketed in Australia, whereas the PBAC advises the minister on which drugs should be approved for a public subsidy. The Productivity Commission advised that cost recovery arrangements should only be introduced to improve efficiency and should not be implemented where they are inconsistent with policy objectives. Whilst cost recovery may improve efficiency, if it leads to higher drug prices and delays to PBS listings, it would be inconsistent with the objecthey tive of the PBS of providing timely and affordable access to pharmaceuticals. Like many people in this place, including the minister, I have contact with the industry and listen to stakeholders. Their concerns in relation to this particular bill are certainly strongly held. The industry argues that this would be a global first, that it would be unprecedented and that the measures do not adhere to the principles of cost recovery. There is no service to the seller. Recovery is being made for a purchaser's function, and it could take the costs of a listing to over $1 million. It could risk Australian patients' access to some new medicines and it could impact small population groups-and this is a very important point. The point relates to drugs which are brought to the market and which do have a very small patient base, where it is a listing which involves so-called ‘orphan drugs' and where the returns to the company are nowhere near what the public perception might be about the returns on some of the so-called superdrugs-where there is a significant return on investment to companies. We are talking about a smaller population drug where there is significant cost to the company to bring that drug to market. In many cases, it is already financially unviable for that drug to be brought forward to market, but there is cross-subsidisation that takes place, obviously, in relation to some of the decisions that these companies make. It means that they can afford, in some cases, for the public good, to bring a particular drug forward even though the returns might be quite minimal-if positive at all. So there are concerns, and I say to the minister that there is a need for the department and for her office to heed those concerns and to look at the measures and how can provide a way forward so that patient outcomes are optimised into the future. Some companies will decide that it is not worth listing some drugs for those groups and that is going to have a detrimental outcome for some patient groups. Again, that is something that the government has to weigh up in the decision-making process. It does, the industry advise, have the potential to deter innovation and investment in the Australian pharmaceutical industry and it is, in fact, a tax. It should be acknowledged by the government as such. There is no comparison to the TGA process where payment is for registration. These are all important points in this debate. The government reintroduces this measure at a time when the industry is dealing with a substantial four-year reform process initiated in 2007 and it also comes as the budget imposes a further $175 million in price cuts on the industry. It is important to note as part of this debate that the now minister expressed strong opposition to cost recovery when she was the shadow minister for health and ageing. Indeed, the minister said that such actions would threaten the independence of the PBS: The PBAC needs to be independent of government and of industry, and we cannot see the fication for this move to the cost-recovery I have asked the government to reconsider this approach given the risk to the independence of the PBAC. Obviously, the minister's view has changed quite considerably over the course of the last 18 months. I also note, as part of my contribution to this debate, that the chair of the PBAC suggested that there were no concerns about cost recovery impacting on recommendations or, indeed, independence of the commitment. The PBS gives Australia one of the best pharmaceutical delivery systems in the world and we intend to make that better. Giving Australians access to the best available medicines that are safe and of the highest quality should be a priority of any government. It certainly was a priority of the coalition government. That is why we initiated the PBS reform and it is why this government has continued with that process. The coalition fully supports the charter of the PBS to provide timely and affordable access to subsidised medications for the Australian community and, despite some rewrite of history that has taken place in a number of portfolios over the course of the last 18 months by this government, it is important to place on the record that during the coalition government's time we increased expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits from $2.22 billion in 1996-97, when we came to government, to $6.4 billion in 2006-07. That is a significant increase, recognised by people in the industry but most importantly recognised by Australians who have the potential for lifesaving drugs to make a difference to their situation and to improve their health. That is certainly a continuing priority for this coalition. When we return to government we will make sure that we continue to have a sustainable PBS system. We will also continue to listen to the concerns of those within the justiindustry who are making investment decimodel. sions about whether or not they will manufacture or conduct research and development in this country and whether or not they continue to employ staff in a highly productive industry. These are all decisions which go to whether or not these future investments will be made in this country. That is why the government needs to tread very lightly. As part of this debate, I want to mention Pauline Talty, a very brave woman who lives in Sydney. She has a terrible condition which necessitates a transplant that is going to be performed overseas because of an announcement made by the government earlier today. This has been a very difficult time for Pauline and her family. It has been an extremely taxing time for a number of months. They have jumped through bureaucratic hoops to facilitate the only option available to this young woman. I have met with Pauline in hospital. I have listened to her case and I have spoken and corresponded with her family and supporters and her case is compelling. I thank the government for their change of heart, for the reversal of their decision. It is a common-sense outcome that they would support this woman to travel overseas to have what potentially is a lifesaving transplant operation. I thank the government for that change of heart, which did not come easily. A great deal of public debate has taken place. I also want to thank all of the media outlets involved in airing the case of Pauline Talty. I want to thank the Alan Jones program for the interest they have shown in this issue because this really was about the life and death of a young Australian. We have been able to help Pauline in her cause to come to this great outcome, an outcome which I said on radio recently I would praise the government for if they were to change their mind. I offer that praise to the government today. I hope that every accommodation will be made in the delivery of this outcome and Pauline's travel overseas. We wish her a successful operation and hope and pray that she is returned to Australia so that she can lead the life she has dreamed of for so long, and for her family to live with some peace of mind knowing that she has been given an opportunity to have her life extended, a life which otherwise, without the assistance of this program, would not have been possible. Also, I want to make some comments about the announcements in the budget last night. The situation is quite dire for public hospitals right around the country. That is why this Prime Minister promised at the last election that he would fix public hospitals by mid-2009. There is now a closing gap but nonetheless a six-week window open to the Prime Minister to fix public hospitals. That is the promise he made at the last election. It is a promise which is going to be broken in six weeks time because, despite any best intention at the eleventh hour, this Prime Minister is not going to be able to fix public hospitals in six weeks. That was the commitment given by this government at the last election but we came through another budget last night without any evidence whatsoever of how they are going to fix public hospitals. Interestingly enough, the words that were used by the Prime Minister were that he would fix the public hospitals. That has been airbrushed from the Prime Minister's website. It now says that they will improve public hospitals. And the latest contribution from the federal minister is that they will water down that commitment even further. That is of great concern to all Australians, because all Australians heard at the last election that this Prime Minister would fix public hospitals by mid-2009, and he has failed to do so. And how can you have a health systemMr Hale- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order as to relevance. The member is not addressing the bill that is in the parliament at the moment.",143
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,There is no point of order.,146
198,Mr DUTTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"This of course, to any Australian, is part of the response to the health outcomes of all Australians. To have a member from the Northern Territory stand in this place and suggest that public hospitals are not important really is a sad development. This really isMr Hale- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order with respect to relevance. The bill is the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2] and the member is not addressing the bill in question.",146
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The title of the bill is ‘A Bill for an Act to amend the National Health Act 1953, and for related purposes'. As the occupant of the chair I obviously have to make sure that all honourable members observe the standing orders, but the addition of the words ‘and for related purposes' does tend to widen the area that members are able to debate. However, I ask the honourable member to be cognisant of the specific provisions of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and observe the standing orders in making his contribution.",146
200,Mr DUTTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course, no debate can be had in this place in relation to the PBS or health without talking about public hospitals. The prescription of drugs at public hospitals is an integral part of how the public hospital system operates in this country, and it is a very important issue about which we should not be afraid to speak. The member for Solomon does not need to sign up to every prescriptive word provided through the Prime Minister's office. If he believes that public hospitals are okay in this country and that they are working well in the Northern Territory and that no fixes, changes or improvements could be made to public hospitals in the Northern Territory then he should say that by way of press release. We would welcome the member's contribution by way of press release to his constituents to say that public hospitals in this country cannot improve. There are plenty of other examples in the health system-there is no question about that-particularly in the Northern Territory in relation to the provision of superclinic services. That has been a complete and utter failure, not just by the Northern Territory government but, importantly, by this government as well. The reason that I raise that is in part because this really goes to the way in which this government has managed health over the course of the last 18 months. There clearly have been a series of blunders. We had the minister involved in the alcopops debate, which was a complete humiliation for the Minister for Health and Ageing. It was a complete embarrassment. This same bill that is before the House came before the House last year, but just before the last election this minister was out saying that she was opposed to the position which she now advocates. So it has been quite a telling exercise, over the course of the last 18 months, to see similar management practices by the federal health minister that we have seen by health ministers at a state level over the last 10 or 11 years-which have been completely and utterly disastrous. That is why I raise great caution in relation to this bill. If drugs which provide life-saving opportunities to Australians are prevented from being listed then that will be a very sad outcome. We take the assurances of the government that that is not going to be the case. We take the assurances of the government that this bill will not impose those impediments which the industry warns of. But we do put the government on notice that, their having given all of these assurances, we will hold them to account at a future time. For that reason I move a number of amendments which I have circulated in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) acknowledges that the bill does not require: (a) an independent review after two years of the cost recovery arrangements for listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; (b) any such review to identify any negative impacts that the cost recovery arrangements have had on access to medicines; (c) any such review to be tabled in Parliament; and (d) an annual quality assurance audit of the evaluation of submissions (from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Committee) conducted by the relevant Department and its evaluators; and (2) calls on the Government to make such amendments to the bill as would rectify these flaws”. I move those amendments because we think that they would go some way toward improving the position that the government is putting forward. We think that it would provide a better outcome for a more transparent process if reviews were able to be conducted-if the advice that was raised as a result of the recent Senate inquiries and the advice of the industry were adhered to. I just flag a word of caution to this government that they may see people on private health or people in the pharmaceutical industry as an easy touch but the reality is that these people have a significant contribution to make. If this minister is just dismissive of views which are contrary to hers, then we will not arrive at a position of delivering better legislation to the Australian people. That is why we move these amendments as circulated. In conclusion, I am happy to say to the Australian people that the coalition, when we were in government, stood for a sustainable PBS regime. We have not differed from that stance one iota. We still have a very strong commitment to providing a viable, wellfunded and sustainable industry to this country into the future. We will rectify the difficulties that this government have created in 18 short months. After the coming election, we will wind back as much of the difficulty that they have put in place as we can. What will take time, of course, is to repay the enormous debt that the Labor Party have created. The Australian people know that it took Paul Keating and Bob Hawke about 13 years to create $96 billion worth of debt; it has taken Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan about 18 months to rack up $188 billion of debt and Advisory there is no end in sight. That is going to make future funding decisions very difficult, and not just in relation to the provision of drugs but for the provision of health services in general. That is why we have to recognise as part of this debate that the government is making it more difficult for future decisions to be made when it has an $8 billion a year interest bill on this huge debt that it has incurred in such a short period of time. That will impact on the government's capacity, and the incoming government's capacity after the next election, to make decisions which are going to be beneficial to the Australian health community. We want to provide better health outcomes for all Australians. That is what a coalition opposition stands for, it is what coalition governments have always stood for and it is what we will fight for after the next election.",147
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Wood-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,148
202,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Dickson has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,148
203,Mr HALE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his contribution to the debate and note that, if he would like to have some copies of my press releases in regard to the $85 million worth of health programs that were in the budget last night for the good people of Solomon, I will happily provide those to him. I have a copy of them here. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I today to make my contribution to this debate on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. This important bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953 to provide the legislative basis for the Commonwealth to recover costs for services provided. The services provided by the Commonwealth are in relation to submissions for the listing, or changes to current listings, of medicines and vaccines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS, and the National Immunisation Program, the NIP. The arrangements are required to provide the framework that will establish charges on a fee-for-service basis. The bill is not a taxing bill and expressly provides that fees must not amount to taxation. The arrangements are aimed at recovering costs from applicants, usually pharmaceutical companies, who apply for products to be listed on the PBS or the NIP. Having a medicine listed on the PBS or a vaccine designated on the NIP generally provides a high level of commercial certainty to the sales of that product in Australia. In order to establish that a product is worthy of the public trust that accompanies any listing, the assessment process of products requires rigorous tests to ensure the accuracy of the clinical claims made. Those tests and those assessments cost money. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for the government to recoup the costs associated with assessing a product's suitability for subsidy. It is envisaged the fees prescribed in the regulations will be derived from an activity based costing model. The more complex and time consuming the evaluation, the higher the fee. Let's be realistic about this: pharmaceutical companies, many of them subsidiaries of large multinational pharmaceutical companies, have the financial capacity to meet the cost of these assessments. Why rise should the taxpayer of Australia foot the bill? In 2007-08 the top 20 pharmaceutical companies each received, on average, $241 million from the Commonwealth via the PBS or NIP subsidy. Cost recovery is not a new concept for the pharmaceutical industry. The pre-market evaluation of products through the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or the TGA, is funded through cost recovery arrangements and has been since 1991. This bill is a logical extension of the TGA's cost recovery process. In fact, the Productivity Commission has noted that cost recovery can provide an important means of improving economic efficiencies and equity by ensuring those who use regulated services bear the costs. Medicines supplied under the PBS are provided directly to the people of Australia by chemists, doctors and hospitals on a government subsidised basis. Co-payments and other amounts charged will not be affected under the cost recovery arrangements. The PBS was established to set the public copayment amount. It is very important to note that Australians accessing the PBS will not be required to pay any extra for PBS listed medicines or NIP vaccines as a result of this measure. Importantly, this bill also ensures the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, or the PBAC. This group provides expert advice on medicines, independent of government and industry. Members of the PBAC are selected from consumers, health economists, practising community pharmacists, general practitioners and other specialists. They make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Ageing as to which medicines and vaccines should be made available for government subsidised supply. The arrangements for funding the PBAC directly through the budget will continue, and the PBAC will have no role in setting fees and will take no part in discussions with companies over fees. This bill will ensure there will be ongoing monitoring mechanisms to ensure fees continue to reflect costs. It is expected that fees will be indexed annually, and in accordance with the government's cost recovery guidelines there will be a full review conducted within five years. The bill will see ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, including peak industry, consumer and healthcare provider bodies. It is not the first time this bill has been before the House. The bill has been scrutinised by two Senate committees looking at various aspects of the bill and the regulations in detail. Both committee inquiries recommended that the bill be passed. Delay in the passage of this bill has already resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in revenue-in fact, around $9.4 million in 2008-09. The bill provides for a commencement date of 1 July this year. Previous operational data suggests fees would be expected to total approximately $14 million in the first full financial year of operation. It is very interesting that those opposite announced in the 2005-06 budget that costs associated with listing products on the PBS and the NIP would be recovered from the pharmaceutical industry. So I think it is worth repeating what our fantastic Minister for Health and Ageing asked yesterday at the end of her second reading speech for this bill: Given that this was a measure of the previous Liberal government in the first place, it is able for us to ask why they continue to oppose it. Is this just another example of opposition for opposition's sake, or is it just the opposition ing to once again support big business over the interests of the Australian people? I commend this bill to the House.",148
204,Mr MARLES,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I also rise to speak in support of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. This is a bill which will allow the Australian government to recover costs associated with the assessment of applications for both new listings and changes in the listing of products on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or for the designation of vaccines under the National Immunisation Program. These assessments are undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is fundamental to the architecture of the way the Australian government administers health in this country. In the financial year 2007-08, $7 billion was paid out in subsidies under the PBS. There were 171 million prescriptions made in that year, the equivalent of eight prescriptions for every Australian. This is a scheme fundamental to ensuring that drugs and medications can be provided to Australians at an affordable price, thus making our system one which we would want to see representing a developed economy and country. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been providing affordable medications to Australians for 60 years and it is essential to the administration of health in this country. While the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme provides an enormous benefit to those persons buying drugs and medications, there is also, very evidently, a significant benefit which goes to the pharmaceutical companies who have their products listed under the PBS or their vaccines designated reasonunder the National Immunisation Program. Indeed, in the financial year 2007-08, the top 20 pharmaceutical companies who had prodchoosucts under the umbrella of these two schemes received, on average, $241 million each through subsidies under the PBS or the NIP. It is clear that it is essential to the business plan of these pharmaceutical companies that they receive the subsidies that are paid under the PBS or through the NIP. So the proposition which forms the heart of this legislation is very simple: if these companies are to receive the considerable benefit associated with having their products listed on the PBS or designated under the NIP, then the assessment which is undertaken by the government of their products in order for those products to come under the umbrella of those programs ought be paid for by the companies receiving the benefits. And these costs are not insubstantial. The assessment process is significant. It involves a exhaustive assessment and testing of the particular products involved so that the clinical claims being made by the pharmaceutical companies can be verified by the government. That is very important in ensuring that there is public trust in the products which find themselves listed on the PBS or the National Immunisation Program. There is also a function undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee of entering into negotiations around the ultimate price which a consumer is required to pay for these products on chemists' shelves. Seeking cost recovery in circumstances such as this is consistent with the Australian government's cost recovery guidelines. Indeed, the Productivity Commission has commented on the importance in circumstances such as these of having cost recovery programs, and for three reasons. Firstly, there is an argument of equity. If companies which are in a position to pay are receiving a significant benefit from a service provided by government, then it is appropriate that they, rather than the taxpayer in general, pay for that service. Secondly, there is an economic argument that goes to economic efficiency on the part of those who are providing the service through government. They will provide that service in a more efficient and ductive way if they know that they are subject to the discipline of needing to provide a bill to those applicants seeking listing of their products on the PBS. Thirdly, there is an economic efficiency argument from the point of view of the applicants themselves, and that is that there is an incentive not to put in place a substandard application if they risk the prospect of that application being knocked back and of then having to pay a price without getting an outcome. This bill provides for the cost recovery scheme by allowing for regulations to be made under the National Health Act for such very a cost recovery regime. It is important to understand that we are not here tonight legislating for a tax; this is a fee for service. The regulations that would come under this legislation may include but certainly would not be limited to provisions which deal with the administrative process for putting in place the cost recovery scheme through the making of the submissions and the prescribing of fees. They would deal with provisions relating to the payment of those fees and whether there are any categories of applicants or products which ought to be exempt from those fees, and whether there ought to be perhaps a provision which deals with the waiver of fees in certain circumstances. The provisions can deal with refusal to provide services in circumstances where no fees are paid-in a sense, a ‘down tools' provision that if the company is not paying the fee then the service being provided, the assessment of their product, would stop. The regulations will provide for the recovery of unpaid fees, for the provision of penalties where there are late fees and, importantly, for a review mechanism for the administrative decisions which are made in the process of putting this scheme in place. These regulations will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. They will provide for a pro- very simple method, a very simple proposition, which is that the more complex the assessment of a product, the more complex the price negotiations involved in a product, the greater the fee that will be charged. Indeed, there were an application that was substandard and was knocked back, as I said, then every new application would be subject to a new fee, as there would be a new service provided. It is expected that these fees would be indexed annually, that there would be a full review of all the fees within five years and that the department would put in place a mechanism for monitoring the fees. As the member for Solomon said, it is anticipated that the revenue raised through this cost recovery scheme would be in the vicinity of $14 million annually. The independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will be assured, as the Commonwealth will continue to directly fund the committee and the revenue raised as a result of this regime would be paid into consolidated revenue. Very importantly, Australians accessing PBS productsaccessing the medications or the drugs which are subsidised through the PBS-would not be paying a cent more as a result of the implementation of the scheme, and that is really a function of the process of negotiating the price, which is part of the assessment of the product in the first place. There has been significant consultation with stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry over the last two years about the implementation of this scheme. And, indeed, this is not new. There are cost recovery schemes, for example, in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, where there is a system of providing for the registration of products or goods for their sale and for their marketing, and, as part of the assessment process required for registration, there is a fee paid by the applicant. So this not a new concept to the industry; it is something that the industry is very familiar with. This bill has a recent legislative history. It was first passed by this House of Representaif tives on 5 June last year. From here it went to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and from there to the full Senate, where the motion for the second reading was rejected, on 28 August last year. It went back to the Senate community affairs committee, where a second inquiry into the bill was held. It is worth mentioning to the House that both the committee inquiries recommended that this bill be passed. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a very important part of the architecture of this country's administration of health. This bill will absolutely improve that architecture. The pharmaceutical companies are certainly receiving a reasonable benefit, but the service that is provided by government in assessing their products to form part of the PBS or the NIP is a service for which they ought to pay, and so I commend this bill to the House. Mr Wood-Madam Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",150

206,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I note that the member for Dickson is in the House and has flagged some amendments to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits-Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 [No. 2]. It is my intention that those amendments be discussed in the Senate. It might be helpful to the member for Dickson is to hear these commitments: we are happy to undertake to discuss those amendments but, in order to not delay the proceedings of this House, our suggestion, given that a number of the other parties in the other place have also suggested some amendments, is that those discussions and negotiations occur in the other place. It would be my intention to seek the bill's passage through the House today and for discussions to be able to commence. I thank the other members, the member for Corio and the member for Solomon, for speaking on this bill. It is a bill that would provide authority for the cost recovery of services provided by the Commonwealth in relation to submissions for listing, or amendment to a listing, of medicines, vaccines and other products on the PBS or the NIP. As I have informed the House, this bill has been subject to considerable review already by the Senate community affairs committee, which has held two inquiries into the proposed cost recovery measure, with both inquiries recommending that the bill proceed in its current form. As I have indicated, in this debate the member for Dickson has proposed some amendments to the bill which the government is prepared to undertake to consider, but in order to avoid further delays to the the government proposes that it be passed by the House in its current form and that the government consider its position on any amendments proposed by the opposition or other parties when the bill is debated in the Senate.",152

209,Mr BUTLER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I will not speak for long and I am sure that the member for O'Connor will get an opportunity to speak on this as well before we adjourn. The Native Title Amendment Bill 2009 is the most recent of a long line of legislation in this place that has dealt with the complex and often controversial question bill of native title, particularly since the 1992 Mabo decision finally rejected the legal doctrine that Australia was terra nullius at the time of European arrival and settlement a little over 200 years ago. This was a pivotal moment in Australia's history, granting legal recognition of our Indigenous communities' previous possession of Australia, and dispossession as a result of European settlement. It was also a recognition of the devastating consequences that have resulted from dispossession, which have reverberated through generations and are still keenly felt today. The Native Title Act 1993 was the legislative response to the High Court's decision in Mabo, introduced by the Keating government in the face of a very significant and at times vicious fear campaign about the threat posed by that legislation and the High Court decision to various types of propertyranging up to, and including in some cases in the fear campaign, suburban backyards, although it was quite clear that the Mabo decision did not involve any suggestions that native title would defeat existing property rights under the Australian and common-law systems. The 1993 legislation saw legislative recognition of those previous rights and the Indigenous Australian connection to the land in the pre-existing English and then Australian and common-law hierarchy of property rights that has endured since European settlement. The act was a vital tool for restoring the cultural, social and economic benefits that that connection between Indigenous communities and their land brings and was a major step forward on the march towards lasting and true reconciliation. The preamble to the act states that the people of Australia intend: … to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire. Sadly, I am sure that nobody in this House could argue that we do not still have a long way to go to fulfil the intention included within the preamble to the legislation. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the Native Title Act coming into operation and taking force and, whilst there have been some successes, it is widely accepted, I think, that the process under that act is excruciatingly slow and complex for all parties involved. The delay that we have seen in the resolution of native title claims and the litigation that flows from those claims has resulted in millions of dollars being wasted, opportunities for reconciliation and development squandered, and the flourishing of distrust and disillusionment with the process by all parties involved, Indigenous communities and others with interests in the land. The prolonged delays in resolving claims have meant that some people have died while still fighting for their rights under the native title process and been denied the chance to see their native title recognised. If this situation continues, as I understand the position, the best estimate is that another 30 years will be required to resolve all current native title claims, not including any that come about in the future. This government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous advantage. The Prime Minister's apology to the stolen generations gave the nation fresh impetus for renewing efforts in reconciliation and moving forward towards a more equitable future for all Australians, including Indigenous Australians. Getting the native title process right is an important part of that broader ambition that we have for our nation. Native title and its associated agreements are an essential part of closing that gap. Whilst the process for recognising claims struggles under the weight of prorich tracted litigation, our Indigenous communities and other communities that have connection to the relevant lands are being further deprived. This government believes that negotiation is more likely to produce results than litigation and that native title issues should be resolved by negotiation wherever possible. Negotiation is better suited to achieving timely and effective resolution of those claims. The adversarial system by its very nature is not conducive to encouraging long term, productive working relationships into the future, which are often so important in ensuring that the land is used in a productive way. Frankly, negotiation and mediation have always been the intent and the spirit of the legislation. My home state of South Australia provides an impressive example of what can be achieved through negotiation. Our state's biggest native title determination was made in March this year, after many years of determined effort. It involved the recognition of the non-exclusive rights and interests of the Adnyamathanha people over more than 41,000 square kilometres of land in and around the Flinders Ranges. It recognises rights and interests including access to perform ceremonial or cultural activities, to hunt, to camp and to gather natural materials such as plants and ochre. These were consent determinations that resolved one claim and partially resolved another. The Indigenous land use agreement is currently being finalised for comanagement of Flinders Ranges National Park. The parties to the determination included 45 pastoral lease holders, mining and exploration companies, along with the Adnyamathanha people and the South Australian government. Achieving this major determination without litigation not only shows the potential for negotiated settlement but, just as importantly, paves the way for future cooperation between all of the parties in managing the land and jointly exploring other economic development opportunities. As the Native Title Tribunal Deputy President Chris Sumner said: This determination is an example of what can be achieved when all agencies involved in the native title process-especially the Federal Court, the Tribunal, South Australian Native Title Services, the SA Government and legal and anthropological advisers-work together in a co-operative way, which is a feature of native title negotiations South Australia. Our government wants to see all of the country following South Australia's example, and this bill aims to facilitate that. The government believes that broadening the scope for mediation whilst tightening case management, a much-needed step in this area, will increase flexibility and efficiency, resulting in more timely and effective negotiated resolution of claims. A key aspect of this bill is to amend the act to give the Federal Court a central role in managing native title claims. The Federal Court, as we know, has vast experience in alternative dispute resolution in a range of different areas of the law. The Federal Court will henceforth, if this bill passes, oversee case management of the native title claims. The Federal Court can provide transparency, independence, accountability and competency that is vital to maximise faith in the native title process, deliver results and fulfil the hopes and aspirations of native title claimants and other involved people. By centralising control over case management in the Federal Court, opportunities for resolution can be more easily identified, deadlocks can be worked on more efficiently instead of being left to fester, a more focused approach can be pressed upon the parties by the court if one or more of the parties is dillydallying and issues in dispute can be more readily identified along with options to further progress the claim's resolution. As part of its central role, this bill allows the Federal Court to refer the whole or any part of a proceeding for mediation to a court mediator or to the Native Title Tribunal or another individual or body. It provides a flexible and responsive approach to mediation and allows the court to use the most appropriate form of dispute resolution according to the circumstances of the case. The in court will continue to utilise the Native Title Tribunal's experience and specialist capacity without relying on it necessarily as the only available mediating body. The Federal Court will better coordinate, prioritise and allocate resources for mediation than currently is the case. The success of negotiating agreements through mediation depends heavily on the good faith of all parties involved. Without a cooperative approach and sincere efforts from all, very little can be achieved. One of the court's new roles will be to assist in idening tifying parties who are acting in bad faith and pulling them into line. The bill will also enable the court to make consent orders-and I stress ‘consent orders'-about matters beyond native title that might be conducive to a positive working relationship between all parties. This could include agreements relating to economic development opportunities, training, employment, heritage, sustainability or existing industry principles. Permitting the court to assist in the resolution of native title and other matters at the same time will foster future cooperation and agreement, hopefully to the benefit of all parties. The bill will also give the court discretion to rely on agreed statements of facts between some or all of the parties. At a minimum, this agreement must be between the native title claim group and the principal government concerned but can also be between a range of other parties involved in the claim. This bill also seeks to broaden the scope of claimants utilising the recent changes to the rules of evidence introduced by this government in the Evidence Amendment Act last year. This has the potential to greatly assist native title claimants with giving evidence relating to traditional laws and customs. In particular, amendments to the hearsay and opinion rules recognise those rules' incompatibility with providing evidence on the existence of traditional laws and customs. This shifts the focus away from legal technicalities to the more pertinent issues-and, frankly, more reliable issues-of reliability and weight. In order to ensure that native title claimants reap the most benefit from these changes, this bill will make exceptions to the transitional provisions so that the new rules relating to evidence can apply to proceedings initiated prior to 1 January 2009. This bill will also streamline processes deal with the recognition of native title bodies that can be involved in the resolution process. Experience has shown those bodies to be a very important part of successful claims. The whole thrust of this bill is to facilitate a more cost-effective, efficient and timely native title process that focuses on negotiation rather than litigation to achieve results. The government has consulted widely on the amendments and there has been wideranging support for what is proposed in this bill. A discussion paper was released by the Attorney-General and distributed to over 70 stakeholders, although we accept there is still more to do than this bill presents. This bill is part of an ongoing process of reform in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to make real and lasting improvements that achieve the original intent of the act 15 years ago. The bill before us today, together with renewed efforts by all parties to work constructively together to further the interests and the intent of those the act was intended to benefit, can make some much-needed improvement that will enable a more flexible, effective and timely response to determining native title claims. I commend the bill to the House.",153
210,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Port Adelaide for not taking up his full time, because I feel I can bring quite a lot of good advice to the House on this matter of the Native Title Amendment Bill 2009 simply because in my business career I lived in-and managed businesses, including hotels, in-a town that had at all times about one-third of its population being of Indigenous descent. I also happened to chair the backbench committee under the Howard government that discussed the amendments that the Howard government provided to the Native Title Act. That in itself involved quite a piece of negotiation amongst the variety of interests involved within the party. We have here today another attempt to find a mechanism that delivers a speedy resolution of native title claims. I am not totally convinced that it will be any more successful than past attempts. My reasoning is not all that difficult to follow. When the bill for the act was first brought to this House, I think even the Keating government wanted to amend it but at that stage our leader, John Hewson, decided that we would support no amendments and would oppose the legislation lock, stock and barrel, so it was passed in its original form. The opposition has made the point that it wants to wait for the report from the Senate on the legislation before us and hold off its final decision until that occurs. I am hopeful that at that time the government will see the sense of an amendment to the right to negotiate provisions. It is one of the problems that need the attention of the government, and I do not know if it was all done deliberately or accidentally but, as I have said, my long standing recollection is that the Keating government thought at the time they really should do something about it. All parties involved in a native title claim bar one group are obliged to negotiate in good faith. The member for Port Adelaide talked about a court dealing with people who were not acting in good faith. But as the act prevails there is no obligation on the native title claimant parties to act in good faith or negotiate in good faith. In fact, in my view it might best be described as the right not to negotiate. I have seen over the years numerous examples of that occurring and the only outcome of that has been that people have got more angry and the circumstances have not been the best. But, quite obviously, it will be otherwise if it is the view of the government that the Federal Court, with its increased powers and responsibilities, to which I am not an objector, can then in fact have the opportunity to say to any of the applicants or all those involved, ‘You will come to court and we will get this matter moving.' That cannot happen today because under the act people do not have to turn up and they are not deemed to have been failing to negotiate in good faith. There is no obligation upon them to do so. If one has had experience, as I have had, with Aboriginal families-and later I will comment a little further on the representations that I have had from Indigenous families within my own electorate-one would know that the first responsibility is to get them to agree amongst themselves. One of the changes with the 10-point plan was to require, for the first time, that there only be one applicant body; in other words, Aboriginal or Indigenous people had to sort out who was going to be the claimant. We had the situation previous to that of a claimant making a claim, successful or not-and if successful often that involved a financial settlement in those days-and then someone else would make a claim and somebody else had to make a financial settlement. Consequently, we amended that situation by saying, ‘Well, there can only be one claimant whatever that matter is.' But this is the situation that arises before native title issues are settled. It is arguable that under this right not to negotiate there are better outcomes for Aboriginal opportunists in some cases to wait until someto one has reason to develop a piece of land and then apply or threaten to apply for native title. Under the act they have a right in those circumstances to negotiate, ostensibly to protect their own interests and culture. But if they can delay a development for sufficiently long, there is usually a financial payment. With a much larger thing like the recent Woodside James Price Point arrangements in the Kimberley of Western Australia, the reality was that the newly elected Premier said, ‘Listen, fellas, if you can't come to an agreement I will'-as the 10-point plan provided-‘resume native title.' Because that is a law of the Commonwealth, it would have been resumed with compensation. The other fact that is misunderstood in all of this is native title is not a right as to property, although that does apply in the Northern Territory, where the Fraser government created a law for the Northern Territory which actually granted property rights. Throughout the rest of Australia a native title right is a right of access and a right, on account of that access, to hunt and gather and to conduct traditional ceremonies. As time has progressed, I think there has been a more generous view than that amongst many people, particularly in the mining sector, who are more than happy to look at the rights of Indigenous title holders and give them better opportunities in employment, better facilities and things of that nature, which is the outcome of proper agreements. But that is typically after native title is granted. The big problem that first needs to be fixed is that, where native title does not exist but the right to negotiate does, one party has no responsibility to negotiate in good faith. I will be encouraging my colleagues to see that that is changed as a major enhancement to these other measures. But there are other aspects of native title that worry me considerably. For many people, I think it has created a cargo cult culture. Their expectations are beyond what it is likely to deliver. I think that is a pity. I to Carnarvon in 1958, nine years before the Australian government had any constitutional right to do anything about Aboriginal people. You may remember the history of our Constitution, in which the founding fathers wished to implement the White Australia policy-under the pressure, I might add, of Labor members of parliament, who thought that the Chinese were going to pinch all their jobs. They therefore created a clause in the Constitution for the federal parliament to pass laws for people of certain race. The purpose of that was to tell them they could not come to Australia. Then someone said, that ‘Oops. We're not going to kick all the Aboriginals out,' and someone else said, ‘We'll put in “excepting the Aboriginal race”.' That insertion forbad the Australian parliament from doing anything on behalf of or for the control of Aboriginal people. It was all a responsibility of state governments. When I arrived in a town of 2,000 or 3,000 people with a local population of 300 or 400 resident Aborigines and a peripheral population of probably some thousands residing on station properties, which were typically their homelands, and serving as a labour pool in those days, everybody had a job. There was no welfare. Outrageously, you could apply as an Aboriginal person for citizenship of Australia. That was the situation, but people did not have the problems we know of today. They were hard working and, in fact, at that time a major construction project commenced, building the road from north of Northampton, which is just north of Geraldton, all the way through to Onslow and onwards. The Carnarvon main roads department ran the job for that length of road, and their third in command was an Aboriginal person and very good road builder. A very large number of their skilled grader operators et cetera were Aboriginal. These people just got along. Their kids went went to school and all the problems we read about today did not exist. In 1967, with goodwill and with the aid of my vote-the only time. I have ever voted ‘Yes' in a referendum-the Australian people gave an opportunity to the Commonwealth government to be part of the process. I do not believe that we have done very well. I think there are numerous reasons for that. I promoted to our former leader John Howard the idea of reversing the funding process from tops down to bottoms up. I still believe that the local government financial assistance grants model is the best way to go, but one of the things it does, of course, is disadvantage the Aboriginal elite, and therefore that is a problem. When one looks at the circumstances that exist, it is too simplistic to say that you can just give more power to the Federal Court. In principle, I do not oppose that, but we need to look at the details surrounding it. There needs to be an understanding that, firstly, the Aboriginal people have to get together and move forward together. If they do not, the court should have the capacity to say, ‘Delay is not acceptable. You have your rights to put your case.' I am also somewhat of a critic of what I term the inventiveness that exists in tradition and culture. A lot of that, I think, is manufactured and not true-and certainly not true when I knew people who had scars on their chests. One of those people told me they never had a sacred site but had a lot of sacred objects. When one thinks of their nomadic existence, there was probably some truth in that. But I just wonder when the Akubra hat or a flag become part of a culture. They are not cultural things. And smoking ceremonies are an American Indian cultural issue. All of a sudden it sort of looks good because you see it in the movies. Mr Gibbons-It wasn't an issue; it's part of their culture.",156
211,Mr TUCKEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"It is not a part of Aboriginal culture as I know it. What I am saying is that some of this inventiveness is of little value when, in fact, I and others would like to see the life of your typical Aboriginal son much improved. I am not convinced that the focus on land rights has been productive in that regard, nor do I believe a centralised bureaucracy is the way to resolve it-and I have produced papers on the subject and tried to do something about that. I sincerely hope that this otherwise rather inconsequential piece of legislation can be the foundation for some much more sensible things. Might I say, before the Speaker tells me it is time to adjourn the House, some very silly things happen. A CDEP manager has just been sacked because he took the view that if you wanted CDEP you actually worked for it. I have anecdotal evidence to prove that the powers that be sacked this bloke. By being made to do some work, two people got full-time jobs. That sort of thing has to be looked into. I will continue my argument when the debate is resumed. Debate interrupted. NA",159

213,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"Indi) (7.30 pm)There is much discussion amongst the budget deliberations of families and the effect on families, but let us not forget that there are many government decisions pre budget affecting families, some in a negative way. In my area of responsibility as shadow minister, I feel compelled to make comment yet again on the bungled way in which the government has handled the whole ABC Learning Centres mess. We remember Ms Gillard's promise that childcare centres cannot close in this country without 30 days notice. In her own electorate of Lalor, in Altona North a centre closed with six days notice. I have been contacted by a very distressed but per- eloquent mother detailing some of the problems and explaining that no parents, children, carers or affected community members were contacted, that this centre was fully occupied and recently renovated, that there is a demand for child care in that area, that all they had was a real estate agent who came to value the property and that no-one came to assess the quality of care in spite of the fact that there is an obvious market. In fact, to add to the insult, the correspondence they received from PPB listed one of the centres that could be used as an alternative form of care for parents who had their children in the Altona North centre. They listed one of the centres where this very woman has had a child on a waiting list for 3½ years. This is the sort of mess we find when the government has said time and time again it is working ‘hand in glove with the administrators in this matter'. If it is working hand in glove with the administrators, it is either ing deceptive or deliberately allowing PPB to run this less than satisfactory and quite embarrassingMr Shorten- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: as I understand the standing orders, members are not allowed to infer or make personal imputations about other members of the parliament. The use of the terms ‘deceptive' and some of the other words",159
214,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I will listen carefully to the comments of the member for Indi.,160
215,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It defies any understanding about why the government would allow this to happen. This is part of the government's attempt to close down centres just because they are privately run. The government has said it wants to rebalance the system irrespective of parents' requests, irrespective of the needs of children and quality care for children. How can it do this to families? How can it leave and ignore the pleas of families in need? This woman who emailed her member, the Minister for Health and Ageing, and the Deputy Prime Minister",160

221,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"No, this is not becoming a debacle. What is a debacle-and you should know this-is that families are besuffering because the manner in which the ABC Learning Centres has been handled has been a disgrace and parents have been left in the lurch. This woman now has her child in child care for two days in a local centre and one day in the city, which breaks up that child's care and attention. Hundreds of potential buyers have pulled out of final offer stages for ABC Learning Centres because they were not provided with details and correct information, and this is despite the minister's assurances last month. It seems centres like Altona North, which were told they had a confirmed buyer, continued to face uncertainty. Now they are closing and the government needs to explain why there has been such a long line of bungles in the whole tender process for this centre in Altona North-and I correct myselfwhich is in the health minister's electorate. This constituent of the minister for health has had no satisfactory response. The government has not responded adequately as to why it has allowed this debacle. (Time expired) Pensions and Benefits",160
222,Mr GIBBONS,ADJOURNMENT,"Bendigo) (7.35 pm)Last night's budget provides Australian pensioners with increases as part of the Australian government's secure and sustainable pension reforms. All 3.3 million age pensioners and disability pensioners, carers, spouse pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from increases their pension payments. From 20 September 2009, the secure and sustainable pension reforms deliver increases of $32.49 per week for single pensioners on the full rate and $10.14 per week combined for pensioner couples on the full rate. From 20 September 2009, total assistance for single pensioners will increase from $304.19 per week to $336.68 per week and for pensioner couples combined from $497.36 per week to $507.50 per week. This increase brings the single rate of the pension up to two-thirds of the combined couple rate. The reforms are focused on addressing the particular inadequacy of the single pension, as highlighted by the Harmer review of pensions. Single pensioners who currently receive a part-pension will benefit from an increase of between $10.14 and $32.49 depending on their level of private income. Around 75 per cent of single pensioners will receive the full increase. All current pensioner couples will receive $10.14 per week combined. The base rate of the pension will continue to benefit from benchmarking to wages. The benchmarked rate will increase for singles from 25 per cent to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, an increase of more than 10 per cent. The new benchmark will be enshrined in legislation. Annually, this represents a total increase in permanent payments of $1,689 for singles and $527 for couples combined. Labor recognise that pensioners are the best judge of managing their own budgets, so we are merging four payments into one by introducing the simplified pension supplement to replace separate allowances for GST, utilities, telephone and internet, and pharmaceuticals. The new pension supplement will initially be paid fortnightly, and from 1 July 2010 pensioners will be able to choose to receive around half of the new supplement in on a quarterly basis. This is great news for older Australians. In the current economic climate, it is hard for those receiving the age pension to make ends meet. In December last year the Rudd government made lump sum payments of $1,400 to each single pensioner and $2,100 to each couple-a down payment on the pension reform we committed to in this year's budget. Statistics indicate around 17,000 central Victorians will benefit from the increased payments and some $15 million will be injected into the local economy. So not only are these pension increases most beneficial for all pension recipients but they will also provide a $15 million boost to central Victoria's economy because most pension recipients are forced to dispose of all of their income each fortnight for their everyday needs. In February, coalition spokesman the member for Warringah turned his back on older Australians, saying that increasing the age pension would cause an enormous hit on government revenue. This is the classic coalition attitude, clearly showing all of the compassion of the Third Reich. This is one of this nation's most disadvantaged groups, and the coalition are more concerned about perceptions of maintaining their fiscal bottom line than looking after the people who helped to build this nation to what it is today. The age pension increase announced last night is yet another step Labor has taken to reduce the impact of the global economic crisis on pensioners' budgets. It has taken the Rudd government just 15 months into its first term to provide some social justice for our pension recipients after 12 years of neglect by the Howard government. The Rudd government's other initiatives in order to help older Australians are: reviewing the value of investments following the recent dramatic falls on the share markets; twice lowering the deeming rate to take account of lower investment yields; and bonuses of up to $900 for self-funded retirees who paid tax on their investment income in 2007-08. The two-thirds ratio between singles and couples will apply across both the base pension and the new pension supplement. Mr Speaker, what are you laughing at? These reforms give pensioners more financial security and flexibility in how they ceive their payments. The reforms will simplify the complex maze of pensioner payments and make the system fairer and sustainable into the future. To provide a strong safety net for those who rely on the pension to survive, the government has also taken necessary decisions to make sure these reforms are affordable. Through a series of tough decisions, and despite the ageing of the population, secure sustainable pension reform will be fully offset by the year 2020-21. These are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago and a vital investment in preparing Australia for the future. I commend these initiatives to the House.",161
223,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ryan) (7.40 pm)Australia is poorer after the budget that was delivered last night by the federal Treasurer. The people of Ryan are poorer after the budget was delivered last night, as well. In particular, I want to speak in the parliament tonight on behalf of those tens of thousands of couples who would be feeling immense pain and immense sadness tonight. The reason for that is that the Rudd government will introduce a cap on Medicare benefits payable under the extended Medicare safety net for a range of items with excessive fees, including to all assisted reproductive technology items, items for treatment to varicose veins, the injection of a therapeutic substance into the eye, hair transplants and a cataract surgery item. The caps will take effect from 1 January 2010. I specifically want to speak on behalf of tens of thousands of couples who will be feeling terribly sad this evening because they will be affected in relation to IVF treatment. The safety net was brought in by the Howard government in 2004. It pays 80 per cent of Medicare related out-of-pocket costs re- above $555.70 for families and concession card holders and above $1,111.60 for others. In the parliament tonight I want to quote the words of two very brave and courageous constituents in the Ryan electorate, Casey and Karen Pfluger. They gave me permission to read out their email to me on Saturday evening. They have been in contact with me in recent weeks, and we have developed a friendship over the email and over the teleand phone. I know that they are listening this evening. I want to thank you two, very much, from the bottom of my heart, for your courage in allowing me to quote your words and to quote your names for the parliament to hear and, I hope, for thousands of Australians across the country to hear. I quote: For couples such as ourselves IVF is the only way we can have children. Karen has a blocked falloBudget pian tube and the other one probably doesn't function after two years of attempting to conceive naturally with no pregnancy. She has regular ovulation, regular periods, correct hormone levels, and a healthy normal uterus, and my sperm is very healthy. Our IVF doctor said that after two years of attempting with all of those factors and our ages (29 and 31), we should have been pregnant. He believes Karen's tubes are our only impediment to conception, and IVF will bypass that. After all, IVF was invented for couples with our problem: married, otherwise healthy but with blocked fallopian tubes. As you see, our infertility is purely medical and beyond our control, yet the Federal Government is considering discriminating against us. We have a lot of love and attention to give to our future children, and are very committed to each other. Next month it will be our ninth wedding anniversary, and we have been together for almost eleven years. We don't drink alcohol, smoke or do drugs. We don't speed or drive dangerously. We pay our bills on time. We have no debt. We have no criminal records. We lodge our tax return on time each year. We both have Bachelor degrees. We have private health insurance with hospital cover. We love animals. Surely the Government wants people like ourselves to be having the children Australia will need in the future to care for the aging population, and to pay tax once they are old enough to have jobs. What we don't have is unlimited funds to pay for IVF. If the Federal Government changes the Safety Net for IVF, we will only be able to afford a few more attempts, especially stimulation and egg retrieval. Our first embryo transfer was unsuccessful last month. We only had one frozen embryo from our egg retrieval, and it was transferred yesterday. We have everything crossed that this embryo implants and we finally get to meet our first child. We need the Government to continue funding IVF treatment. Please do everything you can to make this happen. You are in a unique position to understand the heartbreak of infertile people across Australia because of your own experience. My heart goes out to you, Casey and Karen. Infertility is not something that you wanted. Infertility is not something that you chose. Thousands of others across Australia do not choose infertility. I say to all those in this parliament and in particular to those in the government who are parents and who have the privilege of being a father or a mother: why should we prevent those who, through no fault of their own, cannot have children? Prime Minister, you have three beautiful children. Treasurer, you have children. I am the father of a 2½-year-old. Why cannot some of our fellow Australians, who do not have the finances and who depend on IVF treatment, have children or have the chance to be parents? In God's name, why cannot they have the greatest blessing and the greatest privilege it must surely be, to be a father and a mother? (Time expired) Pensions and Benefits Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (7.45 pm)-I rise to acknowledge the absolute commitment of the Rudd Labor government to pensioners and its willingness to stand by that commitment, despite the pressures of the global economic crisis. It would have been convenient, some would have seen, for this government to use the global economic crisis as an opportunity to not pass on these increases to pensioners. But this government believes that not only was it important to pass on these increases but it was the right thing to do. I know that pensioners across my electorate of Petrie certainly welcome the announcement made in the budget last night to increase the full rate of the single pension by $32.49 per week and to increase the couple's pension by $10.14 per week from 20 September 2009. On the World News Australia website, a pensioner, Mrs Ethel Foyle, is 72 years old and lives alone in the North Brisbane suburb of West Chermside in my electorate. She has said that she is pleased with the increase, as the current pension is just enough for her to scrape by. She says that she requires ‘at least $7,000 a year for things like gas, electricity and rent'. Over 30 per cent of pensioners in North Brisbane are renting. She says there are things she misses out on because she cannot afford them. What she says is that, as a Queenslander she is pleased with the government's handling of the economy so far, and welcomes the extra money granted by the Rudd stimulus cheque late last year. She said: There were things I needed doing around the house, which have now been done. I bought some Christmas presents for the grandchildren, and that's basically where the money went, and got none left. So she welcomes this increase to the pension. That was obviously on top of the stimulus package that this government delivered to pensioners in the short term last year, when we saw that the pensioners were doing it so tough that we delivered that one-off payment as part of the stimulus package. Now this government has delivered for the long term for pensioners-not just in my electorate of Petrie but across Australia. I also call on the Queensland government to ensure that all of those pensioners living in public housing, in my electorate and across Queensland, see that full pension increase passed on to them, just as the South Australian government has announced, and not swallowed up with increases to the rent for that public housing. Certainly, that is what pensioners were asking of me last year when I held the Peninsula People's Forum. All three levels of government, elected representatives, were there in the one place at a public forum to answer any questions. I know the first question was: ‘Would the government increase the pension?' One of the other questions in that same forum was: ‘If you do, will the Queensland government increase our rent in public housing?' It is an issue where I hope the Queensland government, equally, does the right thing by our pensioners, and certainly those pensioners in Petrie would welcome such an initiative by the Queensland government. But, of course, we have heard of feigned concern by those on the other side that they are concerned about pensioners. We heard it last year and we continue to hear it. I am sure that, if given the opportunity, they would have been out saying, ‘Well, if we had one more year in government, we would have done it.' But the fact is that, in the 16 months leading up to the election in 2007 while I was campaigning on the ground in Petrie, not I've once did I hear the Liberal member or the Liberal Party coming out saying that it was proposing an increase to the pension or that it acknowledged the pressures that pensioners were facing at the time. This government has stepped up and delivered for pensioners. We will continue to support pensioners in the long term with the initiative announced in the budget that was delivered last night by the Treasurer, the Hon. Wayne Swan. In my electorate alone, 21,250 pensioners will benefit by this initiative. I look forward to going out next week and talking with my electorate about this initiative and about all of the initiatives of this government-the fact that we are about jobs for now and nation building for tomorrow. We are about apprenticeships and we are about small business. That is what a responsible government delivers, not just for local communities but for the nation as a whole. As I stated, I congratulate the government for the announcement in relation to the pensions. I congratulate this government, my government, about jobs, apprenticeships and small business. (Time expired) Murray Electorate: Water",162
224,Dr STONE,ADJOURNMENT,"I have referred before to the north-south pipeline, sometimes called the Sugarloaf Reservoir project, and I want to talk about it again tonight. This is, of course, an extraordinary project which has the object of delivering water to Melbourne for their toilets, gardens and car washing. The water is to come away from the Murray-Darling Basin and be pumped over the Great Divide. The water is to come out of the Goulburn River systemwhich, sadly, is already designated as the most stressed of the major tributaries to the Murray River. It is acknowledged officially that there not the water savings to be found in the so called Food Bowl Modernisation Projectwhich is plastic-lining irrigation channels in the Goulburn-Murray region and installing different metering systems. But, despite there not being water saved to put down this pipeline, there is still a statement being made from the Brumby-led Victorian government that there will be, ahead of schedule, water pushed down this pipeline, up over the Great Divide to Melbourne. In fact, they are bringing forward this pipeline event to early next year. You would wonder where they are going to get the water from, given the Eildon Dam is down to some 15 per cent capacity. However, Mr Brumby is quite satisfied that there is sufficient of the environmental reserve in the dam that he can take. He admits that there is 10 gigalitres of that 30 gigalitre serve already given to the Coliban Water Authority to pipe via the so-called ‘superpipe' to Bendigo, but there are still some 20 gigalitres of environmental reserve left. Apparently Mr Brumby is going to use that water. The extraordinary thing is that Minister Garrett, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in this place, has made this pipeline a controlled action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. He has quite categorically made one of the conditions the fact that the environmental reserve is not to be used to push water down the pipeline to Melbourne. So we are wondering what is going on. Why are Minister Garrett's EPBC conditions being ignored? What is the power of the EPBC if it can be so actively flouted? Then we have the so-called ‘superpipe' taking water out of that same system via Waranga Basin to Bendigo. Sadly, this pipeline was pushed through, again like the north-south pipeline, without any environmental, economic cost-benefit analysis whatsoever. The pipe was pushed are through so fast that technically it is a very unsatisfactory conduit for water. It leaks. Coliban has acknowledged that. They said, ‘Yes, it does leak, but it's not dirt building up in it; it's just organic matter.' The farmers whose properties this pipeline goes through have been quite interested in having their billabongs and low points filled with the leaking water over the drought periods of summer, but now they are much more concerned that they cannot crop their country because of the leaking pipeline and the disturbed ground which runs along the surface over this pipeline, where it has been buried. This land is now not farmable. They cannot efficiently farm their properties because there is a real problem of lack of compaction and such poorly laid pipes that their farms left have become divided by this easement running through them. They have gone to Colireban and asked for compensation. Of course, Coliban has refused to talk to them. We have a real problem. Coliban has a real problem and they are saying, ‘We'll do another pipe but this time we'll stick it at the top of the Waranga Basin. That way we can get even more water out of the system than the 100 megalitres we take each day at the moment.' The Eildon Dam and the GoulburnMurray system in the Murray-Darling basin cannot supply Bendigo, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Kyneton and a number of Loddon River towns, as well as Melbourne and Geelong, but that is the expectation of the Brumby led government. This is environmental vandalism and it is destroying the agricultural, water security and food bowl future for constituents in northern Victoria. You do not have food security when you have no water security. There are 23 food manufacturing enterprises in the area who will lose their workforce and the transport sector that serves them. This is an extraordinarily serious problem which has been totally ignored by this government. The EPBC Act should have been operative and brought the Brumby government to heel, but it appears to be completely powerless. (Time expired) Budget",164
225,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very proud to be part of the Rudd Labor government which, in the budget yesterday, delivered on increase in the pension. These are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago and are a vital investment in preparing Australia for the future. All 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from the increases in their pension payments. From 20 September 2009, the secure and sustainable pension reforms will deliver increases of $32.49 per week for singles and $10.14 per week combined for couples. From 20 September 2009, total assistance for single pensioners will increase from $304.19 per week to $336.68 per week and for pensioner couples combined from $497.36 per week To $507.50 per week. This increase will bring the single rate of the pension up to two-thirds of the combined couple rate. The base rate of the pension will continue to benefit from benchmarking to wages. The benchmarked rate will increase for singles from 25 per cent to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings-that is, an increase of more than 10 per cent. Being the member of an electorate with one of the highest number of people aged over 65 years in Australia-over 20 per cent of my constituents-I have been advocating long and hard for improvement to the income for pensioners in my electorate. I know that living on a single age pension is very tough. How do I know this? Because my constituents have been telling me at the street corner meetings we hold, at seniors forums, at functions and at meetings in my office. They have not been telling me this just in the last 18 months since we have been in government; they were telling me this for the years we were in opposition. This is not something which has just happened; this has been around for a long time. Let us contrast the decision of yesterday's budget with the record of the former coalition government, which, in 11 long years did nothing to address the inequity for single pensioners. In 11 long years, the former Howard government allowed the pension rate to stay low and squandered the opportunity to support pensioners in an entirely different economic climate. Not only that, but the opposition have been acting with mock indignation regarding the pension rise. Last year around this time, after the budget, they attempted to ram a pension bill through parliament and that was just for political point scoring because they had 11 long years in government to do something about pensions. So why did it suddenly become an issue for the now opposition after a Labor government was elected? Because they wanted to use pensioners as pawns in their political games. The preface of the opposition's pension bill stated: Assistance for single age pension is an immediate priority due to the urgent circumstances facing many recipients struggling to cope with escalating costs of living. You cannot tell me that pensioners and pensioner groups were not raising their concerns in the whole 11 years when the now opposition were in government, but all of a sudden it was an issue for them because Labor was in government. To use a quote after the mock bill was defeated, the opposition spokesman on ageing had the following to say: The contempt shown by this Labor government towards senior Australians is beyond belief. The Howard government did nothing for pensioners for the entire 11 years.",166
