In Committee of Ways and Means: 'Consideration resumed from the 28th November, 1935, on motion hy Mr. That . . . the schedule to the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 1933-1984 be amended as followB:And on further motions by Mr WHITS (vide pages 444 and 760)That . . . the schedule . . . be further amended as follows:",14
43,Mr WHITE,RHINELAND DEMILITARIZED,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.1] - Honor able members will recollect that the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 1933-1934 provides in certain cases for a deduction from the amount of duty payable under the British preferential tariff. The goods to which the deduction applies are those to which protective duties apply, as listed in the schedule to the act. This deduction, while Australian currency is depreciated to the extent of not less than 16§ per cent, in relation to the British country from which the goods are imported, is one-fourth of the amount of duty or 12^ per cent, of the value for duty, whichever is the less. When the nurroncy depreciation is less than 16J per cent., but not less than 11 1-9 per cent, the deduction is one-eighth of the amount of duty or 6$ per cent, of the value for duty whichever is the less. This deduction was intended to compensate for the protective value of exchange. Since the end of 1933 the Tariff Board in its reports has recommended rates of duty based on present exchange conditions with a corrective increasing the rates gradually as exchange moves towards parity. As the protective value of exchange in each individual industry is influenced by the depesdenco of the manufacturer on imported or exchangeCUSTOMS TARIFF (EXCHANGE affected materials this new method provides a much more satisfactory way of dealing with the problem than the former method. The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) proposals at present before the committee nate from the operation of the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 19331934 those items and parts of items for which provision for exchange fluctuations if now made in the items themselves. I move That the schedule to the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 1033-1934, proposed to be amended, be further as follows:By inserting "" 2 3 4 (A ) except as to goods entered for home consumption on or after the 29th November, 1935, and before the 2nd April, 1930""; and By inserting ""241(c) except as to goods entered for home consumption on or after the 29th November, 1935, and before the 1st April, 1936 "". The goods covered by the items referred to herein, namely, item 234 A, cement, and item 241 o, sanitary and lavatory earthenware, &c., were subject to exchange adjustment under the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 19331934. Since the 29th November, 1935, duties have been provided in the tariff under present exchange conditions in respect of these items, and action was accordingly taken under the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) proposals to omit items 234 A and 241 c from the list of items to which exchange adjustment applies. However, as the result of decisions of the committee when these items were discussed in connection with the Customs Tariff proposals, duties have been imposed which are higher than those considered by the Tariff Board to bo necessary under present exchange conditions. Accordingly, it is proposed that the duties resulting from the committee's decision should again be subject to exchange adjustment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. ADJUSTMENT) BILL 1936. Ordered That Mr White and Sir Henry Gullett do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution.

In Committee of Ways and Means: as Consideration resumed from the 28th amended November, 1935 (vide page 2127, volume 147), on motion by Mr WHITE-!That the schedulo to the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1934 be amended as hereunder set out . . . And on further motion by Mr WHIT E (vide page 760)That the schedule . . . be nrthe'r r amended . . .",15
44,Mr WHITE,RHINELAND DEMILITARIZED,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.6] - Unde r the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) proposals, provision is made for special rates of duty on the following goods of Canadian origin:-Ex . 291, veneers; 323, goloshes, rubber sand boots and shoes and plimsolls; 359, chassis motor vehicles; and 157, barbed wire. Veneers and goloshes produced in Canada were, under the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1934, admitted at (vide page 444)rates higher than the British preferential rate, but IOWCT than the general tariff amendedrate. Alterations have been made in the rates of duty under the British .preferential and general tariff rates, and the proposal preserves the rolativity of the Canadian duty. In the case of chassis, no alteration the rate of duty is proposed, but the verbiage of the item has 'been altered somewhat to agree with the item under the British preferential and general tariffs. In regard to barbed wire, Canada .has hitherto been entitled to the British preferential tariff. In its report which was in Byits omitting tabled today, the Tariff Board has recommended free admission of barbed wire from the United Kingdom, and, in the case of Canadian wire, a rate of 50s. per ton with a corrective for exchange fluctuations. The proposal before the committee gives effect, to this recommendation, and I may say that the Canadian Government has signified its moveagreement to this departure from the confollowing ditions originally existing. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. CUSTOMS TARIF F (CANADIAN PREFERENCE) 1936.

45,Mr FORDE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENTS,"Capricornia) [11.11] - I That the item be amended by adding the to paragraph (1) of sub-item (a): And on and after 3rd April, 1930(1) Iii the manufacture of which all tlK> tobacco leaf used is Australian grown-pe r lb., 3s. I move this because I think that it would be in the interests of the tobacco industry if the Government agreed to the reduction proposed. It would give a preferential margin of Is.. 6d. per lb. on all Australian leaf used; that is, the excise duty would be 43. 6d. per lb. on tobacco made from imported leaf, and 3s. per lb. on tobacco made from and Australian-grown leaf. The required revenue could be maintained by an additional flat rate of 6d. per lb. excise on the manufactured product,, which flat rate co-aid be made a revenue adjuster to be .raised or lowered as more or less revenue was required.",16
46,Mr WHITE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENTS,That would raise the juice to the smoker.,17
47,Mr FORDE,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENTS,"Tb e Minister would be .able to ensure the Government receiving .us much revenue as was received last year. 'This would allow of blending to get the best smoking results, and would stimulate .the use and sale of Australian leaf, thus mutually benefiting growers and consumers. In Canada, excise is levied on the leaf going into manufacture, and a duty concession is allowed on tobacco containing not less than 50 per cent, locally-produced leaf. When a differential excise was first proposed the Government raised the objection of difficulty of administration in that most of the tobaccoes were composite, .and excise was collected on the manufactured tobacco. For instance, a tobacco made from 50 per cent, imported, and 50 per eent. Australian leaf would be as much imported as Australian. The proposed scheme of leaf excise gets over that difficulty, and would be simple to administer. In 1934-35, some 17,000,000 lb. of leaf, valued at £1,300,000, was imported, about 10,340,000 lb. of which, valued at £1,242,000, came from the United States of America. The bulk of this leaf could be grown here, and the money kept in Australia giving much needed employment directly and indirectly. In the opinion of the Australian Tobacco Growers Association, the recent reduction by 8d. per lb. of the excise on tohacco made wholly from Australian leaf is of little benefit. In practically all countries where tobacco is manufactured it has been found essential to blend the leaf in order to obtain the best results. Australia is no exception to that rule. The restriction of the reduction to tobacco which is 100 per cent. Australian eliminates large quantities of good quality Australian leaf which is blended with imported leaf. The following official statistics for Australia for the year 1934-35 may interest, honourable members; and will prove that the preferential rate of excise duty, giving Australian growers an advantage of Is. Od. per lb., could be put into operation without serious lo3S of revenue:- ; Loaf used la manufacture (stemmed).

The scheme suggested and approved by the Tobacco Growers Association overcomes difficulties of administration previously raised 'by the Government against differential excise duties. Price adjustments could be passed on to consumers. Increases made in import duties on leaf have invariably been passed on, composite brands going up in price according to the percentage of imported leaf contained in them. Price reductions can likewise be passed on. Revenue would be safeguarded, while preference on Australian leaf would stimulate the use of that leaf, and the sale of tobacco containing it, mutually benefiting growers and conof sumers. The suggested scheme for differential excise duties in regard to manufactured tobacco provides for an exciso duty of 4s. 6d. per lb. on imported leaf, and per lb. on Australian leaf, and, in addiago. tion, a flat rate of 6d. per lb. on the manufactured product. Taking the figures which I have given for 1934-35 as a for calculation, we find that the excise duty on the imported leaf-9,008,00 0 lb. proposals. at 4s. 6d - woul d return a net revenue of £2,026,800. The 3,210,000 lb. of Australian leaf used, which would be subject an excise duty of 3s. per lb., would £481,500. The flat rate of 6d. per lb. 11,866,000 lb. would yield £296,650, whilst the excise of 7s. per lb. on the 4,766,000 lb. of tobacco manufactured into cigarettes would give a net return of £1,668,100. Under the differential scheme the net revenue from excise would total £4,473,050, on the basis of the 1934-35 figures. In addition to the revenue the import duty of 3s. 6d. per on 9,008,000 lb. of imported leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco would return £1,576,400 and, in addition, 4,486,000 Lb. of cigarette leaf at 5s. per lb. would yield £1,158,883, making the total net revenue from import duties £2,735,233, which, added to the revenue from excise, gives a grand total of £7,208,333. The calculations do not clude revenue from exciso on cigar leaf, or from the import duty on tobacco, cigarettes and cigars imported in the manufactured state. The suggested scheme would return to the Government about £700,000 more than the £6,500,000 which the Tariff Board considers is a of reasonable impost to place on the tobacco industry. Moreover, it would overcome the administrative difficulties advanced previously by the Government as a reason for not imposing a differential excise duty. Price adjustments could be passed on to consumers. Increases of import duties tobacco leaf have invariably been passed on to consumers, the prices of composite brands rising in proportion to the perposal centage . of imported leaf contained in them. Price reductions also could be passed on. The revenue would be safenot guarded, whilst preference on Australian Mr Forde. thus leaf would stimulate its use, and the sab the tobacco containing it, thus benefiting both growers and consumers. I submit that this scheme would give a stimulus to the industry which received a setback when the present Government unscientifically meddled with the protective3s. duties which were imposed some years This subject transcends party politics, basis and I appeal to honourable members,, irrespective of party, to support my",17
48,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"New England) to [11.21] - I support the proposal of thereturn Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. on Forde), and hope that the Government will see its way to accept the scheme outlined by him. The honourable member has shown how most of the difficultieswhich now confront this industry could, be overcome. I cannot understand why these duties should be singled out to be made a party issue. According to theSydney Morning Herald, the Minister for lb. Trade and Customs (Mr White) claims that the Government does not regard the tariff as a party issue, and did not whip members in regard to it. I hope that 2d. that means the Government has changed its views in regard to tobacco. If it does not, the tobacco-growers will know that this is the only tariff item which the Government treats as a party issue, and they inwill have to decide which party, or parties, they will support in future. The Government is forcing them to view this subject from that angle. In my opinion the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not go far enough. I should like to see a differential reduction the rate of excise by at least 2s. per lb. Had the Minister accepted the proposal made in this chamber recently, by which another £200,000 or £300,000 could have been obtained from import duties on tobacco, he could easily have agreed to a differential reduction of the excise duty on by 2s.. per lb. He refused to accept that proposal, however, and now I suppose he will tell us .that the present procannot be accepted - because it would mean a substantial loss of revenue to the Government. , I am afraid that we canexpect the Minister to agree to the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, although I am not entirely without hope that he will adopt a reasonable attitude. I have no wish to refer to recent happenings, other than to say that there is evidence that a section of government supporters will not always make loyalty to the Government their first consideration. In'' regard to this item, however, the supporters of the Government are loyal to a man, and will not listen to any argument advanced in opposition to the Government's proposals. Apparently, they are not concerned with the interests of the growers, although unimpeachable evidence that those interests are being prejudiced has been placed before them. In view of the mental olasticity shown by a number of Government supporters in regard to other tariff items, which resulted in the Government being humiliated, there is a clear precedent for them to follow in regard to the duties on tobacco. If they fail to stand by the tobacco-growers it will bo only because of some reason which, as yet, is hidden from other honourable members.",18
49,Mr JTOUDB,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,One - good turn deserves another; the Country party stuck to the Government when the duties on cement and earthenware were under consideration.,19
50,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"I was pleased to notice in the last budget that tha Government had receded from its previous attitude of opposition to differential rates of excise on Australian tobacco. I said then that, although the growers would appreciate the reduction by 8d. per lb. of the excise on tobacco manufactured wholly from Australian leaf, in my opinion the reduction was not enough, and was more in the nature of a friendly gesture than a real contribution to .the industry. Since then eight or nine months have elapsed, and there is evidence that my prediction 'was right, for the industry has not improved in the meantime. Indeed, the . number of growers has declined considerably, and there has been an enormous reduction of the area under crop-fro m 16,000 acres to 8,000 acres in twelve months. It may be claimed that a 50 per cent, reduction of the acreage under tobacco is due to the prevalence of blue mould and other diseases, and to climatic difficulties; but the growers have always been faced with such difficulties and accept them more or less philosophically. For a number of years the industry has averaged only one good crop in three, and for that reason the margin of protection given to it should be greater than to those in which the return is more regular and the profit more assured. .That aspect of the industry has not been fully considered by those who maintain that it is the most highly-protected in Australia. When the customs duties on tobacco were under consideration recently we asked for a small increaseof the import duty in order to provide between £200,000 and £300,000 additional revenue which - would go to make up for any loss arising out of a differential reduction of the excise duty, but the Government rejected that proposal. Consequently now, although it would entail a considerable loss of revenue, we are forced to ask for that reduction of the excise duty without any corresponding increase of the import duty.",19
51,Mr HOLLOWAY,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,It might not entail any loss.,19
52,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,I . shall he surprised if the Minister does not bring forward evidence to prove that it would do so.,19
53,Mr HOLLOWAY,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,A little imported leaf is used for blending in all tobacco put on the Australian market.,19
54,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"But I am assuming that a - differential excise duty in favour of 100 per cent. Australian tobacco would be continued. Indeed, I am of opinion that if it were given sumcient differentiation in excise, the Australian leaf would not need to be blended with imported leaf. The margin of advantage it now has is only equal to about 4d. per lb. spread over the whole quantity used in the manufacture of tobacco. It is too insignificant to be of much use to the growers. If the Government would give the industry real assistance it would give the growers a reduction of excise rates by, say, 2s. per lb. on 100 per cent. Australian tobacco for a five-year period. The Government, however, is unwilling to give the Australian industry that chance; it places the Australian leaf on the same price margin as imported brands, with the result that the cultivated prejudice against the use of Australian tobacco brings about large purchases of the muchadvertised imported brands. Australian brands are not advertised to any extent, but colossal sums of money are spent in advertising well-known and popular imported brands. If the Government would assist the Australian industry in the way I have suggested, it would have the effect of removing this issue from the political arena. The Australian tobacco industry has been, as it were, a running sore in Commonwealth politics for a number of years, and on several - occasions Ministers have barely escaped defeat on their proposed tobacco duties. It is true that Ministers have to consider not only the interests of a few growers, but also those of a big smoking public; but I contend that the smoking public is interested in the successful establishment of the tobacco-growing industry. Indeed, it was demonstrated during yesterday's debate on the motion submitted by the honourable member for Plinders (Mr Fairbairn) that people of Australia view with concern a continuance of Australia's unfavorable trade balance with the United States of America, from which country most of the tobacco used in ' Australia comes. Knowing that Australian growers can produce good leaf, the people of Australia are asking why we should continue to import about 90 per cent, of our tobacco requirements. If the issue before people today were whether they would be in favour of shutting out imported tobacco, I am sure that they would be overwhelmingly in favour of using Australian-grown tobacco leaf. Not many years ago the same issue arose in South Africa where, in consequence of the cultivated prejudice against the local tobacco being so great that the South African growers could not get a footing in their own market, the Union - Government imposed an embargo on the importation of tobacco for five years. At the end of that period, when the embargo was lifted, the people had become so accustomed to smoking the local tobacco that there was no increase of importations and I feel that the same result would follow if the Commonwealth Government would adopt a similar plan and say that for five years, Mr Thompson. by cheapening the local product, it would give the Australian industry a chance to establish itself firmly in the Australian market - Instead of the Australian industry being compelled to compete against the much-advertised imported tobacco on an almost level footing, we should give it an excise margin of say Is. 6d. oi2s. a lb. That would put it on its feet. The Government has given honourable members no information in regard to the effect of these proposals on the revenue. Some time ago the Minister said that he was watching the position, but was not able to say whether the estimate of the Treasurer had been realized-that the loss arising from the differential cut of 8d. per lb. would be £90,000 a year. As the Treasurer's estimate must have been largely guess-work, honourable members are entitled to know the exact result. At the same time a reduction of the excise on tobacco used in the manufacture of cigarettes by 6d. per lb. was estimated to involve a loss of revenue of £25,000, the but we. were told that the manufacturers would pass that on to the consumers. They have not done so and the Government has no means of compelling them to do so. The quality of the cigarettes placed on the Australian market by the tobacco combine today is exactly the same as before the excise cut of 6d. was made. It is very inferior. These cigarettes are greatly the over-rated, and it should be possible for a good Australian cigarette to be put on the market which would enjoy a great deal of popularity among smokers generally. Figures which have been placed at my disposal-the y are not official and therefore may be subject to correction-revea l that the actual revenue loss involved in the reduction of the excise duty on cigarettes by 6d. per lb. has proved to be something like £119,000. That calculation is based on the quantity of cigarettes manufactured during the last twelve months. If these figures are correct, the Treasurer's estimate was sadly astray. The Government should withdraw this unnecessary gift to the manufacturers of Australia and divert it to the tobacco-growers. There was no necessity for it. If the £25,000 had been applied in respect of tobacco made from Australian leaf, the Government could have reduced the excise duty on it by Is. per lb. There is no evidence that the reduction of 6d. has been, of any benefit to the smoking public. I do not think that the revenue position which existed when the Treasurer made his estimate prevails today. The Government is obtaining at least £6,000,000 from tobacco duties annually and, in ' the opinion of the Tariff Board, that is considered to be a fair thing. There IB no justification for the Government to adopt this measly policy of making a cut of 8d. in the excise on Australian tobacco, which has to stand on its own merits in competition with imported leaf. Spread over the whole industry it represents a differentiation of only 4d. per Ib. and is of no value to it. It is merely a friendly gesture on the part of the Government, which is quite unnecessary because at the end of the year the industry will be in a worse position than ever. To-day, there are 2,000 tobacco-growers, and 50 per cent, less land is under cultivation, but more than half the growers are not selling their product. The industry has been delivered a knockout blow by the shilly-shallying policy of this Government during the last four or five years. The only way to display genuine friendliness for this industry is to guarantee it security over a definite period. I suggest that the Government should accept the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) and formulate a policy which will remain unaltered for atleast five years. I feel sure that if this were done and a sound policy were adopted, future Governments would continue it. Every honourable member knows that I have been an advocate for this industry ever since I have been a member of Parliament, not because I hold any venomous spite against the tobacco combine, but because I consider that Australia is entitled to this additional primary producing industry, the success of which is jeopardised by the operations of the tobacco combine. This Parliament is the only authority vested with sufficient power to clip the wings of the tobacco combine, but, except for a brief period, it has consistently refused to do so. By chopping and changing its policy, and by refusing to take the industry seriously, it has made it impossible for any man to regard tobacco growing as a safe economic investment. Though many people have lost considerable sums of money in this industry, the combine has continued to exploit the market profitably. Farmers and storekeepers have lost heavily. I know one man who has lost thousands of pounds as a result of his belief that this Government would do the right thing by the growers. Many storekeepers in the tobacco-growing districts have hundreds of pounds worth of tobacco left on their hands.",19
55,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,It cannot be good leaf.,21
56,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,The Minister will keep on making that assertion. The trouble is that there is only one effective buyer in the Commonwealth and that that buyer has been given a privileged position by reason of our protective policy.,21
57,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,There are other buyers.,21
58,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"The other buyers who are operating are not substantial purchasers, and are, in fact, being driven out of the industry by the tobacco combine, - which picks and chooses the tobacco it will buy. ""When the Minister was speaking yesterday on another matter, he said that local growers were producing only 25 per cent, of the tobacco consumed in Australia, the remainder being obtained from the United States of America. What the honourable gentleman should have said, was that we could produce all the tobacco needed here, but that the policy of the Government would not permit more than 25 per cent, of it to be provided from local sources. The honourable gentleman has twisted and turned so frequently in the course of his speeches on the tobacco industry, that it is difficult to find any consistency in his remarks. But the plain fact is that if the Government would alter its policy, a degree of security which is now lacking would be afforded to this industry. As many people have been ruined through investing money in tobacco-growing, I trust that we shall find a sufficiently large number of honourable members with an Anstralian outlook to accord this industry the support that it should receive. A proper understanding of the needs of the cement manufacturing and lavatory equipment manufacturing industries by a number of honourable members forced the Government to accord reasonable protection to them, and I sincerely trust that proper steps will be taken to cause the Government to proteot the Australian tobacco industry to such an extent that we shall not be obliged to continue to obtain 75 per cent, of our requirements from America, where tobacco is grown by negro labour. Our own white Australian farmers and storekeepers should be given a chance to overcome the disabilities forced upon them by the Australian tobacco monopoly.",21
59,Mr MARTENS,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Herbert) [11.47] - I support the amendment. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) said, by interjection, a few moments ago that more than one buyer was operating in Australia. That is true in one sense, but in actual fact only one effective buyer is operating, and that buyer regulates the price of tobacco. Had the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), on previous occasions, supported with his vote speeches of the kind that he has just delivered, the tobacco growers would now be in a better position. The honourable gentleman has delivered similar speeches on other occasions, but has not supported his speech with his vote.",22
60,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"That is absolutely untrue. I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member for Herbert entitled to misrepresent me and deliberately misconstrue my remarks?  The honourable member has not raised a point of order, but I request the honourable member for Herbert to confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.",22
61,Mr MARTENS,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"What I said about the honourable memher for New England was by the way. It is quite true that many people have lost large sums of money through investments in the Australian tobacco-growing industry. They were led to believe that the Government would adequately protect the industry at least during the period when it was becoming firmly established in the Commonwealth ; but in actual fact the Government has placed intolerable burdens upon the tobacco-growers, and also deprived them of the degree of protection which they enjoyed when the Scullin Government was in office. It is of little use for the Minister to assert that all commercially usable tobacco has been sold, for I know differently. I believe, like the honourable member for New England that the reductions proposed in the schedule now before the committee are simply a gesture which will be of very little value to the tohacco-growerB. We know that all tobacco manufacturing countries import, a certain quantity f 0 tobacco for blending purposes. Even in the United States of America, where tobacco has been grown for more than 300 years, some tobacco is imported for blending purposes. The position of Australia, however, is very different, for the policy of the Government .permits the great bulk of our tobacco to bo imported. That is a state of affairs that we desire to remedy. The .figures submitted to the Government by the Deputy Leader of the  that adequate assistance can be given to the Australian tobacco-growers without endangering the revenue. Certain honourable members of the Country party stated that the Minister for Trade and Customs had given a definite promise that when the excise duties were under consideration adequate protection would 'be provided for the local tobacco-growers, but the schedule now before us is sadly deficient.",22
62,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,The Government is continually studying the problem of differential excise duties.,22
63,Mr MARTENS,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"It was the Deputy  son) who stated that the Minister for Trade and Customs had given a 'promise that reasonable protection would be given to the tobacco-growers, when the excise duties were under consideration. I know that the Minister has denied that such a promise was made.",22
64,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,I gave no promise of the kind referred to.,22
65,Mr MARTENS,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"The Minister has said that he cannot accept the amendment because of the detrimental effect it would have on the revenue; but I submit that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has indicated clearly that no detrimental revenue results would follow. The Australian tobacco industry could, with a reasonable degree of protection, provide very much more employment than it provides at present. Practically all the tobacco required for local use could be grown in this country. I definitely deny that all commercially usable tobacco grown locally is purchased by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, which is the only effective buyer in the Commonwealth. I have in my electorate a small establishment in - which handmade tobacco is manufactured, and I have been informed by the proprietor, Mr. Bayliss, that it is utterly impossible for him to buy, at the Townsville tobacco sales, the leaf that he desires to buy, because the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has first call on the market, and reserves all the best quality leaf for itself. This huge organization can do that kind of thing, because it hasan abundance of capital behind it. Yet the Minister continues to tell us, apparently expecting us to believe him, that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company is acting in the best interests of the growers. Unfortunately, a great quantity of really good leaf is left on the hands of the growers. The Tobacco Investigation Committee was informed that, if growers made complaints concerning the treatment meted out to them by the British-Australasia Tobacco Company, they were, subjected to a kind of duress. Some of the men who made complaints found that, in the following year, they were unable to sell even. a pound of tobacco leaf to the BritishAustralasia Tobacco Company: That, I submit, is unfair treatment. I sincerely trust that the Government will give earnest consideration to the merits of the' amendment, for it provides the very minimum of protection necessary to ensure the progress of this important industry.",22
66,Mr BLAIN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Northern Territory) [11.55] - I shall not delay the committee many minutes, for I do not wish to reiterate the arguments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in support of the amendment. I shall examine the subject from a slightly different angle from that of the mover of the amendment. I offer a strong protest against the flippancy of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) and the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties (Sir Henry Gullett), in dealing with certain Australian industries which merit the protection of this Parliament. The tobacco industry is a "" winner "" and it could be extended very greatly. Millions of acres of land in North Australia, at present unused, are suitable for tobacco-growing. Both climatic and soil considerations ensure that good tobacco leaf could be grown on that land. We shall be forced to do more to promote the economic occupation of our second-class tropical lands, the soils of which, according to the industry, are the only types suitable for the production of high-grade leaf. While it is true that tobacco is being grown on some unsuitable areas in the south, it is also true that a great deal of suitable tobacco-growing country is available in the north where the climate is dry and the atmosphere appropriately humid during the growing period. The soil is eminently suitable for tobacco growing. A grower who is permitted to operate in an obviously unsuitable district is a menace to northern development. This Parliament should take steps to encourage the settlement of these northern areas by men capable of growing good marketable tobacco; then the combine would be obliged to buy the leaf on sheer merit. I admit that many good tobacco growing districts are to be found in the south; but, today, science is the handmaiden of the tobacco-growers. If we also apply human sanity to this industry, progress is certain. It appears, however, that we have developed a kind of bovine mentality in connection with it. The only things that will help us are science and sanity acting together. If we desire to show ourselves as real Australians, we should take steps to encourage the settling of onr tropical regions by capitalizing the few crops that are suitable. I was intrigued by the suggestion of the honourable member for Now England (Mr. Thompson), that we should follow the example of the South Africans. In the sister dominion, the Africanders have been encouraged to develop the tobacco-growing industry, and there is every-reason why Australians should be encouraged to develop the Australian tobacco-growing industry. If the Minister were a real Australian, with an Australian outlook, he would do his best to foster this industry. I do not, of course, wish to cast any slurs upon the honourable gentleman.",23
67,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"If the honourable member for the Northern Territory is a real Australian, I do not wish to be one.",24
68,Mr BLAIN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"I fear the Minister has misconstrued my remarks. I have no desire to be rude. I am suggesting that we should be broad in our outlook on this industry. The suggestion of the honourable member for New England, that an' embargo should be placed on the importations of tobacco for live years in order to develop the local industry, is worth consideration, but this could only be brought about gradually. It may be true that we do not yet understand all the secrets of blending tobacco; but we certainly know enough to produce a good article. I have been in touch with many tobacco-blenders who are also tobacco growers. In Darwin I have mot some of these men who have been in Cairo, the home of tobacco-blending, Greece, and other important tobacco-blending centres.",24
69,Mr CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,Order ! The honourable member should be aware that the subject of blending is not involved in this discussion.,24
70,Mr BLAIN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"I am endeavouring to demonstrate how insufficient is the excise to put the industry upon a sound footing. The Government should pay the closest attention to the recommendations of Dr Dickson, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. If there were a graduated tariff imposition culminating in five years in an embargo against importations of tobacco the local industry would be established in a similar fashion to the motor industry and its problems would be solved. Manufacturers would take advantage of the protection, factories would be erected, and skilled blenders would be brought to the country, introducing the secrets of Vending known only to them. This information, I regret to say, is now being utilized by the tobacco industry in an endeavour to prove that Australia cannot grow suitable leaf; but I contend that millions of acres are eminently suited to this purpose. I am confident that honourable members who aim at being real Australians realise that truth.",24
71,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade aud Customs) [12.1] - The Government regrets that it cannot accept this amendment. During the last three years it has made a very careful survey of the tobacco-growing industry, and has done much to foster it. Honourable members are aware that the provision of an annual grant for encouraging cultural work has been of considerable assistance to it. A definite improvement of the quality of the leaf has been achieved, so much so that 50 per cent, of the leaf now grown in Australia can be considered to be - high-grade. The Government haB raised the import duty by 6d. per lb., and has reduced the excise by 8d. per lb. on pure Australian leaf and Is. 4d. per lb. on that for the use of aborigines. Perhaps I should ignore the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain), but in view of his reiteration of the words ""real Australian,"" I cannot let his speech pass without some comment. The honourable member sets himself up as one who has an intimate knowledge of the industry; he shows inordinate presumption for one who has never been heard of in it before. I point out to him that the action of this Administration in reducing the excise on tobacco for distribution among aborigines, has been of immense advantage to the Northern Territory. Yet the honourable member made no reference in - his speech to that aspect; perhaps he had not heard about it. Oi' is itthat the aborigines have no vole3? News travels slowly in those distant parts. He is noted here for taking up any catch-cry in the press",24
72,Mr CHAIRMAN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,Order !,24
73,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"In regard to the policy of the Government, I made a complete statement during the discussion of the item previously on the import duty. The Government believes in offering every possible assistance to the tobacco-growing industry, and will take every measure to ensure the sale of all good quality leaf.. Action is taken every year in that connection.",24
74,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,There is difficulty in obtaining a market for some of that leaf.,25

77,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"I mean from bright mahogany upwards., The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has suggested the imposition of a lower excise on all purely Australian tobacco, and he put forward a scheme whereby no loss of revenue would be incurred through the adoption of his proposal. I am not satisfied with his figures bnt I am prepared to analyse them. If the scheme does nor. bring in the difference of revenue, and he suggests raising the excise on the whole of the used",25
78,Mr FORDE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"I suggested putting an additional duty of 6d. per lb. on all manufactured tobacco, which could be made a revenue adjuster, and that the excise on Australian leaf used in manufacture should be reduced from 3s. lOd. to 3s. per lb.",25
79,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"T n my opinion, that scheme would raise the price to the smoker. The essence of the Government's proposal- a reduction of Sd. per lb - wa s that the benefit of - id. per lb. could be passed on to the smoker; and, in the majority of casus, that has been done.",25
80,Mr FORDE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,What about the Australian leaf used for blending purposes?,25
81,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Severa l honourable members have mentioned applying the reduction to blended leaf, but I fail to see how such a system could work in the event, say, of 10 per cent, of American leaf being blended with the Australian. No concession on that basis could be passed on to the smoker.",25
82,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"The reduction of 8d. per lb. really amounts to only 4d. per lb. when spread over the whole of the Australian crop, if the leaf for blending purposes is excluded from benefiting from the reduction.",25
83,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"That is so. The Government budgeted to forgo £90,000 of revenue in order to make this reduction, and it is working out that way. The honourable member in this connection should see a reply which I gave to the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. MCEwen) in this House recently. The concession granted to aborigines involves another £3,000. These facts were amply traversed when the committee discussed the import duty. I believe the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) has suggested a prohibition of imports.",25
84,Mr THOMPSON,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,No . I merely mentioned that. South Africa imposed an embargo. I did not suggest that there should be an embargo here.,25
85,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Then it must have been the honourable member for the Northern leaf Territory (Mr Blain) who made the suggestion. I point out to him that Australia is capable of producing only one-quarter of the tobacco required for use in the Commonwealth. The honourable member, however, speaks airily about factories being dotted about the country and about prohibiting all importations. If his suggestion were adopted, the trade would have difficulty in carrying on, and unemployment would immediately be created. The Government has gone a long way in granting concessions to assist the industry in a cultural way, and by increasing import duties and reducing the excise. At present it is prepared to go no further, but it will observe how the present system is working. If other concessions are possible, it will make them. Every government desires that eventually Australia will be in a position to supply, if not the whole, at least the bulk of the tobacco required in the Commonwoalth. But it, must be a gradual process; the present Government docs not propose to repeat the mistake of inviting men into disaster, as was done by another administration by imposing excessive import duties.",25
86,Mr RIORDAN,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"Kennedy) [32.8] The statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) that previous governments had invited people into disaster when they protected this industry was quite uncalled for. That, disaster would not have occurred had it not been for the fact that the Government, of which he is a member, increased the excise and removed the margin of protection that was given to this industry. The blending of tobaoco, I consider, cannot be discussed with any degree of authority by laymen, but I venture to say that if necessary Australia could produce a variety of tobacco leaf in the tropics and the southern areas that should lend itself admirably to blending. An all-Australian brand of tohacco now put on the market is the QLD, but it is difficult to purchase it in any of the country districts. Blending, however, should not be one of the considerations vital to the conduct of the industry-. The Minister stated that, if the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) were carried, the price of tobacco would be increased to the public. The manufacturers of tobacco in Australia publish their share and profit lists; if the Government is desirous of protecting the public, it should take action against this profiteering, instead of against the growers.'. Honourable members have spoken at great length about profiteering by secondary industries. I noticed that, when the fate of the secondary industries was at stake, a number of honourable members who support the Government were prepared to rush to the aid of the masses living in and around the closely-populated manufacturing centres. But when the existence of 5,000 primary producers, who have no lobbyists to state their case, is in jeopardy, the matter becomes one of minor importance with them. I hope that the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), who is the whip of the Country party, will be successful in persuading members of that party to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In regard to the quality of Australian leaf, I consider that it could be manufactured tomorrow into a smokeable tobacco, and the Australian' smoker, if other brands were not available, would adapt himself to the Australian-grown product. Australia were to take the same stand as South Africa has done, and give the manufacturers five years in which to establish the industry, I venture to say Mr Riordan. that afterwards no imported leaf would be smoked in Australia. The honourable member for the Northern Territory' (Mr Blain) stated that the margin of protection should be greater; the honourable memher for New England, I think, made the same remark in connection with excise. If .the Government is not prepared to go to the length of imposing an embargo, some consideration should be given to a rebate of portion of the excise to the man who is prepared to grow a saleable leaf. If that policy were followed, as was done with the sugar-growing industry when it was is its infancy, the tobacco-growing industry would be given an opportunity to find its feet. After all, the judge of the quality of the leaf is the buyer; there is no other authority to decide it. If the Australian tobaccogrower received the same consideration as that which was given to the grower in New Zealand, the Commonwealth would be able to supply all of its own requirements, and the Government would lose no revenue thereby. The embargo as a suggestion to place the industry upon a solid footing could also he introduced without incurring any great loss of revenue to the Government. At the end of five years I do not think it would be necessary to grant the industry any protection; the grower of leaf would have established the industry, and the Australian smoking public would have acquired a taste for the local product. Tho honourable member for New England has shown that five years after the imposition by South Africa of an embargo upon the importation of tobacco into that dominion, the whole of its consumption was of local production. This industry provides a good deal of employment, and would materially assist in solving the problem of both child and adult labour. Instead of imposing a wage tax, primary industries should be developed first for local consumption and then, if possible, for export. The Government of New Zealand guaranteed to the tohacco-groweTS If of that dominion a certain price for tobacco leaf exported. If a higher price is obtained in London, the grower benefits correspondingly. The reduction of the excise suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would give to the local grower a preference of Is. 6d. per lb. over the imported leaf. That is not too much to ask. The acreage under - production has dropped-hy more than 50 per cent, since the alteration of the duties imposed by the Scullin Government. Practically half the growers have lost theircapital and have gone out of production, not as the result of blue mould, hut on account of the activity of a parasite which attacked the industry when the present Government came into power.",25
87,Mr WHITE,APPLICATION OF SCHEME TAKING ABOVE,"That is not correct. Mr EIOEDAfN"" - The evidence available proves that, while the Scullin duty operated, the Australian leaf found a ready market. The production in the last year of its operation totalled 10,000 lb. The best test to apply to the policy of the present Government is the production today. The political plea which is always made is that the consumer m i l be affected.. The consumer can he protected by attacking the large profits made by the manufacturers, who felt no ill effects even during the years of the depression. The opportunity is here presented to members of the Country party to vote in the interests of the primary producer. The reduction sought is not excessive. If they are not sold lock, stock and. barrel to the United' Australia party, and can justifiably claim that they are representative of the primary producer, I ask them to lend their support to this industry. I hope that the amendment will have as ready an acceptance as was experienced by amendments moved in connection with cement and other manufacturing industries. All the investigations prove that 10,0.00 growers would he needed to produce, on small areas, Australia's requirements of tohacco. industry is capable of supporting 30,000 persons, and is) therefore, worthy of every encouragement and support.

NA BILL 1936. Bill brought up by Mr Casey, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",27
88,Mr CASEY,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corio - Treasurer) [12.35] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This hill is a necessary consequence of the proclamation by which the Commonfrom wealth flour tax of £2 12s. 6d. a ton was terminated on 24th February, 1936. The purpose of the bill is to provide for at the termination of the tax. refunds of tax paid on flour held in stock on that date by hakers, storekeepers other persons, who are not flour millers. The bill re-enacts the provisions which were originally enacted for a similar purpose, but which were repealed in following purposes:December last, when the law was amended to provide for the continuance of the flour tax after 6th January, 1936, the original terminating date of the tax. The refund provisions were repealed 'because it was contemplated at the time that the flour tax would continue until the inauguration of the plan for securing a home-consumption price of wheat. The refunding of tax on flour accumulated at a point of time marking both the termination of the flour tax and the commencement of the wheat plan would have resulted in freeing such flour, not only from the flour tax, but also from the burden of the increased price, under the plan, of wheat sold for home consumption. This would have led to a serious dislocation of the wheat and flour markets as the time of transition approached, and also to serious competitive anomalies in the marketing of wheat products after the inauguration of the plan. By dissociating the termination of the flour tax from the inauguration of the wheat plan, these considerations have now lost all significance, and it becomes necessary to restore the original character of the tax as a levy on flour consumed in Australia during the period of its operation, viz., from the 7th January, 1935, to the 24th of February 1936. To do this it is essential to provide for refunds in respect of tax-paid stocks of flour held on the 24th February, 1936, as otherwise the tax would amount to a levy on flour consumed after that date, to the extent of the tax paid on stocks so held. Honourable members will realise, also, that failure to provide for the refund of tax paid on stocks held on the 24th February, 1936, would impose serious competitive burdens on bakers holding considerable stocks of flour on that date, as such bakers, until they exhausted those stocks, would be forced to sell bread made tax-paid flour in competition with bread made from tax-free flour by bakers having little or no accumulation of flour It is estimated that the refunds provided for and by the bill will amount to £100,000. In addition to restoring the repealed refund provisions, the bill contains other more or less related provisions for the (a) To prevent a m-iHer's refunds in respect of bad debts exceeding the tax passed on by him to his purchasers This restriction is necessary in order to meet the position in Tasmania, where millers have obtained refunds under State law in respect of tax not passed on by them. (b) To prevent two refunds being made in respect of the same flour, e.g., a refund to a baker who held flour in stock on the 24th of February, 1936, and a refund to a miller who writes off the sale price of the flour to that baker as a bad debt. (c) To obviate, as far as possible, the necessity to hold up refunds until the miller is fully paid for flour purchased from him by persons who held it in stock on the 24th of February, 1936. This is made possible by providing for millers to give undertakings not to claim refunds for bad debts, and by providing, in otter cases, for refunds to be proportionate to the amounts paid off the millers' account the flour. (d) To enable the amount due as a refund to any person to be set off against any amount owing by that person for tax or penalty under either the Flour Tax Assessment Act, or under any Sales Tax Assessment Act.",28
89,Mr HAWKER,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wakefield) [12.39] I protest as strongly as I can against the practice which has grown up of introducing bills at the very end of a sitting, and passing them through all stages before those members of the community upon noticewho will be affected have an opportunity to study them. This bill could have been circulated, I have no doubt, some days of ago. Copies could then have been sent to sultant ? Melbourne and Sydney so that those conhas2. he cerned might be able to determine the exact effect of the measure, and so that honourable members might learn whether, wealth ? in their opinion, the bill contained anything other than what the Treasurer has led us to expect. We know that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) would not consciously deceive the House, but we have had experience in the past of hasty legislation which has had to be amended almost immedi1931-32, ately because of faulty draughtmanship, £2,958 or because all the relevant facts were before the department concerned at the time the measure was drafted. I have no desire to hamper the Government in putting through its programme of business, but I feel that I must enter my protest against this slipshod introducing legislation at the last moment, and then rushing it through beagreement fore honourable members have even had an opportunity to compare the amending bill with the original act.",29

93,Mr NOCK,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT,"the Minister for Trade method of and Customs, upon noticeW ill Tie advise by what clause of the Ottawa the absence of a specific request from the British Government to refer galvanized iron to the Tariff Board exonerates the Government from its obligation to do so, as provided by article 11, which states, "" That a review shall be made as soon as practicable by the Australian Tariff Board of existing protective duties in accordance with the principles laid down in article 10""?",29
94,Mr WHITE,FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT,"There is no avoidance of an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth Government, as is suggested in the honourable member's question. The last inquiry held by the Tariff Board into galvanized iron was in August, 1932. Whilst there is no clause in the Ottawa agreement which makes reference to the Tariff Board dependent upon a specific request from the British Government, it has, by agreement between the two governments concerned, been the practice of the Government in fulfilling the review provided for in article 11 to give precedence to those items concerning which specific requests have been received.
