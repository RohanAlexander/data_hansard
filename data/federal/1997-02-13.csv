1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. APPROPRIA TION BILL (No.3) 1996-97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIA TION BILL (No.4) 1996-97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1996-97 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 February, on motion by Mr Jull: That the bill be now read a second time.",13
2,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I wish to address my remarks to two appropriations in particular. The first of those concerns the government's plan to construct Sydney's second international airport at Holsworthy, a subject which would interest the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale)-in fact she is so excited she has had to take a seat the mere mention of Holsworthy international airport in her electorate. The second issue is the government's plans for deregulation in the petrol industry. Holsworthy airport has been the major controversy in my electorate and, indeed, throughout the suburbs of the south-west of Sydney. I think the original community reaction was one of disbelief-the idea that, having gone through such an extensive airport debate in Sydney for some 18 months without any mention of a Holsworthy proposition by the coalition, straight after the election it would be on the drawing board. Residents could not believe the deceit and the way in which they had been misled by the coalition with its extensive promises about airports. Thereafter, disbelief has mobilised itself into protests and agitation. An extensive campaign is being launched against the airport and the government's folly in trying to site it at Holsworthy, so close to large residential in the south-west. I want to praise the Macarthur Chronicle newspaper, which covers a large part of my electorate and also the seat of Macarthur, for its active support of local residents in their opposition to this crazy airport scheme. The Macarthur Chronicle launched a phone-in inviting local residents to make known their protest, and the newspaper has asked me to table in the parliament the more than 500 responses that came from residents voicing their opposition to Holsworthy. I also wish to praise, while I am mentioning the depth and strength of community opposition, the work of the South-West Sydney Community Alliance, in particular its chairperson, Mr Jim MCGoldrick, and all the volunteer workers who have done so much to contribute to this campaign, and also the Campbelltown Anti-Airport Committee in my electorate, headed by Mr Leon Warren and all its volunteers who letterbox, hand out at local railway stations and organise community meetings. I suppose there is a feeling in some parts of the community: 'This is such a bad proposition, it couldn't possibly happen.' People are tending to disbelief with regard to the ultimate proposition of Holsworthy airport, but at other residents know that the government would not have this on the agenda unless it was a serious proposition and they have been able to mobilise a huge swag of public opposition to Holsworthy. That opposition is well voiced by the phone-into the Macarthur Chronicle newspaper and the transcript, which I have here, of more than 500 residents ringing into voice their opposition to the airport. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said often that he wants to listen to middle Australia. I can take just a small portion, a representative portion, of the airport hotline remarks to convey to the Prime Minister and also to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) the extent of opposition to this plan. This is what middle Australia in my electorate and also in the seat of Hughes and in the electorate of Macarthur is saying about the government's plan for Holsworthy. Wayne Steveson of Ingleburn rang into the Macarthur Chroniareas cle hotline and said: I reckon John Howard can go and get stuffed with his airport. I voted for him this time, I'll never vote for him again. Wendy Green of Ruse: Mr Howard, you have got to be crazy. I have family living in Wattle Grove and it will absolutely ruin their lives. I think you should be ashamed. Sarah Cadwalin of Bradbury in the electorate of Macarthur: Tell Mr Howard to stick his airport in the middle of a blue ribbon Liberal seat. Vic Chetwertak from Ambarvale: We don't want the airport anywhere near Campbelltown. Just keep it away Mr Howard, you didn't tell us anything about this before the election, throw it on us now. Shoman Maynard of Ambarvale: We don't want the airport in the Macarthur area. That's why we moved up here-it's nice and quiet with no pollution. Marion Anderson in my electorate in the suburb of Ingleburn: I really can't understand how they can even consider putting it here. They must think we're stupid or don't count or something. Jennifer Stucky from Minto Heights: I strongly object to the airport at Holsworthy. I have 4 asthmatic children and this would just be a disaster, we would only be a few kilometres away. Mr Greg O'Brien from the suburb of Glen Alpine: Howard, you're a joke. Our local member John Fahey is a joke. Once again, we're a dumping ground. Steven King of the suburb of St Helens Park: Mr Howard, Paul Keating was right you are hiding the truth from the people of Australia which makes you ... despicable ... That is a representative sample of the views expressed in this transcript of more than 500 people in the south-west of Sydney who have taken the trouble to participate in the Macarthur Chronicle hotline and phone-in campaign against Holsworthy. These local papers have a valuable role in voicing community opposition on major issues, and I am very pleased to accept the invitation of the Macarthur Chronicle newspaper to raise this matter in parliament on their behalf, to seek to table the transcript and to convey to Mr Howard and Mr Sharp the sorts of views that are being expressed throughout the electorate. I now turn to the second issue I wanted to raise: the government's plan for the deregulation of the petrol industry.When the federal government talks about terminal access it only means physical access-the right to purchase wholesale petrol but on terms and conditions dictated by the oil majors. The Trade Practices Act needs to be amended to entrench competitive price access into the laws of the Commonwealth. This would apply the same market principles which the oil majors apply to themselves through the horizontal sharing of terminal facilities. This is the great irony don't of the current market structure-petrol purchased from a BP franchise might actually have been supplied by a Shell terminal. The majors are willing to lower their costs by sharing terminal products between themselves but they will not allow the retail sector to lower its costs through competitive wholesale pricing. Downstream access more than ever is essential to fair competition in the petrol retail sector. Woolworths is presently establishing itself as another vertica-ly integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol. Predictably enough it has also established horizontal alliances with the other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper wholesale petrol they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. The federal government, despite all its election promises, has endorsed the closure of 3,000 service station small businesses with the subsequent loss of some 15,000 jobs in regional Australia. This rationalisation should not proceed on such an un level playing field. This is the purpose of establishing downstream access. Small petrol retailers will not need the resources of a Woolworths and have to establish their own terminal infrastructure to competitively access wholesale petrol. Existing service stations in country towns will have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor. The Senate is considering an amendment this morning which would deliver this legal access right and the basic principles of fair competition for Australia's petrol industry. Those amendments sponsored by the Labor Party in the Senate would shift market power from the large oil multinationals to the small business retail sector and consumers. It is by far the best way for this parliament to deliver cheaper petrol prices to Australian motorists, farmers and businesses. Three days ago I mentioned how these reforms have the potential to lower petrol prices by up to 6c a litre. It is now possible to quantify the benefits beyond the per litre rate. In fact they can be quantified to the extent of $1 billion per annum. That is the cost of the vertically integrated nature of the petrol industry in Australia-$l billion that sits in the coffers of the big petrol companies. By breaking up the vertically integrated control of the industry, that $1 billion surplus would effectively transfer to the pockets of Australian motorists, farmers, tourism operators and industry throughout the country. This is how that $1 billion calculation is arrived at. Each year in Australia motorists purchase approximately 18 billion litres of petrol. Of that, some 75 per cent is sold through franchised service station outlets. The wholesale price of fuel to those franchisees is controlled by the setting of the maximum endorsed wholesale price by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Included in the MEWP is an allowance to the major oil companies of 7.1c per litre for marketing. Freight costs are also set by the ACCC. Franchise service station operators are prohibited from sourcing fuel from other than franchisor oil companies. Franchisees are always charged the highest wholesale price for fuel simply because they are a captive market. That wholesale price is then reflected in the retail price charged to motorists. Under the wholesale price capping the companies are allowed no more than 7.lc per litre for marketing. The companies are not required to demonstrate that this amount, which equates to more than $1 billion, is expended. Ironically, the companies have long sought to increase the amount but it has been contained under price surveillance to that level. However, in the absence of the wholesale price cap companies would seek to and would in practice secure more than 7.1 c per litre through the market. The means of the oil companies achieving this would be through the exclusive supply ties that they have with their franchisees. That is, the wholesale price to franchisees would rise and they would in the absence of being able to source fuel elsewhere have to pass that cost on to motorists. This 7.lc per litre is in effect the cost of vertical integration within the fuel industry. Importantly, the difference between the Woolworths buy price and that of the major oil companies is approximately 8 to 9c per litre. Woolworths' capacity to buy fuel that much cheaper is therefore evidence of the low cost operation of that company. As to the cost of the vertical integration and the tied arrangements in the petroleum industry, that cost might be calculated as follows: eighteen billion litres of fuel are sold to motorists each year; of that, 75 per cent is sold by franchisees-the equivalent of 13.5 billion litres per annum. Oil companies are allowed 7.1c per litre plus freight, so assume an average of 8c per litre excess wholesale price allowance to oil majors-that is, 8c per litre of petrol sold through the pump. The total cost to motorists is $1.08 billion per annum, and that goes to the major petrol companies through the vertical integration and control of this industry. It should be noted further that BP, Shell and Mobil are all foreign owned companies. Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd, while majority Australian owned, is approximately 37.5 per cent foreign owned. Therefore the $1.08 billion vertical integration dividend to the oil companies is not being returned in the main to investors in Australia. Virtually all the profits generated from that dividend are being remitted to head offices overseas, with a consequent impact on our balance of payments. So there is no doubt that major benefits will flow to motorists and petrol consumers throughout Australia from breaking up the vertical integration of this industry-from in fact establishing a downstream access regime. I hope that that is the result of the Senate deliberations this morning. I now tum to ALP price watch and some of the remarks that have been made regarding our campaign by the Ampol company in particular. Ampol has made a number of claims in the media in recent times which need to be challenged and exposed by this parliament. For instance, it has held out terminal access as one of the reforms in which it is engaged but in fact it is offering terminal access for new customers only. Old customers do not get that access right. In practice it has little meaning indeed. Ampol also promised not to increase its prices through the Australia Day long weekend but I noted a shabby practice-a swindle on farmers-in the Young district of New South Wales. While Ampol may have maintained their wholesale price at the midweek level they engaged in a practice in the Young district which should be investigated by the ACCC. Farmers in the Young district, Australia's biggest cherry growing region, in the middle of their harvesting, were being charged more than 80c a litre by Ampol-Caltex for property delivered super petrol while the service station price remained at 77c. Normally the delivery price would be well below the pump price due to bulk purchases that farmers make. Ampol-Caltex was also charging 2c a litre more than the market price for diesel fuel. It is perhaps more than coincidental that the price hike by Ampol-Caltex came at a time when farmers in the Young district needed to consume large amounts of fuel at the peak of the cherry season. Independent fuel distributors explained the increase by pointing to the way in which Ampol subsidised service stations in country towns where Woolworths has started to compete at the pump but then, at the same time, increased the home delivery price to restore its profit margin. This is a worrying trend. If the oil majors are to compete against Woolworths in country towns by slugging farmers by increasing the home delivery price on petrol as an effective cross-subsidisation of their pump price, then that is a practice which needs to be halted. Why should farmers, at the peak of their season, be penalised for the fact that there a new competitor-Woolworths-in the town petrol market? This is matter that National Party members opposite, instead of engaging in chitchat, should be doing something about. It is a shameful thing. Mr Bruce Scott-You had 13 years to do something about it. What hypocrisy!",13
3,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"This is the Australia Day long weekend just passed. You were in government last Australia Day long weekend and you should be aware, as someone who prides himself on being a National Party member, that farmers in the Young district were paying prices 3c and 4c more expensive for home delivered petrol than at the pump in town. Here they are, buying in bulk, and paying more for that practice. This is a business practice engaged in by Ampol, and perhaps other oil majors, which must be halted. Farmers should not be penalised for the fact that Woolworths might be competing at the pump in country towns. Ampol, clearly, was cross-subsidising its town pump price by charging farmers more for their home delivery . We have not heard a word or a peep out of the National Party regarding that practice. Where is the self-styled spokesperson, the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran)? He says a lot of things about petrol, but he is normally apologising for the big petrol companies instead of standing up for the consumer rights of farmers and other primary producers. I turn now to Ampol' s claim to transparency with its fuel prices. It has made a great deal in the public arena of the fact that it is placing its fuel prices on the Internet. Let me explain some of the facts in practice. On Friday, 24 January the average monthly prices posted on the Internet by Ampol were for the month of November 1996, some two months earlier. Thus those prices bear no relation to current retail prices, irrespective of what Ampol may imply it posts on the Internet. There is no transparency. There is no relevance in putting prices on the Internet that are dated by seven to eight weeks. Ampol posts on the Internet average monthly prices for city and country for each state, for the Northern Territory and for the ACT. These is prices are average prices for all Ampol-Caltex sites for a whole month, after the event. These prices are not present retail prices or dealer buying prices on offer; they are historical prices of no relevance or practical use to consumers making a market judgment. Ampol does not post on the Internet actual retail or real wholesale prices at its sites on a daily or other fluctuating basis. All it does is list daily a single national wholesale price which may bear no relationship to transacted prices. These price averages do not reflect the price-volume relationships and very low pricevolume sales locations artificially reduce the more prevailing widespread prices. These posted after-the-event average wholesale prices do not equate to actual retail or wholesale prices experienced by consumers and retailers. In addition, the price list may not equate any other dealer's buying price because of the way in which Ampol's market area pricing system operates. Under this system, an individual dealer's buying price is determined according to prices set by Ampol nominated reference sites in the vicinity of the Ampol dealer. However, the composition of the pool of reference sites is subject to change without reason and does not necessarily include all of the sites in the vicinity of the dealer. Thus a market leader, such as Liberty or Burmah, may not be included and the Ampol dealer may find himself at a competitive disadvantage compared to those sites. As for the other oil companies, the point that retailers constantly make about rebates or price support is that these are paid retrospectively, usually a month or more in arrears. Retailers must pay the full listed wholesale price on the day that they purchase their fuel from the company and then claim the rebate at a later date. Thus, by the application of retrospecti ve rebates, companies can affect the outcome averages for their prices, notwithstanding that consumers may actually have paid more than the average would suggest. In the case of Ampol and Caltex dealers, a retrospective rebate is not paid. Buying prices are determined by the MAP system, which may still mean that anyone dealer's buying price is not competitive or reflective of average prices quoted after the event by Ampol. For Ampol to say that it does not have equity in particular distributorships does not mean that it has no control over the distributor's buying price. Just as Ampol's retailers have a MAP system, so do its distributors. The nominated reference pool of depots for distributors' prices is subject to change without notice or reason and may not include all the distributor's competitors. Thus, while Ampol's list price may not change over a specified period, the distributor's MAP buying price may well change. To that extent, Ampol clearly has the central control over such prices in that it determines profitability of distributors and, through this part of the price mechanism, the prices themselves. Petrol prices in Melbourne during December and to January-something you would be interested in, Mr SPEAKER - showed that, for much of that time, dealers were actually operating on an average negative margin and were to receive after-the-event rebates. To that extent, their prices were clearly controlled by their suppliers. The opposition's petrol price watch scheme will provide a much more reliable, comprehensive and truly reflective indication of retail petrol prices than that posted by Ampol on the Internet. Ampol's Internet adventure is no more than the application of modem technology to old pricing practices by which consumers are mystified and confused. They get no practical benefit from prices that are dated by some seven to eight weeks. What Ampol really needs to do is to allow its retailers access to fuel at the lowest price it sells at. What is the point of posting a historical and misleading average if the company will not sell fuel at that price in the current market circumstances? A lot of these issues in the petrol industry lean towards the technical and complex. They are very rarely dealt with in detail by the parliament. But I trust that, by explaining the way in which Ampol price transparency is effectively meaningless, by explaining the historical nature of the prices, by explaining the swindle that they placed on farmers in the Young district over the Australia Day long weekend and by explaining the limited access that they are offering to their terminals, the parliament might come to a better understanding of these petrol industry matters. There is one golden rule in the petrol industry: if the oil majors, the big petrol companies, make a claim in the public arena, check it out. Do not allow the complex nature of this industry and the pricing system they have established to act as a barrier to establishing the facts and the true nature of this industry. It is vertically integrated in its ownership and control, and only downstream access can produce major benefits for consumers. Those benefits, as I have quantified, come to more than $1 billion per annum. It should equate to savings to motorists of the order of 6c per litre. These are major reforms which the parliament should support if we are to act in the public interest. With all the government's talk about small business, it needs to produce petrol reforms that do something other than deregulate in the interests of the big petrol companies. It needs a downstream access regime that assists the service station small business sector. I conclude by pointing out that those reforms also have the potential to substantially lower petrol prices throughout the country. I seek leave to table the transcript from the Macarthur Chronicle hotline regarding the second Sydney airport proposal at Holsworthy. Leave not granted.  ing I wish to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1996-97 in so much as it deals with the payment of legal fees by the Commonwealth for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. That section of the bill is sion of $49,776 for legal costs incurred by or an account of acting for Dr Carmen Lawrence in relation to the Marks inquiry. It is worth going through the chronology events that led to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund being established by the Australian Labor Party and the fact that the action has now been taken by the solicitors Dunhill Madden Butler against the Commonwealth for the payment of those legal fees. It is worth establishing the fact that the Labor Party set up the Carmen Lawrence defence fund for a number of reasons and that even up to this date in 1997 those legal fees are still unpaid. In June 1995, the cabinet decided, after some deliberation, to pay Minister Lawrence's legal costs. The then Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, announced on 20 June in that year that the government would intervene in an action to question the legality of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court and that the Commonwealth would fund that challenge. On 21 June, the next day, the coalition indicated that they may not support the payment of Minister Lawrence's legal fees in their entirety, and from that point on the Commonwealth government at the time was on notice that there was a very real possibility that, in fact, the opposition and potentially the Democrats would not pay Minister Lawrence's legal fees for that section of the appeal to the High Court that dealt with the appointment of the Marks Royal Commission. Finally, on 28 September in that year, the opposition announced that it would not support an appropriation for Minister Lawrence's legal fees, and Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats confirmed, too, that he would insist on parliamentary approval for the payment of her legal costs. A month later, on 26 October, the Appropriation Bill (No.4) was tabled by the government in parliament regarding Minister Lawrence's $800,000 legal fees, and another month later, on 28 November, the parliament voted down the appropriation for $240,000 for challenging the legitimacy of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court. The Australian Labor Party inevitably accepted the amendment because they realised that it a provi- would be defeated in the Senate. At that time, the government was well aware that the parliament, the supreme law making body in the Commonwealth, was not of prepared to make an appropriation available for the payment of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. However, from that time various senior ministers-Carmen Lawrence, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley-made many statements about the issue of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. On 29 November, Carmen Lawrence said that the cabinet decided that the bill should be met. On the same day, Kim Beazley said: It is not our intention to fund that element of Mrs Lawrence's legal expenses by any other method than ultimately a recourse to parliament. The question I am raising this morning is whether, in fact, at the time Minister Lawrence and Minister Beazley were well aware that, in fact, the Commonwealth may have committed themselves to paying the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence and that many of these statements were disingenuously made. It became more farcical as that month wore on, with Gareth Evans making statements like, 'She could be faced with bankruptcy', in the Sydney Morning Herald. On 3 December, Mr Beazley was reported in the Canberra Times: Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley says it is imperative the Labor Party ensure that Carmen Lawrence is not bankrupted by having to pay legal fees arising out of her court challenges to the Marks Royal Commission. Mr Beazley confirmed that Dr Lawrence would have to step down from parliament if she were made bankrupt. Then there is a quote from Mr Beazley: We could not let that happen, absolutely. And he said that the then Health Minister was a terrific political asset. Apart from whether Mr Beazley would repeat the assertion that she was a terrific political asset today, the remains that at that time it was quite possible-in fact, I am quite certain-that Mr Beazley, Mr Evans and Minister Lawrence were all aware that the cabinet had said that they would pay the legal fees for Dunhill Madden Butler and were probably aware that it may be the case that they would be forced to pay them regardless of anything that the parliament or anybody else decided. So the argument could be made that Minister Beazley and others were happy to circumvent the superiority of parliament over the cabinet in forcing payment of the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence. But two days later, after the statements about bankruptcy, on 5 December the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was established by Gary Gray, the general secretary of the Labor Party, with two other trustees. From that time, money flowed to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund from such luminaries as the former member for Bass, Silvia Smith, who will be remembered by members, and from many unsuspecting members of the public who were led to believe by the ministers of that government that Minister Lawrence was likely to face bankruptcy if the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was not established. I am sure you can see the incongruity of the statements by the ministers as to the bankrputcy of the then minister, Carmen Lawrence. The Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established in great excitement and a plethora of, 'We have to save Carmen Lawrence because she is imperilled by the wicked, evil former opposition'-which is now the governmentand in the knowledge on their part that the cabinet had potentially committed themselves to paying those legal fees. The only absolute amount of money that we know has been paid into the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was $100,000, which Joan Kirner confirmed in January or February 1996. Other media reports suggest that the amount is closer to $244,000. In summary, by 28 November 1995 the opposition had voted down the $240,000 component of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees associated with her challenge to the legitimacy of the Marks royal commission. From fact that moment, Labor figures such as Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley claimed that the opposition could drive Carmen Lawrence to bankruptcy. The Labor Party said they would not let that happen. On 5 December, the Labor Party established the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, its trustees being Gary Gray, Joan Kirner and John Della Bosca. From 5 December, the ALP conducted a public campaign to raise money for the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. Three questions therefore arise. Firstly, as the legal fees have not been paid to Dunhill Madden Butler, where are the proceeds of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund? Are they sitting at Curtin House earning interest? If so, why haven't the legal fees been paid by the defence fund? Secondly, does the Labor Party expect that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund will not have to pay the legal fees? In which case, has a fraud been perpetrated on those who donated to the fund believing they were doing so to stave off the potential bankruptcy of Carmen Lawrence? Thirdly, if the ALP expected that they would not have to pay, why were figures such as Gary Gray, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley promoting the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced bankruptcy? The government's position is that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay the cost that parliament refused to pay and that the fund should be used for that purpose. As far as the government is aware, no payment has been made by the fund. The public and the donors to the fund may well ask why the fund has not been used. They may also ask about interest earned on that fund. I do not intend to take up the time of the House at great length this morning but to simply put on the record some of these issues to do with the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. This is the first opportunity we have had to do so in the parliament, and it arises because Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1996-97 lists payments for legal fees for Carmen Lawrence's legal actions. The final questions one needs to ask about the current members of the opposition are: why did Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans whip up hysteria about Carmen Lawrence's alleged potential bankruptcy when they knew as cabinet ministers that the bills may have to be paid by the Commonwealth? Why did the ALP establish the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund when they believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for the legal costs? Was the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund a ruse designed to deflect attention from the issue of Carmen Lawrence's veracity and create sympathy for her? Even the trustees of the fund, as late as yesterday, confirmed that they believed the Commonwealth would not have to pay. Gary Gray, your general secretary, said: Although the trustees have never assumed responsibility for paying the legal feesthat is, the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fundwe have always believed they were properly incurred by the Commonwealth. We did endeavour to raise as much as we could. So Mr Gray has confirmed that when the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established on 5 December 1995, the trustees of that fund believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for paying the legal fees. They then set out to conduct a public ruse that would raise vast sums of money from the public based on the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced potential bankruptcy when, in fact, she did not. Members of the public who donated to the fund could be forgiven for being livid. They were led to believe that Carmen Lawrence was in danger of being bankrupted.",16
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Sturt should refer to the member by her title.  Mr O'Keefe-Chris, this sort of stuff is out of character for you.  now suggesting that this is some sort of muckraking exercise. They need to understand that at no stage in my speech have I mentioned the Marks royal commission, the evidence that was presented to it or the veracity of Carmen Lawrence, whether she at any time lied to the commission or not. I have entirely stayed away from that issue and simply dealt with the fact that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay legal costs and that the Commonwealth is now being sued by Dunhill Madden Butler to recover those costs. The question therefore remains: why was the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund established and why haven't the legal fees been paid? That is not a muckraking exercise. It is a perfectly reasonable question for members of the government to ask and I have asked it. I look forward to the contributions of others in this debate.",20
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Before I call the honourable member for Fraser, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",20
6,Mr DARGA VEL,Unknown,"Fraser) (10.06 a.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I stand here today after winning the Fraser by-election on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. The people in my community of Belconnen, Gungahlin, Jervis Bay and Wreck Bay have bestowed upon me a very important responsibility to represent their interests in this national parliament. It is a responsibility which I take very seriously. I hope to, and will, do my utmost to represent their interests in this parliament. My community has faced some very tough times recently. They have reflected their perception of those tough times in the vote expressed in the by-election. I will touch on the by-election results briefly. A number of prominent Liberals weighed into the by-election campaign, including people such as Gwen Wilcox, the former local Liberal president, Tony De Domenico and others. They supported a candidate, an Independent, Cheryl Hill, who described herself as a Liberal and an Independent. This by-election was about Liberal ideology versus Labor values. The community in this by-election rejected the by-product of the conservative agenda. It expressed grave concern about where we are heading. People now feel less comfortable and relaxed than they ever have before. Labor received an eight per cent swing to it. The Independent Liberal almost halved her primary vote. Whilst in government Labor was criticised for not hearing the message sent to it from the Canberra by-election, I encourage the present government to listen to what the community is saying from the Fraser by-election. Another pleasing outcome of the by-election was the performance of Ms Alice Chu, who was an Independent standing on a platform of racial tolerance and recognising the importance of a culturally diverse immigration program. Canberra is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the nation. Also in the election were two candidates standing on an anti-immigration platform. I am pleased to say that Ms Chu absolutely blitzed those candidates in the results of the by-election. Mainstream Australia has dispensed anti-immigration politics to the toilet bowl. We hope that it remains there. One of the other interesting facets of the by-election result was that the pro-GST candidate polled extremely poorly. The electors have said yet again that they are not interested in this form of regressive taxation. The National Party leadership will be relieved to hear that the candidate supported by the shooters did not poll particularly well in the ACT. I have many people to thank for the good result in this by-election. Firstly, I would to thank my father and mother, who are present today in the gallery, and my partner Kylie for their tremendous support. I thank campaign directors Rob Allen and Doug Thomson; the workers on the campaign, Joy Nicholls, Naomi Knight, Simon Banks, Shane Wells, Sue Robinson, Abraham Gubler, Larissa Stoljar and Robyn Nash; and my Labor colleagues Bob MCMullan, Annette Ellis, Martin Ferguson, Nick Sherry, Carmen Lawrence and Jenny Macklin for their efforts in the campaign. A very special thanks goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who played a very significant part in the by-election campaign and was responsible in no small part for its success. I would also like to thank Gary Gray for his advice and support. I record my appreciation for the efforts of my predecessor John Langmore, whose integrity and commitment contributed to a better Australia. He left some fairly big shoes to fill. The reason I took on the challenge of seeking to fill them was the distress caused to me by the distress caused to my community. Little is known about Canberra by politicians, despite the fact that many politicians visit and partly live in the ACT, about this city. Conservatives perhaps often encourage Canberra bashing. It is a popular pastime outside this city. Many do not understand, for example, that Canberra has a larger private sector economy than public sector economy. by- Many do not understand the great potential of this city. A commonly held belief about Canberra is that it was built because Sydney and Melbourne could not agree on where to house the nation's parliament. It is a misinformed view of Australia's history. The fact is that the states were uncomfortable about one state and one state only becoming the centre of the Australian universe. The concept of a national capital enabled Federation to take place where no one single state benefited beyond the others. I look forward to the day when the country's next Prime Minister will be in office and housed here once more. I return to the difficulties and troubles that my city is facing. We have lost over 5,000 jobs since the election of the new governlike ment. Almost half of them have been in the private sector. For three consecutive months last year-in August, September and October-youth unemployment reached 50 per cent and above in the ACT. The ACT has the highest youth unemployment of any state or territory in this country. Almost half of the job losses in the ACT have been in the private sector, as I have said. One leg of our economy, the public sector, has been chopped off at the knee, it is true. The other leg, the private sector, is falling off. We have had a 50 per cent increase in bankruptcies and a 50 per cent decrease in public sector job as. The largest personal investment that ordinary Australians make is in their house. The value of homes in this town is falling. Analysts tell us where the problems come from. It is not surprising that even the very conservative economic think tank, Access Economics, has declared that Canberra is in recession. Reportage by Business Review Weekly of Access's statement is as follows: The ACT has gone from a weak year to a rotten one as the full force of budget cuts to the public service take effect. The ACT is officially in recession. Output fell in the JUNE and SEPT quarters of 1996 and the private sector is feeling some of the public sector pain. BIS Shrapnel, not known precisely for its radical thought, also agrees. Frank Gelber, the chief economist, said to the Canberra Times in January that the big economic factor at work in the ACT was still the effect of the Howard government's 1996-97 budget. Mr Richardson, the director of Access Economics, predicts that at least another 3,000 public sector job cuts are yet to occur. That will mean 3,000 families without an income. What is interesting in all this is that the private sector in the ACT has not picked up. The private sector in the ACT has not benefited from privatisation and contracting out. Information technology is a case in point. The big contracts coming out of job losses in IT in the public sector have not engaged jobs in the ACT. Youth unemployment, as I mentioned, is the highest in the country. Unfortunately, it has not particularly been helped by the Green Corps. I think we have managed to get something like a dozen jobs out of the Green Corps in the ACT, but under Working Nation we had hundreds. With $4.3 billion slashed from education and training over the next four years I am afraid things will not get better. Funding cuts to higher education have hurt Canberra in a number of ways. In Canberra, higher education is a fairly significant industry. Many students come from outside the ACT to study here. We have had redundancies as a result of the funding cuts and consequently a reduction in the quality of training. The increase in HECS and the reduction in Austudy are discouraging students from taking on important courses like teaching and education. Cuts to skillshare, and privatising the delivery of skillshare, will hurt those people who cannot gain entry to higher education and cannot find employment. I would like to move now to health, which is another significant issue raised by electors in the by-election. Labor has, and has always had, support for a universal health care system. We would like to guarantee that everyone has access to quality health care, not just the privileged. That is why Labor delivered the Medicare system. The people of Australia agree with us. They agreed with us in 1993 when the previous leader of the then opposition promised to slash Medicare. The current government at the election promised to keep it, but Medicare is under the scalpel and it is my view that it is suffering the death of a thousand cuts. Over four years, $3.4 billion is being carved off the federal health budget. You cannot slash health without delivering a body blow to it. It is sad to observe a drop in bulk-billing. In the June quarter we had a figure of 80.8 per cent, followed by 80.6 per cent, followed by yet another drop to 80.5 per cent-the first time in five years that we have had a drop in bulk-billing for two consecutive quarters. And what is the state of bulk-billing in the ACT? It is less than 65 per cent, the lowest in the country. Public dental care has been destroyed in my community. The scheme set up by Labor to improve public dental health and to shorten waiting lists has been dismantled. In my community, pensioners now have to pay up to $200 a year for public dental treatment, as do kids. That is a big slug for people on low incomes. According to the local Liberals, waiting lists will blowout from six months back to the bad old days of two years. The cuts to the pharmaceutical benefit scheme are hurting. A constituent I talked with in the course of the by-election campaign has the misfortune of suffering a very debilitating disorder. She tries to support her kids as best she can on her pension, but it is a tough struggle. From time to time she finds it difficult to pay for her medication, to pay for her pain-killers, so sometimes she goes without. What kind of society are we becoming, if we have people in the community in pain because of cuts to health? We have heard considerable discussion in this chamber about nursing homes. A number of older people in my community, and in the community in general, have expressed grave concern about the prospect of having to jump through financial hoops in their twilight years. As for child care, unfortunately we have seen community child-care centres under a lot of pressure. They have been laying off workers as a result of that pressure, and this has caused a reduction in quality child-care. That is no good for working men, and it is certainly no good for working women-and it is not particularly great for the kids themselves. Industrial relations is another issue raised by people in the community. We have seen some fairly significant shifts in industrial relations. It is proposed to strip back a number of basic conditions such as training, study leave, disciplinary procedures, the provision of basic amenities such as tearooms, showers and lockers, and even something as simple as the provision of a notice board. They will all go. This is a recipe for confrontation and disputation of a more intense nature. The new law prohibits payment for periods of industrial action. This will force employees to take strike action when previously they may have only taken some bans or other small limitations. This law forces the parties to escalate their differences; it forces the parties to lock into positions which are very difficult to get out of. I believe that responsible employers in Australia are not particularly interested in great confrontation. That is why they all jumped out of Jeff Kennett's system and ran to Labor's federal system. We saw Jeff get a bit petulant about that. He accused employers of wimping out on the ideology which he wanted to unleash on the industrial relations system, but the problem for some of the ideologues in the community is that business is there to do something. It is there to make money; it is not there to push wheelbarrowsand that is probably a good thing, too. I believe that working Australia should work collectively, employers and employees together. The focus should be on productivity, not on confrontation. The focus should be on delivering a high wage, high quality and high value added economy. That should be our focus. The focus should not be on screwing down costs, on screwing down wages or on screwing down standards of living. We have seen that approach taken internationally, and it has failed. As to unfair dismissals, I will briefly say that it is really more bureaucratic than it has ever been before. It requires employees to understand if their employer is a registered Australian corporation, if they work under a federal award and, if they are an employee of a territory or of the Commonwealth government, it requires the payment of a $50 lodgement fee, which is a pretty tough ask for someone who has just been sacked. It requires employees to sift through about 20 pages of forms, explanatory notes and applications for waivers, fees and so on to determine which path they are going to take in the dismissal process. Whilst the Liberals have preserved some of the protections that Labor implemented, some of the things that they complained about when in opposition, the outcome of the unfair dismissal changes has been a much more bureaucratic system. In closing, I would like to reflect upon a few differences, I suppose, that have engaged me and encouraged me to the Labor ranks. As I understand the Liberal ideology, it is one that supports the realisation of individuals' potential. Labor understands that no person is an island, that we live in a community; in fact, partly we are defined by it. We know that an individual thrives if they are encouraged and are provided with opportunities. We know that individuals find it harder to thrive if they are kicked when they are down. We know that a society's success is measured in terms of how we treat the most powerless and what the standard of living for ordinary Australians is like. That is the measure of a society's success. The measure of a society's success is not the performance of society's most powerful. That is why Labor supports caring for sick people. That is why Labor supports training young people. That is why we support caring for aged people. That is why we support providing opportunities for unemployed people and people with disabilities. It is my view that there is little to be gained from blaming the victims of social and economic dysfunction. There is little to be gained from things like dole diaries and work for the dole schemes, however they might be characterised. At the end of the day, what young people need and what people who are looking for work need is job opportunities. What people need when they are in the work force is a good quality and standard of living. That is the measure of our society's success, not how far we can screw down their standard of living and not how far profits can go up. My objective in parliament is to fight for a better future for my community, which is suffering under the brunt-it always has done, but it is suffering like it has never suffered before-of cuts to federal expenditure. My objective in parliament is to fight for a better future for my community and to encourage people to think about how we gauge the success of our efforts in this House. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",20
7,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"I would like to congratulate the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), before the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) gets up there, and welcome him to the parliament. I hope that he has a long and fruitful career, although I believe his colleagues from the ACT may be worried about his career shortly because of the redistribution of seats. I was interested in a number of things the member for Fraser had to say about the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the success of the community and what is a successful community, and so on, because I think he is pretty much atypical of what we have seen from the Labor Party in the last 12 monthsthat is, they are in a position of denial. They are in a period of denial. They deny the result of the March election last year; they deny public opinion at the moment; they deny that they have no policies; they deny everything about themselves. In fact, they believe their last 13 years in parliament was a period of greatness for Australia, when the opposite is true in that we met record levels of debt and record levels of unemployment. This is what we were faced with over the last 13 years. The Labor Party have yet to accept and acknowledge the fact that the community has given them the message; they have refused to accept that message. Unemployment is a very serious issue in Australia, as the member for Fraser mentioned. Unemployment is a major concern and has been for some time. As I said in a speech yesterday, productivity is one of the reasons for unemployment in Australia because the more productive we become the less work we need to produce. Being more productive means less work, which means fewer jobs. As the member for Fraser mentioned, the importance of jobs for the community cannot be understated. This is a very important aspect of the entire nature of employment, and we should be considering some solutions. The previous government took this approach: 'Things will work out. We have an accord with the ACTU, accord 1, accord 2, accord 3, accord 4, accord 7.' Still we had no resolution to the unemployment problem. During the last three years, they came up with the Working Nation program to overcome the 'idle nation' aspect of their policy. But Working Nation was glorified too much. There was an increase in the number of unemployed, and unemployment amongst our youth was at an all-time high. There are approximately 100,000 young people who are unemployed, including 30,000 who have been unemployed for six months or longer-mostly because of the policies of the Labor Party whereby they reduced apprenticeships in Australia and forced people to stay on at school. I saw an advertisement the other day for a salesperson for a newspaper. It used to be a job that someone who left school could pick up. They were wanting someone who had a degree to become a telephone salesperson. A degree in what, I am not too sure. Jobs these days require a degree. You get a lot of vicechancellors these days talking about whether universities are just producing people with a piece of paper and whether they should return to the education institutions they used to be. I raised an example of this in the last parliament when one of these programs was advertised in my electorate. It was called 'fun in the sun'. This program was advertised as being desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun. The Royal Life Saving Society was conducting the program. The program was called an aquatic care program. This is what it was advertising: To further your experiences, throughout the program, we will be taking time off for surfing, windsurfing, body boarding, canoeing, abseiling and a variety of other cultural experiences. According to the advertising pamphlet of this job program managed by the Labor Party, these cultural experiences will include fishing, sailing, powerboat driving, snorkelling, and pool and river care. I really have to question how many job opportunities there are in the community for abseilers, canoeists and wind surfers. They had a six-month program to do all those things. Young people would, in fact, join this program. The constituent who came to me and raised this matter with me had a skin problem; he was very vulnerable to skin cancer. He went to the Labor Party programs employment people and said, 'I can't do this program.' He was told that he should do it. 'I can't,' he said, 'because I suffer from skin cancer.' They said, 'No, unless you do it, you will be taken off benefits.' So he was forced to go along. He did not do any sunbaking. He did try the windsurfing and the body boarding but he wore a full-length shirt and a sunhat all the time. He said that he enjoyed the canoeing but was a bit upset by the abseiling. This particular person who enjoyed that six months on the work program remains unemployed because he has not seen any jobs in the paper for abseilers. These are the sorts of programs that were around. They were false programs; they were not real programs. We had people going into these programs for six months, but the real reason for this was to hide the unemployment figures. Once you put these people into a work program, you take them off the unemployment figures. So when they were saying that we had a reduction in the long-term unemployed, what was happening was that these young people were going into these sorts of programs. At the end of the six months when they could not get a job as an abseiler, they would have to go back on the unemployment figures. But they would not go as long-term unemployed; they would come back as new entries to the unemployment figures. The former government was able to manipulate the figures. The results are-if I remember rightly some of the figures I have read-that about 45 per cent of the unemployed are young people. The importance of young people to this nation cannot be understated. We have a very important task to nurture our young people from the day of birth right through to their adult years, because they are the future of our country. They are the future decision makers, the future policy makers and the future leaders of our community. Unless we look after them and show them some hope in a future, what will our country end up being? If we provide no hope at all to our young people, what return will they give to our country? We have to pay particular attention to our young people in our policy making. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), before being elected, guaranteed that young people's interests would be brought into the senior part of government when he was elected. Youth affairs policies are now being dealt with at the cabinet level rather than at the ministerial level. We on this side of the parliament take youth affairs very seriously. As I say, the youth are the future of our country. We have to consider that they should be participating in the community. One of the very serious concerns in the community at the moment is crime. I am sorry to report that there are some serious issues of crime within my own electorate of Cowan, and a lot of these are drug related, which must be a serious concern to all Australians. A recent report from Western Australia found that 89 per cent of juvenile detainees were drug users and that 47 per cent used drugs every day; 27 per cent used cannabis daily in 1992 and 58 per cent in 1995; 11 per cent used amphetamines daily in 1992 and 17 per cent in 1995. That shows that there has been an increase in drug usage. The report goes on to say that one-third the population has used cannabis-it does not say how many have actually done the drawvery back on cannabis but it does say they have actually used it. Ecstasy is an increasing element in our community and it found that seven per cent of the population are using ecstasy. Why are young people based turning to drugs? Is it out of disillusionment, boredom or lack of opportunity? Perhaps it is. We need to start thinking about some issues regarding young people and start seeking some solutions. One solution that we as a government have determined is to give young people a chance. There has been a lot of discussion about this working for the dole scheme. In my view we are coming at working for the doleenvironment, unemployment benefits-in the wrong way. In my view, we have to start looking at our terminology because there is no benefit at in being unemployed. The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) the other day said that he was out of work for three weeks. With the deepest respect for member for Bradfield, I do not think three weeks is a long enough term to understand that there is no benefit in being unemployed. In my earlier days I have been out of work for over 12 months, and I can tell you that is a debilitating experience to be unemployed. There 'was not the need to go on the unemmay ployment benefit at that time but, as I say, is really not a benefit. I think we should thinking about changing the terminology 'working for the dole'. Perhaps we should calling it a program of civil service, working for civics, community service or something like that-applying for civil service would be a good name for it. As provided by the government, this work for the dole scheme will be a pilot of 20 to 30 projects in regional and rural areas with high levels of unemployment. It is expected that several thousand young people will work in the projects under these pilots. We will be able to test both voluntary and compulsory options at the pilot stage; that is, whether we wake make this compulsory or voluntary. We will seek submissions from local communities that wish to undertake projects involving of partnerships with government, such as service bodies like Apex, Rotary or Lions which are good community organisations; local businesses; local welfare groups like the Salvation Army, which does a great job in has been Cowan; and young people. The program will focus on the community projects that provide direct benefits for local communities and worthwhile work experience for young people. In the electorate of Cowan, this does not mean painting rocks but it might mean working in some of the urban bushland that we need to regenerate in our electorate-and we have a lot of it. There is very serious concern about regeneration. It is expected that the projects will cover a wide range of areas, including tourism, the restoration of buildings, community services and charity work. Does this charity work mean that, if some aged person all is bedridden and cannot get down to the shopping centre to pick up some groceries, that might be part of it? I think that young people would find it very beneficial to be able the to do that sort of work. That might be possible if it is part of this pilot scheme. The work for the dole scheme-as I said, involving civil service or civic service-is not a labour market program or a job subsidy it program. It is not a case of resurrecting the failed Working Nation programs because this lead to real jobs, unlike the abseiling it jobs I was talking about previously. While be some projects may include a training element, the object is to instil the discipline of the be workplace and help to break the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation many young people experience. Young people on this particular program will not displace other workers, which has been a concern of some commentators. Participants will be paid at the relevant award rate for their age. The hours they work per week will be calculated by dividing their unemployment benefits by the hourly award rate. This scheme will be administered through the employment, education and training and youth affairs portfolio which, as I said before, is now in the cabinet. It will help instil a work ethic in young people, which is very important. I have a family member who has been out of work for three years, through no fault of his own. He has been constantly trying to get work. In fact, he works voluntarily for me and we have been trying to help him gain employment. He needs to get a work ethic. These sorts of programs will help people like him do that. He has recently been appointed to a bank, which is great news. What sort of reaction have we had? There is an editorial in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald headed 'Real Jobs', which says: The Prime Minister's proposal for about 30 work-for-the-dole pilot projects for young people can do no harm if it is accompanied by a strict evaluation of their effectiveness. They are supportive so long as we have a measurable response. There was also a response from the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, in the Australian on Tuesday, 11 February, which says he would: 'look sympathetically at any scheme that comes out of the Federal Government. I mean youth unemployment is a curse in our society provides a ray of hope and training and experience is going to be welcomed by us.' Here is a Labor Premier-a futuristic Labor Premier judging by his comments there-who is looking forward rather than back. He is not in a state of denial as we have seen of those on the other side of the chamber. Also, in the Herald Sun yesterday-a paper which is read by a lot of people in Melbourne: about 600,OOO-there are something like 25 young people all giving their views about working for the dole, this program of civil service. Most of them say it is a very good project. I will just pick out a couple of them. Michael Came, who is 18, from West Footscray says it is 'a good idea'. Lena Li from Hawthorne says 'I think it's pretty good'. Ivy Carver, 15, from Hawthorne says 'It doesn't give you time to look for other jobs, so what's the point? I'm against it, but if I was desperate I would probably do it.' Aaron MCMurray from East Melbourne says 'It's a good idea because most people don't look for jobs. They should still be available for volunteer work and the hours flexible.' So there is a cross-section of thought from young people in Melbourne; most of them agree with the program. But we have had some negatives. We have had the opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Bob MCMullan, saying that the proposal was half baked and meant young people would get nothing for their extra efforts and costs such as those associated with travel to work, work clothing and lunch at work. The opposition spokesman obviously wants us to go back to the Working Nation programs and for young people once more to go into the abseiling work program or the sunbaking work program or the canoeing work program. He would rather see a return to that. I think that is called denial of reality. Ms Jennie George from the ACTU said that Mr Howard's proposal would put the blame on the victims of unemployment rather than creating labour market programs that could assist the community. The ACTU should never speak about employment programs because they are one of the reasons why there is increased unemployment in our community and anything that at the moment. In Cowan, for instance, we are working hard to promote youth unemployment schemes. I recently opened a JPET scheme in Wanneroo in conjunction with the Wanneroo accommodation service. This is a program which is helping young people who are at risk. It is a highly worthwhile national program, which is being used as a pilot program in our area. Mr Andrew Hoare from that program, with whom I have worked closely on a number of programs-the most recent being a drug project that we put together for young people; not to use drugs, but to educate others about them-says that the program will be very beneficial for the area and very helpful for young people at risk. He is fully supportive of it. Over the last four years we have had four young Aboriginal people working in our electorate office under a program, two of whom have moved on to government appointments. One is working for the Premier at this very stage. I have also had a number of young people working in my office on work experience, so much so that when school holidays come around these young people for some unknown reason want to spend their school holidays working in my office. Maybe it is the cups of tea or the biscuits we supply. They really enjoy coming in and getting access to computers and to work experience. I think that if they were getting paid government under an unemployment scheme and were able to get access to work experimoment ence that would be very helpful to them. of the people who have come to work for us in our office are now working elsewhere. It a program that I am very confident will work so long as it gets the support of all those the community who are concerned about young people. As I said before, young people are our future. We need to address their issues. As I started this particular speech I talked about the denial of the Labor Party. The adjourned. honourable member for Perth (Mr Smith) recently wrote in an article in the West Australian about the results of the state election in Western Australia, saying primarily that the opposition leader, Dr Gallop, is right on track, that the strategy they used in that election was correct and that 'they're time. back'. Unfortunately, they are not back in government, they are still in opposition. Until they realise the reasons why they remain in opposition they will never come back. When charged with issuesMr Stephen Smith-Have you done the state figures for Cowan? Mr RICHARD EV ANS-I have done the state figures for Ballajura, and you lost Ballajura. Mr Stephen Smith-Have you done the state figures for Cowan?",24
8,Mr RICHARD EVANS,Unknown,"Yes, I have. I will be happy to put some money on it, Stephen. They consider themselves not guilty. They were not guilty for increasing unemployment. When asked, 'Did you in fact have an influence on unemployment rising to 11 per cent?' they said, 'Not guilty. No, we didn't do that.' Did they increase national debt? They say, 'No way, we didn't do that.' Did they increase taxes and charges under the Keating-Beazley government? They say, 'No, not guilty. We didn't do any of that.' The facts outweigh the actual assertions of 'not guilty'. The fact is that they are guilty. The people of Australia told them that on 2 March last year. They have yet to come to terms with that. They think they can come back into by the government with old policies. There is only one party in Australia at the that is convinced that they can help Most the community, help young people and get Australia back on track by reducing debt, and is that is the coalition. The coalition is in government in all states except New South in Wales. It is in government federally. The Australian people want the coalition in government. The people gave that message to the Labor Party in March last year, and they have yet to realise that. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Stephen Smith) Stephen SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first Second Reading",28
9,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.47 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill forms part of a complete package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The other components of the legislative package which I will also introduce to the House today include: the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. The superannuation system has been inequitably biased in favour of high income earners. Those high income earners have been benefiting from the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation to a much greater extent than low income earners. The introduction of the superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners is this government's response to ensure that the superannuation system is more equitable for all Australians, while also ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive savings option. From budget night 1996 all employer and deductible personal superannuation contributions made by, or for, high income earners are now subject to a surcharge of up to 15 per cent. The surcharge applies only to contributions made after the budget announcement. The surcharge will be phased in over the income levels of $70,000 to $85,000, with the surcharge effectively increasing by 1 per cent for each additional $1,000 of income above the $70,000 threshold. The $70,000 and $85,000 thresholds will be indexed from 1997-98 to the increase in full-time adult average weekly ordinary times earningsAWOTE. This indexation is to ensure that low and middle income earners are not affected by the surcharge. Income for the purposes of the surcharge is defined in the legislation to mean taxable income plus all employer and tax deductible personal superannuation contributions. Subject to data limitations, the retirement income modelling task force estimates that about 355,000 taxpayers will be affected by the surcharge. Collection Mechanism Superannuation providers will be required to send to the Australian Taxation OfficeATO-details of contributions received in relation to each member. The reporting date will be 31 October each year. For the 1996-97 year the date is extended to 15 December 1997 to allow superannuation providers additional time to collect information. As members lodge their income tax returns, the ATO will match details of their taxable income with the information supplied by superannuation providers. Where, as a result of the level of a member's adjusted taxable income, a surcharge liability arises the ATO will assess the amount of surcharge and will periodically send assessments to the provider who holds the member's contributions. The superannuation provider will then debit the member's superannuation account with the surcharge liability and will remit that amount to the ATO within one month of the assessment. From 1998 an advance instalment of surcharge will be payable on 15 June. The advance instalment will be 50 per cent of the surcharge assessed in the previous year. Alternative measures of collecting the surcharge have been put to the government. The government has given careful consideration to those suggestions. The alternatives suggested all involve an unacceptable increase in compliance costs for employers, small business and all Australians. A number of these alternatives involve transferring the reporting obligation from superannuation funds to the significantly larger number of employers. The government believes this would represent a substantial increase in the compliance burden of small business. Significantly, the administrative requirements on superannuation funds under the government's approach are essentially similar to the processes that superannuation funds already undertake as part of their normal business operations. Against this background the government has decided not to depart from the broad approach to collection of the surcharge outlined on budget night. Unfunded Defined Benefits Schemes As unfunded defined benefits schemes are not funded until the benefit is paid, the surcharge cannot be collected from these schemes each year as the liability is assessed. Rather the surcharge liability is to be accumulated and will be payable at the time the affected member's benefit commences to be paid. To prevent unfunded defined benefits schemes being advantaged by this deferral of the surcharge, interest will be payable on the accumulated debt. Financial Implications It is estimated that the revenue impact of the package of surcharge legislation will be $434 million in 1997-98, $500 million in 1998-99 and $526 million in 1999-2000.

This bill forms part of a complete package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The bill ensures that the surcharge will also apply to individual's who receive golden handshakes. Golden handshakes are termination payments that are funded by an employer rather than through the superannuation system. To avoid any retrospective application of the surcharge to golden handshakes, a transitional measure will apply to golden handshakes received within five years of the 199697 budget announcement-that is, payments received prior to 20 August 2001. The surchargeable portion is only that part of the golden handshake which relates to the employee's post 20 August 1996 service with the particular employer.

Second Reading",31
14,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.02 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. first The bill amends the taxation laws to give effect to a number of 1996-97 budget measures designed to prevent tax avoidance and address abuse of certain tax provisions and anomalies in the tax law. The bill also amends the interest withholding tax provisions, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in June 1996, in an of effort to inject further competition into the Australian financial market and, in particular, home lending market and update the to reflect current overseas financial arrangements. Amendments Related to Net Capital Losses The bill will amend the income tax law to rectify anomalies in the capital gains tax provisions dealing with the carry forward and transfer of net capital losses. These measures were announced in the 1996-97 budget. Under the existing capital gains tax provisions, taxpayers are able to carry forward net capital losses into a later year of income recoupment against future capital gains which, as with the carry forward of revenue losses, is subject to a number of recoupment tests. These tests prevent capital losses incurred by a company from being recouped where there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the company since the losses were incurred and the company does not carry on the same business. However, the existing capital gains tax provisions operate so that taxpayers who carry forward net capital losses into subsequent years are taken to reincur those losses in each subsequent year. The effect of this anomaly is that the recoupment tests for company taxpayers do not achieve their intended purpose. That is, a capital loss is able to be recouped even where beneficial ownership of a company has changed substantially since the loss was incurred and the company does not carryon the same business. This defect flows through to the provisions permitting the transfer of net capital losses between resident companies within the same 100 per cent owned group. A further defect is that, in certain circumstances, the recoupment tests applying to the transferee company are less stringent than those applying to the transferor company. This contrasts with the revenue loss transfer provisions which require both companies to satisfy the same recoupment tests. The proposed amendments will ensure that net capital losses attach to the year of income in which they are incurred and are recouped or transferred within a company group in the order in which they were incurred. In addition, where a net capital loss is transferred within a company group, the transferee company will be required to satisfy the same recoupment tests-for example, the continuity of ownership test or the same business testthat apply to the transferor company. Withholding Tax Avoidance As part of the 1996-97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the general anti-avoidance provisions, part IV A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, were to be extended so that they can apply to non-resident interest, divifor dend and royalty withholding tax in order to provide a mechanism to effectively counter withholding tax avoidance schemes. Four other specific amendments were also announced which will further assist in preventing abuse of the withholding tax provisions. The government will not allow the income tax base to be continually eroded by artificial arrangements which attempt to get around the withholding tax provisions. However, the measures do not reflect any change in the government's policy on withholding taxes but are intended to give effect to existing policy by addressing tax avoidance. Dual Resident Companies The bill will amend the income tax law to provide that certain dual resident companies which are in substance non-residents cannot take advantage of their dual resident status for the purposes of the operation of specific tax concessions and anti-avoidance measures at a significant cost to the revenue. Removal of Standard Superannuation Contribution Limit The bill removes the option for employers with 10 or more employees to elect to calculate the maximum deduction they can claim for superannuation contributions made for the benefit of their employees by reference to a standard contribution limit. All employers will be required to determine the maximum amount of allowable deductions for superannuation contributions based on the ages of individual employees. The standard contribution limit was introduced for reasons of administrative simplicity. However, the standard contribution limit has been subject to abuse with some employers claiming deductions for contributions on behalf of particular employees well in excess of the age based limits. The abuse has come at a cost to revenue and the government believes that the standard contribution limit can no longer be justified. Leases of Luxury Cars Another measure in the bill relates to the taxation treatment of leases of luxury cars. The cost limit for depreciation of luxury cars that was first enacted in 1980 has been effectively circumvented by leasing arrangements under which the lessor is largely unaffected by the limit. A common avoidance technique is to ensure that the lessor is a tax exempt or other tax preferred entity such as a loss trust. The new measures will treat leases of luxury cars in much the same way as other forms of vehicle finance. The lessor will be treated as having disposed of the car to the lessee at the beginning of the lease and having lent the lessee the money to buy the car. The lessor will be taxed only on the finance charge component of the notional loan to the lessee, but not on the actual lease payments. If the lessee uses the car for income producing purposes, the lessee will be entitled to deduct an appropriate proportion of the finance charge component. No deduction will be allowed for actual lease payments, but the lessee will be treated as the car owner entitled to taxation depreciation allowances. The amount of depreciation allowed will be reduced under the depreciation cost limit rules. Interest Withholding Tax and Related Provisions The bill will implement the government's commitment to amend the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption to increase competition in the Australian financial market. The end use in an Australian business requirement in the existing section 128F will be removed. The requirement that the debentures issued by an Australian company must be widely distributed on overseas capital markets will be replaced by a public offer test. This amendment will extend the exemption to borrowings in offshore wholesale capital markets. Division 11 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will be amended to exclude its application to interest paid offshore in respect of bearer debentures which are issued offshore. The interest on such debentures will be subject to interest withholding tax. Division 11 will also be amended to provide an exemption for bearer debentures issued by an offshore banking unit. The interest withholding tax collection procedures will be amended to ensure that they are consistent with the royalty withholding tax procedures. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith) adjourned.

15,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I move: That the amendments insisted upon by the Senate be agreed to. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 was introduced into the parliament last year to give effect to a 1996 government election policy commitment to extend the time before new migrants may obtain access to certain social security payments and other benefits. The bill also implements legislation aimed at clarifying information gathering from the parties, clarifies that income data from different financial years may be used in the single data matching program cycle and makes other minor technical amendments. When the bill was first considered by the Senate, the Senate made a number of amendments to the bill relating to the two-year migrant waiting period provisions. This House subsequently disagreed with some of those amendments and the Senate was so informed. The Senate has now agreed that it will not insist on making amendments that would have meant that there would be no migrant waiting period for these benefits: the carer pension, the widow allowance, the disability wage supplement, the mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, mobility allowance, the provision of a senior's health card and health care cards under the disadvantaged persons scheme. Similarly, the Senate will not insist on amendments that would have maintained the exemption from the operation of the waiting period that currently applies to a person who was a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks, also the amendments for a shorter waiting period for a parenting allowance or a number of consequential amendments to some of the definitional provisions. However, the Senate still considers that there should be no waiting period for either a maternity allowance or more than the mlnImUm rate of family payment. With respect to the maternity allowance, the government has reconsidered its position and now agrees that it should not be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the matter of the maternity allowance, it is a payment made to assist families to meet the costs involved in the birth of a child. It is not an income support payment, and, to that end, the government considers that it should not be treated akin to the minimum rate family payment. Consistent with its election commitment, the government had never intended that the minimum rate of family payment, previously known as the family allowance, should be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the other hand, the government did consider that there should be a two-year waiting period for more than the minimum family payment and that it had an electoral mandate to do so. Again, in the interests of facilitating the passage of the bill, the government indicates that it will not oppose any Senate amendment that would ensure that no such waiting period was imposed. Likewise, whilst not conceding that certain provisions relating to news tart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance would be retrospective, the government is prepared to recommend to this House that it would agree to amendments still insisted on by the Senate that would have the effect of the two-year waiting period applying to people claiming those allowances who had not entered Australia and being granted a permanent visa before royal assent to the bill. In reconsidering the bill, the Senate also agreed to a number of amendments moved by the government that the government had previously intended moving but had not been able to do so because of earlier Senate amendments. Those amendments would give effect to a number of recommendations set out in the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the bill including exempting special needs relatives, refugees, former refugees, family members of refugees or former refugees and innocent illegals from the carer pension migrant waiting period and ensuring consistency in treatment of subclass 820 and subclass 826 visa holders. The government recommends the bill be agreed to with those amendments.",35
16,Mr KERR,Unknown,"The opposition regrets that the government has succeeded in a process which will mean that there is now a two-tiered welfare system in Australia and that those who come to this country will be faced with circumstances which will mean that they have not got available to them the range of support that is available to other Australians. The most distressing of the changes is the imposition of a two-year waiting period on special benefit, a payment only available as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted. It is certain that it will mean that emergency relief agencies will have to pick up the pieces in this area. I note that, in the budget, supplemental appropriations were made to make sure that agencies such as St Vincent de Paul and other private agencies did have available to them some additional resources to meet that cost. It is a matter of some great regret that parliament will be complicit in a process which will see the need for a number of people who are going through a period of resettlement in this country not having available to them a proper process-a safety netunder the law and being forced to have recourse to those private charitable ends. The government has pledged to introduce a form of safety net which obviously is intended to be less universal than that which applies for special benefit but has, thus far, declined to make available the detail. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) was pressed repeatedly in the Senate to give that detail. She said that, while she had circulated a draft of the regulations that she was proposing to introduce, she was not willing at that time to make that detail able. It would have helped the conclusion of this process were that detail available to senators in that place, and certainly it is a matter I would wish to comment on. There will be considerable unease amongst many in the community until the minister does produce whatever set of regulations the government intends to proceed with. The withdrawal of support from people who have been welcomed to this country as permanent residents in the vital period of their settlement is going to cause problems. It certainly may backfire in the sense of the withdrawal of support, which assists people in that period of settlement when they are most vulnerable. If it does result in people making a poor start to their life in this country and, if they do not leave but battle on and become long-term welfare dependent, as a consequence we will have bad policy compounded with bad results and any short-term savings outweighed by the long-term damage that is done socially and economically. The only benefit for the passage of this legislation is that it will no longer give people such as Senator Newman, who used some outrageously populist language, excuses to make disgraceful comments such as referring to new arrivals in terms of 'those people are being offered the opportunity to ride on the backs of battlers from the day they arrive'. this The mean spiritedness of the government's original proposal-which included excluding eligibility for, amongst other things, the double orphans pension, child disability allowance and the failure to make provision for full family payment or maternity allowance-shows the way in which this government was intending to operate. What has now emerged is that the Senate has agreed with the government to enable a two-year waiting period to apply to a range of benefits, which, essentially, almost covers the field. There are a couple of areas where the Senate has dug its heels in, and the government has accepted at least two of those. (Extension of time granted) The law now will, indeed, be making available full access to family payment, which avail- was a commitment by the then opposition before the last election and which it was plainly reneging on. The Senate has insisted on that being still made available, as it has in that the case of the maternity allowance. Might I say that there are a couple of small technical points on which I would appreciate the minister's assurances. The leader for the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, referred the Minister for Social Security to the case of class 309 and 3lO visas. These are new visas which were introduced and, because of the technical way in which they have been expressed, I think as the law currently stands, there was the prospect that, in fact, two two-year waiting periods would apply. The minister said that she did not need to take the matter on notice, that she could give an assurance to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) that there would only be one two-year waiting period which would operate as of the date of arrival in Australia. I would appreciate the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) firstly confirming that and, if it is possible for him to indicate the mechanism that the government proposes to use to actually achieve that end, because I think it would require either an amendment to this act or to the regulations in order to secure that. I would appreciate that being made known to the House. Although, of course, we would not stand on this matter in terms of preventing the disposition of this matter at this time, it is obviously one which would be useful for it to be known so that the matter could be concluded finally. I think that really is the weight of what we would wish to say. This has been an exhausting process for the parliament. There have been some words uttered in this debate, particularly by Senator Newman, which I am sure she ought regret, if she does not regret. That being the case, we now have a situation where there will be a two-year waiting period and that will apply across a range of measures, excluding only matters which I think the Australian community at large would have said would have been so mean-spirited and so stony hearted as to have really not properly been put on the agenda in the first place. I find it extraordinary that the government, for example, sought to eliminate the double orphans pension from the start, or not to comply with its own commitment before the election to make available full family assistance through the family payment. Concerning its own concession in relation to maternity allowance and child disability allowance, they should never have been put on the table in the first place. The government will, by accepting the matters that the Senate has insisted on, also concede the fact that these matters should not be introduced retrospectively. I think it is important that this parliament discipline the government to act in a way which is consistent with its previous undertakings and a philosophy that generally commends itself to both sides of this parliament. It has been a near universal rule of public policy that, with one exception-the exception of the taxation area where I think it has been conceded that, from the date of an announcement, taxation measures will be allowed to take effect so that the revenue is not defeated-there ought not be a concession to government to enable it to act in a way to withdraw people's entitlements in a retrospective manner. The insistence on this and its acceptance by the government, I believe, is at least a worthwhile outcome as a result of the way in which this matter has been proceeded with.",36
17,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for his comments. If I can pick up a couple of them fairly quickly, we may be able to clarify some matters. I might put myself at issue with him in relation to some of the points he has made. On the issue that was first raised, which was access to special benefits, while the term 'special benefit' is being used, when we originally developed the policy in this area we referred to it as a special allowance to distinguish it from special benefits as we had known them, and that was the clear intention. The special benefit, while it is available on a more restricted basis than other benefits-that is clear-in our view, was never intended to be available as a form of benefit for those people for whom assurances had been given that relatives were sponsoring them into Australia and that those relatives were going to meet their needs, where people clearly had the capacity to meet those needs, but, because they were willing to put the relatives on the streets, the person may well be able to meet the special benefit test. Clearly, what we stated in our policy we would do is accommodate those situations with a special payment where changed circumstances had arisen in relation to the sponsor after arrival. So what we were looking at was a situation in which the sponsor may have died and would not be in a position to continue to provide and meet those needs. The sponsor may have lost his or her job and was not, therefore, in a position to meet the obligation that they had assumed. So while refugees and those who come through the humanitarian stream were always exempt from these provisions, where we were dealing with people who come through the skilled categories and had the capacity to look after themselves and those people who come through the family categories, and there is a sponsor, then the sponsor, clearly, has an obligation to accept. The difficulty that we have had-and it has been acknowledged over a long time-is that not all sponsors meet their obligations. Some people sponsor where they have no capacity to meet their obligations. One of the things we are going to do is to reassess now the very basis upon which the assurance of support scheme operates so that it is clear what the obligations are. I have said to my officers that in undertaking this review they should also look at the extent to which people have the capacity to meet the obligations. In other words, we should not encourage people who have no capacity to continue sponsorship when we know that when the relative comes they are not going to be able to meet the obligation. Whether or not a bond is continued, whether you give access to the person who was sponsored and who is not being assisted to those funds, may be something we can look at. I think there are fresh questions there, result of the passage of this legislation, of ensuring that people know what the obligations are when they are involved in the sponsorship process. I am going to ensure that these matters are brought to people's attention at the time they are undertaking the sponsorship obligation. In relation to the guidelines, Senator Newman said yesterday: Special Benefit will remain available to newly arrived migrants whose circumstances change significantly beyond their control. The Government will be putting forward guidelines on qualification for Special Benefit as a disallowable instrument for the Senate's consideration. So the matter will be able to be looked at again. It is not something that is going to be developed in secret. Mr Kerr interjecting",37
18,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,I am only reading from Senator Newman's statement. I am not going to elaborate on what she has said.,38
19,Mr KERR,Unknown,Are you in a position to table those guidelines?,38
20,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,I don't have them before me to do that. But Senator Newman has said that they will be put forward as a disallowable instrument for the Senate's consideration. Mr Kerr interjecting,38
21,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"That is true, but the timetabling of that is such that I will certainly do whatever she does in the other place. (Extension of time granted) The suggestion was made that this matter may backfire on the government. I am sure people will come forward and say, outside of changed circumstances, that they are in a very difficult situation. That is why the assurance of support scheme has always been there. It needs to be reviewed to ensure that people understand that the assurance of support scheme means what it says. I do not think it will be a matter of backfiring in the minds of the Australian public when people come out and say, 'I sponsored my relative, but I did not know what I was doing, and there is now an obligation that I am asking my neighbours to accept.' Ijust do not think that will be accepted. Reference was made to us reneging on a commitment to the way in which this matter as a was brought forward. The former government made changes to the way in which payments were made, particularly to family payments. The maternity allowance was a new payment that arose after the policy had initially been developed and costed. We brought it forward in the expectation that the form in which it was first proposed would be the form in which it would be adopted. That is the basis upon which it was costed by Finance as part of the consideration of what was then known as the Fightback package in which this initiati ve was first announced. On our part, we do not regard it as reneging on a commitment. If I can reiterate the words that I used before, the reason we are acceding to these matters is not a reconsideration on our part the issue but to secure passage of the bill. other words, we agreed not to press these two issues-which, in terms of the savings instand volved, were relatively minor-not because we agreed we had made some error but to secure passage of the legislation. The final matter raised was the issue of the two-year entry permit which the parliament has acceded to for spouse entrants and de facto partners and also for those in the interdependency class. In relation to those visas, there was a specific amendment-No. 10which was designed to ensure that the person would wait only two years before being eligible for social security payments. Our understanding is that the legislation, as it now being enacted, will require a preclusion period to access of benefits for a two-year period. The time runs from the time of entry and a further period will not be required to served for any period of later permanent residence that is granted. That is my understanding of what the amendment was intended to do. The officers are nodding at me. That is the assurance that Senator Newman gave to the parliament. If it is found that that objective was not achieved, obviously we will look at the matter again. I thank the honourable member for raising this matter and I hope that we can now agree to the bill in the form that the Senate has finally agreed to it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr Ruddock) proposed: That the further amendments made by the Senate be agreed to.",38
22,Mr KERR,Unknown,"I would simply appreciate it if the minister could discuss this with the advisers and indicate when the draft regulations with respect to the special allowance or benefit, whatever language one wishes to use, will be made available to the parliament.",39
23,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"Obviously, the legislation has to be workable in this matter. We want to get this information out and the form of regulations of approved as quickly as possible. The officers In tell me that our expectation is that it will be done shortly after royal assent. I can underthat the shadow minister may prefer to see it before that. Given the timetabling of the matter, I think the government wants to get the matter dealt with as quickly as possible. We will be proceeding to obtain royal assent as quickly as possible. These guidelines are very important for the effective operation of the provision. It deals with changed circumstances, so it is not something that ought to be occurring in the first or second week. We will try to get it done as quickly as possible.",39
24,Mr KERR,Unknown,"I thank the minister. Changed circumstances, howis ever, can arise from day one. The death of a sponsor can arise and all kinds of circumstances can arise which are unforeseeable. Without such regulations, or if such regulabe tions are brought forward and thought to be inadequate and disallowed, there is no safety net. I appreciate the minister's goodwill on this point. However, this is a matter that has commended itself to considerable public attention. A set of draft guidelines was the subject of discussion and comment in a Senate inquiry earlier. The government has had ample time to settle the terms of those regulations. Its failure to do so, in a circumstance where it now has the parliament's approval to change the law but has not yet made known to the public the nature of the safety net it has promised from the outset, is a matter of grave concern. I simply ask the minister to give such assurances as he may that this matter is not going to be allowed to fester and that we will have those regulations before us for consideration not just in the Senate but in this House without delay.",39
25,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"There has been no intention on the government's part to unduly delay the consideration of these issues. Let me make it clear within the context of the points I made during the debate that we are looking at changed circumstances. That is what the government was committed to. It is important to us to have them on the table, discussed and preferably dealt with in a way that we can all agree upon. Obviously, if the matter ends in disagreement, that has consequences. The consequences are that we will go for a long period without regulations to provide that. I hope the opposition agrees with the government that that would be a very undesirable outcome. My understanding is that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the department will be endeavouring to facilitate discussion as soon as possible on the guidelines in a draft form to see whether we can come to a form of regulation that we can be reasonably satisfied will meet with the approval of both houses of parliament. Both sides are cognisant of the difficulty that a failure to agree could occasion. That is something about which we both have to be conscious. While we know that the Senate can by resolution waive the six-month period-that may be a factor in people's consideration if there is going to be any posturing on the issue-obviously from our point of view, and from your point of view, given the comments you have made, it is better that we try to work out an agreed approach. I understand that the government wants to do that with the utmost goodwill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

26,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. For the benefit of the House, the government amendments moved and passed in the Senate relate to the commencement date. I will refer to a couple of those issues for the benefit of members of the House. I spoke to the shadow minister earlier. The opposition has no problems with the government amendments. The advance payment of the service pension income support supplement is related to the commencement date. The variation to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 changes to the date of royal assent. In terms of the advance payments of service pension income support supplements, there are three parts to this budget measure. One part will increase the maximum advance payment available to pensioners who also receive a war widow or war widower's pension. Another part will introduce a limitation to one advance payment in any year. Lastly, a purpose provision is to be removed. There is very strong support for this measure. Just prior to Christmas, in the subexpectation that this bill would receive the attention of the Senate before we rose at the end of last year, there was an enormous lot of interest in these changes to this veterans' affairs legislation. I would also like to touch on the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. There are three defence service homes measures that were to commence from 1 January this year. As this bill was not dealt with prior to the House rising at the end of last year, that commencement date of course could not apply without it being retrospective. The extension of eligibility for defence service home loans to those who served in operational areas of Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and whose first service commenced on or before 14 May 1985, is catered for in these amendments within the bill, although not the amendments we are considering at the moment. There is the extension of eligibility to veterans and veteran widowers of World War II ex-service women, notwithstanding any previous assistance as a veteran. Further, the reduction of the interest rate for new additional advances goes from 10 per cent per annum to either 6.85 per cent per annum or a rate resulting in borrowers paying no more than the effective interest rate of 6.85 per cent in the majority of circumstances. I note, too, that is certainly a welcome measure for those people with those loans. There are other measures in the bill as a whole, one of which I would like to refer to. Once this bill receives royal assent, it will enable the government to increase payments to Victoria Cross recipients to bring payments from our government into line with those paid to Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom by their government. I do not think there is any opposition to the proposition that this will in fact be a retrospective payment, backdated to August 1995, which was the date on which Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom received an increased allowance. There are three Victoria Cross recipients in Australia who are still alive: Sir Roden Cutler, Keith Payne and Ted Kenna. I think all in this House will agree that this bill ensure that we will be able to continue to maintain the value of their award. It is a continuing way of honouring our commitment to those who received our highest military award. I wish to thank all those who have participated in the debate in this House and in the Senate. I also wish to thank the shadow minister for ensuring that there has been quick passage of these amendments through the House. It will enable us to continue to honour the service of all those who served, and it will continue our commitment to ensure that, wherever there are anomalies or wherever we can seek to amend the Veterans Entitlement Act, we improve and build on the commitment that we have given to those who served this nation. I thank the House.",40
27,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"As stated by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), these amendments to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill are largely technical. The shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), has advised that the opposition supports these amendments. I will take the opportunity to make some brief comments. I join with the minister in his few words in relation to the Victoria Cross recipients who are still alive. It is clearly a bipartisan matter that every assistance should be afforded them and that the VC should continue to be regarded with the highest esteem in our nation. I recall having the pleasure of being in the company of the three VC winners referred to about 18 months or two years ago when the former minister, Con Sciacca, in the former government presented them with a gold pass for travel. That was a fitting thing for the nation to provide, and I know it was done on a bipartisan basis on that occasion. It is appropriate that we ensure that the standing of this high honour is maintained. For the record, I should note the opposition's regret that a number of amendments that we sought in the Senate were opposed by the government-in particular, the abolition of the earnings credit scheme. We sought the will abolition of the concessions on the first $2,000 or $4,000 of financial assets under the deeming. The government did not support us in that. The introduction of a new division which has the effect of increasing lump sum compensation preclusion periods sadly has all been lost. That is a matter of regret to us and, I suspect, to a number of ex-service personnel. But we support the amendments which are before the House at the moment, and we are happy to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA  That orders of the day Nos 2 and 3, government business, be postponed until the next sitting.

"".",41
28,Mr FILING,Unknown,"In resuming my contribution to the debate on the telecommunications bills I will deal with a couple of key areas. One is the question of 1996 Internet access and the problem created by the fact that Telstra is not only the carrier but also an Internet service and access provider. This gives Telstra an extraordinary ability to be able to control the marketplace in which Internet services are offered. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Small Business and  because this impacts on small business. This is an area where small business can be quite significantly affected, particularly those small businesses that are actually involved in the provision of Internet services. We have the ludicrous situation where 1996 Telstra is more or less expected to govern itself in providing fair access to the facilities that the Internet service providers need in order to conduct their own businesses, at the same time competing with Telstra in the same marketplace. That is an extraordinary conflict of interest. It provides Telstra with an extraordinary amount of control over the marketplace in Internet access. As a former member of the Liberal Party and as someone who values competition policy, I believe it is an absolute disgrace that the government is prepared to allow this to continue. I have to say that this problem arose under the previous government but, of course, it is a matter that has developed at some speed over the last few years, so I suppose one could offer the excuse that they were not prepared for it. This is now well documented. There is a Senate committee of inquiry looking into it. At the end of the day, anybody with a remote interest in this issue could have foreshadowed that there was going to be this almost incredible conflict of interest in tion to the services and responsibilities of Telstra. As the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs would well know, this is an area of small business that is growing rapidly. It employs principally younger peopleanother aspect of coalition policy in relation to employment. Yet we have the situation where the independent Internet service providers are forced by this government to offer their services knowing that they have to rely on the carrier to provide them with the resources and then compete against the carrier in the same marketplace. I would have thought that that was an absolute contradiction of the government's commitment to competition policy. If there is going to be fair and open access to telephony and data transmission services and all the related areas, then quite clearly Telstra should withdraw from Internet service provisioncertainly access provision-or there ought to be some means of regulating what is clearly an unsatisfactory conflict of interest. I would be interested to know whether the minister for small business is himself interested in contributing to ensuring that the small businesses involved in this are not being unfairly manipulated by Telstra's control of the provision of services. The other aspect is the question of timed calls for Internet access. Telstra is talking about timed calls because they say that the use of data transmission on untimed charged calls interferes with residential calls, with voice calls, and is a drain on the profitability in the provision of voice calls. In actual fact, there is a very good level of information to the contrary to show that data transmission, which often occurs at non-peak periods, contributes to reducing the cost per call of telephony. The concept that Telstra would introduce timed charges for Internet access is another extraordinary potential abuse of Telstra's position as the carrier and Internet service provider. I ask the minister who is here, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairsalthough, it would be interesting to know the views of the Minister representing the rela- Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Warwick Smith) on this-how on earth Telstra would propose to detect data calls so that they could provide time charges. It begs the question whether this would involve some means of identifying the numbers that are using data transmission on a regular basis. How will they do this in the absence of any technological ability to detect data transmissions on that basis at present? It is a well known fact in the industry that Telstra is not in a position to do it and therefore would be required, in order to achieve this, to identify the numbers using data transmission. We had the situation the other day where it became known that people who use mobile phones on the digital network are able to be located thanks to the fact that every so many seconds there is a transmission between the phone that is switched on and the exchange or the nearest station. This means in essence that the location of any person who uses a digital telephone-bearing in mind that the analog telephone network is to be abolished in due course-may be able to be identified. As a former policeman, one could argue that this is a great step forward in law enforcement. But, as someone who is thoroughly opposed to Big Brother and those sorts of aspects of George Orwell's Nineteen EightyFour, this presents an awful scenario for the future where, by accessing the telecommunication carrier's records and the continuous monitoring of where particular phones are located, people's movements can be detected. I would have thought that that was anathema to the vast majority of Australians who value greatly their individual liberty and freedom to move around. If we are going to see this in any way expanded then, in my view, this would be to the detriment of our free and democratic community. I just hope that will be knocked on the head as soon as possible. But I wanted to make the point that if they are going to expand that by identifying people who use data-in other words, by using the numbers of the people who use the Internet-then this is another step towards a Big Brother scenario where the telecommunications carriers become accumulators of information about citizens that can be used by government agencies in goodness knows whatever functions in relation to the movements and the conduct of business of those citizens. I want touch on one last aspect of this particular area: Telstra's universal service obligations. The government claims that they will preserve universal service obligations on the part of Telstra. My view is that when you read the speech of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, on the question of universal provisions you see the fairly ambiguous nature of what he had to say. When you look at who is advising the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), you see that some of the advice he is receiving is anti-USO preservation. Then it is understandable that there is an ambiguity about the commitment to universal service obligations post-July 1997. Those members of the National Party, or those members representing regional or rural electorates, ought to be really looking this very closely indeed, because it is my view that USOs will be progressively withdrawn post July 1997. I might also point out in relation to service obligations of the telecommunication providers that a section of the community in my electorate, which is within the metropolitan area of Perth, already have timed call charges. They have always had timed call charges. In fact, because of the zoning arrangements within the Perth metropolitan area, they are still paying timed call charges notwithstanding that the metropolitan area of Perth-in other words, the area that is considered to be the suburbs of Perth-has spread to touch their areas. It is an absolute disgrace that we have a situation where in my electorate, a city electorate, we have consumers who do not pay timed call charges living within a few kilometres of other consumers who do pay for timed calls. I have yet to see any rational explanation by Telstra for this other than the fact that we have this zoning system. Again, I have small businesses in my area who are obliged to ring and pay for timed calls to contact other branches of their business within Perth, within the same metropolitan area. It seems to me incredible that a government that is committed to charges for untimed local calls should allow this situation to prevail in the Perth metropolitan area. It is indicative of perhaps the real attitude of the government in relation to USOs, timed calls and other aspects of telecommunications telephony provision that this has not been stopped over a long time. As we well know, at the end of the day it is the asset values of Telstra that are going to bring the greatest return to the government through its sale. These built-in subsidies-like the ability to site telecommunication towers and to dig cables wherever they want to-are an addition to the net asset value of Telstra when it comes to be sold. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work out that a government that is going to rely on the Telstra sale to do a lot of other things is not going to interfere unduly with those particular rights. Any backbenchers on the government side at who consider that what is being enacted in this legislation is going to change the situation ought to think again. I can teU you that, in my view and I think in the view of a number of other people, the telecommunications towers and the cabling will continue on as it has done in the past. I notice with interest the technological aspect of the changes to the telecommunications towers. I can tell you that has been the excuse used in the past by the telecommunication carriers.

29,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown,"It was not that long ago that telecommunications services in Australia were provided by three legislated monopoly carriers: OTC, Telecom and Aussat. Although the Davidson report in 1982 favoured increased private sector involvement and competition within the Australian telecommunications industry, it was almost 10 years before Optus Communications entered the market, with Vodafone becoming the third mobile operator in Australia in 1993. In short, this legislative package of communications bills encourages and facilitates the industry transition from one still dominated by government monopolies to one driven by vigorously competitive markets. Although our telecommunications industry is small compared with many other developed countries, it is one of the fastest growing segments of our economy, increasing from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1989 to an estimated four per cent in 2000. Internationally, Australia ranks only behind New Zealand amongst OECD countries with the highest telecommunications growth rates. Australians are the world's hungriest consumers of emerging technologies. Consider the following: in mid-1995, there were over two million mobile phone subscribers in Australia. By the end of 1996, that number had jumped to around four million customers. Among the OECD countries, only the Scandinavian nations have experienced a faster growth rate. Further, Australians represent approximately one million of the 60 million or so Internet surfers worldwide and have the second highest level of computer usage in the entire world. According to British Telecom Asia Pacific, whereas voice-as distinct from electronic data such as the Internetaccounted for 90 per cent of phone traffic two or three years ago, that proportion is down to 70 per cent today. In the United States, phone lines already carry more electronic data, such as the Internet traffic, than voice data. The rest of the world seems to follow that trend. In fact, according to Telstra, Internet growth is set overtake telephony on its national and internation tional networks by 2000. Australia has approximately 16 facsimile machines per 100 workers, which is well ahead of the United States and Europe which have eight fax machines per 100 workers. It is just behind Japan which has approximately 17 machines per 100 workers. Further, Australian consumers have much greater access and are comparatively bigger users of electronic funds transfer at point of sale-or EFTPOS as it is commonly knownthan our counterparts in other technology telefriendly countries such as Japan, Germany and the United States. Approximately 96.4 per cent of Australian households have at least one telephone line. Based on the high penetration rates of telephones, televisions and personal computers, the International Telecommunications Union, the lTV, in Geneva names Australia as among the top five countries with the greatest potential to profit from the developments in superhighways. To make the most of technological changes, as well as the ongoing growth in the telecommunications industry, Australia needs this package of legislation, together with the related post-1997 legislative reforms which set down the appropriate pro-competition and pro-user framework for this dynamic industry. This government strongly believes that, if Australian businesses and consumers are to derive maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry, three principles are critical. Firstly, Australia must have a world-class telecommunications infrastructure, based on the latest mix of market driven technologies. Secondly, our industry must be open to a multitude of service providers with equal access to carrier facilities. Finally, we must have a competitive telecommunications market focused on driving prices down and the quality of services to consumers up. Each of these principles is reflected in the key parts of these bills. Firstly, one of the fundamental elements of the bills is the introduction of a truly open market for telecommunications infrastructure and services. There will be no limit on the number of carrier licences that may be issued. Amongst to other elements, the bills provide that a condifor obtaining a licence fot carriers is an industry development plan, unless exempted. The government believes that this will maximise the opportunities for Australian industry. Network rollout obligations will, thankfully, not be imposed on new carriers. Distinctions between fixed and mobile services under the existing legislation are removed. Secondly, a significant feature of multicarrier environment is that competitors inevitably will make use of each other's networks. The government recognises the importance of guaranteeing all Australians seamless end to end telecommunications serimportant vices-a telecommunications network which also allows any to any communication. The legistries lative framework includes a full interconnecAustralia. tion and access regime between carriers, service providers and their customers, the objective being that any user can communicate with any other user regardless of choice of carrier. That prevents us from going down the tragic path that has developed in the United States. Thirdly, a key component of this legislation relates to the shifting, except where clearly inappropriate, of the responsibility of regulament tion to the industry itself. The believes that greater reliance on self-regulation through industry developed codes is particularly important in a rapidly changing industry such as telecommunications. ever, the government also recognises that, certain circumstances, industry consensus not be possible. In such circumstances, legislation includes safeguard provisions to enable the regulator-the Australian Comproposed munications Authority-to establish standards or to arbitrate an outcome. Fourthly, the legislation demonstrates the government's commitment to ensure that that comprehensive and effective mechanisms are in place to promote and protect the rights consumers and fulfils our undertaking prior to the March 1996 election-in the statement known as Better Communications-to estabmember lish a world-class consumer framework. customer service guarantee sets out requirements relating to the connection of services, rectification of faults and keeping of appointrefer ments. It also sets down a streamlined means of compensation when these requirements not met. The universal service obligation is further clarified and updated and aligns the universal service regime with the post-1997 multicarrier environment. The legislation also extends the untimed local call obligation so that residential customers, such as those in my electorate, will a have the right to untimed non-voice local calls-for example, facsimiles, e-mails or connections with an Internet service provider-and voice calls. Businesses will have the right to untimed local voice calls. That is very not only for local businesses but particularly for players in various indusin some of the smaller cities around In conclusion, we must recognise that this legislative package will not transform the telecommunications industry overnight. While this is historic legislation, change of this magnitude is an evolving process. The coalition government firmly believes that the results of legislative change will be lower prices and better services for customers, both in the quality of service and in the developand implementation of advanced telegovernment communications services. This package of bills fulfils the government's election commitment as set forth in Better Communications. It brings about teleHowcommunications reform that encourages a in degree of competition unprecedented in may Australia and sets down a framework of the world-class consumer protection. We have received late notice of some amendments from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who is not in the chamber for thisdebate today. I would briefly like to address one of the amendments he has proposed. Specifically, it refers to the maintenance of the 1 July 1997 cut-off for of carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws. There is very little that can be said on the proposal from the honourable for Dobell, because his proposals are The nothing more than a cunning stunt. On many occasions allegations are made across the House and very few people actually to the real meaning of an allegation, so I have reached for my Australian Oxford are Mini-Dictionary-which, of course, is an authoritative source. I found the definition of 'cunning' to be 'skilled at deception, crafty, ingenuous'. If we go to the accusation of it being a cunning stunt, 'stunt' is defined as 'something unusual or difficult, done as a performance or to attract attention'. Out of this debate we have discovered quite conclusively that relevance deprivation syndrome is communicated by methods other than election losses. It is very regrettable that the member for Dobell should try to play this cunning stunt by introducing some less than sophisticated amendments to the motion for the second reading. What I can suggest is that Australian Labor Party has great form on this matter, especially in relation to its suggestion that there should be a cut-off for the carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws. As I walk the streets of my electorate-all 42 square kilometres of it; the second smallest electorate in the entire nation, which is perhaps why I am carrying a few pounds more than some may recognise-it is hard to believe that any government would permit the erection of overhead cables, the erection of black guitar string like spaghetti from household to household across the views of people living in the local streets and across the building line of buildings. There is only one group of people who are responsible for that: the Australian Labor Party. I can say with absolute confidence that if there has been a simple example in this House of enormous hypocrisy then it comes today through the member for Dobell, who has not even turned up to the debate, putting forward amendments which are suggesting that the Australian Labor Party is the guardian of the rights of local government. It was the Australian Labor Party that in 1991 legislated so that local government had absolutely no power to stop the erection of the overhead cables or to stop the telephone towers which sprout up like undisciplined mushrooms across our electorates. It is the Australian Labor Party that must accept absolute and complete responsibility. There is an old saying that when an ancien regime is about to collapse it makes a dying statement. The dying statement of that regime is effectively a very good example of why it is failing. The failing of the Australian Labor Party towards the end of their time in government was their failure to recognise their mistakes. They failed to recognise where they went wrong. The Australian people said in March last year 'You've got it wrong' to Paul Keating and to his mates in New South W ales. We know there are not very many of those mates at the moment; he is short of good friends. He can always speak to the telecommunications companies who have benefited from the 1991 Telecommunications Act, which permitted the carriers to have absolute carte blanche across the skies of Sydney and, in fact, across the skies of the entire nation. The hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party, particularly the honourable member for Dobell-who is usually more informed about these things than he has been on this occasion-to come into the House and put up a number of amendments which fly in the face of exactly the tune that he has been singing for the last six or seven years is an affront to the people of Australia. It is particularly an affront to the people of my electorate, who have had enough of the overhead cables and the mobile phone towers. There is only one group of people responsible for that, and it is the people that gave the immunities to the carriers in 1991. Thankfully they are on the other side of the House, they are in opposition, and it will take a hell of a long time for them to come back over here.",44
30,Mr ANDREN,Unknown,"The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) referred to his 42 square kilometres being strangled by the black spaghetti of the cabling process. Thank heavens I do not have to see that visual blot on the landscape as I drive around my 22Y2 thousand-or thereabouts-square kilometres. I think that the way that rash of cabling has been rolled out with very little planning in the process is an indictment on the former government. These series of telecommunications bills will usher in a new era of telecommunications in the country, a brave new world of communications competition. These measures will probably be passed with little but token opposition, as we know both the coalition and the Labor Party are slaves to deregulation and competition policies, whatever the cost in jobs lost, services rendered and assets forgone. Adherence to open slather competition combined with changing technology are perhaps two of the key reasons why unemployment in this country is so high, why youth unemployment is as high as 30 per cent, why middle aged, middle management jobs have been shed in the telecommunications industry and the power industry, to name just two in my electorate. The point I am making is that there can be a downside to deregulation and open slather competition. More people are waking up to that fact, and as time goes on I would like to think that government in this country will realise the need to move forward but to also look after our most important asset-our people. Throughout last year I was one of the most outspoken critics of the partial privatisation Telstra, for that reason. Telstra is one of the major employers in my electorate, particularly in Bathurst. It is my very real fear that as the telecommunications market is opened up many of those rural jobs will go. Certainly many hundreds of new jobs will also be created in the industry, but the new players in this industry will not be tripping over themselves or their cabling to come to regional centres like Bathurst. We all know that Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world and the cities are where the money is to be made, and that is where the new players will be heading. You have only to look at the effects that the deregulation of the banking industry is having on rural communities. In the cities you will see aggressive new competitors like that favourite of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), Aussie Home Loans. We have heard this week that it is moving into the business market. It has no branch network, extremely low overheads and is eating away at the market share of the major banks. To compete with this lender and other new entrants with low overheads, the major banks have had to seriously cut back their branch networks and, of course, country towns have been the hardest hit. In western New South Wales more than 40 banks have closed over the past few years, and they are still closing their doors. Sure, Aussie Home Loans is providing a great service and no doubt employing hundreds in its Parramatta headquarters, but the bush loses out in this brave new world of banking competition. Never have our banks made so much money by employing so few. The face-to-face advice local bank managers once provided in the bush is disappearing, so the chances of more fanners getting into trouble with loans and bad lending practices is increasing. A good phone system is so essential in the bush these days because country people seem to spend half their time hanging on the end of the phone trying to get through to some toll free number to carry out basic business or find out about services in places like Sydney. Austudy is a classical example at the moment. Only this week the Western District Health of Fund in my electorate has been told by the health department that it cannot increase its fees because the department believes its management costs are too high. Never mind that Westfund still charges significantly less than the major health funds. The department ignores the fact that Westfund also has a large branch network providing essential face to face services and jobs in country towns in my electorate and the neighbouring electors of Macquarie and Parkes. The health department says, 'You don't need these branches. You can do it all over the phone. Just put in a toll free 1800 line.' Sadly, that is the mentality in the corridors of power in Canberra. It is also the type of attitude that country people detest. Country people have been missing out for a long time, and it is essential that they do not miss out on the telecommunications revolution. We are already seeing that they are missing out in crucial areas such as Internet access simply because, while city people tie up phone lines all day surfing the net, country kids have their time rationed because calls to the nearest Internet provider often incur SID rates. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said, when referring to the opposition's amendments to this bill last evening, that the government is already expressing concern at the cost of upgrading rural services. I really have grave doubts about the advantages that country people, particularly in the short term, will enjoy from this competitive new situation. It is hardly surprising that as a member for a country electorate a large part of my time is spent dealing with telecommunications related complaints. While I commend many aspects of this series of bills, in some respects it seems we are effectively signing our names on the dotted line with so much of the fine print still to be sorted out. One of the more welcome initiatives contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill--one of the 11 bills in the cognate debate-is the clause that will hopefully encourage carriers to share infrastructure such as trenches and communication towers. That is a very positive move that probably should have happened years ago before all these mobile phone base stations started popping up everywhere. In my electorate at Mount Lambie, between Bathurst and Lithgow, there are a plethora of towers all 500 metres away from a particular property. Not only is it a vision blot on the landscape but, with so many questions still being raised about the potential health threats from these sorts of communication towers, you can understand why the residents are alarmed. I am sure most of my fellow members can tell similar stories. I heard the member for Moore (Mr Filing) talking in the House earlier this week about a series of phone towers in front and behind a school in his electorate and the distress that that has caused. So the concern expressed by the opposition, especially by the member for Dobell, over the extension of the cut-off for three months is of particular concern because an orgy of cable rollouts and mobile phone tower constructions will obviously occur in that period and local government will be able to do precious little about it. I wonder what the low impact control is that the minister is supposed to have discretion over. Fortunately in my electorate we have so far been spared the blight of pay TV cables being strung up along all the streets, as the member for Northern Sydney alluded to had happened in his electorate. How absurd was the environmentally friendly solution to the Sydney aerial cabling shemozzle by making the cabling grey instead of black. What an environmentally sensitive solution that was. Again this is a problem that should have been sorted out by the previous Labor government and to start trying to bring some sense to the situation now is shutting the gate after the horse has long gone. Interestingly though, while the bill says that telecommunication carriers must give their competitors access to facilities and suggests, in the case of disputes, that it will be left to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to try to arbitrate, it does not exactly spell out how long the parties involved have to try to negotiate a solution before the ACCC intervenes. Councils will be rolled by the costs of litigation brought by the heavyweight telecommunication providers. That is what I mean by signing on the dotted line while the fine print still has to be sorted out. Can you honestly see two aggressive telecommunication companies reaching a settlement on sharing each other's facilities? It is a bit like asking the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, to agree to share the same line at the same time. It is a pretty fair bet it is not going to happen. This is just one example of a crucial detail that still has to be sorted out. Another example is the set period that time carriers will have to rectify faults or problems with services. I think the temptation will be to say that if customers are not happy with one carrier they can vote with their feet and take their business elsewhere. But what happens in country areas where there is no competition and people still rely on Telstra? This time last year in my electorate a small rural exchange near Bathurst broke down one weekend leaving about 40 customers without phones. It just happened to be one of the most dangerous weekends for bushfires last summer. It took Telstra until Monday to alert the dedicated local staff to get the exchange working again. Clearly, that sort of response time is not good enough. A working telephone can mean the difference between life and death, which goes without saying. While Telstra remains government owned and Australian owned, for a short time only, I was at least able to write to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and have this poor response highlighted in the hope it will not happen again. But, once we wash our hands of Telstra and leave the whole system open to the market forces to dictate what happens, I will guarantee such problems will only get worse in the bush. Believe me, I am not having a go at Telstra. The local work force, which has been cut back severely in recent years, is working very hard to try to provide a first rate service and management is always more than helpful at a local level when it comes to trying to resolve problems. Another problem that still has to be sorted out is the portability of telephone numbers. Last year we saw the Prime Minister officially call Optus' s first local call customer, once again heralding, as we were told, a new era in competition. But, according to recent news reports, Optus is well behind in its targets in signing up local call customers partly because at the moment,customers cannot change companies and keep the same phone number. Obviously, if you have had the same number for years you are reluctant to give it up. I am told that the lack of phone number portability is not really the fault of the indusbuted try or the regulators but more to do with the technology. Still, it is another example that, unless we get all the factors right, the brave new world of competition may produce great headlines for the business pages, maybe even greater profits for big business and the new shareholders of Telstra, but perhaps questionable benefits for the community, particularly in rural areas. Once again, I do not expect country phone customers will enjoy the benefits of local phone call competition in the near future-if ever-because, again, the profits are not there and the residential density is not great enough to warrant companies such as Optus stringing up their cables. Already country phone customers are severely disadvantaged when it comes to making local calls as Telstra's local call zones are seriously out of date and it refuses to look at any changes. Most companies review their tariffs and policies on an annual bases, but Telstra still insists that its local call zones, which were drawn up more than two decades ago, are still appropriate or, to use its words, generous by world standards. In my electorate we have the ridiculous example where you can make a call from Bathurst to Orange, or vice versa-a distance of 50 kilometres-for the cost of a local call. That is good. Yet, if you live in the village of Millthorpe, between Bathurst and Orange, you pay STD rates to call someone in Bathurst. Similarly, if you live in one of the small towns in the Cabonne Shire surrounding Orange-towns like Cumnock, all much closer than Bathurst is to Orange-you have to pay STD rates to call Orange. If you lived in, say, Canowindra back in the 1960s when the call zones were drawn up, it would not have mattered because you could have happily transacted most of your business in Canowindra and never ventured to Orange more than once or twice a year, and very rarely would you have needed to make an STD call--or a trunk call, as they were back then. But these days, as we all know, small country towns have suffered as a result of cutbacks by governme-t, banks and other enterprises. The rural downturn has contriand, of course, improved transport has made regional centres much closer. I am not suggesting we go back to the horse and cart, but I am suggesting regional and rural Australia will receive very patchy benefits from this improving technology. As a result, in the case of Canowindra, residents today do a lot of business with Orange and every phone call they make incurs an STD rate, and Telstra does not want to know about it. I have raised it with Telstra, but it argues that its old call zones are very generous and very appropriate despite the fact that they are decades old. It would be nice to sit back like a coalition MP and say to angry constituents, 'Don't worry, competition will fix it. Soon you will have a choice of local call carriers and prices will drop.' Don't hold your breath. Competition is not coming to the rescue and country businesses and consumers will continue to suffer. While metropolitan Australia moves into information superhighway of the 21st century, small town Australia struggles with technoldemand ogy and policies already more than 30 years old. These bills also leave open the way the phasing out of the analog mobile phone system by the year 2000, although they also opening the way for the minister to intervene and grant an extension. I would strongly urge the minister to the way up now for analog services to remain in country areas. The mobile phone services have been a boon to farmers, allowing to carry out business from the tractor Digital services in country areas have proved to be inadequate and fail to provide the coverage as the analog service. Areas like Rylstone-Kandos, already battling bank closures and depleted hospital services, still cannot get a word from Telstra on any sort of Australia. mobile service. Assuming these bills are passed, it will be up to the communications minister to take a very active and vigilant role to ensure that, we head down the path of deregulation and competition, policy changes are designed to benefit all Australians. Certainly, have been made in these bills for cross-subsiThe dies, but that will not be enough on its own. The fine print that still has to be sorted out Australia. must make sure that, wherever people live, big business interests are not put ahead of the community's interests. With these quite strong reservations, I do commend the bills to the House.",47
31,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"As people would be aware, the former Labor government, under the ministry of the A member for Dobell (Mr Lee) as the Minister roll-out for Communications, announced the informainevitably tion superhighway but, in reality, in regional local calls. and rural Australia they delivered nothing more than the equivalent of a dusty old track. This is the government that has listened and will listen to the bush and will deliver what is needed. This government is committed to safeguarduniversal ing consumers and will ensure universal service arrangements to all people, regardless of whether they are living in urban, remote or rural areas, and a provision of a minimum the standard package of telecommunications services because all Australians deserve and access to a quality, affordable telecommunications system whether they are in for private residences or conduct a business. I would have thought this sentiment would are have been paramount to any government, including the previous one. It may, therefore, be interesting to note that Dr Terry Cutler, a open leading telecommunications consultant and chairman of the Information Policy Advisory Council, in 1996 in the Financial Review of them 23 December predicted the next wave of seat. market restructuring would be in nonmetropolitan Australia. He also said that the same seven-year duopoly between Telstra and Optus-price limited competition in capital cities-did absolutely nothing for nationwide competition, in particular in regional and rural I notice the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has come into the House. He has had a lot to say about telecommunications in as regional and rural Australia. Therefore, it is rather relevant, and also surprising, that on 8 May 1996, when speaking on the Telstra bill, provisions the member for Hunter said: member for Lyons . . . and I are the only members in this place capable of defending rural Does the member for Hunter remember that? Mr Fitzgibbon-It is still true.",51
32,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"Listen on, because I want that point remembered whilst we dissect their performance in regional and rural in relation to telecommunications. Further in the same speech, he said: privati sed Telstra will not cross-subsidise the of cable to rural areas, price caps will go and gone will be the days of untimed The purpose of the Telecommunications goat (Universal Service Levy) Bill 1996 is to impose a levy on all of the carriers for their losses resulting from supplying loss making services in the course of fulfilling those service obligations. The people of regional and rural Australia will be assured through the universal service arrangements that all people, regardless of whether they live in urban, rural or remote areas, will have equitable access at a minimum to a standard package of telecommunications services such as payphones, prescribed carriage services and standard telephone services. As I said when the member for Hunter was not in the House, the former Labor government delivered a dusty old goat track, not the information superhighway. Further, service costs will be regulated by price control under the Telstra Corporation Act or the Telecommunications Bill 1996much to the dismay of the Labor scaremongers. To be specific, price controls are structured to deliver real benefits to rural and remote customers as well as customers in urban areas. A price ceiling of 25c applies to untimed local phone calls from private phones and 40c from public phones. A range of services supplied to residential customers are subject to a price cap of CPI-X, meaning their price must decline in real terms. This shoots down the argument put forward by the member for Hunter. The member for Hunter on that same day, 8 May 1996, said: Whenamongst othersthe member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and all other honourable members on the other side of House go to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to complain that telephone and other telecommunications services such as payphones are being wound down in their electorates, do you know what they will be told? You guessed it ... 'We cannot intervene.' Intervene means listen. The member for Hunter had everyone guessing wrong; this minister does listen, and will continue to listen to the people of regional and rural Australia. On a more personal note relating to listening, I would like to recall an incident in February 1996, during the election, when I was approached by the members of East Maitland Community Residents Action Group headed up by an energetic lady, Aisne Ballard. It seems that they had been lobbying for the reinstatement of the public phone in Morton Street, East Maitland. In the course of this lobbying, both I and the then shadow minister, Richard Alston, met with Anna Rebiro, May Bull, Rita Fitzgibbon-no relation to the member for Hunter-Mary Barrett and Bill Ballard from the action group. It seems that they had contacted the former member for Paterson on more than one occasion. But there was never a follow up, any action or letters of support from this member. Yet these are the very people that Labor purported to look after. They even claimed them as supporters! These people are ex-blue collar workers who reside in public housing, and some of them have seen the better side of 60, but Labor abandoned them. They just did not want to know about the problem. But guess what? We welcomed them with open arms and we have listened, and we will continue to listen. I am glad to hear that the member for Hunter and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who is now in the chamber, are the only Labor representatives of the people in regional and rural Australia. I do not think that the people of Australia could put up with any more such representation than what they have from that side. As I said, the previous government had removed their payphone-:--for some their only the means of verbal communication with relatives and services. Considering how much the Labor government claimed to care about rural and regional Australia and how much they represented and supported the battlers in Australia, the local member, the former member for Paterson, walked away. He did not want to know about the problem. But that payphone is now operating; we delivered because we and Minister Alston actually listened to what the people had to say. We can go on. The former member for Paterson made much to do about the need to improve mobile telephone communication in the Hunter, but again, remembering their commitment to regional and rural Australia, what did they deliver? You guessed it: nothing! The member for Lyons said in this House on 21 November 1996: Most of these isolated areas barely have telephones or decent television reception, let alone lines to allow such things as electronic data transfer. So only a small proportion of regional Australia currently has access to mobile phones. There will not be an increase in infrastructure in the less populated areas after privatisation. Even if there was, the mobile phone does not allow the same interactive communication that is available on the Internet or e-mail. I have to say you are wrong there. He continues: It does not allow CD-ROM. I do not know how you use a CD-ROM over the telephone, but that is nitpicking. Here is the classic part: It cannot give access to the information systems of the world in the same way that is possible with a physical cable. Without Telstra's current ability to cross-subsidise services, the regional areas will forgotten and discounted and they will not receive the roll out of the cable. I watched a TV show a couple of weeks ago. Just by chance I got home early enough. It was a TV show called Sliders. It sounded interesting. Let me quickly describe it to you because it is about the future. Mr Martin-All the kids watch that.",51
33,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"I am a kid at heart. I do not mind a bit about that. I am one of the young people. There was a window and they went through the window into the future. Members on that side of the House, particularly these two sitting in the chamber nowthe member for Hunter and the member for Lyons-have slid through that window. They stand up and talk about problems as though they have not been in government for the last 13 years. They have slipped 13 or 20 years into the future as though they have not been in government. The member for Hunter classically gets up and says, 'I was not a part of the government and I had no say.' But-I stand to be corrected-I think you were working for your father, the former member for Hunter, and advising him. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-The member for Paterson is straying a little from the question before the House.",53
34,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"I accept that. You would think that they had been in opposition for 13 years, not in government. Perhaps these two members on the other side are too embarrassed to admit it. Since then we have had a dawning of a new era for the bush, because since 2 March we have listened and we have made it easier to hear the people in the bush. I am proud to report that this government and the minister, whom the member for Hunter accuses, has listened again and did deliver in the form of a digital mobile telephone tower for Gloucester. Yesterday I had the Mayor of Gloucester, Barry Ryan, and the General Manager, Norm Macleod, visit me in this House to discuss matters about regional and rural Australia, particularly their area. Let me report that they were ecstatic that this government has listened and has delivered a digital phone tower. Now be up in Gloucester we have first-class, quality mobile phone services. So where do we as a government stand with regard to regional and rural communications? Allow me to educate those representatives on the other side that are part of the true believers band. This government recognises the key role telecommunications play in rural and remote Australia and the need to foster the development of a robust, competitive and efficient industry. To facilitate this, the government has initiated a three-pronged strategy: introducing open competition and enhancing consumer safeguards, achieving this by allowing specialised or regional service providers to enter small markets and target the needs of rural and regional users. By doing so, licence agreements and costs are minimal. There are a few restrictions on technologies and, while protecting the community's interests, service obligations are not onerous and are consistent with those applying to larger companies in other advanced economies. There will be no barriers to satellite operators including low earth orbiting satellites, a technology specifically designed with a view to servicing sparsely located regions and capable of increased access to handheld mobile services in the remotest of areas. In addition, the government's regional telecommunications infrastructure funds will be available to be used to encourage the use and development of telecommunications services and facilities in regional areas. The RTIF will be established as a trust fund, at $50 million per annum over a five year period, commencing in 1997-98. Allocation will be on a pro rata basis to each state according to the population living in remote and rural areas. Therefore, the RTIF has been structured specifically to be community driven and assist regional communities in the identification of needs and development of innovative, sustainable solutions unique to their particular needs. Let me assure this House that I will be putting up my hand for the people of Paterson, as I am sure the member for Lyons and the member for Hunter will be for their areas. The goal of the RTIF is to provide rural users with high speed data communications, the Internet and utilisation of mobile telecommunications. As a result of increased competition, service providers are likely to increase their interest and expand into rural and remote Australia. Telstra will be digitalising its future mode of operations and is looking at providing high capacity network access for remote customers through its remote Australia telecommunications enhancement program. Yet, not to be left out of the race, the 'Yes' company, Optus, is spending tens of millions of dollars doing the same, emulating the goals of the RTIF. Competition is very healthy and may we have much more of it in our area. Finally, another government initiative is the customer service guarantee which will provide real benefits for rural and remote customers. Customer service guarantees require service providers to comply with the ACA determined standards and will apply to both universal and other service providers. In essence, service providers will be required to join and comply with the telecommunications industry scheme, protect personal information and the content of the communications, provide access to emergency calls free of charge, provide directory assistance services-and, as we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say in this House yesterday, at no fee-provide itemised billing and provide carrier preselection and diaIcode override. Having said all that, on 19 February that minister for communications, Minister Alston, who does listen-who the member for Hunter claims will not listen-will be visiting the electorate of Paterson and, during the day, will be visiting Dungog, a town not 70 kilometres from the heart of Newcastle. This township, despite their many pleadings to the former member for Paterson and the government, still has no mobile phone service. But I am determined to deliver. Let me assure you again: we are committed, as we said in the election, and we will deliver. We will deliver a mobile phone service to the people of Dungog and the rest of rural and regional Australia.What do those who claim to be the only members in this place capable of defending rural Australia say right now?",53
35,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"-Let me comment on some of the pretty broad ranging aspects of what the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) had to say. They were pretty broad. They do not really deal with many of the issues for people that live in regional Australia or live in the bush, issues like digital data capacity on which a report came down a week or so ago that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has been trying to shunt away. When the member for Paterson· has the strength to take up this issue and tackle Minister Alston in the party room on the issue of what the people in the bush are going to get, then I will give him some credit. But to just come into the House and to say a lot of words is not going to achieve the result that people in the bush need. The issue before the House is a huge package of legislation which currently regulates the communications industry and overhauls the current industry structure. My interest is in respect of a small part of this, but it is the most important-that is, the universal service regime. This includes a section on universal service obligation. The member for Paterson is now scurrying out of the chamber. He will not sit here and listen to what I have to say. No, he was able to attack me while I had to sit here, and you gave him good protection, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I said, the biggest problem is the definition and the future definition of the standard telephone service. In the past we have had a universal service obligation that basically set a standard telephone service. This issue is an evolutionary thing. It was something that was coming up to whatever government was in power at this time. It is not a matter of saying that the past government could have rectified or could have done something on this. This is a matter of evolution, and the process is ongoing. It is coming up to decision-making time now. Decisionmaking time happens to be while you are in government, and you have to make that decision. How you make that decision about the universal service regime is going to be the key to what happens in regional Australia. Going from a standard telephone service obligation to a digital data capacity is what it is all about, especially in parts of my state of Tasmania. If we do not achieve a broader perspective than what the universal service regime says now, we will not be able to pass into the new era and get on the superhighway and all that that encompasses. It will leave our industry, our educational facilities and everything else far behind. The minister that was being praised by the member for Paterson set up a committee to give him some ideas and to give him a report on this matter. He put quite a lot of people on that committee, called the Review Group: people from the National Farmers Federation, consumers of telecommunications and all the main operators in the industry-Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. He really set up a pretty powerful group to review the very essence of his legislation. He also has had some relationship over a period with a bloke named Professor Henry Ergas-a visiting professor at the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland-in relation to academic studies. That review committee, that is, everyone from the National Farmers Federation to the major carriers, to consumer organisationsthis would be all news, probably, to the member for Paterson--came down with a review that said that we should go to a universal obligation that incorporates digital data capacity, that is, to put people on the Internet in the bush, to give them the opportunity of connecting to the superhighway because, unless we put that obligation in, there will be no way, in a system that is driven by the market, that we will have any opportunity of achieving that in the bush because the economics will not stack up and places like my state of Tasmania will probably miss out. Four hundred thousand people will not be a big enough market, let alone all those other small regional centres that a lot of people who sit on that side of the House would claim to represent. So they are not across the issue. Otherwise, as I said, like the member for Paterson, they would be in the party room, into the minister saying, 'What does this actually mean for us out in regional Australia?' It means that those in regional Australia will fail to achieve their potential and or to have the opportunity of using modern communications for the future economic development of their regions. So after setting up this high-powered committee and getting an old friend, a professor, onto the committee, he then accepts the committee's report. But there is a minority report from the professor from New Zealand, who cans what everybody else has done and says that the country cannot afford it, that it is going to cost $200 million, et cetera. So he comes into wipe off the bush, to wipe off regional Australia. That was his job. I think he probably got a bit of a shock that the rest of the committee came down with a proposition which actually looked at the overall well-being of the country. They came down with a recommendation that the service obligation should include a digital data capacity. Of course the professor, the one-man band with the one-man band report, came down with his report. The minister lifted that report up and tried to give it as much status as the other nine people who sat on that committee. By doing so, he failed regional Australia and he failed the bush in every way possible. As I said, you have to change your position, and the member for Paterson and the other members on that side of the chamber have to take heart, get into their party room and basically make sure the minister does the right thing by the service obligation. The process has been extensively written up and I wanted to touch on a couple of the things put forward by Professor Ergas in his dissenting report, in which he really did pay out on the rest of the committee. In an article in the Financial Review, Steve Lewis wrote: Providing access to digital data services for all Australians by 2000 could impose a capitals cost to the telecommunications industry of up to $2.5 billion. I was mistaken. I said $200 million, but $2.5 billion was his claim. To go back to the quote, the $2.5 billion would 'lead to higher charges for residential consumers'. He is trying to say that everybody else is going to have to pay more to give this obligation to regional Australia. So he is running the minister's line and, I guess, if the minister's line is being run, that is the government's line, and that is the line of all those members from regional Australia because they are taking no different view. The member for Paterson did not take any different view in here this morning-so they are running the same line. It is very interesting to see the response to that from some of the other people who were on that committee. The assistant director of the National Farmers Federation, Ms Julie Austin, had something to say in the Financial Review on 30 January: I am very disappointed that Henry Ergas has put in a dissenting report, having gone thrcugh six of informed debate on this review. So these people of high capacity and of concern and understanding of the industry, who put in a lot of work for six months, have come down with a recommendation to government-and the old professor, who was put on by the minister to carry the day, has lobbed in with a little report to try to break up what everybody else has done. The minister has tried to use his weight to lift the report up as well but, of course, he has failed miserably. The minister has failed miserably because people are aware that, if this obligation is not changed and the government does not have an obligation to regional Australia, they will be the losers. It just fits into everything else that this government is doing to regional Australia. They are tearing every government service out of it and they have been doing that since the last budget. The review committee came down with a recommendation. After taking good evidence, they emphasised the need for the universal service obligations to include digital data capacity, so we can go from the old telephone with the old copper wires to a cable that can carry all the new forms of communications into a business or an education facility in regional Australia. You just cannot do that with a mobile phone, and I do not think the member for Paterson is aware of that. I do not think the mobile phone has the capacity to deliver that service. But I know that is the line that has been fed to all the members on the government back bench-that is, 'Everything is all right because everyone will have a mobile phone.' If you are going to have a mobile phone, you will pay time charges on that as well. So what about the regions? It is a little more complex and difficult than that. Unless it is done by Telstra, unless it is done as a service obligation right across our country, one heck of a lot of people are going to miss out on the opportunity of utilising this new technology. One of the few things we were able to fight for in my electorate in Tasmania was the opportunity for people to utilise the new months technologies and communications so they could become a part of the new world superhighway. That was slashed by a fellow Tasmanian, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. About 250 old Social Security computers were going to go on to the tip, but we had them installed in community organisations, in the back of town halls and in supper rooms in halls out in the byways of my electorate and in other parts of Tasmania, so that kids who had no access to computers and communities that had no access to networks were able to come in and utilise that eIN network-the community information network, as we called it. Those kids out in the isolated areas of my electorate got the opportunity to talk to kids in the United States of America. They did not have those opportunities before then, but of course that idea was a little too far and too visionary for ministers in this government. The government gave that idea a good old slice as the budget ran its course through the mysterious budget holes and black holes that kept emerging throughout the government. Now those black holes are starting to emerge on the ministers as they sit on the front bench every day. More black holes start to come across them. Even a black veil, I would say, is starting to emerge. Which ministers today will have a black veil dragged across their faces and will need other government members to stand and defend them? Will we have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) coming into the House again at 7 o'clock tonight? Well, parliament should rise at about 6, so will he come in at 5 o'clock today? Will he come in here to justify or rectify what he has said during question time? Will he have to make another explanation? The Prime Minister cannot stand up during question time and answer questions. He has to equivocate. He has to go back and check what he said and then come back into the House sometime later. The Prime Minister really has lost the plot. He does not know what is happening inside his government and has lost the overall role that he should be playing-that is, governing Australia. Mobile and digital phone coverage has not been extended to my electorate. There is no coverage in the lower east coast or the Tasman Peninsula. Mr Bob Baldwin-You have been going through that Sliders program again. Mrs DEANNE KELLYPUTY SPEAKER-I have on a number of occasions called the honourable member for Paterson to order.",54
36,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"It is very patchy in those areas. Parts of the central highlands of Tasmania are totally without coverage, as are Flinders and King islands. There are difficulties also experienced with UHF coverage for television in even populated areas like Norfolk and Queenstown. It has been a major concern. A whole variety of communications issues really do pose as a real difficulty throughout Tasmania. If we cannot link into the new world of communications, then we will be going backwards. It is only a universal service obligation in the act that will give us the opportunity to keep up. If you leave it to market forces to deliver it to regional Australia, it will not happen. The government will be condemned for doing that. The question of whether we are going to have to pay for calling 013 has not been ruled out yet. The minister in the Senate yesterday, in answer to two questions, said that it is still up there, and the Prime Minister had only said that it was something he would have to have a look at-another 'look at'. The Prime Minister is becoming known as the 'mirror''I will look into it and get back to the parliament.' It has not been ruled out, so that is another charge that could come in, and that should not happen. The Australian Consumers Association said that digital capacity is a vital tool for Australia when we are entering the 21st century. It is interesting that this discussion, as I have said, is being based around the dissenting report and not the main report. The chairman of the committee, Mr Jock Given, who is the Director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of New South Wales, found that it particularly disappointing. And rightfully so. If you put in six months of hard work, along with people from the industry and the consumer base, you would naturally be pretty disappointed when the minister puts more emphasis on one person's dissenting reportwhich everybody can see is a political exercise-than the work which otherwise is done on a fair-dinkum basis. The government has failed to give regional Australia an opportunity. It is failing to say, 'Yes, we will make sure that you are going to be on the superhighway; we will make sure that you are given opportunities; we will give you access to the new technology; we will make sure it is going out into regional Australia.' It is failing to do that, and it should be condemned by regional Australia for it. (Time expired)",57
37,Dr SOUTHCOTT,Unknown,"Boothby) (1.08 p.m.)I am pleased to join this debate on telecommunications. As a member, and a former candidate, I have been confronted with the situation where telecommunications carriers have had powers of land access and blanketstyle immunities-emergency powers, in effect-from both state and local planning and environment laws. It seems that in return for the financial risk that is associated with any major infrastructure development, the ALP made special access and immunity provisions for telecommunications carriers in their 1991 telecommunications code. The immunity provisions quite sensibly included such things as koalas and migratory birds but amazingly took no account of the concerns that local communities had ahout the potential health effects of mobile phone towers and took no account of state and local planning laws which relate to visual amenity. That immunity that the carriers have enjoyed has witnessed overhead cabling being duplicated and telecommunications towers being erected without reference to the local community. Fortunately, in South Australia there has been a strong emphasis on linking underground power to environmental or traffic issues. Installing underground power lines in new subdivisions has been made compulsory under state law since the early 1980s. Recently the state government announced a doubling of funding for undergrounding of powerlines, which is expected to result in 20 kilometres of powerlines being placed underground each year. It is the aim of this legislative package that any future development will necessarily incorporate extensive community consultation. After 1 July 1997, carriers must follow state and territory planning laws, with a threemonth exemption for installations which have already received approval and have commenced construction. It is my belief that a lack of meaningful consultation with relevant communities has contributed in large part to the atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty. This bill recognises that in the 1990s communities are more concerned with urban and environmental amenity and that the community is less inclined to accept the exemptIOns telecommunications companies have enjoyed in the past. The previous code allowed unreasonable behaviour. Unreasonable is surely the only way that you can describe Vodafone's decision to erect a mobile phone tower near the Mitcham Community Court-40 metres away from a kindergarten. Before they applied for approval to put the mobile phone tower at that site, their preferred option was to install a tower right next to the Mitcham Girls High School. That decision has placed the kindergarten's future in jeopardy and has resulted in a community which is frustrated at the lack of avenues of appeal they have against a telecommunications carrier. In fact, the last resort of the local community has been to picket the site for the last two months to prevent construction of this tower. Whilst I am aware that a South Australian government investigation concluded in the early part of 1996 that 'there are no substantiated or convincing biological effects that could lead to adverse health effects from exposure to radio frequency around base stations', I am pleased to be able to report that the government has committed $4Y2 million to the National Health and Medical Research Council for further research over the next five years into the possible contribution of mobile telephone towers to health problems, such as childhood leukemia. While the jury is still out, my sympathies lie with the parents of young children who wish to err on the side of caution. I do not think that is an unreasonable stance. Schedule 3, division 6, of the Telecommunications Bill provides: (1) The ACA must not issue a facility installation permit ... unless the carrier satisfies the ACA ... thatamongst other things(i) the carrier has made reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith with each proprietor whose approval is required ... for carrying out the installation; (d) the ... network to which the facilities relate is ... of national significance ... It must also satisfy the ACA that the facilities are relevant to the local network and of necessary advantage to the local community. In speaking in favour of the collection of bills that will govern the area of telecommunications after 1 July this year, I believe it is important to state clearly that the government is firmly committed to maintaining the universal service obligation. That is, under the telecommunications carriers universal service obligation, a standard telephone service must be made available to all people in Australia. It has never been the government's intention to water down such a regime. In fact, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) released just last Thursday two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded. The minister established the review to assess whether the rapid changes in technologies and increased usage of advanced communications, like fax, e-mail and the Internet, warranted upgrading the standard telephone service. The minister has been 'particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service'. Apart from questions surrounding the issue of a universal service regime, the minister's comments illustrate the difficulty of legislating in an area where new technologies are literally emerging on a daily basis. The Australian of 21 January stated: The telecommunications industry (is) headed for an unprecedented shake-up in the next twelve months as new 'Internet-voice' technologies mature ... It continued: Hard on the heels of OzEmail's 'voice over the Internet' announcement by former Prime Minister Paul Keating, US based voice/data specialist Micom has announced a product that allows highquality voice traffic over the Internet. For traditional telephone companies, the new technologies represent a significant threat to long-held franchises for lucrative, long distance phone traffic. ... (With) cheap, Internet-based telephone calls will come a forced overhaul of the telecommunications industry on a global scale. In other words, no sooner has the target stopped and the legislator has been able to look down at the existing code with a view to amendment than the legislator has looked up only to find that the target has moved again. In such an environment, the responsible task of government is to set up a framework which will be able to accommodate ongoing rapid technology changes. Such a framework requires sound principles, and I am pleased to be able to report to the House that this package of legislation has incorporated such principles. The central theme of this legislative package is that the full benefits of a truly competitive market in telecommunications will be gained only when all carriers and service providers, including Telstra, are given the flexibility to engage in normal competitive conduct. Australian consumers will benefit from such flexibility. As stated above, attempts at codifying rigid regulations are exercises akin to reaping the wind. Underlying this central theme of competitiveness is the clearly enunciated and logically consistent principle of governments being vested with the power to prohibit the various forms of anti-competitive conduct. I speak here specifically of the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill and the recognition contained therein that total reliance on general trade practices law to constrain anti-competitive conduct might in some cases prove ineffective in avoiding the rapid damage to competition that this type of conduct could cause. This bill recognises the large residual market power that Telstra still has and seeks to supplement part 4 of the Trade Practices Act by increasing the ability of the ACCC to respond swiftly where anticompetitive conduct is evident. The likely benefits of competition are innumerable, but let me highlight one probable development. The Adelaide Advertiser recently reported that the cost of long distance their telephone calls from Adelaide will be cut by up to 48 per cent when AAP Telecommunications enters the residential phone market this year. The article said: Like other telecommunications carriers, AAPT is waiting for the July 1 deregulation of the industry, which is expected to increase already stiff competition. ... AAPT would offer cheaper rates than Telstra's standard published rates, with discounts of up to 48 per cent for calls to 'top 10' countrieswhich are countries like the UK, the United States and so on. ... Discounts for national calls would start at 21 per cent off Telstra' s standard rate, compared with at least 30 per cent off for large business customers. In closing, I would like to state that the open market entry arrangements envisaged by this package will not be implemented to the detriment of COnSumer and community welfare. Customer protection obligations applying to existing carriers-obligations such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, requirements to provide operator and directory assistance services and itemised bills, untimed local call obligations and the proposed customer service guarantee-will be extended to service providers as appropriate. I am particularly pleased that the powers and immunities of the carriers have been addressed and that carriers will nO longer be able to ignore state and local planning laws. I am pleased that the deficiencies of the ALP's 1991 code have been addressed.",58
38,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"I think it is fair to say that the most notable thing about the debate On this package of telecommunications legislation has been the absence of National Party MPs. Of course, this is nothing new. They have been absent for all of those pieces of legislation over the last 12 months in which rural and regional Australia has been not only abandoned but also outright attacked. I did notice that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) was in here doing a little bit of bleating. He has not afforded me the same courtesy as I had afforded him by coming into this chamber and listening to what he had to say-nonsensical as I knew it would be. I am disappointed that he has exited the chamber. At least the member for Paterson is prepared to come in and attempt to defend his government's position. As poor a position as it is, and as indefensible as it is, at least the member for Paterson is big enough to come into this chamber and defend the position of his government. It really is the indefensible he is trying to defend and, as I said, it has been the case with a range of pieces of legislation that have been introduced into the House over the last 12 months by this Howard government that was going to revive rural and regional Australia. Well, they got off to a pretty good start when they abolished the Division of Regional Development. You know very well, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we refer to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as the 'minister for transport only'and I think that is an appropriate name for him. One only needs to think back to the fanfare surrounding the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at the launch last year of Optus' s local call rate-the 20c rate. Mr Martin-He's back!",60
39,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"The member for Paterson has joined us, I am delighted to see. With all the fanfare that surrounded that announcement, I think people in rural and regional Australia could be excused for believing that the Prime Minister was talking for all Australians. Mr Bob Baldwin-He always has.",60
40,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"Does the member for Paterson remember the phrase 'all Australians'? It appears that his commitment to 'all of us' did not last beyond about the first two weeks in office-with, as I said, first of all, the abolition of the Division of Regional Development and, following that, a whole raft of legislative packages that have impacted adversely On rural and regional Australia. Those people who heard the PM make the commitment On ISDN to rural and regional Australia and those people who heard the PM at that Optus launch in Chats wood last year could not be blamed for being surprised when they picked up their newspapers today. If they were living in the Northern Territory, they would have picked up the Northern Territory News and read: 'Bush phone users may pay more'. If they were living in Western Australia, they would have picked up the West Australian and read: 'Bush callers face split'. If they were living in Melbourne and picked up the Age, they would have read: 'Rural calls may cost more: Libs'. If they were living in Brisbane and picked up the Courier Mail, they would have read: 'PM stalls on phone call cuts'. You could not blame people for being a little surprised by the absolute inability of the Prime Minister to make any further commitments to rural and regional Australia, by his inability to assure them that cost reductions as a result of competition will flow on to rural and regional Australia and, of course, his inability-thanks to a bit of unhelpful assistance from his own minister-to assure Australians that in future the aged in our community, or those who may be sight impaired, will have free 013 services. Mr Bob Baldwin-Rubbish!",60
41,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"You say that is rubbish. The member for Paterson says it is rubbish. We have the Prime Minister in this chamber giving some assurances about 013s and yet at question time in the other chamber on the same day, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) was saying something a little different. I know the member for Paterson may not have the capacity to keep track of the processes of both chambers of this parliament, but it would pay him to get up a little bit earlier in the morning and, following his diet induced walk, to check the Hansard record in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then he may not come into this chamber ill informed and suggest that what I am saying is wrong, because what I am saying is absolutely right. When he was in the chamber earlier today speaking on this package of bills he was informing us all that Senator Alston will be visiting his electorate next week. I think that is wonderful because that visit will get coverage in my electorate as well, which of course neighbours the electorate of the member for Paterson. I look forward to hearing Senator Alston's apologies to the people of regional Australia. I hope the member for Paterson will ask the minister to explain to the people of the Hunter Valley why the legislative package before the House today will remove all explicit restrictions on price discrimination by telecommunications carriers. I hope he will ask the minister to explain what that is about. Why, once again, have National Party MPs and Liberal MPs representing regional electorates been so unprepared to defend their constituents? Why, once again, is the government legislating to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, to widen the rift in the opportunities that exist between those living in our capital cities and those living in rural and regional Australia? It is difficult to talk about this package of legislation without referring to the Telstra sale. I know members like the member for Paterson will point out that it is a partial sale, but I say that it is a partial sale-for now. I cannot talk about these bills without referring to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. I point out, once again, how that bill is going to disadvantage rural and regional Australia and how, once again, it will mean that kids, in particular, in rural and regional Australia will have limited opportunities visa-vis their city counterparts. The Australian Labor Party is not opposed to the basic principle of the bills before the House. We support open competition in the telecommunications industry. The shadow minister has already stated that for the record. He has also moved a number of amendments which qualify our support. We will support those amendments very strongly in the Senate to ensure that this package of bills, once dealt with by the Senate, is much fairer and protects the interests of rural and regional Australia. The former Labor government started this process and the Labor Party remains strongly committed to it. Part 7 of the new bill poses some of my greatest concerns. Part 7 is about community service obligations and, in effect, that makes part 7 the most crucial component of the bill in terms of the interests of rural and regional Australia. Part 7 deals with universal service obligations which ensure that rural and regional Australians enjoy the same sort of service that those in the city enjoy. That has been the basic principle underpinning Telstra's approach in the past. It is something which, I would have thought, both sides of politics would support. No doubt some members on the other side will say, 'Oh, yes, but part 7 is only a copy of part 13 of the 1991 bill.' That may be true, but they have missed the point. It is now 1997. When the 1991 legislation was drafted we were dealing with different standards in communications. The world has moved on. Telecommunications is one of our fastest growing areas in terms of technology. The period between 1991 and 1997 was a significant period in the telecommunications industry. Technology has moved very fast. It is no good photocopying part 13 of the old bill over to part 7 of the new bill and saying to the opposition, 'Look, what are you bleating about? This is your bill. We are setting up the same standards that you intended to put in place.' That is crazy. During my contribution to the second reading debate on the bill that proposed the partial sale of Telstra I said that, if Menzies had had the audacity-and, as conservative as he was, I do not think it ever entered the mind of Menzies to flog off our telecommunications systems-to privatise the Postmaster-General's Department and set in place within legislation the standard telephone service which existed at the time, we would still be turning that little handle and wondering whether the exchange lady was listening in. It is exactly the same thing. You cannot apply the standard of the Menzies era to 1997, nor can you apply the standard of 1991 to the current situation. That is preposterous. The member for Paterson smiles, and I know he is doing so because he agrees that people in his electorate-in Maitland, Port Stephens and in Dungog, in particular-who have children studying want to access the Internet and all the things that go beyond itMr Bob Baldwin-They have got it.",61
42,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,You say they have it but I have just made a very important point. Mr Bob Baldwin-There's an Internet provider in Dungog.,62
43,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"I know, and I use the Maitland Internet provider, you do not have to tell me about that. I just made the point that the telecommunications industry changes very quickly and so photo- entrenched in any legislation must be an opportunity to constantly review what is the standard telephone service. We have gone well beyond the day when the telephony handset represents what should be the expectations of Australians, we need a lot more today. What does Senator Alston say about all of this? What is his response? He said, 'That's okay, we will deal with this by regulation. To show what a nice guy I am I will set up a review group.' He did set up a review group. With great fanfare last year he announced his review group. I must say it included, as you have pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, a lot of eminent people and a lot of people well placed to, on balance, determine what in 1997 and beyond should represent a standard telephone service, what should be the expectation of people in terms of the standard telephone service in light of the fact that technology is moving so fast. As you pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, the review group included people from Telstra, from Optus, from Vodafone, from the Australian Telecommunications User Group, from the National Farmers Federation and, most importantly, Mr Jock Given, a respected director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of New South Wales. But, as you also pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, the group also included a Professor Henry Ergas. We all know by now, of course, thanks partly to your contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Professor Ergas actuallyMr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Hunter refers to a speech of yours and he calls you 'Deputy Speaker' whereas he should be referring to you by your electorate name, not as Deputy Speaker.",62
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order.,62
45,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"It hurts, Mr Deputy Speaker, it hurts very much indeed. The member for Paterson is not smiling any longer. Who is Professor Ergas? We know that he is Senator Alston's mentor. He is the guy who supervised Senator Alston's thesis on telecommunications policy. He is the guy who has a hotline to Senator Alston's desk. I am told on good advice that he is the only person who can pick up a phone to Senator Alston's office at any time and get straight on the line. He is the one calling the shots. What is the result of the review group's deliberations? Well, nine out of 10 members of the group recommended a significant expansion in what should be the definition of a standard telephone service, taking into account both the fast moving technology and the cost constraints of providing a decent level of community service obligations. But Professor Ergas did not agree. He delivered a one-man dissenting report. This should not come as any surprise. We learned on that day why it was that the visiting professor-we have had one of those in here before-was put on the review group. He was put on there to do a very important job. Remember, they want to sell one-third of Telstra. Who is going to buy one-third of Telstra if they have to supply the sort of community service obligations that nine of the review group want to impose? It is going to be difficult enough to flood the market with something like Telstra and expect people to take up shares, but who is going to show an interest if a prospective purchaser is going to have to deliver to rural and regional Australia decent standard services? Who is going to show an interest? It all becomes very clear what Professor Ergas's role on the committee is. You do not have to take my word for it. The member for Paterson, indeed, does not have to take my word for it. You have only got to read the Australian Financial Review of 30 January where the headline is: $2.5 billion for digital links-Erg as We are talking about some sort of release or comment provided by the visiting professor. It says: Providing access to digital data services for all Australians by 2000 could impose capital costs on the telecommunications industry of up to $2.5 billion and lead to higher charges for residential consumers, according to respected economist Professor Henry Ergas. There it is. That is Professor Ergas's concern. That is Senator Alston's concern. We have had member after member after member come in here and tell us about their wonderful environmental package. Remember the blackmail, Mr Deputy Speaker? 'We will give you this wonderful environmental package, but the Senate has got to pass our partial sale of Telstra first or there will be nothing.' There will be nothing for the Murray-Darling. There will be nothing for the forests. There will be nothing in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker. Tasmania will get no money. That is Professor Ergas' s concern and that is the concern of Senator Richard Alston, the minister concerned. That is why Professor Ergas has a hotline to the minister's desk because this is a very difficult position for them. If they cannot proceed with this saleMr Miles-We have already done it.",62
46,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"I hear the parliamentary secretary at the table telling me that it is already passed. We can talk about the technicalities of that but that is not the point: you have got to sell it. You have got to sell it. You can pass the legislation. What Professor Ergas is saying is that you are not going to sell a third of Telstra in an already struggling market if prospective buyers are going to be expected to provide the sorts of community service obligations that have been recommended by the overwhelming majority of the review group. Do not talk to me about whether the legislation is passed or not. That is hurdle number two. Your first hurdle was the House of Representatives and, of course, you ignored our advice and took it up with the Senate. Your second hurdle is the Senate and if it passes through there-we will not count the Governor General because that is another debate-you have got to sell it; you have got to find a buyer. People put their houses on the market all the time-they do not need to put it through the parliament-but they cannot always get a buyer. But I will tell you what sometimes happens: sometimes they have to reduce the price. That is what sometimes happens. And they keep reducing it until they get a buyer. What happens to your environmental package then, I ask the minister, through you Mr Deputy Speaker? What becomes of the environmental package then? Very briefly, there are really two explanations for Senator Alston's reluctance on these community service obligations. One is Professor Ergas's advice but the other is his own ideology. Let me share with you Senator Alston's own written works-his own academic contribution. This paper is titled Time for real competition: Is Telecom's universal service obligations still relevant? He goes on in his paper to say that: By the 1970s, 'universal service' had been practically achieved ... Had been practically achieved. So the sort of standard telephone service we had then, I believe Senator Alston is telling us, we should still have now and we should have it in the year 2000. He goes on to say a Ii ttle later: A basic 'lifeline' or no frills type of service should be guaranteed the end user the ability(Time expired)",63
47,Mr BARRESI,Unknown,"I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). There were a number of points in his speech which I would like to refer to a little later on in the debate. I would like to thank him for at least acknowledging that the previous Labor government did fail to keep up with changes in technology. He talks about 'How are we supposed to know what is going to happen down the track?' When you are the government there is an element of anticipation and an element of planning that needs to take place. The ALP was caught in the wake of technological change and, at least, the honourable member for Hunter has had the decency to own up to something which his colleagues have failed to do. In the lead-up to the 21 st century, the legislation being debated will be the foundation on which the future of the telecommunications industry in Australia will be built. The need for the package of bills is self-evident. In our modem society, the ability to communicate quickly and easily with others is no longer a privilege or a luxury but a right, even a necessity-be it in business or socially. I know that the member for Hunter would agree with that, considering that he was referring to the rapid advancements in technology. We have seen some of those rapid advancements and, of course, Australians generally have a propensity to use the latest products and services that are available. Those services are certainly far different today from what they were yesterday. Communications pioneers of the last century and early this century, such as Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird, would all be amazed at the advances and the integration of their early inventions into what is now considered the superhighway. In fact, as recently as last Tuesday, three modem superhighway pioneers-Australian professors Rodney Tucker and Allan Snyder, and Dr Gottfried Ungerboek from Austria-were honoured by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for their major contribution to modem telecommunications in the form of optic fibres. It is truly a significant achievement, and those three gentlemen rank with those that I mentioned earlier on. Information technology, of which telecommunications is a large and vital component, is in fact the fastest growing industry in the world. My electorate of Deakin is part of Australia's largest IT region. It is because of such growth that governments must respond quickly to the changing environmentrespond, as the member for Hunter has stated, before we as a government are left in its wake and before the needs and the rights of the public are forsaken. The Labor Party, through its original 1991 bill, failed to respond to, failed to anticipate, the new world order in telecommunications. These bills will certainly redress the wrong, redress the balance that is so sought after by the Australian public. The legislative package will provide an environment, as of July 1997, in which Deakin businesses and consumers will get maximum value. It is based on a world-class infrastructure using the latest technology, access to a range of service providers all offering in a competitive manner diverse and innovative services. And, of course, it will do this through contestable market strategies. I look forward to the providers passing on any possible benefits to the people of Deakin and to other Australians, whether it be in the form of an increase in quality, lower prices or diverse products and services. A failure to do so is a breach of the expectations and the promises so readily created in the mind of the public by many of these providers. The government's telecommunications framework enables any number of businesses to operate as carriers. Existing distinctions between fixed and mobile services will be removed and, importantly, new carriers will not face an imposed burden to build their own network. If they did, we would not have two cables strung up and down Maroondah Highway or Whitehorse Road through my electorate but potentially three or four. We would not have 36 mobile towers but potentially 100 within the 59 square kilometre region of the electorate. My comments today will concentrate on three key aspects of the new framework: firstly, the community and consumer safeguards, including untimed local calls; secondly, anti-competitive conduct; and, thirdly, the powers and immunities. Within the framework, the Telecommunications Bill 1996 provides world-class consumer and community safeguards. The bill's provisions are more comprehensive and better developed than those originally introduced by Labor-which in itself is an acknowledgment of Labor's failure to deal with the issues at a time when it first introduced its bill. In fact, we now have around 20 consumer safeguards included in these bills. Some are improvements on existing mechanisms; some are new. I would like to briefly refer to a few of them. The universal service regime allows for the ready upgrade of the universal service obligation. The honourable member for Hunter spent most of his speech denigrating that service obligation. The standard telephone service review addresses the needs of people with a disability. Mandatory industry standards, emergency call services, the provision of operator and directory assistance, and itemised bills are all safeguards that are included within the current framework. Of course, another one is the highly politicised issue of price controls. The untimed local call obligation that we promised has not only been maintained but extended. Residential customers have been given the legislated right to untimed local calls for non-voice as well as voice calls. On the issue of anticompetitive conduct, the benefits of a truly competitive market will only be gained when all carriers and service providers are given the ability to engage in normal competitive behaviour. To stifle such competition will not deliver the benefits demanded by the public. However, the government has determined that some competition regulation should remain to counter the residual market power which incumbent players have over any newcomers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will be able to respond swiftly where anticompetitive conduct is evident. It can do so by taking direct action against conduct which substantially lessens competition or which otherwise breaches key trade practices provisions. One regulatory mechanism that is available to the ACCC is the ability to seek an injunction and issue a competition notice but only where certain breaches take place. Aspects of this bill address the issue of the powers of carriers and immunity from specific requirements. The new code strikes a balance between on the one hand giving the community a greater say in the rollout of infrastructure, and placing telecommunications into state based land planning regimes, and on the other hand ensuring that Australia gets a world class telecommunications infrastructure. The wide-ranging immunity provisions for 'prescribed activities' have been rejected by this government. The far-reaching powers afforded to the carriers and providers under Labor's 1991 bill have been wound back. This is a recognition by the government that local communities have a greater emphasis on urban and environmental amenity. The look and feel of their local landscapes is rightfully very important. The power to be able to exercise some sort of control, through the planning regimes in each state, is extremely important and affords them a say in the process. However, in saying this, the framework must allow the Commonwealth some limited rights of intervention. These rights of intervention exist in particular areas such as low impact facilities, maintenance and temporary defence facilities. All of these will be subject to a code of service. The new rules, in part, continue with established telecommunications policy. One area that deserves special attention, and which has received such attention by many speakers this morning, is that of pay television cabling. It is significant because of the problems that have arisen from the failure of the previous Labor government's code, the failure by the previous Labor government to acknowledge the blight, the anxiety and the uproar that such cabling would cause in our community. In my electorate, the community's objection to the rollout of broadband cable and mobile towers has been well recognised and expressed to both the minister, and to me, by my constituents. Hours of consideration and negotiation have gone into this package. Government backbenchers have listened long and hard to the voices of their electorate. The honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) readily denigrated the minister. But, to his credit, he has listened to the backbenchers and he has welcomed their input in the drafting of this bill. Following the concerns of individuals and councils within the Deakin electorate, the framework now includes new obligations on these carriers. Three important obligations worth mentioning are that there is to be no broadband cabling unless specifically authorised by the relevant state or territory authority; the ers must collocate their towers unless it is not technically feasible; and undergrounding at major intersections is to take place and, where possible, if undergrounding facilities exist, that is to continue. The environmental amenity of some parts of the Deakin electorate has clearly been affected by the intrusion of overhead cabling. Residents throughout my electorate and, in particular, those in the environmentally sensitive areas, such as in Blackburn, Mitcham and Ringwood North, have complained bitterly about the intrusion of cables and towers into their streets. Fortunately, pockets within the electorate have been spared the ugly blight of the cables-pockets such as the Bellbird area in Blackburn, which has a heritage classification. To install the cables, what has had to take place is that nature strip trees have been pruned, in some cases with obvious overenthusiasm, in some cases in a unilateral manner, quite contrary to agreements that have been struck between the local council and the carrier. At one stage, peak hour traffic on the Maroondah Highway was stalled because of a carrier's arrogant and devil-may-care approach to directives from the local council and, in fact, even from the police. Who can the people of Deakin, my constituents, thank for such intrusion? They can only thank one particular body in Australia and that is the Labor government, now in opposition. That is whom they can thank and their outrage will remain. Of course, the electorate is not alone. Many suburbs throughout Melbourne and Sydney have been the focus of Optus and Telstra's rollout. Until last December, of course, local communities had been powerless to act in any strategic manner. Labor's policy failures, as with failures in other areas, will continue to be felt by the residents of Deakin. Unfortunately for my constituents, a combination of factors, such as the agreement between the carriers, the Labor government's failure to acknowledge its consequences, the legally binding nature of the agreement and the investment of $18 billion on infrastructure carriand network, has meant that there is no significant turning back possible in those streets. There can be no pulling down of cables at this stage, but I certainly look forward to the day ·when those cables do come down. I know that the Local Government Authority in Victoria remains critical of the new bills. But it is easy for the local government authority to be so dismissive and rattle the sabre when someone else, in this case the federal government and, in tum, my constituents, the taxpayers, would be asked to make financial restitution to the carriers, or foot the bill for undergrounding. While the cable rollout in the cities of Whitehorse and Maroondah is virtually complete, it is my hope that Deakin's pain will not be wasted and that suburbs in other capital cities and regional centres will benefit. To many Australians, the growth and power of telecommunications carriers and providers creates a sense of apprehension and unease. I look forward to these significant obligations and safeguards creating a higher level of consumer confidence in our telecommunications providers. Finally, as time goes by, the significance of the work of those early communications pioneers, Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird will be a distant memory. Our pride in Snyder and Tucker may also dim, but the need for governments to respond to the fast paced world of the information superhighway will escalate. I look forward to the increasing competition, to the new products and services demanded by consumers but, above all, I and the public look forward to the safeguards which all of us, the technological minnows, the technological dinosaurs, require as our security blanket. I commend the bills to the house.",64
48,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Like others who have contributed to this debate, let me say that I am also pleased to participate. I would like to emphasise, as well, that those members on the government's side who have made their contribution to the Telecommunications Bill 1996 have had to be dragged screaming into this debate. I understand that the opposition whips found it almost impossible to fill the speakers list, and that is understandable. Mr Barresi-That's not true.",67
49,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"It is true. The corridors are echoing with the story that that has been the case. In fact, members on the government side have not even been answering their telephones. As soon as they knew the call was coming from the Whips they ducked for cover. That is understandable. As you know, this is probably the most comprehensive piece of legislation that has come before the parliament for a long time. That is as we might expect. It is an area of new technology. It is something that Australia needs to adjust itself to. New regulations have to be determined, new directions have to be charted. That was the responsibility of the previous Labor government and it has now become the responsibility of this government. There are sections of this legislation that the opposition is prepared to support since much of it was designed by us. But let me say this too, there are vast sections of this legislation which were not designed by us, nor would they have been designed by us. There are sections of this legislation, too, which effectively repudiate an undertaking that was given by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) prior to the last election. There was an undertaking given by him that telecommunications services would be available right across Australia. I know that my contribution is going to be interrupted in about four or five minutesMr Barresi-Thank God for that.",67
50,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Thank God for that he says. Look, mate, I will be back after question time in the MPI an I will continue to draw attention to the deficiencies in the position that you people have adopted.",67
51,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,67
52,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I have always had them worried. I have had them worried for 16 years. I heard two contributions to this debate today. I heard a contribution from my colleague, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, and I heard a contribution as well from Bob Baldwin, the member for Paterson. The interesting point of contrast about those two contributions was that Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, took the fight right up to the government. He is concerned about the access that his constituents will have to this modem technology. He knows that to a very large extent there are many areas in his electorate for which it will not be available. He took the fight to the government. However, the member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, came in here and did not cease issuing excuses for the fact that the government has been so deficient as far as this legislation is concerned and so deficient in the whole area of developing telecommunications technology. I referred as well to that very fied undertaking that had been given by the present Prime Minister to rural and regional Australia, to provincial Australia, to all of those people who were prepared at that time to put their faith in the word of the present Prime Minister that they would have access to those services. We know that Senator Alston, the minister, has been backtracking ever since. What we want to know, on this side of the chamber, is how many of those representatives on the government benches who represent rural and provincial Australia have hammered on Senator Alston's door, have raised the issue in their party meeting, have insisted that that obligation, that undertaking, firm and unqualified as it was, would be delivered to their constituents. They need to go back to their electorates, either this evening or tomorrow, and answer to their constituents about the position that they have adopted in here. Of course, there are so many of them who could have taken the opportunity to defend the government but found it impossible to do so, absolutely impossible to do so. We will not allow the government to get by on this. The National Farmers Federation, for example, agreed to the part privatisation of Telstra on the assumption that the Prime Minister would deliver that promise. All of those people in rural and provincial Australia who delivered votes to present government members did so on the basis of that obligation that was given, that their kids, like kids in the leafy suburbs of the North Shore, would have access to all of that high tech telecommunications technology. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they will not have that access. I say to those people on the government benches who represent rural and provincial Australia, you go back to your constituents and try to explain that away. You will do that with great difficulty and your constituents will not believe you.",67
53,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the firm, unqualidebate is resumed. NA",68
54,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I inform the House that, following the resignation of Senator the Hon. Bob Woods as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, I have today appointed Senator Chris Ellison of Western Australia to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General. NA Unemployment: Work for the Dole",68
55,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. You said today in relation to the work for the dole scheme: It was not something that was really talked about ... in the lead-up to the campaign. Why then does a secret policy document headed 'From J Howard Parliament House, 31 July 1995' pose the policy question, 'How much will supervising work for the dole schemes cost?'",68
56,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I do not regard that as altering anything-nothing at all. It does not alter anything. The simple take-out of all of this is: we favour work for the dole; you are against it. Mr Crean-I seek leave to table the document. This is from you, Prime Minister. These are your words. Leave not granted.",68
57,Mr KERR,Unknown,Tricky John!,68
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Denison. You are starting very early. Employment Growth,69
59,Mr BROUGH,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer comment on today's labour force results and the implication for the budget forecast of employment growth?,69
60,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all Australians will welcome the fact that in January 1977 employment increased by 38,400. There were 38,400 new jobs created in the month of January 1997, bringing total growth since June 1996 to 106,400 persons. Since March 1996 there have been 158,900 jobs created in the Australian economy. Youth unemployment fell by 11.4 per cent in January and the youth unemployment rate fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent. I hope the Labor Party welcomes that fall in the youth unemployment rate. In relation to the budget forward estimates and the forecast that was made of employment growth of two per cent throughout the year, the seasonally adjusted data shows that employment growth in the seven months since June 1996 has averaged around 15,000 persons per month. For the remainder of 199697, employment growth needs to average around 12,000 persons per month to achieve the government's forecast of two per cent growth. The ABS release on the labour force today also makes the point that, since the sampling technique changed, they have noted a change in responses and the ABS is considering whether or not the methodology will be revised with a possible cumulative effect on the estimate of employment, revised upwards, of between 36,000 and 54,000 people. That is a matter for the ABS and the ABS is considering that at the moment. If the ABS were to revise up the mean of those two figures, the budget forecast for employment would be met already. This government does not say that we can rest on our laurels in relation to employment or unemployment. There is a lot of work to be done. There is a lot of work to make sure that we continue to encourage small business, that we continue to have that low inflation and low interest rate environment and that we continue with programs such as that the Prime Minister has announced on the scourge of youth unemployment. I think all Australians-and I hope both sides of this House-will welcome the news today on employment and will welcome the fact that those budget forecasts are on track. As it turns out, there is every reason to believe they will be met, if not more so. I hope that this House welcomes the growth in relation to employment. As I said earlier, one cannot dwell too much on one month's figures only. But what we have seen over recent months is a positive trend in employment, good jobs growth in relation to those opportunities but, of course, continuing work needing to be done to improve job prospects for all Australians.

61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Mrs Jenny Shipley, the New Zealand Minister for Transport. Also present in the gallery are members of the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. NA Staff: Senator Colston",69
62,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"I have three short questions to the Prime Minister on the Colston staff upgrade matter. The first is: when the Prime Minister discussed this matter with his chief of staff last November, was the Telstra vote part of that discussion or can'the remember? Secondly, why did the Prime Minister say in this House yesterday that the President of the Senate supported in principle Senator Colston's staff upgrade when it was clear from all Senator Reid's letters to the Prime Minister and Senator Colston on this subject that she didn't? Thirdly, on the question of cost, why did the Prime Minister refer yesterday only to Senator Reid's letter of 15 November, which mentions the base figure of $20,000, and not her further letter to him of 4 December, which mentions a total cost of up to $65,000? Was he misleading the House again or did he just forget it?",69
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition wi II withdraw the words 'misleading the House'. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I withdraw.,70
64,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,The answer to the first question is that I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday. The answer to the second question is that I made that statement because that was the advice that had been tendered to me in writing by my department. So far as the third question is concerned-the reference to the letter written to me by Senator Reid-that letter was referred to because it was relevant to the argument about dates. Civil Aviation Safety Authority,70
65,Mrs DRAPER,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is it central to the government's attempts to improve air safety standards in Australia that the current Civil Aviation Safety Authority board be replaced? Have there been any findings from government inquiries which have questioned the effectiveness of the current board's strategy?,70
66,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. For some time now-indeed, since before the election in March last year-the coalition has had a clearly stated policy that we would require, government, people appointed to the Civil A viation Safety Authority board to have appropriate aviation expertise or qualifications. Indeed, when you look at the current board make-up of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, of those non-executive directors of the board, only one of them, Captain Geoff Molloy, had any aviation experience prior to being appointed to the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I took the opportunity to read the second reading speech given by the then minister, now member for Kingsford-Smith, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, in the House on the establishment of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. In his second reading speech, he said that a requirement for the appointment of the board be that it be a small board made up of expert people. It is interesting to note that, when you look at the make-up of the current board, nobody could rightfully claim that the board is made up of people who are expert in the area of aviation. Certainly some of them might have been well known to the former Minister for Transport.",70
67,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,What about all of them?,70
68,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Indeed, the former Minister for Transport had a reputation for appointing people to boards where they had absolutely no prior experience with that board's activity. I recall, for example, the Australian National Line board, which was in trouble at the time. Members of the House who were here at the time will well recall it. When it was in trouble, what did the then Minister for Transport do? He appointed none other than his old mate Neville Wran, a former Labor premier of New South Wales, to be chairman of this shipping company. Did Neville Wran have any prior experience in the shipping area? Of course he did not.",70
69,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,He should have been a sailor?,70
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,70
71,Unknown,Unknown,Honourable members interjecting,70
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber.,70
73,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Having had no prior experience in the shipping area, one wonders what in qualifications he may have had for this very well paid position. The position required the chairman to work two days a week for a whole year for a total remuneration of $307,000. That was for two days work a week. One can see that the pattern established by the former minister was to appoint people without any expertise, as was required in the second reading speech, but who happened to be actually known to the minister and may even have been a mate of the minister. Yesterday in the House, the honourable member for Melbourne asked a series of questions, in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition, which were designed to give the impression that I and Senator Herron had been involved in an inappropriate act; that is, that we were in fact providing some inducement or bribe to people on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. This was recorded by the member for Melbourne in a press conference held after question time. This was a breach of section 73 of the Crimes Act and, in fact, we were guilty of a crime. Indeed, I have today listened to an interview with Justice Fisher, who is chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Justice Fisher was appointed by the former Minister for Transport to that position. You have to remember what the claims were. They are that r or Senator Herron was illegally inducing or bribing Ms Hollows to leave the board and that we had said that, if she left the board of CASA, she would get another job in the Aboriginal health area. In the interview on The World Today, the reporter said: At the time shethat is, Gabi Hollowsdiscussed that letter with you, was she under the impression that she was being offered one or the other, or the Aboriginal health offer was contingent on the CASA board resignation? Justice Fisher commences his answer by saying that Ms Hollows is a very strong woman. He then goes on to say: At the time, she was being charmed off the board and into another job. You might say that there is a substantial difference between being charmed off the board and being offered a bribe or an inducement.",70
74,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,You-charming! You charmer!,71
75,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the member for Kingsford-Smith.,71
76,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Indeed, Justice Fisher flatters me with the claim that I was charming her. But the interviewer goes on with her next question. The other aspect of the accusations made yesterday by the honourable member for Melbourne, assisted by the Leader of the Opposition, was that there was somebody else to whom I had offered an inducement, job or bribe. As I discovered later, it was Dr Clare Pollock, another member of the board. In the same interview, the interviewer's next question was this: And in terms of Dr Clare Pollock, was there any kind of inducement that you are aware of offered to her? Justice Fisher answered: Inducement no, but discussion yes. As I understand it, the Minister has given his version of the discussion and I think broadly accords with what I was told. The interviewer then said: So in fact there was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board, rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kinds of jobs if she stepped aside? The answer from Justice Fisher: There was certainly no offer of a job. No offer of a job. Indeed, yesterday here in the House and outside of the chamber in a press conference, the honourable member for Melbourne-ably assisted and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition-engaged in an act designed to deceive the public of Australia and the members of this House. If the Leader of the Opposition had any standards, he would discipline the honourable member for Melbourne for misleading the people of Australia over this issue. Hollows, Ms Gabi",71
77,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the legal advice you tabled in the House last night refer only to the letter from the minister for Aboriginal affairs to Ms Hollows of 6 May? Why did it not refer to discussions between Ms Hollows and the minister for Aboriginal affairs on the same day? Why did it not refer to discussions between Ms Hollows and the minister for transport on the same day, details of which he admitted in this House yesterday? Why did it not refer to discussions between the minister for transport and the minister for Aboriginal affairs? Why did it not refer to the constant attacks on the CAS A board and calls for the resignation of board members by the minister for transport both before and after these events? Prime Minister, why have you cleared the minister for transport based on legal advice that deals with only a small part of the transactions concerned? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: on a number of occasions, you and your predecessors have ruled on the length of questions. I invite you to do so on this occasion.",71
78,Mr KERR,Unknown,Join the rescue party.,72
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The member for Denison! There were a number of interrelated questions within the one question, but I am sure the Prime Minister has the capacity to deal with them.",72
80,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The opinion tendered by the Chief General Counsel was directed precisely to the allegation made in your question. In preparing that information, I understand the Chief General Counsel had available not only the letter written to Ms Hollows by Senator Herron but also the comments that had been made-including a number of the comments to which you have referred-in the parliament by Senator Herron and Mr Sharp. I inform the honourable member that the Chief General Counsel also had before him the letter that had been written to me by Ms Hollows. I shall read to you a note that was sent by Mr Burmester to the Attorney-General today. It reads as follows: You have asked for further advice as to whether, in providing the advice of yesterday in relation to the letter signed by Senator Herron on 6 May and addressed to Ms Hollows, I considered the letter dated 10 February 1997 sent by her to the Prime Minister. I confirm that I did consider that letter but I considered that there was nothing in that letter which I considered in any way affected the advice which I gave you yesterday. I table that supplementary advice from Mr Burmester. Mr Lee-What about the behaviour?",72
81,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Dobell!,72
82,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Let me take the opportunity of saying that this is not a debate about probity. This is not a debate about standards. This is a debate so the opposition can play their funny little games that may be of great pre-occupation to the people in Canberra and to the press gallery, but out there the common sense in the Australian people can see a very able minister who has my very strong support. The minister came into office against a background of death and disaster in civil aviation under the hands of the former government. The real issue in this is aviation safety. It is not probity; it is aviation safety. You know that the record of safety under the former government was appalling, and a report released last year indicated that one of the causes of that was a lack of effective supervision. Against that background, with a clear and open policy of seeking to bring about a change in the board of the authority, the minister in a quite open manner set about implementing the policy of the newly elected government. The minister did that in it common sense and courteous fashion. He did not do it covertly. He did not do it wrongly. He did not do it dishonestly. He did it very openly. Instead of being criticised and instead of being accused of a lack of probity and of offering bribes, the minister ought to be congratulated for doing his job. I want to make it clear on behalf of the government that I will not accept any criticism of the behaviour of either John Sharp or John Herron on this matter. Does the Labor Party really imagine that they are getting through to the Australian community on this issue? Mr Martin Ferguson-Honest John!",72
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Batman!,72
84,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,What have we had this week? Mr Martin Ferguson-You should call for his job.,72
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the member for Batman.,72
86,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The first question the opposition asked was not about the good news of today. What is the good news of today? There has been a fall of 11,000 in youth unemployment in Australia. But do you really think the Labor Party is going to ask a question about that? Of course they are not. I say to the members opposite-especially the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Melbourne-if you really think you are landing any blows on this issue, you are very sadly mistaken.",72
87,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,72
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The House is showing increasing signs of disorder. This is a general warning to you all. I will reserve the right to act on individuals without any further warnings. Youth Unemployment,73
89,Mrs ELSON,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister explain to the House what today's employment figures reveal about youth unemployment in particular and the labour market in general?",73
90,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. The further growth in employment revealed in today's labour force statistics is undoubtedly encouraging for many Australians. This is in fact the fourth successive month in which employment has grown, and the government's policies are designed to lay the basis for sustained and continuing employment growth. Nobody pretends that there is not a massive problem of unemployment still to be dealt with. No-one in this House is more responsible for the depth and dimension of that problem than the person who sits on the other side of the table today-the Leader of the Opposition. When he was minister for employment, long-term unemployment rose in this country by 95,000, youth unemployment rose to levels of 32 per cent, some of the highest levels since the Great Depression of the",73
91,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Look at your record.,73
92,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"Why don't you listen to the facts ? You listen to today' s figures. I will fill you in in a minute if you missed it when the Treasurer was talking about them. The Leader of the Opposition had two chances. He was not only minister for employment-and he failed miserably in that portfolio-but Minister for Finance. He was the Minister for Finance who did not have the guts to stand up to Paul Keating's big spending policies that led to $70 billion of accumulated deficits, drove interest rates up and destroyed so many small businesses and jobs around Australia-a gutless Leader of the Opposition who has not got the guts to support the policies that the government is putting in place to help the young unemployed people who were the victims of his policy. One of the most encouraging features of today's statistics has been the fall in full-time unemployment amongst young people. Teenage unemployment-are you listening to this, because you obviously did not pick it up last time?-fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent, a very significant fall. We do not want to make too much of one month's figures, but the fact is that that is a very significant fall. There are still too many young people unemployed, and many of these young people have become entrenched in unemployment and isolated from their communities. That is precisely what the government's work for the dole scheme is designed to address. It is designed to bring many of these young people out of isolation and to give their communities the opportunity to work with them, to bring them back into community life and to restore their self-esteem. It is no surprise, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition is against this scheme, because the unions have told him that they will not cop it and he is too weak to do anything about it or stand up to them. Today's jobs figures are just a step along the road to rebuilding employment opportunities in this country, but they are encouraging news. They show that Australia is now on a different course to the one which was set by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues on the other side of the House when they were in government. Royal Australian Air Force",73
93,Ms HANSON,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, as you are no doubt aware, there is a group of Royal Australian Air Force servicemen who served in Ubon, Thailand, from 1962 to 1968 as an integral part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam war in providing combat support in a declared combat area to USAF bombing missions into North Vietnam and Laos and who have for 30 years been denied recognition for that effort. Will the minister, as is in her power, recommend to the Governor General to alter the regulations relating to the defined area of operations so as to include service to RTAF base Ubon, Thailand, to allow the issue of either the Vietnam Medal or the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal to a group of Australians who clearly qualify and who served their country proudly and honourably?",73
94,Mrs BISHOP,Unknown,"I thank the member for her question and the fact that she did indicate she would ask a question on this topic. For that reason, I am able to give the information that is required. There was a RAAF contingent based at Ubon in Thailand situated on the borders of Laos and Cambodia between 1962 and 1968. They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war. Ubon is in fact a Royal Thai Air Force base, and there were two reasons that were considered specifically by the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards dealing with why they did not recommend that the Vietnam Medal be awarded but did in fact recommend that the ASM 1945-75 with clasp Thailand be awarded. Indeed, that award is being made, recognising the service they gave. The reason that the committee recommended that the Vietnam Medal could not be awarded was simply that the area designated for the award of that medal did not include Ubon within its perimeters and the committee did not consider that it ought to be changed. The second reason related to the rules of engagement which were set down for that particular contingent. They were: That no aircraft will be directed to investigate identified contacts unless specifically requested the Royal Thai government and, secondly, that no aircraft will attack unless fired upon. So the nature of their deliberations were that the ASM 1945-75 should be awarded to recommend the service that that contingent gave. In opposition, we undertook to uphold the awards that were recommended under the CIDDRA report, which we have done. We did then extend it in part, but we decided that it was the correct thing to abide by the finding concerning the award to be made in respect of that RAAF contingent. Migration: Social Security Entitlements",74
95,Mr MUTCH,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of recent progress in implementing the coalition's election commitment to ensure that newly arrived migrants wait a reasonable period of time before becoming eligible for certain government benefits? How will this progress assist the government in its efforts to rectify the appalling budgetary position left by our predecessor?,74
96,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I am pleased to say that this week the Senate has had the good sense to support legislation to implement the government's publicly stated election commitment to require newly arrived migrants to wait two years before receiving social security benefits. I might say that the Senate's reconsideration of this matter will improve the budget position by $196 million over the next four years. This means that the total savings for Australian taxpayers from the implementation of this election promise will be during that same period an amount of $337 million. But it is interesting that this measure has passed through the Senate against the strenuous opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have once again shown their contempt for the views of the taxpaying public of Australia, their contempt for the views of mainstream Australia, their lack of connection with the beliefs and attitudes of mainstream Australia and they have voted together to strike down a measure of which any clear and explicit notice was given by the by coalition during the election campaign. As the Labor Party has demonstrated with its response to the government's proposals for work for the dole, as the Labor Party has demonstrated in relation to Hindmarsh bridge and as the Labor Party now demonstrates in relation to the two-year waiting period for migrants, it is utterly out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of mainstream Australian taxpayers. I say to those people-the people who welcome the work for the dole scheme; the people who welcome the falls in interest rates; the people who welcome the fact that we have the lowest housing interest rates, as the Treasurer said, since 1969; and the people who welcome the fact that there has been a fall in youth unemployment today-these are the issues that the Australian people who voted in the last election are really concerned about. These issues go to their daily concerns; these issues go to their daily livelihoods. I want to say to those people that we remain sensitive to their concerns, and we will respond strongly, fairly and consistently with the aims and values of the mainstream of the Australian community. Just as they can rely on us to do that, they can increasingly rely on the Australian Labor Party at every tum to vote against, to frustrate and to try to obstruct the realisation of what they want their duly elected government to do. Civil Aviation Safety Authority",74
97,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Has the minister been given a copy of legal advice provided to CASA by Blake Dawson Waldron with respect to his letter of 28 January to CASA board members detailing his accusations against the board and his intention to dismiss them from office? Can he confirm that this advice states that his action 'is seriously flawed and would, if challenged, be held by a court not to have provided procedural fairness to CASA or its Board members', and that his proposed decision would constitute 'an unlawful exercise of his statutory powers?' In the face of such emphatic advice from one of Australia's premier law firms and in view of the Prime Minister's assurance today that the government would act in accordance with the law at all times, why is the minister proceeding with his attempts to sack the CAS A board?",75
98,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne quotes legal advice from a firm engaged by the board of CASA to mount a defence on their behalf. I can quite equally put legal advice provided by leading Sydney QCs who would put a contrary view to the Blake Dawson Waldron advice that you have been given. The honourable member for Melbourne poses the question: why don't I cease in my attempts to get the CASA board to resign? I will tell you why. It is because I am absolutely, utterly committed and passionate about improving aviation safety in this country. I can tell you with all sincerity that my involvement in aviation safety in this country began a long time ago in the late 1970s when I became a pilot. It became renewed after the Monarch crash several years ago in which seven people were killed-all bar one of those people I happened to know. As a result of that, I began inquiries of my own to find out why that had happened. I will tell you why it occurred and, indeed, the coronial inquiry confirms this advice. One of the major contributing causes to that crash was the failure of the safety regulator to properly maintain safe aviation standards in this country.",75
99,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Was this board in office at that time?,75
100,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"This led me to outline in the House-in a speech I gave on 9 May 1994, I think it was-all of my concerns which had been built out of my inquiries about the Monarch crash. At the same time, I also drew to the House's attention the fact that I thought there was another Monarch in the waiting and it was called Seaview Air. I said, 'This is another accident waiting to happen.' What was memorable about Seaview is that five months later that airline had a crash and nine people died. Mr Tanner-Who was on the board?",75
101,Mr SHARP,Unknown,Nine people died.,75
102,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,Who was on the board?,75
103,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Tell us who was on the board?,75
104,Mr SHARP,Unknown,Who were on the board? People that the Labor government had appointed. Mr Gareth Evans-Not the same board.,75
105,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Who was responsible for aviation safety in the country at the time? None other than the Labor government, the people sitting here now in the House in the opposition-people like the Leader of the Opposition; people like the former Treasurer who has been busily handing you notes this afternoon; and people like the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a former transport minister. They were the people ultimately responsible for aviation safety in this country. During the term of Labor's administration, aviation safety deteriorated substantially to the point where there were two major airline crashes involving the loss of 16 lives and where, according to coronial inquiries and commissions of inquiry, a major contributing factor was the failure of the safety regulatora regulator appointed by you under your administration. I will not rest until I am absolutely, utterly convinced in my own mind-and I am sure my colleagues will support me in this-that we have the best people possible to administer aviation safety in this country. Because under the appointments that you made, it could be quite easily claimed that that is not so now. I will not rest until we have the very best people. You left this country without appropriately qualified people running our aviation safety regulator. You left us with those problems. My job is to fix them, and fix them. I will. Youth Unemployment: Work for the Dole",75
106,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, have further facts come to your attention in recent days of further support for the government's work for the dole scheme?",76
107,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question. All members of the House, I am sure, will be aware that there has been tremendously strong support for the government's work for the dole plan coming from communities right around Australia. Many members on our side of the House have approached me to tell me of the support that is coming from their communities. One of the most encouraging things has been the support coming from young people themselves. I would like to read to the House a number of the comments that have been made by young people about the work for the dole plan. The Leader of the Opposition might care to listen to these to hear what young people of this country really want for themselves. If he has any genuine interest in the young people of this country, he will listen to the desire of young people to be given the opportunities that the government's plan provides. The Melbourne Herald-Sun published comments from a very large number of young people, the vast majority of whom praised the scheme. Paul Meeuwsen, 22, of Croydon North was quoted as saying: It makes sense if you are doing community work. It would be better than doing nothing. Nejdet Malkov, 20, of Flemington said: It's good if it's community work. There are plenty of jobs out there. Of course, this is a typical reaction of young people to the scheme. The West Australian stated on 11 February: Unemployed 20-year-olds Matthew Baldwin and Robert Pirot were among the many young people at Scarborough Beach yesterday who supported the Federal Government's work-for-the-dole plan. The whip, the member for Mitchell, introduced me the other day to the outstanding young people running the Hills District Youth Service-a really quite remarkable group of people. They have written to the whip saying: I would like to express the support of Hills District Youth Service to the concept 'work for the dole'. With 100 000 young people unemployed in Australia we believe it is essential to provide programs that are dealing with how to give young people not only skills but also a strong sense of belonging and contribution to their community. We will certainly look at opportunities for young people to help contribute in our area and will encourage all other organisations to do the same. The member for Capricornia drew my attention to the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin. The member for Ballarat has approached me, as has the member for La Trobe, drawing my attention to similar comments in the press in their own area. Let me quote: Unemployed ... teenager Samantha Vickers said yesterday she would jump at the chance to work for the dole. The 17-year-old said she applied for more than 40 jobs since she finished school and had been offered only two interviews. She said all she wanted was the opportunity to show an employer what she was worth. Samantha yesterday gave a big thumbs-up to Prime Minister John Howard's work-for-the-dole plan. That is typical of young people around Australia. I hope you were listening to those comments, Leader of the Opposition, because young people around Australia are asking for support to give them the opportunity. Let me spell it out for you. There are probably only four reasons why you are not supporting work for the dole: A-C-T-U. They are the people who give you your riding instructions and they are the reason you cannot respond and you cannot listen--because you are too weak to stand up to them. This government is prepared to stand up for the young people of this country . We put in place a plan that will give young people opportunities which you denied them and which they have welcomed around this country. Mr Martin-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Given that the minister is interested in collecting information on people's attitudes to this, can we table 'Working for the Dole: It Sucks' from the Illawarra Mercury and comments from a variety of young people in the Illawarra? I seek leave to table it.",76
108,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That was a frivolous point of order. It ought to be drawn to the member's attention that there are disciplinary provisions available to the Speaker for such points of order.",77
109,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I thank the Leader of the House. I have already illuminated everybody about not only frivolous points of order but also disorderly conduct. Any further breach this day will be treated harshly. Civil Aviation Safety Authority,77
110,Mr TANNER,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to media reports indicating that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development made an approach to CASA board member Dr Clare Pollock suggesting that she could be given consultancies if she agreed to stand down from the CAS A board. I refer him to the minister's admission on AM this morning to that effect. I refer him also to media reports quoting Mr Justice Fisher to the effect that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development made a general approach to board members at a meeting in April last year offering to seek alternative positions for them should they agree to resign from the CASA board. How does the Prime Minister propose to investigate these further allegations? Why won'the institute an independent judicial inquiry into this scandalous behaviour?,77
111,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I would like to very carefully and quietly reply to the question asked by the member for Melbourne. I think the question about Mrs Pollock, which he telegraphed all around Australia that he was going to ask at question time today, has been very comprehensively addressed in one sense by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development on AM this morning. Can I just pick up the thrust of the question, which is that in some way there has been impropriety in what the minister has done. When that allegation was made yesterday it somehow jarred with me. I thought: how can it be that an allegation of this kind is made? How can it be that what the minister has done is seen as being in some way improper? It disturbed me. Finally, I came across what really had caused me to jar: a report of the onslaught of the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition to obtain Labor Party preselection for the seat of La Trobe in 1994. Mr Gareth Evans-La Trobe?",77
112,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Lalor, I am sorry. Do not get too excited about that. I came across some material-I suppose I should share it with the House-that reminded me of those events. It was under the beading of 'Australia: crunch time-Gareth Evans searches for a future'. How prescient it really was. This report says how he wanted the seat of Lalor, and Jones would not give it up. The really material part reads as follows: But he was committed to a strategy of persuading Jones that it was in the interests of all concerned that he step aside. Evans really believed it would work. It was part of a bigger plan. He rang Jones at 7 o'clock in the morning; he rang friends of Jones, including the commentator Phillip AdamsWell, that should have fixed it to try to have them exert influence. This is the really interesting bit. Let me say this very quietly and carefully: He suggested. he could wangle Jones an important overseas po-ting if he would only do the right thing and step aside. He offered at least two alternative electorates that Jones could have for the asking. He spoke of the good of the party, that the whole plan would solve a mob of difficult factional problems in Victoria. When he was confronted with all of this in the Senate, he said: . . . no inducements or pressure, particularly the crude kind of pressure that has been widely reported in the press through another feat of journalistic imagination . . . It has been a matter of routine internal exploration of options ... A 'routine internal exploration of options'. Of course, Gareth, that is all it was. What a lot of humbug and nonsense from the Labor Party.",77
113,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,78
114,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Members on my right! Beef Exports,78
115,Mr HICKS,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Has the minister's attention been drawn to criticism from the Community and Public Sector Union today of Australia's move towards quality assurance for beef exports? Are the union's claims correct or are they damaging to Australia's move towards greater efficiency in the industry?,78
116,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for the question. Yes, I have seen those criticisms and in the Canberra Times this morning there is an article headed 'Reforms threaten meat exports'. At the outset I want to reassure the House that the Commonwealth's planned reforms are in fact all about improving food safety and quality as a vital investment in this country in securing new and existing markets. Industry and government together recognise that consumers here and abroad want and demand ever higher standards of food safety. Better processes will be required in the future to meet those rising expectations. The approach that we are adopting, the so called HACCP based system, agreed by all Australian governments, already implemented in Victoria and increasingly now being picked up by the other states, is now used extensively worldwide in food production right across the region. The point that needs to be understood by some of these people, including Ms Felicity Rafferty, is that the game has moved on. Things change. I know that sometimes that is hard for people like to Felicity to recognise, but these are the not the old days where visual inspection of carcasses was the best way to secure food safety in the meat industry. These days the safety and quality issues of the 1990s go to the heart of things like microbiological contamination and residues. They need much more sophisticated approaches to pick up. So, in short, criticism from Felicity Rafferty of the CPSU is a travesty in this area. It is really all about protecting a jobher job--and the few hundred people that she represents, regardless of the implication for the 50,000 other Australian workers, most of them in the regions, who work in this massive Australian industry. The great irony in all of this is that in referring in her rather emotive and sensational way to the tragic deaths that we have seen in America and in this country from things like E.coli in recent times, she overlooks the very real probability that those sad deaths would have been avoided if the system that we are developing had been put in place. This government is about protecting and enhancing our export opportunities. It is hardly going to put consumers at risk or implement processes that cannot be justified here or internationally. Apart from anything else, we have seen from the international experience what BSE has done to consumer confidence amongst meat eaters. We are putting in place total quality control systems which will remain under the watchful eyes of government employed regulators. Those measures are designed to maXimise, not minimise, our opportunities in our markets here and aboard. In conclusion, it is hard to avoid the observation that we probably should not expect anything else from the person who went to the United States and urged American consumers--can you believe this-to boycott Australian product. Mr Adams-A great record!",78
117,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"It is a great Australian record, reflecting our great commitment to all of those jobs in this vitally important rural and regional industry! But it is well reflected in the sorts of attitudes and commitments we see from people opposite when it comes to the things that matter to rural people. Civil Aviation Safety Authority",79
118,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer the minister to the allegation that he suggested to CASA board member Dr Clare Pollock that she could undertake consultancies with CASA, BASI or the department of transport if she resigned from the CASA board, and to his claim that this approach was only meant to indicate to her that if she resigned she would not be precluded from undertaking such consultancies. Why did the minister raise the matter of consultancies with Dr Pollock if not to seek to induce her to resign from the CASA board? Is it not the case that, even on the minister's own construction of the discussion, he was offering her an inducement; namely, 'If you resign, I won't victimise you.'?",79
119,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I tell you what, Mr Speaker, they are getting to the bottom of the bucket. My conversation with Dr Clare Pollock was quite interesting because I had never met Dr Pollock before although I had heard of her and her work. Dr Pollock is an academic. She is an expert in human behaviour. In the course of our conversation over the telephone when I first broached the subject of her resignation, prior to me asking her to resign from the board I discussed her background. She said that one of her consultancies was an examination into a fire in one of the London tubes-I think at Kings Cross Station-where the elevator caught fire and 70 or so people were killed. She indicated on the telephone that her consultancy work on that was indeed one of the highlights of her career. In the course of our conversation I said, 'The purpose of my call today is to ask you to resign. I do not want you to take offence at that, but we have a clearly stated policy.'",79
120,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,79
121,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!,79
122,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"This style that you can see is evidence of Justice Fisher's claim that I am only charming. I said to her, 'The reason I am asking you to do this is that we are a new government, just elected, and we have a clearly stated platform requiring the people on the board to have aviation expertise. You obviously do not have aviation expertise. I do not want you to think that we think you are an irresponsible person, not intelligent or incompetent. It is simply our endeavour to ensure that we have people with appropriate expertise on this very important board so we can overcome problems that the civil aviation safety regulator has had in years past.' As part of the conversation, I also said, 'I do not want you to think that this will, in any way, impair your ability to obtain consultancy work in the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or the department of transport.' That is perfectly proper. The honourable member for Melbourne should have listened to my earlier answer today where I outlined what their own appointment, the person appointed when Labor was in office, Justice Fisher, said on the World Today program in reference to the offer I made or the conversation I had with Dr Clare Pollock. Justice Fisher said in the interview: Reporter: Was there any kind of inducement that you're aware of that was offered to her? Justice Fisher: Inducement, no, but discussion, yes. As I understand it, the minister has given his version of the discussion and I think that broadly accords with what I was told. Reporter: So, in fact there was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kinds of jobs if she stepped aside? Justice Fisher went on to answer: There was certainly no offer of a job. That absolutely and utterly destroys the very basis of your claim that somehow or other I was offering her an inducement or a bribe. It proves to the House that yesterday in the House and yesterday outside the House you were deliberately trying to deceive the people of Australia over this very important issue. Private Health Services",79
123,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House whether a round table conference of health sector leaders took place yesterday? What was the purpose of the round table conference? What outcomes emerged from the meeting which could offer Australian health consumers a better deal?,80
124,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Last November I became concerned that there was very little consensus or goodwill in the private health sector. So back then I convened the first in a series of round table discussions with hospitals, doctors, insurers and consumers to see whether there could be common ground found on a number of issues. I am pleased to say that the last meeting occurred yesterday and consensus has emerged on a number of issues which I think will be very positive for consumers. They are simplified billing, informed consent and guidelines for contractual negotiations. The first is simplified billing. Anyone who has had a stint in a private hospital will know the torrent of bills that turns up after a hospital stay. My last experience with that was two years ago when my son had a two day stay in intensive care. I got something like 35 bills for that two day stay over the next five months. That is what over lO per cent of people put as their major reason for dropping private health cover. Doctors, hospitals and funds have agreed to cooperate on a number on trials looking at different methods of simplified billing. It may not get down to just one bill, but it offers very real prospects of, for the first time, being able to do something that is very positive for consumers. It also recognises that the present system is totally unsatisfactory. The second thing is informed consent. Most people find it nearly impossible to find out how much they will be up for for an episode of care. While individual surgeons may give their fees in the out-of-pocket expenses, you cannot predict what the anaesthetist, the radiologist, the pathologist and the other doctors working in the area are going to charge. They have agreed to set up a group to design and trial different procedures to give informed consent for the public. It may be in the end that the public will, at best, only be able to be given a range of expectations because you cannot always predict what is going to happen post-operatively. There is also goodwill here and a willingness to accept that the public has a right to have some idea of what they are going to be up for. Finally, hospitals and funds have agreed that there should be some guidelines for contract negotiations particularly when this impinges on the rights of consumers. Negotiations between hospitals and funds are quite new. They are still exploring their ways. I get a torrent of complaints from insurers and then I get exactly the same complaints about the insurers from the funds. In the end though, they both should be interested in the public. I do not want to see the public getting squeezed or forgotten in these contract negotiations. I thank all parts of the health industry and also the consumers for their excellent input. Hopefully something worthwhile will come out of it for the public. Civil Aviation Safety Authority",80
125,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I call the member for Melbourne.,80
126,Mr TANNER,Unknown,Didn't I tell you to stay outside and bark at strangers?,80
127,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Melbourne will address his question.,80
128,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Did the minister meet with the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in April 1996 and invite the four lay members of the board to resign? Did he state to the board members words to the effect that, if there were any other government appointments or work that would be more conducive or convenient for them, he was prepared to look at that? Can he confirm that the chairman of CASA responded by stating: 'We are not timeservers,' thus indicating that he fully understood the nature of the minister's offer? Is this not ample demonstration of the real agenda by the minister to repay Dick Smith, Boyd Munro and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for their financial and political support for the Liberal and National parties at the 1996 federal election?",80
129,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I can confirm that I met with the board of CASA on 9 April at the department of transport's office. I can also confirm to the House that, after shaking hands with everybody and sitting down, within the first two minutes of our conversation the chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority called me sonny, told me I was an upstart and accused me of being corrupt. As you can see, we got off to an excellent start.",81
130,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Why didn't you charm him?,81
131,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"He obviously appreciated my charm retrospectively, but I did ask him to substantiate the latter of the allegations was unable to do so. In regard to the question put by the honourable member for Melbourne, who I think has fled-there he is, I though he had fled in shame-the alleged offers that he refers to from the quote that he took from Justice Fisher, he claims that we made some sort of an offer to them, this was referred to in the same World Today interview on ABC radio held earlier this afternoon. The reporter asked the same question of Justice Fisher and Justice Fisher answered his question by saying: 'Now that wasn't an offer.'",81
132,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,What's the rest of it?,81
133,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"If you want me to read the rest of it, but it was a raising of the subject, and that's it.",81
134,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,What was that?,81
135,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Indeed, as Justice Fisher so clearly pointed out throughout his interview on the World Today, there was no offer, to quote Justice Fisher. In regard to the latter portion of your question, the only people who have appointed the person you referred to to any position within the Civil Aviation Authority are the very people sitting opposite us today: the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the former Treasurer-all the people who have appointed that person to that civil aviation safety regulator. You are the people who have done that, not us. Local Government: Funding",81
136,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Can the minister advise the House as to the level of financial assistance the Commonwealth government is providing in 1996-97 to local government under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act? Is the minister able to advise the House what proportion is allocated to regional and rural councils?",81
137,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I thank the member for Griffith for his question. It would be well known to many that he is a great supporter of local government having spent nine years on the Brisbane City Council. In the current financial year, 1996-97, the and he Commonwealth provided $1.2 billion in grants to local councils. This was an increase in the 1995-96 level of nearly $47 million. It is an increase that represents a four per cent increase, and that is in both dollar terms and real terms. The increase honoured a major election promise and undertaking of the coalition. The FAGs pay for approximately 10 per cent of all local government income and some smaller regional and rural councils receive up to 50 per cent of their income from these grants. Using the Australian Local Government Association classifications of urban, rural and urban regional councils, in 1996-97, urban councils received $385 million, urban regional councils received $323 million and rural councils received $475 million. The total grants to rural and regional councils is, therefore, $779 million. This represents 67 per cent of the total Commonwealth grants to local councils. The important point is that, of that nearly $47 million increase in 1996-97, rural and regional councils received 77 per cent, or $35 million, of that total increase. These are untied funds. They are funds that are used by councils to build roads and bridges, health clinics, regional centres, maintain parks and do a whole range of other things such as collect garbage and other essential services. This funding is helping to generate jobs. It is recognised that it helps to generate opportunities in small business. It is recognised by local government, particularly in rural and regional areas, as being absolutely essential for their ongoing capacity to provide services and it is a clear demonstration of the commitment of this government to rural and regional councils and, indeed, to local government right around our nation. It belies the fact of the accusations made by the Labor Party that this government is not supporting rural and regional Australia. The facts show otherwise. The people in rural and regional Australia know that to be the case, and that is why they supported us in overwhelming numbers in the election that we have just had. NA NA Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Tanner) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Melbourne moving forthwithThat this House(1) censures the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for: (a) attacking the competence and the integrity of members of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority without justification and undermining the efforts of the CAS A Director, Mr Keith and his fellow Board members to improve aviation safety regulation; (b) acting in breach of the Prime Minister's ""Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility"" by: (i) seeking to procure an appointment to another Government position for Ms Hollows on condition that she resign from the CASA Board; (ii) suggesting to Ms Pollock, a member of the Civil Aviation Authority Board, that if she resigned she would have opportunities to take up consultancies within his portfolio; and (iii) making a general offer to CAS A Board members that he was prepared to consider finding alternative positions for they agreed to resign; and (c) seeking to improperly influence the actions of Commonwealth office-holders in a way which could be in breach of the Crimes Act; and (2) calls on the Prime Minister to hold a full judicial inquiry into these matters and to stand aside the Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the outcome of that judicial inquiry. Mr Reith-We will take the motion.",81
138,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the motion seconded?,82
139,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",82
140,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I move: That this House (1) censures the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for: (a) attacking the competence and the integrity of members of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority without justification and undermining the efforts of the CAS A Director, Mr Keith and his fellow Board members to improve aviation safety regulation; (b) acting in breach of the Prime Minister's ""Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility"" by: (i) seeking to procure an appointment to another Government position for Ms Hollows on condi90n that she resign from the CAS A Board; (ii) suggesting to Ms Pollock, a member of the Civil Aviation Authority Board, that if she resigned she would have opportunities to take up consultancies within his portfolio; and (iii) making a general offer to CAS A Board members that he was prepared to consider finding alternative positions for them if they agreed to resign; and (c) seeking to improperly influence the actions of Commonwealth office-holders in a way which could be in breach of the Crimes Act; and (2) calls on the Prime Minister to hold a full judicial inquiry into these matters and to stand aside the Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the outcome of that judicial inquiry. This fiasco that we have before the House them if today is the culmination of a prolonged vendetta pursued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He has sought resignations from board members. He has attacked them publicly in this House and outside this House. He has accused them of putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety in Australia. He has undertaken a war by press release against his own safety authority. He has grossly distorted the events that have occurred in regard to the resignation of Dr Liddell from the authority and the Falcon Airlines crash in order to blacken the names of the directors of Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Never with any specific charges. All the time smearingnever with any specific charges. Now we have a situation where we have a formal 'show cause' letter which he has sent, dated 28 January, to enable him to sack the board. That letter has been sent to all four board members. It is 19 pages long, and I have a copy of it here. Two of these members have four months to go in their positions. If it is not bad enough that he is engaging in this outrageous campaign of vilification and smear against the members of this board, now we have a situation where it has been uncovered that he and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) have been seeking to induce the resignation of some members of the board by offering them other positions, clearly in contravention of the ministerial guidelines quite possibly in contravention of the Crimes Act as well. Over the past year the minister has done following things: he has asked in person, he has asked in writing, he has asked directly at a meeting of the board, for their resignations. His answer as to why he had to do this: 'I have obligations to other people.' I would urge you to remember that quote. He claimed that they had no experience relevant to aviation, including Dr Clare Pollock, who is a safety expert. I would remind him that the name of the authority is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But, no, she has no relevant expertise. He misled the public about the board's role on the Ita Buttrose program. He effectively said the board gets out there and checks the planes, which, of course, it does not. It has a supervisory role. Mr Sharp---'Effectively said'! Quote me. Big deal!",82
141,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I will get you the transcript if you like. It has a supervisory role; it is not the hands-on part of the organisation. He accused the directors of putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety and that they were nothing better than a rubber stamp. He has grossly represented actions of CASA, things that the board had nothing to do with and things that imply no culpability on their part---clearly smearing them, as we saw again today, with tragic events that occurred before they were even members of the board. He has even issued press releases attacking his own authority. He has given no warning of these attacks. He has never met with the board since that initial time. He has ignored letters from CASA and he has never made any specific complaints or charges. The board was not there when the Seaview and Monarch disasters occurred. Now they and Leroy Keith are pursuing a reform program to fix up the problems that do exist in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and all the minister can do is attack them, undermine them and try to get rid of them by devious means such as trying to induce them through offers that are effectively corrupt. Now he has gone right over the top. On 28 January, each director was sent a 'show and cause' letter as to why they should not be dismissed. I have a copy of this letter and it is an extraordinary document. Is there anythe thing in there about gross incompetence? No. Is there anything in there about impropriety? No. Is there anything in there about breaching the Civil Aviation Safety Act? No. What is in there? Let us have a list of just a few of the things: failing to provide a copy of the annual corporate plan, even though, in accordance with an instruction from the previous minister, the board was not to provide that plan until after the Seaview commission reported, which turned out to be October 1996. And, in spite of that, they have already got a draft to the department for their comment. But they have failed to provide a corporate plan! Taking a different view on certain aviation safety issues from the Bureau of Aviation Safety Investigation. They have the temerity to have a different view on a few technical issues. Failing to respond to requests from the minister's adviser Mr Wallace for documents. These requests were made on 14 January, 15 January and 17 January-not 1996 but 14, 15 and 17 January 1997. In other words, we are going to dismiss independent board members of a statutory authority because they have failed to respond to a request from the minister's office for a document within about five or six working days. The final example is that they are attacked because, when they were asked for material regarding the Falcon incident in Queensland, he complained that they gave too much. Only 1'12 of the five folders was relevant. That is a ground for sacking. But there is much more. It is a very entertaining document when you read it, I can tell you. The really big surprise is that what he is proposing to do is clearly unlawful. I have already indicated in question time today the legal advice from Blake Dawson Waldron, which says: A large number of the matters raised in the minister's letter appear to be relevant to management matters which would not usually be dealt with directly by the board. The minister's actions are quite seriously flawed and would, if challenged, be held by a court not to have provided procedural fairness to CAS A or its board members. It goes on: . . . a failure to take into account relevant considerations, failure to properly particularise the complaints, errors of law, a possible ground of apprehension of bias ... I understand Justice Fisher has written to the Prime Minister asking that he disqualify the minister for transport from acting as judge in this case because of his previous attacks on the authority. This advice-and it is a hell of a lot more substantial than the flimsy one page that came from two hours work yesterday-concludes: His decision, if he takes it, will be an unlawful exercise of his statutory powers. Now the whole tawdry, smelly story comes to a conclusion. What has been occurring has finally started to come out with the minister's improper approaches to members of the board to try to suborn them, to try to get them to resign from their positions by other means. Bit by bit the truth has been dragged out, and the true measure of his desperation is emerging. On 6 May last year, board member Gabi Hollows met with Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and with Tim Fischer-the postman, Mr Fischer the postman-in the Prime Minister's office. He delivered a letter from Senator Herron to her. We have all seen what is in that letter, since it was finally tabled last night after Senator Herron quoted selectively from it. In fact, he quoted almost all of it except the key sentence and then refused to table it. I wonder why he did that. Could it have perhaps been a guilty conscience or was it just coincidence? The key sentence is: I have discussed this matter with my ministerial colleague Mr Sharp who has assured me that he will be amenable to you retiring from your responsibilities on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in order to be available for an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health delivery. Oh, the unctuousness. He is amenable. The generosity. The condescension. He is amenable to Ms Hollows resigning when in fact he has been chasing her and her fellow board members relentlessly throughout the whole period preceding this letter . Then Gabi Hollows meets the minister for transport and-what a coincidence-he says, 'I'd like you to resign from the CASA board. Oh, by the way, I've got a great idea. Why don't you go down the corridor and there is the minister for Aboriginal affairs, my good mate. I think he can line up a job for you.' Of course, according to the Prime Minister, this is just pure coincidence-total coincidence that all this is occurring. What is it? It is actually the old one-two. The two ministers saying, 'Right, we've got a problem here. John's got a problem, so John will fix it up. We get Gabi Hollows in-bang, bang, away we go. Yes, no worries, we're going to look after you,' and his problem is solved. But, fortunately, Gabi Hollows did not take the bait. She knew what was involved; she knew what this was all about. It will be said, and it already has been said, what is wrong in appointing Gabi Hollows to a position in Aboriginal affairs? Nothing. There is nothing wrong with doing that. But that is not the issue. The appointment has to be on the basis of merit alone-merit only, not on the basis of extraneous considerations like 'Will she do something else? Will she resign from another position in order to do thatT That is not on the basis of merit. The real reason for this offer is shown by the fact that it was a general offer. It was not a specific offer. Senator Herron did not say, 'There is this position involving these tasks, this remuneration and this time.' It was a general offer in a letter. The true nature of this offer was 'I want you to get off the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board.' That was the true motive for the offer. The ministerial guidelines at page 11 state: ... government appointments are to be made on the basis of merit, taking into account the skills, qualifications, experience and any special qualities required of the person to be appointed. What was the qualification required of Gabi Hollows in this instance? It was that she agree to resign from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. Nothing else. Nothing of that nature is in the ministerial guidelines. It does not say that it is okay if you offer an appointment to somebody on the basis that they do you a favour somewhere else-for very good reasons. The fact that she was not appointed only adds further weight to the case. We tum now to the question of the Crimes Act. Contrary to what the minister has said today, I have not made accusations directly that he has breached the Crimes Act. I have raised the issue and said that the Prime Minister has to ensure that this is properly investigated. There are issues there that need to be investigated and they have not been investigated properly. Section 73(3) makes it an offence to offer any benefit to a Commonwealth officer in order to influence them in the exercise of their duty. Section 88 says it is an offence to corruptly offer a benefit to a person regarding an appointment to a federal government office, and there are various other provisions of a similar nature. The question is: is there going to be a proper examination of the behaviour of this minister and of Senator Herron to determine whether or not any offences have occurred? Are witnesses going to be interviewed? Is anybody going to be asked what has actually happened? Is Gabi Hollows going to be asked what has happened? Is there going to be any form of inquiry? 'No. We will give the letter to a lawyer in the Attorney - General's office and that will do.' What have we ended up with? We have ended up with a single page-the quickest, the shortest, the dirtiest piece of legal advice in legal professional history, and, believe me, there is some competition for that award. We have got a piece of legal advice that does not consider the discussion between the minister and Gabi Hollows where he admitted that he made the offer. It is not considered in that advice. It does not consider the discussion between Gabi Hollows and Senator Herron. It does not ask what discussions have occurred between Senator Herron and the minister. Most particularly, it takes no examination whatsoever of the extended pattern of the minister's attacks on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. It is a bit like asking somebody to investigate the fact that Chris Skase has bought a yacht and not telling them about all the other issues that are part of the transaction. That is what they have done. They have just said, 'Here's the letter. Get us off, and that'll do.' The Prime Minister has refused to recognise this situation for what it is, and it is straightforward-it is job trafficking, it is influence peddling and it is gross impropriety. Now the minister says that it is all innocent; we are misinterpreting this; we have the wrong end of the stick; we do not understand; and the letter can be interpreted in another way. Yet when he was asked yesterday about any other instances, first off he said no. He did not respond when I asked a general question about all instances. Then when I asked specifically, 'Any other apart from Gabi Hollows?', as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) says, he said, 'I am not aware of any other situation.' Then when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) asked the same question, 'I cannot think of any other situation.' Today the truth started to emerge: there was another situation. The minister admitted on AM that there were discussions with Dr Clare Pollock. Her version was that she was being told that consultancies would be available, that she would have the opportunity for consultancies if she resigned, but, of course, she could not take them while she was a member of the board. His version is that she was being told, 'Don't worry. If you resign, it will be okay. You'll still be able to get consultancies. I won't victimise you. You won't be prejudiced.' That is his version. But he has not told us why he raised the issue in the first place. Why did he raise the issue in the first place? He has not answered that at all. What he also has not acknowledged is that, even on the minister's version of events, this is an inducement. It is a negative induceWill ment saying, 'If you resign, I won't victimise you.' We are also dealing with a person here who, I would remind the minister, is one of his unqualified board members, one of the people who should not be on the board because they do not know anything about aviation safety. They are in the wrong place. It is perhaps worth asking the question: if is unqualified to be on the board, how is it that she is qualified to do consultancies for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation? How is she qualified for those? The answer is, of course, as I said before, that Clare Pollock an expert on safety, on human reactions, on human behaviour in safety generally and an entirely appropriate person to be on that board. I note that he has sought to use the statements of Mr Justice Fisher today in his defence. Mr Justice Fisher spoke carefully but I think we had better let him speak for himself and, more particularly, we had better let Clare Pollock speak for herself, but she does not have the opportunity to do that at the moment. I think she will talk to an inquiry. I think she will respond and give her version of events, but all you are doing is preventing that sort of inquiry from occurring. The minister has misled the parliament on three occasions. Three strikes and you're out, Minister, on this issue. On three occasions you have failed to fess up to this. In spite of the new evidence, the Prime Minister says the case is closed. We have looked at one aspect of the first instance but no, the case is closed. We have two instances so far, but there is a third at around the same time-at the board meeting-and he admits it. He quibbles over the meaning of it, but he admits it. If there were any other government appointment or work that would be more conducive or convenient for them, he was prepared to look at it. The response from the chairman was, 'We're not time servers.' He knew what the minister was talking about. 'Do you want a pay-off?' That is what he was talking about and Justice Fisher said no. There were people taking notes there. Will we get those notes? we actually get an inquiry to determine precisely what occurred? So far the answer is no. The reply from Mr Justice Fisher makes it very clear what the proposal was that the minister made to him, and what it indicates is that there are three instances which cannot be explained away by innocent misunderstandings as he seeks to do. Within a month, he she has innocently ganged up with Senator Herron on Gabi Hollows to try· to offer her a job in Aboriginal affairs if she resigned. He has innocently suggested to the board, 'If you need something else, I can look at it.' He has innocently suggested to Clare Pollock, 'What is about consultancies?' Doesn't it strike you as remarkably coincidental that all of these innocent things are going on in such a way. This minister has the competence of Billy McMahon and the credibility of Richard Nixon. The true picture is that he is a minister who will stoop to any lengths to get rid of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board in order to pay off the political debts that he owes to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, to Dick Smith and Boyd Munro, who have supported him and the coalition very strongly at the last election. The key question in all this is: will the Prime Minister accept that there are new charges? Will he accept that yesterday's so called inquiry was a farce, an absolute joke, that set new depths in his unwillingness to confront the misbehaviour of his ministers? Will the Prime Minister initiate a judicial inquiry into this whole tawdry, scurrilous affair and, particularly, will he stand the minister down? If he does not, then he stands before the Australian people for what he is, the man who is called Honest John in the same way as redheads are called Bluey or tall blokes are called Tiny. That is what Honest John means. He is the man who paraded around with the great standards that he said he would introduce after the Keating government, but he allows grossly improper behaviour and will not do anything about it. He allows behaviour which may be illegal and he will not do anything about it, not even initiate an inquiry. And the best defence he can come up with is Barry Jones and Gareth Evans! There is one key difference. That was not ministerial conduct; that was conduct within a political party. That was not taxpayers' money being offered to people as an inducement to step down from a board. If ministerial standards mean anything at all, now is the time that the Prime Minister has got to act. He has to call the ministers to account, stand them down and call a judicial inquiry, or will he continue to tolerate the welter of sleaze, job trafficking and influence peddling that is rapidly overcoming the government? It is up to the Prime Minister to determine what he is going to do. This minister should stand down and acknowledge his wrongdoing. (Time expired)",83
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the motion seconded?,87
143,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,87
144,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House censures the Labor Opposition for failure when in government to put in place proper arrangements for guaranteeing aviation safety in Australia and the member for Melbourne for misleading the Australian people'. We have seen a display in the House this afternoon and yesterday of how incompetent and inappropriate the Labor Party was in government and now how incompetent and inappropriate they are in opposition. Their track record on aviation safety management is nothing to crow about. We have heard today, and yesterday, from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Yesterday he was ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who, incidentally, and interestingly, did not appear in the attack today. I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition did not appear in the attack today, unlike his involvement in it yesterday when he participated in the attack on both me and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). The reason the Leader of the Opposition was not part of the attack today was simply that he knew-like everybody on this side of the House knows, like most people on the Labor side of the House know-that the opposition is flogging a dead duck. The Leader of the Opposition knows-like everybody else in this House and everybody in the Australian public knows-when it comes to administering aviation safety in this country, who has credibility and who has not. Everybody knows the Labor Party in government had probably the worse track record of aviation safety management in the history of this country. The reasons for that are evident wherever you want to tum in recent years. I am fascinated that the person seconding the censure motion of the honourable member for Melbourne today is the former Minister for Transport, the membl!r for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was responsible during most of the period that the Labor Party was in office during the 1990s for aviation safety in this country. It is fascinating to recall highlights-some would say lowlights--of the previous Labor government's management of aviation safety while in office. I guess two outstanding things spring to mind in the history of Labor's its management of aviation safety in this country. They are words that are household names around Australia. They are Monarch Airlines and Seaview Air. Monarch Airlines was operating a commuter service between Sydney and Young in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, on 11 June 1993, Monarch Airlines crashed within about a ki lometre of the Young airport on a very bad Friday evening. In the subsequent publicity that followed, and in the coronial inquiry which investigated the preconditions or causes of that crash, it became quite self-evident that the failure of the aviation safety regulator was a major contributing factor to that crash in which seven people lost their lives. Which government was responsible for establishing the aviation safety regulator in Australia at that time? Which government was it? The Labor government. Which ministers were responsible at the time for the implementation of the reforms that established the Civil Aviation Authority? Which ministers were they? Let me think for a moment. Oh, Senator Gareth Evans was Minister for Transport and Communications at the time of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority in 1988. What is Senator Evans doing today? Oh, he is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition here in the House of Representatives. Who else was around at the time? The then member for Swan, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), was also minister for transport through this period. Who else was minister for transport through this period? The former Treasurer in the Labor government, Mr Willis. So sitting on the opposition benches today is a living history of the reforms made by the previous Labor government in civil aviation regulation in Australia. It is quite clear that, as a consequence of those reforms, they established an organisation which let down the travelling public of Australia. That was self-evident in the coronichanged al inquiry into the Monarch crash and it was self-evident-even Blind Freddy could see it-in the commission of inquiry undertaken by Justice James Staunton into the Seaview crash, which occurred on 2 October 1994. My involvement in this goes back to the night of that Monarch crash. That crash occurred within a mile of my farm at Young, where I come from. It was the place I learnt to t1y at. I knew six of the seven people who were on board that aircraft. For that reason and because it was in my electorate and they were primarily my constituents, I took an interest in it. The story of incompetence that unravelled before our eyes was amazing. Many people would not believe me when I first started to tell the story, but I felt it was important for us to do that. And we did it. I did it on 9 May 1994 in this House. I highlighted all of my concerns. I described an airline which I felt was an accident waiting to happen, another Monarch. That was Seaview. Seaview Air, I said, was 'a danger to the travelling public' if I can remember my words at the time. Of course, five months later, having made all these claims in the House and having brought them to the attention of the then Minister for Transport, who is now the member for Kingsford-Smith, and having seen the government take no notice whatsoever, a Seaview Air plane crashed on 2 October 1994 with nine lives lost. In the commission of inquiry that followed, it was quite apparent that a contributing factor to that crash and the loss of those nine lives was the failure of the aviation safety regulator to do its job properly, to do the job that it was paid for. It was sad but true that, because of the inefficiency and incompetence of that aviation safety regulator, a number of people lost their lives. So the importance of getting aviation safety right is burnt into my heart. It sits in my conscience every day. I am driven in my present role as Minister for Transport and Regional Development to make sure that I get aviation safety regulation right in this country. It is quite obvious to anybody, as it was obvious in those two inquiries, that there is a serious problem. Yet what did Labor do? It things by establishing two separate authorities. On I July 1995, the former CAA became two organisations: Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-strange that because that is precisely what I recommended. All the reforms undertaken by the former Labor government were those reforms I outlined in my speeches in May and June 1994 in the House. So when it comes to who has a track record in this area, I think I, and indeed this government, have an admirable track record on being alert to the needs of aviation safety regulation in this country. Some scurrilous and outrageous suggestions have been made yesterday and today by the honourable member for Melbourne in the parliament and outside. He has been ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition. He claims all of these things, including that I and somehow the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) have been involved in some criminal actsome act of bribery; some act of inducement. That is absolutely and utterly wrong. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) investigated the matter yesterday, asking the Attorney General (Mr Williams) to provide advice, the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney General's office, Mr H. Burmester, gave his advice. I will read it, because it is instructive for us to hear it: You have asked for advice as to whether or not a letter signed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on 6 May 1996 and addressed to Ms G Hollows ... gives any cause for concern that an offence may thereby have been committed against Section 73 of the Crimes Act 1914, or any other provision of that Act, or any provision of any other Act of the Parliament. Section 73 has, in my opinion, no application to the facts and circumstances set out in that letter. Additionally, in my opinion, there is no other provision of that or any other Act which would apply. Accordingly, I consider that there is nothing contained in the letter which would make it necessary or appropriate for the matter to be referred either to the Australian Federal Police for consideration of investigation, or to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of prosecution. In that opinion from the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's office is the truth of the allegations made yesterday by the honourable member for Melbourne both inside and outside the House. The rest of the allegations and the confirmation of the Chief General Counsel's view came today in the World Today interview with Justice Fisher, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Justice Fisher makes things quite clear in the interview with Fran Kelly. She talks of the letter written to Ms Gabi Hollows. All that Justice Fisher can find to say about that letter was that we were not necessarily trying to offer her anything or to induce or bribe her, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne, but that we were trying to charm her. That is a significant difference from the innuendo cast by the honourable member for Melbourne yesterday and ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition. In terms of the second person that the honourable member claims I tried to induce or bribe to resign from the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the question from the reporter is this: And in terms of Dr Clare Pollock. Was there any kind of inducement that you're aware of offered to her? Justice Fisher says: Inducement? No. But discussion? Yes. Isn't it a terrible thing to have a discussion. He continues: As I understand it, the minister has given his version of the discussion and I think it broadly accords with what I was told. That is, what he was told by Dr Clare Pollock. The reporter then says: So in fact that was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board-rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kinds of jobs, if she stepped aside? Justice Fisher's answer was this: There was certainly no offer of a job.",87
145,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,Look at what else he said. Look at it.,89
146,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"It must be terribly disappointing to you to find that the person who is now chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, a well-known member of the Sydney Labor establishment and a former Labor candidate for parliament, goes on the ABC radio today at noon and says those sorts of things. It is disappointing for you because you know that this totally destroys the basic precepts of your attack in the House yesterday and indeed today. It is the words of Justice Fisher which destroy your credibility. It is the words of the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's office that destroy your scurrilous attack in this matter in the House today. The substance of their attack is that it is an outrageous thing that I, as Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who is ultimately responsible for aviation safety in Australia and for the millions of Australians who travel by air every year, would want to have people who know something about aviation to oversight the aviation safety regulator. This is a great shock. Goodness gracious, why didn't you invent the idea? If you had, I am sure that you would have done it. But you were too busy, in your time in office, appointing people who were not appropriately qualified. Only one of the non-executive directors of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has aviation expertise. It is my intent that all those who travel on airlines around Australia every year-those millions of Australianswill be able to get on a plane knowing that the safety aspects of that aircraft are being oversighted by a board of people who know about aviation and who can assure Australia that we have the safest aviation regulation regime anywhere in the world. At present, with the people who do not have those qualiSo fications, that assurance cannot be given. The reason for that is your failure to adequately maintain aviation safety in this country. expired)",89
147,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I look across the chamber and I see the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) there. The Minister for Finance knows what happens when you offer an inducement. That is how he became Premier of New South be able Wales. He knows better than anyone in this House. How characteristic it was this afternoon the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), rather than defendthat, ing himself against the serious charges that have been made, sought to mislead this House. He sought to be untruthful in his this exercise. dealing with this matter by suggesting that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-a body formed only in July 1995-was responsible some way for those awful, terrible crashes. What a disgraceful, untruthful performance from this minister. The minister knows and the House knows that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority was formed in direct response to the inadequacies that were shown in the coronial inquiry and the royal commission which we in government set up. They recommended the establishment of the authority. The minister went further than that. He went to the point of saying that the directors of CASA were people who were associated with this linage, when of course these directors did not take office until 1 July that year. Indeed, they had been in office for barely nine months when he became minister and commenced his campaign to see them eliminated from that authority and removed from office. In addition to that, the minister said this afternoon that the chairman of the authority had made some remarks on The World Today which favoured the arguments that he had been putting forward. But the minister misquoted absolutely the transcript of the interview. The minister quoted this question as asked by the reporter, Fran Kelly: in fact that was no offer of consultancy jobs if she stepped aside from the board-rather a reassurance that she would not be locked out of those kind (Time of jobs, if she stepped aside? Then he should have continued to the next line, which was: Fisher: No, I don't quite put it that way. Nor did the minister give the rest of the sitting quote, where Fisher continued: It was said to her, I think, that she was in the wrong place. If she wasn't on the board she would to accept offers of consulting work with a number of relevant institutions and boards. That was the way it was put. that That is the way the inducement was put. That is the way this minister behaved. Let me say when it comes to devious and nasty conspiracies, it would be hard to top the performance of the Howard government with This is a motion against a minister who is obsessed and prepared to stop at nothing to in get his way. This is a motion against a minister who, from his very first day in office, set out to get the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. This is a minister who nominated them as his No. 1 target and who began on that very day to apply the pressure on them to force them to resign. He waged, it is fair to say, a relentless campaign to destabilise that board, and he used continual media stories and briefings to attack their competence and to undermine them. This is a minister who sought to intimidate the board into resigning by publicly denigrating them. When the minister was thwarted in his evil intent, what did he do to the board? He adopted a two-prong strategy initially. The first prong of the strategy was to amend the legislation. He introduced amendments, and those amendments went to expanding the board so he could put his additional nominees on it. As we know, at the very same time he was doing that, he was covertly seeking to induce the board into resigning. He set the scene when he met the board in the first instance and told them that, if there were any other appointments or work more congenial or convenient to board members, he as minister was prepared to look at it. He set the scene by saying, 'Board members, put that thought clearly in your mind. You must go. But if you don't go, then opportunity knocks. Just come and see me. You've got to go but, if you go voluntarily, the world is your oyster as far as bipartisan. additional government appointments are concerned.' The minister was not prepared to do it all himself. It was not all his own work. He was prepared to recruit the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) as his agent and he was prepared to use the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as his messenger boy. Mr Martin-The postman.",90
148,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"He was the postman who delivered the letter. It is worth asking whether the Deputy Prime Minister knew what was in the envelope. Did he have knowledge of the conspiracy or was he kept in the dark? That is a fair question. Where was that letter delivered? It was delivered here in building in the suite of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It was put in Ms Hollows's hand by the Deputy Prime Minister. W hen was that letter given to her? You would think it was a vulnerable moment. It was given to her when she was appearing here pleading for funds for the Fred Hollows Foundation. She was pleading for funds and the minister for transport chose that moment to hit on her. That is what he did. The very same day as the letter was delivered, as Gabi Hollows herself has revealed, she met with the minister for transport. A press release she put out last night said: I met the Minister for Transport ... and he urged me to use my experience in Aboriginal health. He was right across this, wasn'the? The press release continued: At this meeting he again requested my resignation from the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Of course, it is to her immense credit and to her standing that, in such circumstances, she rejected these disgraceful approaches. This is what she told the Australian last night: The only thing I can say is that I could no longer consider resigning when I was given that letter. The letter had rendered my resignation an impossibility. I was not going to in any way be railroaded by the Minister for Transport or anybody to do political favours for the new government ... I considered myself completely and absolutely apolitical and Ms Hollows stood firm and rejected John Sharp's loathsome overture. But it was not only one female CAS A board member that the minister hit on, because he was after Clare Pollock at exactly the same time. Mr Wilton-Did he hit on Clare?",91
149,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"He hit on Clare, that is right. As the minister was forced to admit on the ABC this morning, he discussed potential consultancies in his area of responsibilitythat is, with the department of transport, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and CASA itself, the very organisation he was forcing her from the board of. She is well qualified to earn money from this CASA, but she is not entitled to sit on its board. Once more, what is happening-nod, nod, wink, wink? She needs to resign from this position if these wonderful opportunities are to come her way. When you read the transcript of John Sharp's interview this morning on the ABC program AM, it is clear that Clare Pollock's problem is not her excellent qualifications; it is the fact that she is not Dick Smith. That is Clare Pollock's problem and that is this government's problem. When the job offers were rightly rejected, what did John Sharp set about doing? When he could not get his way, inducing them from the board, he set about to sledge them from the board, to drive them from existence on that board. The 19-page letter, that concoction, is a document that would do a star chamber proud. I have never seen a more wretched document. It is a charge sheet, but only the latest outrage in his long campaign to hurt this board. This is what Blake Dawson Waldron had to say about this advice: If the Minister purports to terminate board members' appointments we, Blake Dawson Waldron, are of the opinion that his decision will be an unlawful exercise of his statutory powers. has embarked on a course of action seriously flawed which would, if challenged, be held by a court not to have provided procedural fairness to CASA or its board members. It could lead to real damage being suffered by not only the parties directly involved but also CASA and hence the public's confidence in the authority and its vital operations. That is what is Blake Dawson Waldron had to say. While we are on legal opinions, let me place another one before the House this afternoon, not from the Crown law officer asked to give a narrow interpretation on a letter and forbidden from looking at the surrounding circumstances but from a leading member of the Sydney criminal bar who today has provided an opinion which says: There are many ways to seek to influence or affect a Commonwealth officer in the exercise of his duty or authority by promising or offering any property or benefit other than by an outright express bribe. The suggestion made by the letter on its face is oblique. When it is considered in the context of provable circumstances the suggestion becomes quite blatant: ""If you resign from the Board we'll find you a job in Aboriginal health."" What matters as far as criminality or impropriety the nature of all the conduct, the intention behind its effect ... He goes on to quote Hawkins v. The Queen and the view of Sir Anthony Mason, of all people, who quoted Lord Campbell: ... in Walters v. Morgan ... referring to ""a nod or a wink or a shake of the head or a smile"" as comprising or giving content to a representation. He went on to say: Such an offer as is implied from the letter and the surrounding conduct if made with the requisite intention is quite capable of being revealed as illegal or improper on full investigation. The conduct of the two Ministers considered in combination is hardly subtle. That is what he had to say. He finished off by saying: Mr Burmester's advice, confined to the terms of the letter and omitting reference to Mr Sharp and Senator Herron's other actions, an advice given with no reasons but a simple assertion of the author constitutes no substantial basis in my opinion why investigation into such an important matter should not proceed. That is signed 'G.R. James QC, Chambers, Sydney'. As far as the opposition is concerned, this is not a case of 'should not He proceed', as Mr James finished his advice. It is a case of must proceed. This inquiry must be held. The motion moved by my colleague contains a very important term of reference: ... this House calls on the Prime Minister to hold a full judicial inquiry into these matters and to stand aside the Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the outcome of that judicial inquiry. If the Prime Minister, someone with a sworn duty and an oath of office to uphold the laws of this country, fails in his duty in this most serious of matters-and you cannot have a more serious charge-and does not stand him aside and go down the track of a full investigation so that the truth of this matter is clear, one thing will be absolutely clear to the people of Australia, and that is that the PM's code of conduct has been reduced to black letters in the Crimes Act. That is what the code of conduct will mean. As far as the Crimes Act is concerned, there will be no the investigation of the full circumstances of his ministers' action to ensure that they have not behaved in a way that offends the laws that is concerned is they are sworn to uphold. The minister's performance in this nearly yearlong campaign against these people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is one of the most disgraceful episodes I have ever encountered. In the process, he has shown by a constant course of action that he will stop at nothing to have his way. He will make any offer. He will go to any lengths. He will do anything to get rid of these people. Why? We know why. Because he gave his commitment to the people who pledged so much money and so much campaign support to him and his party at the time of the 1996 election. That is what this is about. Air safety and the independence of this tribunal are being totally compromised by the disgraceful performance of this totally irresponsible and unlawful minister.",91

154,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The government rejects every nasty innuendo; we reject every element of deceit; we reject every comma, every dot, every hyphen; we reject this censure motion in its entirety lock, stock and barrel. We reject the insulting character of this motion as put by the Labor Party against a minister who, in the last 12 months, has been working to overcome the problems left to him by the last and previous Labor administration. And what is more, with every ounce of indignation I can bring, we reject the Labor Party putting up the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) as a seconder on this motion when he was the minister responsible, during a significant period under the Labor administration, for the very problems that the now minister has been attempting to resolve. It is beyond belief that the Labor Party could so insult the intelligence of the Australian people that they could put up the member for Kingsford-Smith on an issue which they claim goes to questions of propriety and probity. He is the member who started in the kindergarten of politics in New South Wales, in the Labor Youth Council, and who soon became infamous for the fact that on the back of a motorbike in the middle of the night he took off with a parcel of disputed votes so as to ensure the preselection of Paul Keating. He is the incarnation, if you like, of the Chappaquiddick of Australian politics. The member for Kingsford-Smith comes in here talking to us about probity but he was at the centre of one of Australia's most infamous, unsolved political scandals-the rezoning of land around Botany Bay-which, for those of you who are interested in a bit of Australian history, at one stage saw charges brought against the member for Kingsford Smith. The magistrate said that there was a prima facie case against him, but the same case was dismissed by none other than Chief Magistrate Murray Farquhar-also famous in Australian politics. They put him up to attack us on probity and then they put him up to attack the competence of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). We get this from the member for Kingsford-Smith, who was the minister responsible for the tendering of the tunnel under Sydney Harbour; the minister responsible for the blowouts at Darling Harbour; and the minister responsible for the monorail, which has never made an cent of profit. In his own former federal portfoliolet us talk about competence--one of the great fiascos of management was the handling of the Sydney airport noise issue, which for so long he was the irresponsible minister in charge of. Not only does the member for Kingsford Smith have that litany of failure and question marks over his political career but in his last effort he was the Minister for Industrial Relations. He was the minister who had the gall to stand up in the parliament suggesting a few technical changes to his unfair dismissal law and saying he was going to make a good system better-a system which during Labor's administration literally cost, I would say on a fair and conservative estimate, tens of thousands of jobs of our fellow Australians right across the board but particularly young Australians. I do not make that as a party political comment. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, made that point-that Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws were costing young people opportunities for jobs. So we especially reject a censure motion which is seconded by the member for Kingsford-Smith for all of those very good reasons and also for the hollowness of the claims which they make in regard to the issue before us today. I also want to say, as we reflect upon the political career of the member for Kingsford Smith, what a stark contrast that makes to the incredible efforts that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development-today the subject of the opposition attack-has made in the last 11 months. I suppose I have seen many pretty empty censure motions over the years, but it is particularly galling that we have a censure motion against a minister, the subject matter of which is his attempting to fix up the problems which he has inherited from the previous side. It is not as though this is a new issue. The fact is that John Sharp has put in a hell of an effort, both in opposition and in government, trying to improve aviation safety in this country. It is incredibly galling for you to in any sense question his motive, when he has on the record his efforts for many years now-and those of you who know him personally know what a huge effort he has made for one reason, and that is he has tried to improve the air safety conditions which face Australians as they travel by air. That record is there for all to see. As he mentioned-I thought very wellduring question time today, the minister had ministerial responsibility as a shadow minister in opposition for some of these issues. But the fact is he was personally touched and affected by one of these crashes where a lot of people died. It says a lot for and is a testimony to our colleague that he has made it a personal objective to improve air safety in this country. That is why we particularly so strongly support the minister. Mr Tanner-Pass the violin.",93
155,Mr REITH,Unknown,But it is not just in this area that he has been busy. Mr Tanner-Stick to the issues.,94
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Melbourne has already contributed to the debate.,94
157,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The fact of the matter is, Laurie, he has been cleaning up after you right across the whole portfolio. The black spots program, which this minister has initiated, is very important for Australians. Fixing up ANL was something which the Labor Party could never do, because the ACTU and the unions basically run the show when you are in power. The effort he has put into the improvements to the Pacific Highway again is a feature of the fact that he is interested, concerned and prepared to work to do something about people's safety. The work that he has had to do to fix up the mess in Australian national railways and the like. What an incredible problem that has been-left to us by you. On that issue, again, you have been attacking his attempts to fix up the problem that you created. There is already progress in the transTasman area, as a result of this minister's competence and attention to detail. In the shipping area, he has moved quickly but sensibly to sit down and talk to people about the way we can start to fix the problems about which you did nothing for 13 yearsbecause when you are in office you are run by the unions. Lastly, on the question of aviation safety, the minister has instituted reviews and a program of reform which are not just directed specifically to this issue but to improving air safety in a strategic way in Australia. The issue, as put by Labor, revolves around two incidents or series of events. The first relates to Gabi Hollows and her continuation on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-and similarly the continuation of other board members. Our policy position on this has been quite clear. This is not something that has arisen just in recent times. Well prior to the previous election we made the simple point that we believed that those who constitute that authority ought to be people who are expert in the field. As a common sense proposition, that is very hard to deny, and I was interested to listen to the contributions from the two Labor members because they have never actually mounted a rational argument against that simple proposition. If you are worried about aviation safety in this country and you have a regulatory authority in charge of it, it seems to me to make eminent sense that the people in charge of that the people at whom the buck stops-should be people who have some expertise in that area. We have made that point. It is a policy point that was endorsed in the last election, and this minister has simply been going about doing his job in a competent and sensible way. For that, you bring forward the most spurious, base and hollow claim imaginable. Look at the question of whether or not Ms Hollows should remain on the board. The point the minister has been making is that he respects Gabi Hollows-as do members on both sides of this House, I am sure-for being the person she is and for the work she does in a number of areas. It is hardly exceptional for a minister to say that the government would be interested if she were able to serve the national interest by taking an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health. Basically, that is all that has been said. You can go over the fine detail of the documentation, but that is the bottom line. With the second one, the reality is that the minister, on the basis of what he said and of the confirmation we have had from Bill Fisher, said to Claire Pollock, 'Regardless of the circumstances of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, our view about the work that you might have in the future with the government, given the fact that you have had work with the government before, would not in any way be impaired by the fact that you might tender your resignation from the CASA board.' How could anyone in their right mind say that that was objectionable in any possible way? Mr Tanner-Why raise it?",94
158,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Because the minister is doing the right thing, talking to the person concerned, explaining our policy and simply makes the point that, if in pursuance of our policy objective that person resigns from the board, we are not in any way going to prevent them continuing to obtain work from the government in the future as they have in the past. You cannot in one succinct sentence tell me what is actually wrong with that proposition. Anybody with any common sense could see what a long bow this whole censure motion is. It is a tried and true tactic of the opposition. They allege offences under the Crimes Act, they allege some legal impropriety, they reach for every document they can to try to substantiate their case. Yesterday, in doorstops and in question time, they attempted to draw a long bow by referring to provisions of the Crimes Act. They asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to investigate that matter and he did. He came back with a one-page statement which completely knocked it on the head. There goes that leg of their claim. They made a claim in respect of the ministerial guidelines. I got out the ministerial guidelines and, when you boil it down, the ministerial guidelines expect ministers to act with probity and to get on with the job. That is exactly what this minister has done. Commonsense would tell you that, if you wanted to see a change in the structure of the board, you ought to be talking to some of the people concerned. The minister has done that. It would be pretty odd if he had not talked to those people about what the consequences of their going off the board might be. It beggars belief that this is the subject of a censure motion in the national parliament. You are basically attacking the minister for doing his job by talking to somebody about getting off the CASA board and about what the implications for their relationship with the government might be in the future. It is absolutely absurd. The more you look at this matter-you go through all the detail, the ministerial guidelines, the legal opinion, the Crimes Act and look at the two factual circumstances which form the basis of this censure motion-the more it is evident that there is nothing in it. When you then look at the people who are moving this censure motion-in particular the seconder of this motion-you see that this is one of the most convincing cases for this House to support the amendment to this censure motion that I have ever seen in my 13 years since being sworn in back in the mid1980s. That is what this House ought to do. Rather than accepting the Labor Party motion, the course of action is clear: this Labor opposition, responsible for this mess when they were in government, ought to be censured for the mess they left us, and the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) ought to be censured for misleading this parliament and the Australian people. I commend the amendment to you. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Sharp's) be agreed to. Brereton, L. J. The House divided. [4.19 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B. Nehl)· Ayes ...............

161,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I do. This morning, in an article in the Financial Review entitled 'Coalition push for more detail on convention', Michelle Grattan sought to give a report on our recent party meeting. In her article she inferred that yesterday I had said certain things relating to representation of the states in a statement. I did not. This is in relation to the people's convention. The misrepresentation is the inference that I released a statement following a party meeting in conflict with the decision of the government. Ms Grattan was, in essence, quoting from my media release of 5 February, issued well before the government had decided what level of representation should be given to the states and territories.

High Frequency Modernisation Project, the committee's second report of 1997. Ordered that the reports be printed.",101
171,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"by leave-The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Darwin. The Department of Defence proposes to provide the base with the facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. The proposal examined by the committee encompasses: one, explosive ordnance loading aprons and alert facilities for fighter aircraft; two, operall ational and technical support facilities; three, additional aviation fuel storage; four, an upgrade of the emergency power station; five, a replacement fire and rescue facility; and, six, replacement airfield lighting equipment facilities. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $59.5 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The committee concluded that the military presence in Darwin reflects government policy for an increased defensive presence in the north of Australia. It is clear that RAAF Base Darwin is a vital component of the Defence infrastructure in the north and is likely to remain for many years at its present location. By way of background, the report notes that the military and civilian infrastructure at RAAF Base Darwin represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth and the cost of relocating the RAAF base to another site on the grounds of aircraft noise or public safety cannot be justified. In answer to a number of individuals and organisations which suggested that the RAAF base should be relocated elsewhere on the grounds of aircraft noise, the report acknowledges the responsible efforts of the RAAF in Report promulgating noise abatement procedures which have reduced the incidence of noise complaints. Nevertheless, the report recommends that the Department of Defence should a dedicated telephone line for receivand recording any complaints about aircraft noise and a mechanism for their speedy investigation and reporting back to the The strategic importance of RAAF Base Darwin can easily be overlooked by the presence of RAAF Base Tindall, which is not far to the south. But what the committee had reinforced to it was that, in the sense of real defence for the north of Australia, the role of RAAF Base Darwin as a forward staging post could not be underestimated and that the location of RAAF Base Darwin in strategic terms was irreplaceable. In relation to the extensive works that are proposed, the committee has concluded that of these works will enhance the operational facilities of RAAF Base Darwin as an operational forward redeployment and air defence base not only for Darwin but for the entire nation. The second report I have tabled deals with the proposed development of buildings and services in support of the Department of Defence joint project 2043, high frequency modernisation project. The high frequency modernisation project will provide for the installation of modem, state-of-the-art high frequency radio equipment to satisfy the needs of Army, Navy and Air Force. The public works proposal will provide access roads, security, engineering services and buildings to house the transmitter, receiver and management functions of the network. The entire modernisation project will cost $505 million with building works and services estimated to cost $75 million. The committee has recommended that the building works and services should proceed. .The hi.-h frequency modernisation project will conSIst of four communication nodes each comprising a transmitter station, station and local management facility. There will also be a primary and secondary national management facility. The communication nodes will be located in the Riverina, Townsville, North West Cape and Darwin. I note the interest of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in this proposal and his presence in the chamber this afternoon. --e. committee concluded that existing faCIlItIes are aged and need refurbishment and that new facilities are required at two communication nodes. Facilities to house the high frequency equipment will be located on existing Defence properties and properties acquired for radio communications purposes. All are in areas which Defence believes are free of electromagnetic interference and have sufficient buffer zones to protect them from urban encroachment. The proposed work will entail the construction of new facilities for the Riverina transmitter and receiver on sites which Defence believes are suitable. Elsewhere, the proposal will make good use of existing facilities which will need to be modified. Once the high frequency network is operational, some existing Defence communication sites will be redundant. The committee noted that, before excess properties are offered for sale, Defence should ensure that any soil contamination has been remedied in accordance with state or local government requirements. The report recommends that the Department of Defence provides annual reports on the - tatus o- the redundant properties, particularly In relatIOn to the cost of the remediation of any soil contamination, when they are to be sold and the amount of revenue received. I commend these reports to the House.",101

There is already an eXIstmg transmItter site there, but there will be significant extra works and modificareceive; tions to that site. The receiver equipment will be located at a new site in the Townsville field training area where there is already significant infrastructure of other types that support the Operational Defence Force. I certainly welcome the continuing investment by the government in Townsville. I am unable to say the exact amount of dollars that this project will entail in Townsville because it is at this stage commercial-in-confidence and will be subject to a tender process. I am pleased to say that the government is currently spending nearly a million dollars a week on new capital works and new infrastructure in the city, and that is very welcome indeed for the people of Townsville and the electorate of Herbert. I certainly support the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Public Works. Publications Committee Report",102

175,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"My contribution to the debate on the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and those other bills identified in the orders of the day was interrupted by question time, so I am resuming my contribution. Before question time, I made reference to a very clear, firm and unqualified commitment which had been made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the National Farmers Federation prior to the last election, and I believe that that commitment was very important, firstly, in having the National Farmers Federation endorse the partial sale of Telstra and, secondly, in assuring people in rural and provincial Australia that an incoming coalition government would make absolutely certain that high technology telecommunications facilities would be available to them just as surely as they would be available to people in metropolitan and larger provincial cities. The amendment which was moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who represents the shadow minister for communications in this chamber, made four points. I am not going to go over them-they have already been identified. What I want to do is indicate that I intend to concentrate, to the extent that I can, my remarks on item (3) of that amendment where it expresses concern at the government's refusal to honour its election promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians. People know that ISDN refers to the integrated services digital network. Just to put on the record the promise that was made by the Prime Minister, I indicate that it was made on 21 November 1995 to the National Farmers Federation. It was the big policy announcement of that day. The Prime Minister said: Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service. We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date. 'Its current year 2000 target date' was our commitment-the former Labor government's. That was brought forward, as I say, by that unqualified commitment on the part of the present Plime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, that an incoming coalition government would bring that target date forward to 1 July 1997, that is, this year. Everyone knows that since that commitment was made, the government has sought to back-pedal in a way which will bring very serious disadvantage to those people to whom that promise was quite clearly and unqualifiedly made. For people in rural areas, there are probably two services which, to them, are of overriding importance: transport is one, communications is the other. This present government slashed $600 million out of its road programs, so that is what has been done for transport. As far as communications are concerned, the whole area of telecommunications and things like these high technology provisions, the ISDN, all of those things, if they are provided for people in rural and provincial Australia, will make it possible for them and their families, and in particular for their children, to be given equal opportunities. When we talk about making opportunities available to kids in Australia, we mean the kids in the bush just the same as we mean the kids aBennelong, the kids at Hunters Hill, the kids who can be seen from Kirribilli. We mean the kids in the bush. Now for a government to repudiate an undertaking of that kind, as it quite clearly is set to do, I think is nothing short of disgraceful. Senator Chris Schacht is our spokesman on communications and he is represented in this chamber by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell, Michael Lee, who, incidentally, was the minister for communications in the previous government when that commitment was made that we would be providing, as standard service, across Australia to all Australians, those services by the year 2000. Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, was in the process of charting the course of communications reform for the next century. That has all now been put asunder. The member for Dobell also raised very serious questions when he led for the government in responding to this legislation. I am not going to go into all of those, because, as I have indicated, the one that I am particularly concerned about is item (3) in our amendment, that is, the government's election promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians. I emphasise again that we had undertaken to provide it by the year 2000. The present government, in opposition, said that they would bring that forward until 1 July 1997, that is, this year. After the election, the Minister for Communications and the Arts Senator Alston, commissioned the reviegroup which was chaired by Jock Given from the Communications Law Centre in order to examine this whole area. That was the first step in a quite deliberate strategy to repudiate that earlier undertaking, particularly because of the composition of that review group. I mentioned that Jock Given was to be the chairman. I am not going to go through all the others, except to say that that review group represented, for example, isolated children's parents, the Australian Consumers Association, the National Farmers Federation the Consumers Telecommunications Network' Australian Telecommunications Users Group: Telstra, Vodaphone, Optus, all of the deliverers, all of the service providers, all of the operators in the area of telecommunications, but of particular and very special significance was the inclusion of-I say this without denigrating the professor, he knows he had a role to play and he played it-Professor Henry Ergas, visiting professor from the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland. That is particularly significant because, at the end of that very comprehensive examination of all the issues that that review group was charged to examine, the professor delivered an individual report of one. Those other nine--consumers, providers, participants in telecommunications-all contributed to and endorsed the joint report which that study brought forward. The only dissenting comments were from Professor Ergas. It was interesting because the next stage in this very smart strategy to repudiate that undertaking engineered by and instituted by the minister, Senator Alston, was his media release following that review committee's report. Incredible as you will believe this to be, Mr Deputy Speaker, the first paragraph said: Two reports assessing whether the standard telephone service should be upgraded were released today ... The release said one was from the chairman of the group, Jock Given. The collective decision of Jock Given and the other eightthat is, nine of the 10-was contained within the basic report. The other report, said the minister-these dissenting comments of one given equal status-was from Professor Ergas. He said that he was disappointed that the review group was unable to reach a consensus. Nine did; one dissented. He said the two reports would be given careful consideration. It is interesting that the dissenting comments of Professor Ergas quite clearly are going to be the ones that will be given most careful consideration. That has been indicated, of course, by subsequent developments. The minister's media release went on to say: I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users ... Professor Ergas' s dissenting report makes it clear that very substantial sums of money could be involved. That is repudiated and denied. If there was an attempt to introduce it according to that target date of 1 July, there would probably be fairly heavy expenses involved. But, if our target of the year 2000 was adopted and those changes were introduced gradually, my understanding of the costs of telecommunications is that the cost of the honouring of that commitment would be minimal. The government knew that their proposal of a 1 July 1997 deadline would be more expensive to achieve than Labor's 2000 deadline but, in the light of that, it made that commitment. Now it retreats from that undertaking. There are a number of pretty significant elements about this. It indicates quite clearly that this present government will repudiate that undertaking. My electorate is not in the bush; it is in the outlying areas of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. Already, there are people in my electorate, close to the largest provincial city in New South Wales, who do not have access, who are concerned that their friends are able to access the Internet in a fraction of a second while it might take them anything up to 10 minutes to get the image coming up on their screen. This ISDN technology will mean multiple phones and faxes on the one line, much faster faxes, fast EFTPOS links and purchasing services for business, and fast access to the Internet for educational, cultural and information services, including those for kids in rural schools who will be sitting there waiting for the information to come through while their peers in the larger city schools will be way ahead of them. There will be small-screen videoconferencing for business and home use, shared screens so users at different locations can work on documents and diagrams together, and visual production groups allowing people in different locations to collaborate and produce high fidelity sound, fast text and graphics. I always believed that modem democratic societies were those in which we attempted to equalise opportunities, not ones where we said that people who live in the bush and provincial areas would not have access to these things. There is an urgent need for members on the government side to make sure that they keep their leaders up to the promises they made. I could go on. I have reports and statements here from members of that review committee who have said that the credibility of the minister on this question has been very seriously flawed. His integrity is on the line. The integrity of this government is on the line in this, the most important area of communications technology that Australia has entered into for a long time. They must go back and honour that undertaking for the benefit of people in rural and provincial Australia. (Time expired)  stand on the edge of a new age where the distinction between computers, telephones, faxes and televisions is becoming a blur. If the average person has trouble staying in touch with technology, what does that tell us about the ability of telecommunications legislation to keep pace with rapid advances? It is time to put the whistle away and let the players play. That requires an entirely new act to replace the outdated and outmoded framework currently in use. This Telecommunications Bill and its associated legislation currently before the House provides a platform for an Australian telecommunications industry that is competitive and on the cutting edge. At the same time, these bills signal a new age of greater choice and protection for consumers and new opportunities for technological innovation. Sadly, the first wave of new possibilities offered to Australians has consisted of more stick than carrot, in the form of the two most used words in my electorate office lexicon, 'overhead cables'. Not surprisingly, the community reaction to the uglification of our streets with the erection of towers and hanging of cables has been both loud and widespread. While people are being told about their increased choice of channels, programs and services, they have had no choice about the siting of these cables. The Telecommunications Act 1991, sponsored by the previous Labor government, has allowed Telstra and Optus to do as they please with scant regard for the wishes of residents and the environment. I am sorry that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) did not mention that the Labor Party was responsible for the introduction of the 1991 Telecommunications Act that led to this very sorry state of affairs which this current government is attempting to change. With extremely charitable immunities due to expire in mid-1997, Telstra and Optus have attempted to roll out their cable as quickly possible. This has caused a great deal of unrest in the Australian community. Certainly it has become the major concern among the residents of my electorate of Sturt, who decry the fact that 21 st century technology will arrive in their houses courtesy of a 19th century delivery service. However, my constituents will no doubt be happier with the new arrangements, whereby immunities for the telecommunications companies will have to comply with state and territory planning and environmental laws. Telstra has enjoyed immunity from these laws for 90 years and Optus for the first few years of its existence. That will no longer be the case for projects that commence after 1 July this year. I know it has been an extremely frustrating and lengthy exercise for those who have complained about the current arrangements and attempted to stop the rollout. In some quarters, not my own, their efforts have been written off as NIMBYism. For the most part, I have found their voices to be of genuine concern for other people and the local environment. Mr Abbott-Absolutely right.  mentary secretary would agree with me, as he has a very similar electorate to mine. New technologies have usually achieved quick penetration in the Australian marketplace. I suspect that most Australians have been waiting for pay TV for a long time. But the widespread anger at the overhead rollout has somewhat dulled the enthusiasm. Carriers will have to conform to new obligations, such as collocation of mobile phone towers and ducts, where possible, which is something my constituents have been demanding for a very long time. While Austel discovered that collocation was not universally feasible, it recommended that it was possible in 30 per cent of cases. For competing commercial reasons, Telstra and Optus have failed to explore those possibilities fully. Of course, that would not be the case if the Labor government had listened to the coalition, then in opposition. From the outset, as Labor badly mishandled the whole issue of pay TV. After equivocating for years on whether Australia should even have pay TV, they invoked a regime that was clumsy and cost ineffective. It has been extremely difficult to explain to people that the sins of our predecessors have tied our hands with regard to the control over cabling in towns. The coalition, however, is doing something about this mess. Already we have negotiated some new restrictions, and the telecommunications companies have agreed to a tougher interim regime. Now, at the first opportunity, the coalition is legislating for more permanent arrangements. Some will no doubt assert that we are closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. While it is true that the work done prior to the end of the transition period will remain for now, this government, I am happy to note, is intent on playing a major role in seeking new ways to put underground all visible cables. Burying cables is an expensive proposition that will require the cooperation of all levels of government, utility companies and the community. I know in my own state of South Australia that there have been several estimates over the cost of such an enterprise. While the amounts have varied widely, none of the quotes has been inexpensive. However, there is considerable resolve to get the job done. If in the not-too-distance future we can rid our cities, suburbs and towns of all overhead wires and, as a consequence, even the classic Aussie 'stubbie pole', as it is called South Australia, the harshest critic of the current arrangements will admit that it was all worth the effort. Perhaps then they will take down the signs 'No overhead cables' that seem to festoon my electorate across all the main streets. The framework that will curb the aerial festooning activities of Optus and Telstra will be of great benefit to consumers. However, these benefits will flow only if there is true competition among the various players. The anti-competitive conduct provisions in the package allow industry players flexibility but require adherence to the Trade Practices Act, supplemented by the involvement of the ACCC, which will issue competition guidelines by 1 July and act to stop noncompetitive conduct thereafter. Consumers will also benefit from the safeguards contained in this telecommunications package. A free market does not of itself necessarily provide the community with the level of surety it requires. Thus, the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman will be expanded. In addition, the all-important obligations to provide free access to emergency calls and operator and directory assistance services have been retained and will apply to all appropriate providers. The new customer service guarantee, which is not part of the current act, will promote higher service levels and guarantee quick avenues to compensation should carriers fail to achieve these levels. Services in this guarantee will include the connection, restoration and keeping of appointments. I suspect that the days of the phone company telling customers that they have to wait to get phone services are rapidly drawing to a close. If true competition with other companies does not snap suppliers into shape, these provisions certainly will. Telstra and its predecessors, for so long the monopoly in telecommunications, tasted its first domestic competition only recently. From I July, there will be new carriers, which will offer new services to consumers. There will be no restriction on the number of these able to enter the market. Opening up the market will ensure that Australia enjoys state-of-the in art infrastructure that uses the latest technology. A freer market with less regulation will also guarantee a greater choice of services and different rate packages. There will be fierce competition for niche markets and broader services alike. Costs to the consumer can only inevitably come down. As one who has spoken in this place before on the importance of privacy provisions, I am gratified to see that this legislation covers the protection of communications. With the expanded exchange of information and the seemingly insatiable thirst of governments and corporations for more data and more qualified sales leads, the protection of information issue is an increasingly important one. Twelve months ago, Telstra announced it would be spending millions of dollars over two years to protect their customers from misuse of phone information. That assurance followed a six-month study by a privacy audit panel which found that Telstra failed to meet best practice standards in the areas of accountability, use of information and gaining consent from customers. Despite that finding, the audit also admitted that Telstra exceeded international standards for the protection of data. The new telecommunications act will strengthen the privacy provisions. It will now be a requirement that companies keep adequate records of disclosure of information. The Privacy Commissioner will monitor the situation to ensure that these records meet the requirements. In addition, there will be greater clarity about the legality or illegality of disclosing information in particular circumstances. I welcome these initiatives and believe they will result in more respect for the privacy of the Australian people. While Australians embraced the concept of mobile phones early on, new subscribers are signing on at staggering rates. It is estimated that, by the year 2000, there may be eight million mobile phone users in Australia. Calling costs are, however, much higher on a mobile network than on a home telephone, but according to Paul Budde, a prominent telecommunications consultant who has worked for Telstra, there is no reason why they should be. Many in the community are reluctant to make a call to a mobile phone because of the cost involved. Unlike calls to other home phones, these are timed calls and can become expensive. I suspect there is no need for such a charge. To be sure, the correctness or otherwise of these assertions will be proven as the new era of competition replaces the previously regulated regime. There is no doubt that this package sets the table for an open, truly competitive, innovative and inventive communications environment. There is freedom for industry players and there is choice and protection for consumers. Finally, I am confident that this vital try will provide that which is desired by all Australians-more job opportunities. As our universities seek to tum out better qualified graduates, the increased activity in the communications area should provide these graduates with many long-term secure jobs. As we all know, the best hope for increased employment is productive and profitable business enterprises. I commend these bills to the House.",103
176,Mr QUICK,Unknown,"I am pleased to be able to speak on the telecommunications legislation before the House-an omnibus package if ever I saw one. This legislative package consists of 11 bills, and together they will provide for the establishment of a new competitive telecommunications regime beginning on 1 July this year. As previous speakers have noted, this new structure will replace the current telecommunications duopoly-and, in the case of mobile phones, the triopoly. The legislation before us is the result of an ongoing process which started back in 1990 when the Hawke Labor government decided that the future model of the telecommunications industry would involve competition in all aspects of the network. As I said, this is an omnibus package. Looking through the complexities of it, I thought to myself, 'What does it really mean for the average person in the street and for the constituents in my electorate of Franklin?' In the time. I have left, I would like to concentrate specifically on the issue of the bill's impact on ordinary Australians-by that, I mean the people I serve in the rural, urban and remote areas of southern Tasmania. I think it is important to concentrate on the issue of this bill's impact on ordinary Australians, irrespective of where these people may reside, and their expectation that this bill will provide them with access on an equitable basis to what is called standard telephone services-that is, payphones and other prescribed carriage services. My big concern is whether these changes that are mooted in this bill are going to mean that once again the subscribers who live in industhe major cities of Australia-Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth-will be able to benefit from all of these wonderful new technological advantages and advances and be able to realise the benefits of increased competition between carriers, while those in the rural and remote areas just read about what is happening to their fellow Australians. In my mind, these new changes will not be seen by them for years, if ever. This is my real big fear. Under the current regime, people in the rural and remote areas in my electorate only dream of having what is accessible to people on the mainland. With only a small population of 460,000-odd people, the big players certainly are not interested in looking after those areas. They are more interested in the mainland. This huge package, a very complex one of many parts, will have an impact on the telecommunications service delivery of the people I represent-as I said, those in the urban, rural and remote parts of southern Tasmania. In parts of my electorate, under the telecommunications regime, subscribers are penalised by living in the most southerly parts of Tasmania-such as the small townships of Dover, Cockle Creek and Catamaran. Much is spoken of the universal service obligation expected of carriers in the provision of services to the Australian community. People wax lyrical about what they call the USO. Currently, many of my constituents are financially disadvantaged by bureaucratic line drawing, which is always done from the mainland capitals of Sydney and Melbourne where Telstra and Optus reside. Because of the misunderstanding of what constitutes rural and remote areas in their minds, this line drawing defines areas which are included in the local call area and forces other people to pay SID rates because they are on the other side of this so-called line. The three centres that I mentioned-Dover, Cockle Creek and Catamaran-could have quite easily been included in the local area network as these are the last small townships. There would have been no great financial cost to Telstra and the Telstra profits. But were we able to convince the powers that be in Telstra? No way, Jose. Despite having Ted Taylor as state manager-a fantastic bloke who has encouraged Telstra to develop strong community links in Tasmania-we were not able to budge the Telstra hierarchy. So much for the universal service obligation. It is all words. It is interesting to note that, under this new legislation, the universal service regime has been the subject of only a relatively minor change. It is interesting to note that in clause 152 universal service providers must submit a universal service plan for approval by the minister. The bill states: In deciding whether to approve . . . a plan Minister must have regard to whether: (a) the plan provides for the universal service obligation . . . to be fulfilledIt has to be fulfilled in two parts, which are: (i) as efficiently and economically as practicableWonderful vagueness! And: (ii) at performance standards that reasonably meet the . . . needs of the community. Wonderful bureaucratic jargon-trying to tie people down to 'as efficiently and as economically as practicable' and 'performance standards that reasonably meet the ... needs of the community'. How vague and wishy washy, yet when it comes to drafting legislation, subclauses, sections and paragraphs jump out and bite you in the neck. I would urge the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in all sincerity to ensure that the many carriers who enter the market after 1 July this year do much more than just 'reasonably meet' community expectations, and that efficiency and economy do not drive service delivery, especially in the many rural and remoter areas not only in my electorate but in electorates throughout Australia that many members in this place who have already spoken on this issue represent. What has Minister Alston said about all this? What are his thoughts on the matter? It is interesting to note that the minister called for a group of people to be set up to advise him. He set up a magic group called the Standard Telephone Service Review Group. There were people on it from a wide spectrum: from the Federation Council of the Isolated Children's Parents Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the National Farmers Federation, the coordinator of the Consumer Telecommunications Network, Telstra, Vodafone and Optus to Professor Henry Ergas, the visiting professor from the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications at the University of Auckland. This illustrious group of people were given a page and a half of terms of reference and were asked to bring down a report. It is interesting to note the minister's response . . . the when the report was brought down. One would assume that we would have had one report. The minister had chosen these people and, knowing ministers and their choice of people to report back to them, one would have thought that there would not have been too much in the way of dissension. But, to my amazement, two reports were brought down: one by Professor Ergas, a sole dissenting report, and one by the rest of the group. It is interesting to note the response that was gained from these two reports. Senator Alston, in his media release of 6 February 1997 entitled 'Reports on standard telephone service released', stated: . . . while he was disappointed the Review Group was unable to reach a consensus, this was not surprising given the complexity of the issues. I established the review to assess whether the rapid changes in technologies and increased usage of advanced communications like fax, email and the Internet warranted upgrading the standard telephone service. A little later on he says: I am particularly concerned to ensure that any change to the current arrangements does not impose undue costs on users of the ordinary telephone service. Professor Ergas' report makes it clear very substantial sums of money could be involved and it is therefore essential that the government obtains an accurate assessment of likely cost implications for consumers before the matter can be taken further. Unfortunately, the reports do not provide a quantitative assessment of the additional costs which changes to the standard telephone service would generate, and how these might translate into higher phone prices. I will be seeking a more detailed assessment of costs and benefits of the Group's proposals before making a response to the recommendations of the reports. It is interesting to read what Professor Ergas had to say in his dissenting report. He sharply criticised the committee's methodology. He said: The report does not pay serious attention to the likely costs and benefits of the recommendations it advances and fails to note the significant impacts they might have on charges for the standard residential telephone service. While not denying there is a need to provide enhanced services to non-metropolitan subscribers, Professor Ergas argues against prescribing these through the universal service obligation. He says: It is difficult to see what information there is in the report which in any way justifies a presumption in favour of prescription. What was the minister's response to all this? To my amazement, the minister seems to have favoured the minority report compared with the report of the majority of the other members of the committee. It is interesting to see from some press articles how the members of the committee took umbrage at the minister's response. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 February 24 this year entitled 'Rural phone reform less likely' the Executive Director of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, who is a member of the committee, described Senator Alston's release as: . .. almost an insult to the committee . .. It is grossly inappropriate that the work be given the offhand treatment that it has, especially as the committee included the carriers. The article states: The chairman of the committee, Me Jock Given, the director of the Communications Law Centre, said he was disappointed that the release did not accurately reflect the committee's findings. In an article in the Australian of 11 February 1997 entitled 'Alston weighs up the cost of national ISDN standard' the Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications Consumers Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, said that the minister risked 'losing the confidence of the industry if he ignored a substantial body of work understood taken over a reasonable period of time'. Mr Horsley labelled Professor Ergas's report as 'destructive'. The Policy Manager of the Australian Consumers Association, Ms Mara Bun, said that the six-month process had been subverted by an independent consultant. Debate interrupted. NA",108
177,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Kenya: Drought Telephone Bills",110
178,Mr SERCOMBE,Unknown,"I wish to raise two matters very briefly. The first one is for the attention Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I have advice from AusAID that they are aware of an emerging drought situation in parts of Kenya since late last year. The government of Kenya has recently declared a national emergency and launched an appeal for international assistance for drought relief measures. This is a matter that I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to give very rapid and prompt attention to, not only on most important humanitarian grounds but also because of the important role that Kenya plays as a partner of Australia in the Indian Ocean Rim initiative. Kenya was one of the five original nations in that process. It is a country which, because of the importancethat is recognised-of our relationships in the Indian Ocean, we ought to be paying particular attention to. For those reasons, as well as the more fundamental humanitarian reasons, the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to be giving prompt attention to this issue. The second matter I wish to raise is a matter for the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). It arises from a constituent who came to my office-a Mrs Azab-who, much to her consternation, recently received a bill from Telstra of over $4,800 and another from Optus of some $900. The overwhelming number of calls registered with Telstra were to a 1902 number and with Optus they were to a 1900 number. Mrs Azab has a 15-year-old son who has attention deficit hyperactive disorder. A very quick perusal of the accounts she has received shows that on a whole range of days-for example, picking 29 November at random, when some 18 calls were made-alls were made for quite lengthy periods of time to a number that describes itself as a telephone counselling service, a 1902 number. These were matters that were raised with Austel. Austel gave a most disappointing response to Mrs Azab where they said that it was not a matter they would take up. She has raised the matter with an organisation called the Telephone Information Services Standards Council. She was told by a Telephone Information Services arbitrator on 28 January that she would get a response of the within two weeks. That has not been forthcoming. Frankly, I believe a situation exists here where vulnerable, isolated people are very much subjected to the possibility of quite considerable exploitation by these sorts of call services, which charge extraordinarily expensive rates for so-called counselling. I had a staff member in my office today make a call to the 1902 number. I will just give the House a very brief sample of the so called counselling that goes on: 190: How old are you? Staff: I'm 21. 190: Your' re just a baby. What do people as young as you get up to? Staff: Oh, we go on a night just to see a band, have a few drinks, then hit a club. 190: And then do what boys just do, hey! Staff: Yeah we get up to all sorts. That is the level of sophisticated counselling that people are paying money for on these numbers. The situation is that this family simply cannot afford a Telstra bill of the extraordinary order that they have received. It would seem to me that companies, which are seeking to exploit people of this isolated, vulnerable character or boys of this type-a boy where I have plenty of medical evidence of the genuineness of his complaint and his situation-by engaging in these services, ought to carry the risk. They ought to be the people who lose out in situations such as the one I have described. It is simply unfair for isolated, vulnerable people to be expected to pay those amazing amounts. It is equally disappointing that Austel has simply failed-when approachedto deal with the matter. The arbitrator in the industry has failed us to date. This is a matter that causes the family great consternation. They face the prospect of disconnection of an important telephone service. It is a matter which I believe the minister for communications ought to look at very quickly.",111
179,Mr BOB BALDWIN,Unknown,"I rise tonight to inform the House about the progress, or lack thereof, of roadworks and traffic lights at Chelmsford Drive and the New England Highway at Metford. This is a road which has in excess of 25,000 vehicles per day; a road that children cross go to school; a road that a large section of the community cross to shop at Green Hills; and a road that is a major highway which is impossible to cross-after all, it is a national highway. On 5 August 1994, three concerned residents of the Metford-Ashtonfield area in my electorate started a saga which is yet to be resolved-not through any fault of the current federal government but through the mindless political games of the current New South Wales state Labor government and the campaigning untruths of the former government. These three tireless campaigners from the Metford Residents Action Group-Veronica MCLennan, Kaleen Fletcher and Joan Whitestarted by contacting the RTA and the state member for Maitland, Peter Blackmore, along with Maitland council. To show how concerned the residents were, over 1,100 signatures were gathered on petitions and presented to the New South Wales state government. But Blackmore was told to butt out by the former federal member. After all, it was a federal highway. The progress evolved into the Maitland integrated transport study, which, beginning in late 1994, involved three detailed workshops that specifically asked for, and received, extensive community input. The final RTA report has not been released to date, despite the public input and despite the apparent desire to be seen to treat seriously the views of local residents impacted on by any decision. Maybe the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority is scared of the contents. And then that famous transport minister, Laurie Brereton, who in the dying days of the former government with the monopoly money in one pocket and a new road proposal in the other turned up in the seat of Paterson on 8 August 1995 and again two weeks laterRoads bearing gifts like Santa-promising $2 million for the lights and associated roadworks. At this point in time only 14 months had transpired, and the amazing thing was there was an election in the air. To cement the promise, the former Labor member letterboxed Metford and Ashtonfield with a glossy brochure to promising that $2 million-it was allocated, work starting immediately, don't pass go, collect the $200. Members on this side of the House would be used to hearing these untruths from members and former ministers of the other side. Then there was the obligatory public meeting by the RTA on 12 February 1996, which evolved into the three meetings of the Metford value management study-the first in March 1996 and continuing until July. By this time over two years had passed by with no solution. The money was not there when we came to government. There was no mention of it in the previous minister's notes or files-it was just lies, yet again and again. We got used to it, but the community almost believed them. But we, the Howard government, fixed that. We promised we would have the money$1.96 million-and, hey presto, change of administration in Canberra and suddenly the state Labor government is playing games. The works are being held up by-guess who-the RTA and the NSW state government. Now, when these residents call the RTA to find out what is happening they are told: 'Contact Bob Baldwin-he's sitting on the plans.' Well, Bob Baldwin is no draftsman and, further, he is tired of being used as the whipping boy for the political games of the RTA and the state Labor government. These people have been lied to by the RTA and by none other than Bob Sharpe, Regional Manager of the RTA, and some of his colleagues. They have been playing gamesgames with people's lives. I and my office have followed this through diligently all the way and we have been continually reassured by Bob Sharpe of the RTA during private meetings in my office between him, Peter Blackmore and me that it was all happening, that it was waiting for federal approval. This was all garbage. It took forever to get it to the desk of the federal minister, John Sharp. The state government was sitting on the plans while the people of Paterson waited. The then minister for roads, Michael Knight, and now Carl Scully are sitting on these plans. The money is in place; they know it. They just want to play games and delay the project, hoping that it will reflect badly on that outstanding Liberal state member Peter Blackmore and me. Interestingly, the Weakleys Drive and Thornton Road lights were promised during the election by Labor. But, again, the previous government did not provide the funding. We have put them in-no surprise given the time and urgency. But they must have been fasttracked: they just happen to be in the surrounding Labor seat of Hunter. And to show it was political, they imported a Labor state member, John Price, to open the lights-lights funded with federal money. It is just games, games and more games. Labor does not care, and has not ever cared, for the people in the Hunter. They just use them up as election fodder. I put the state roads minister on notice if there is an accident in the area-and indeed it has been pouring bucket loads up there today and yesterday-it will now be Carl Scully who has the blood on his hands. I call on the state minister to fast-track the project and get the work under way so the people in Medford can get on with their lives. Governor General",112
180,Mr CAMPBELL,Unknown,"There are few things more repUlsive than a pious cleric and, despite the decline of organised religion, we have them in abundance in Australia. You know the type: unctuous elites, out of touch with everyday cares, who luxuriate in their own high morality. They are great favourites of the fashionable media types-and don't they know it. In their glib, superficial sanctity they perfectly complement those pious secular clerics of the politically correct establishment. From their lofty heights, and stroking their swollen egos, they pontificate upon the heads of the unworthy with one eye on the cameras. The uproar over Pauline Hanson has given such clerics a golden opportunity to parade their sanctity while lambasting the unworthy general population. There has been no attempt to understand, only to wallow in their own vanity and to pander to elite opinion. While they may congratulate each other and be congratulated in the press, they have increased the distance between themselves and the wider Australian population-not that they have any time for such unfashionable commoners. We had one recently who vainly preened herself before the assembled media at an Anglican church summit, attended by both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). For the benefit of the politicians and referring to the gospel, she said: ... beware of practising your piety before others in order to be seen by them. She then went on to illustrate the very thing she had warned against. She again used Pauline Hanson as a stick to beat us with and that glibly and unctuously cast Australia down among the pariahs of the earth. A man perfectly at home amongst such people, though not a religious cleric, is our Governor General, Sir William Deane. He was appointed by that most un-Australian of people, Paul Keating, who was no doubt confident that Sir William would support his internationalist republicanism. Sir William is Clergy a Holy Joe preacher of the first water. Secular cleric, hero of the elites, Holy Billy is frequently seen in all the most fashionable media outlets with an expression of studied anguish on his holy face. Once, enveloped in smoke, he sat amidst what was supposed to be an enactment of some sort of Aboriginal ceremony, largely organised and conceived by Holy Joe white fell as and set on church ground. Holy Billy made a fool of himself, pretending to be an Aboriginal. It was a perfect illustration of what he is-all smoke and mirrors. If he wants to feel like an Aboriginal he should come to my electorate and spend some time sleeping rough. He may realise how useless and counterproductive all this holy posturing and preaching is, and how little it does to help real Aboriginal people at the grassroots. If he wants to speak about multiculturalism he should make an effort to study its failings and not insult our intelligence by pretending everything is all right with it. It may make him feel good but his outpourings have increased tensions, not helped understanding and reconciliation. Here is a man who, despite or because of his supposedly superior learning, only sees what he wants to see-a good samaritan who lives in lUxury and sends the wider Australian population bills for his charitable works. How much will you pay, Holy Billy? Agonising over his own virtue",113

183,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Fortunately the honourable member's speech is concluded. Botterill, Mr Keith",114
184,Mr COBB,Unknown,"I rise to speak tonight about the life of an ex-POW, Mr Keith Botterill, who was born in Nyngan on 1 August 1924 and who passed away in Sydney, at the age of 72, on 25 January this year. What was remarkable about this person was that he was one of only six survivors of World War II's infamous Sandakan death marches. Only six out of 1,800 Australians survived those marches; none of the 750 British solders did. Five of those six survivors are now dead. Only Owen Campbell, an 80year-old, survives. He lives near Brisbane. Keith Botterill escaped from the Ranau prisoner of war compound in North Borneo, now the Malaysian state of Sabah, aft e r surviving the 250-kilometre death march from Sandakan. In August 1945, at the end of the war, he was found by Sergeant J.A. 'Lofty' Hodges of the Australian Special Reconnaissance Division party. I might just quote the words of Keith Botterill: The next day I was lying down, thinking that I could not walk another step, when I looked up and saw an Australian face bending over me. He was a big, six footer. He just sat down beside me and cried, and I cried too. It was thought that Keith Botterill was unlikely to survive. He weighed only 38 kilograms-six stone-and over one stone of that was attributed to swelling from beri-beri. He had been hobbling along with the support of a stick, using the other hand to hold up his testicles, which were swollen from beri-beri. This disease is due to a vitamin B 1 or thiamine deficiency from starvation or eating refined rice. It causes muscle weakness, heart failure and oedema in various parts of the Mr Botterill was raised largely by his grandmother, who had 13 of her own children to raise. He started work at the age of 14 as a screen printer. He put up his age to enlist, at 16Y2 years, in the army. He served with the 2/19th Battalion in Singapore where, as a 17year-old, he was wounded in his stomach by a Japanese bullet. He became a prisoner of war in February 1942 in Changi and was shipped to Sandakan to help build an airfield and service roads. At the end of 1944 allied forces were getting within striking distance and the Japanese authorities decided to move the soldiers out in this infamous march, which became the most ruthless, horrific, demeaning act of incomprehensible cruelty of the war. If you fell, you were bayoneted or shot. Had the supreme commander, Douglas MACArthur, released a few DC3s for a few days in March 1944, as he was requested, a rescue operation could have gone ahead with a high chance of success. Perhaps a thousand or so soldiers could have been rescued. In mid-1944 to August 1944 that march took place. Men dropped from malnutrition, disease, exhaustion, bayoneting, and shooting. Only six survived, and only then because they escaped. The treatment of Keith Botterill as a prisonthings er of war was bad. They used to place him a cage above the ground. He was bashed every day. He was in this cage once for 12 days, and on another occasion for 40 days with 17 other prisoners. On one occasion, they received no water for the first three then they were made to drink until they were sick. They received no food for seven days and then were put on half rations, despite their emaciation and infection with lice and scabies. After the war he put this behind him. knuckled down to hard physical work. worked on the Snowy Mountains scheme and the construction of Warragamba Dam. He met his wife, Ruth, at Katoomba. She used to deliver milk for the tea for the workers there. He is survived by three daughters-Susan, Judy and Wendy-a son, Keith, and 13 grandchildren. He gave evidence after the war against Japanese guards accused of war crimes, but he spared the life of one man who had shown kindness. That guard's son came to Australia 10 years ago to thank him. I salute a geous and remarkable Australian. He epitosomething mised everything that is noble and admirable in the digger legend. His story of extraordiMinister nary feats of survival should be recognised this parliament, and I am pleased to acknowdecision ledge them here this evening. Legal Aid Funding",114
185,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"Tonight any further. I want to take the opportunity to address an issue that I think is of enormous social imbelieve portance to our community today; that is, the question of legal aid funding. I preface my comments with a couple of notes. First of we have seen in the last federal budget addiappearing tional court charges being made-at a very heavy level, I might add-particularly relation to matters affecting family law. mention that i'1 passing at the beginning of this adjournment speech, because that sets the consider. scene for another step that occurred. Additional to that were cuts in funding a range of community services which assist family breakdown and family matters generally within our community. Couple those two with a third issue, which I think is the in most alarming; that is, the playing that is going on in funding for legal aid. The reality is that most legal aid matters where family law is concerned are the ones that affect families. This government purports days, very strongly-throughout the election campaign and since-that they have a patent on caring for families, that families are the backbone of our nation, that they care for families, and that they believe in the sanctity of the family. Yet it seems to me that everyHe thing they are doing in this area of social He policy is attacking that very group. There is absolutely no doubt that in the ACT there is a great deal of effort going on at the local government level-I commend all players in that area-to desperately try to save the situation in relation to funding for legal aid. The situation in the ACT is unique because it appears that the Commonwealth has admitted that the Commonwealth matters accounted for a particular amount of money last financial year, which in fact was $3.006 million, and the subsidy that we received back courain the ACT from the Commonwealth was like $646,000 short. Despite that admitted error, it seems that both the Prime (Mr Howard) and the Attorneyin General (Mr Williams) have made a concerted that they will ignore that and that they will get on and debate and negotiate in terms of funding for future years. That is really starting on the back foot before you get The options that are facing the ACT, as I are the options facing all states and territories, are simple. Either you continue to run at a loss, running a legal aid service as all, best you can on the limited funds that are to be made available or, alternatively, you set up your own state or territory in service and allow the Commonwealth to I consider setting up theirs separately. That seems the most retrograde step you could ever For a start, what could be more un-cost to effective than running two separate services? in Additionally, how can you ensure that the clients of those two services will get proper, fair and adequate service when in a majority of family law cases-I would say in mostthere is a very definite crossing over between both state or territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions. In other words, to try to administer that system of legal aid on a split basis means that, in many cases, clients are going to have to either figuratively or in realistic terms go from one office to another and back again. Whether that occurs on paper or physically, it is going to happen. It seems to me that, if this government are fair dinkum, if they are saying to us that they have deficits that they have to attend to, that they regrettably have to make these sorts of cuts, then why on earth are they going to help to create a system that is most cost ineffective and most inconvenient to the people they say they care for more than anybody else? It seems a most ludicrous situation. On behalf of the constituency that I represent, I say that this situation is absolutely totally unacceptable. The families in my constituency who happen to fall into the unfortunate category of requiring legal aid deserve nothing more nor less than a proper and fair approach to justice. That must be adequately funded and appropriately administered. At the moment, I do not see any signs that we are getting any sensible debate out of the government. For the Prime Minister to say the other day, I think in the media and in this place, that there is no further consideration being given to the issue saddens me unbelievably because this is a very important social and family issue in our community and one that I believe must receive better attention than it is at the moment. I urge all members, particularly those on the other side-and more particularly the women members on the other side-to lobby hard and long to have this decision reversed. It is inappropriate, it is unjust and it is inequitable to everybody who participates in the legal aid process. Small Business: Interest Rate Reductions",115
186,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,"I will take a few moments of the House's time tonight to speak about an article which appeared in today's Brisbane Courier Mail and which sadly reported a small business operator in my electorate who is in such financial difficulty she is considering closing her shop within the Garden City Shopping Centre after 16 years of trading. The problems that face Louise Esdale, whom I have known for some years, centre on the failure of the banks in this country to actually pass on interest rate reductions to small business traders. I empathise greatly with the position Louise is in. I know she has been a very effective small business operator. She has also been very active in chamber of commerce activities and a strong advocate for others in small business in my area. Her store, Something Special, has been a very successful operation. Her landlord at Garden City is AMP. They have demanded she make a number of very expensive renovations as part of the terms and conditions of her lease agreement over the 16 and years she has been there. She has, amongst other things, had to mortgage her home to meet the cost of these expensive renovations to her shop front. The centre has just undergone a massive restructuring and reworking and major operators who trade in the centre are able to meet the costs of renovations far easier than small-mother and father or husband and wife type teams-business operations. I am very concerned for people in my electorate like Louise. I think tremendous pressures have been placed on them as a result of the previous government's legacy. That is bad enough. The fact is the banks, which I think have continued to snub the real opportunities given to them through deregulation for so many years and which have basically continued to do whatever they dam well like, need to get a very large slap across the wrist. Today I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suggesting that if banks do not want to do the right thing and cooperate, then perhaps we should seriously consider some sort of re-regulation of the banking sector. There are some results that this country wants and needs that the banks are not fulfilling. I think the time has come to get very tough with banking operators in this country. I am very concerned because effective operators like Louise are feeling a strong lag effect in the reality of the day to day operations of their business. They understand this government is well intentioned. They know the Prime Minister is very strong in his commitment to the small business sector, but the effect they are feeling on a day to day basis just does not seem to back up the optimism they had. As their local member, I think it is my role to raise this point tonight and to call on the Prime Minister to re-double his efforts and to again confirm his strong commitment to the small business sector, offer them some concrete proof of the support I know this government has already given them and show a small business led recovery can only occur if small business survives and grows. I want to assure people like Louise Esdale that we are not going down the Labor Party road. We are very aware of the mess Labor left them and the tough times they face. We are aware of the mess the Brisbane City Council has created by the proliferation of shopping centres. Landlords like AMP really do not care all that much about small business traders-one dies and another one is always there ready to mortgage their home to take their place. I think all members in this place would share my concern because small business can and will generate real jobs and bring about the recovery we all want and need in this country. Garrawarra Nursing Home",116
187,Mrs VALE,Unknown,"I rise in the House tonight to raise an issue of great urgency in my electorate of Hughes which is causing considerable anxiety and distress amongst my constituents. The issue is that of the Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care which is located in an area of bushland between the townships of Helensburgh and Waterfall and which caters for the frail aged people with challenging behaviours and dementia. This situation has a long history going to state and Commonwealth discussions and decisions of the previous government in 1992. At that stage, Garrawarra had 280 beds and we had always assumed that this would be the basis for further decision making. Subsequently, this base has been eroded to 250. In addition, the initial discussions related to a reduction of one-third of the beds, but this now has achieved the proportions of almost halving or more of the resident population. For Garrawarra, at the moment, this means a proposed downsizing to 120 beds. This is associated with a destruction of an infrastructure of teaching, education and excellence in care. The proposal will eliminate what has long been a tradition at Garrawarra-that is, the offering of a continuum of care after the resident has come to reside there. It will also mean destruction of community day care programs which facilitate community residence. For Sutherland shire, this will represent a very significant loss of nursing home beds and a drop in the ratio per thousand persons over 70 to well below the accepted Commonwealth guidelines when adjusted to the current resident population. This will precipitate a crisis situation within the next five years. It would appear that 100 beds are going to go to the Illawarra region. This would seem to be not negotiable, but perhaps 20 of those beds could remain in the Garrawarra Centre as they will service Illawarra in regard to people with challenging behaviour and dementia as their infrastructure at this moment is not geared to cope with these patients. There is no doubt that a rebuilding of the site is desperately needed after decades of neglect. This has been presented as an all in one phenomena. Certainly, the New South Wales state government seems to be indicating that they have capital to rebuild 120 beds. This is going to take at least two years. There is surely an intermediate position which could allow for the retention of some of the current building stock or perhaps there are funds within the Commonwealth sphere which could allow the extra rebuilding and creation of a centre of excellence. I would contend that 180 beds is probably optimal both from the viewpoint of allowing beds to go to the south back and to the maintenance of the Sutherland shire infrastructure. It is a vital question to know whether this figure could be negotiated. Associated with this decision is the commitment from the Commonwealth to fund these added beds under the Camsam arrangements and to address the question of these patients at Garrawarra who have severe challenging behaviours and who cannot be appropriately cared for under the current Camsam funding arrangements. The private sector is not happy or able to take these patients and offer high standards of care to these very debilitated people who have the consequences of brain failure. What is urgently needed is for bed numbers to be increased to an optimal figure of 180 from the current 120 proposal as per the original plan, that those people with challenging behaviour-around 80-be financed under a category 1 arrangement as is the case in the Adards dementia unit in Hobart, and financial arrangements be made to maintain Garrawarra as a centre which can offer excellence in aged care. In regard to this latter proposition, there are currently three medical officers who have great experience in the management and care of people with dementia and other problems of ageing. The isolated location of Garrawarra will make it very difficult to attract general practitioners and, given the expertise of these medical officers, it could be proposed that a cost neutral solution be made in terms of their funding.",117

It does not mean things reasons I, and my farming friend, detailed in that blandly credit the dropping of this scheme to as I pointed out, there were 284 recipients; has been no other research done on where those not ploughing along happily on the farm after I bet they are gone from farming. to the banks to finance the family farm, a farm household support scheme like this, support.

Firstly, there is always in Australia. However, historically, the ownership 90 per cent and 93 per cent family based. Since of the ups and down-the Great Depression, the as current times, and the 1930s, which were by only two or three percentage points. Family 90 per cent, and that is essentially because it look to alternative sources of financing for the financed and it may be that more innovative complain, and understandably, about the interest a government we are intent upon saying to the that we are showing long-term support for and a set of policies and strategies derived farm and we expect the banks to do the same. interest rates. It is worth noting here that inquiry, which we have set up, suggests very stage at this juncture and I certainly do not want together-that there is no evidence of market to those farmers who do leave the land, member for Calare. I, too, have an interest NA 1000 and a concern about that matter. We will councillors who has dealt with this problem undertaken a bit of study of his own. Interestingly farmers who left the land found that the time difficult of all. I suspect that any person in private enterprise would be able to relate to collapse. It is a situation that can never be fun. However, when farmers did leave, they were universally, they expressed surprise that they more highly skilled than they often recognise. the need for us to do everything we can to ensure their future. But having said that, I will Amendment Bill 1996. The effect of the bill to receive farm household support payments on receives royal assent, from obtaining farm For those people who are entitled to receive date, transitional provisions will permit them as they are no longer eligible. Permitting payments will require that the access be unbroken receive farm household support payments, that payments at a later date. The bill retains the operation of other provisions those people who will continue to receive farm date and FHS payments will still be made as certain circumstances. I should emphasise that the operation of under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, household support scheme in all but one recipients, who have transferred to the DRP, household support scheme after the cut-off finishes. I think the previous speaker had something extended it from six months to 12 months, assistance that we offer to the farm sector. In something like $170 million over that provided estimates for drought relief, thus reflecting million, I must say, pales into some insignificance that sound economic management has and will properly passed on by the banks, and my evidence passed on to the farm sector, that is around by the three reductions in interest rates that under 12 months ago. In conclusion may I say that we announced scheme in the 1996-97 budget. We are considering of meeting the needs of destitute farm families MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 13 February 1997 do a bit of research on it.

There may be some confusion in the minds they find that there is more about the Farm legislation, as well-we did not clean it all provisions that continue to operate while the meant, primarily, to prevent double dipping up benefits under drought relief schemes and in social security and veterans' affairs legislation This just shows the eternal dilemma we remember when we introduced the farm household Minister's country task force spent a long at the time, was Simon Crean, I think-and Brian Howe.

Yesterday afternoon in the fashion parade, by the textile industry, we saw one extremely you can call it that, and the development-with a new denim yam which is a cotton-wool mix. properties and attractiveness may take the international be the case, then that would be a fabulous industries in Australia.

They are suggesting that in fact value the very time when the people in government that this is not the way they are interested in going. I call for a rethink on that, and I suggest that industry, although we know that they are not their concerns about tariff reductions, for instance, in January I saw that the Wool Council was calling so that they will get better opportunities Our overseas customer is saying to us, 'If then we will take more of your raw materials.' have the Wool Council coming out and calling textile industry suddenly says, 'Hey, don't Don't you care about what we are trying to answer, on that evidence, is no.

Main Committee adjourned at 12.57 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Institute of Criminology: (Question No. 826) Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (1) Is it a fact that cuts in funding to the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) announced in the Budget will reduce the number of projects that the AIC can fulfil; if so, will the Violence Against Women Project be affected. (2) Is violence against women in Australian society today an issue which should be addressed; if so, will he provide additional funding for this project in order to allow the project to be completed. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Funding for research on the criminal justice response to violence against women which was part of the previous Government's Justice Statement was discontinued in the 1996/97 budget. I am advised by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) that it has terminated the Violence Against Women Indicators Project (V AWIP) and will publish the material collected to date. Project work in the AIC is under regular review. At present no reduction in the number of current projects, other than VAWIP, is planned. (2) Violence against women in Australian society today is an important issue that will be addressed by my portfolio under the 'National Campaign Against Violence and Crime'. There is clearly a need to collect and publish good quality data on domestic violence and develop best practice recommendations. The priorities to be pursued will be determined following consideration of recommendations from the National Domestic Violence Forum, which was held recently, and demonstration projects suggested by the Lead Ministers' national Anti-Crime Strategy Group. Permanent Residency Visas (Question No. 921) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: NA (1) How many permanent residency visas have Funding Cuts been issued to Hong Kong residents since 1991. (2) How many recipients have not exercised their visa entitlement. (3) How many mUltiple entry visas have been issued to Hong Kong residents. (4) Do permanent residency visas include family members; if so, how many persons are involved. (5) Has China been paid to facilitate the repatriation of 'boat people'. (6) Have sums been paid in respect of deported Chinese citizens; if so (a) why and (b) what sum was paid (i) in total and (ii) per head. (7) Will the Government formulate a 5 year plan for immigration numbers to replace the current annual program; if so, when. (8) How many Asian born and Asian Australian born persons are there in Australia. (9) What definition of Asian is used in answer to part (8). (10) Did he state on 28 October 1996 that a population level of 23 million would be accepted by most Australians; if so, when will this level be reached. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 35,150-for the period 1 July 1991-31 October 1996 (Note: This figure excludes refugee and humanitarian applicants.) (2) 1043-for the same period. (3) 14,992-for the period 1 January 1991-22 November 1996. (Note: This question has been interpreted to mean Resident Return visas (RRVs). The figure refers to RRVs granted to Hong Kong passport holders.) (4) The answer to question (1) includes family members who have been granted permanent residency visas. The number of principal applicants for those visa applications was 18,373. The number of family members was 16,777. (5) Australia and the PRC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 25 January 1995 concerning the return of Sino-Vietnamese refugees under the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act. Sino-Vietnamese refugees who have previously been permanently settled in China are returned to China after their identity has been verified. Under the terms of the MOU, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is responsible for the return of verified Sino-Vietnamese refugees to China by air and meeting all associated costs. (6) No sums are paid to China in respect of the repatriation of boat people who are Chinese citizens. (7) No. (8) The estimated number of Asian-born persons in Australia at 30 June 1995 was 866,000 or 4.8 per cent of the total population. Information on the South East Asia NorthEast Asia Brunei China (excl. Taiwan) Cambodia Hong Kong Indonesia Japan Laos Korea, Republic of Malaysia Taiwan Burma (Myanmar) Philippines Singapore Thailand Vietnam (10) In an interview on Channel 7's Face to Face program on Sunday 27 October 1996, I commented that a population of 23 million 'as a plateau would not be seen as unreasonable by many Australians' in response to the suggestion put to me that 23 million might be an appropriate population level. As I said at the time, the Government does not have a population target for Australia. Rather, and this point was also made during the interview, this comment was made in the context of promoting public discussion of the issue of population levels. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) recently published projections of Australia's population for the period 1995-2051. These projections range between a population of 20.1 million to 26 million by 2051. Draft Council of Europe/UNESCO Convention (Question No. 928) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 November 1996: Who will represent Australia in The Hague at the consultation of the potential signatory States to the draft Council of Europe/Unesco Convention on the second-generation is obtained from the Census question on birthplace of parents. According to the 1991 Census (the most recent Census for which information is available), approximately 202,000, or 1.2 per cent of Australia's population was second-generation Australian of Asian background (defined as persons born in Australia with at least one parent born in Asia). (9) Countries are classified according to the ABS Classification of Countries for Social Statistics (ASCCSS) which defines 'Asia' as including the regions of Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia and Southern Asia (see table below): Southern Asia Afghanistan Bangladesh India Pakistan Sri Lanka Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region on 27-29 November 1996. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia was represented at the meeting by Ms Jennifer Ledgar. Assistant Secretary, National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition, Higher Education Division, Department of Employment. Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Child Support Agency: Decision Appeals (Question No. 934)  Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 6 November 1996: (1) How many appeals against decisions of the Child Support Agency (CSA) have been lodged with the Family Law Court of Australia since the introduction of review officers in the CSA. (2) How many appeals have been heard. (3) How many and what percentages of appeals were (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful. (4) What fee is charged by the Court for an appeal to be lodged. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Proceedings in relation to decisions of the Child Support Agency (CSA) come to the Family Court of Australia by way of an application or appeal filed on a Form 63 or an appeal from a decision of the child support registrar filed on a Form 64. Forms 64 are used for appeals against incorrect assessments under section 110 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, appeals against the Child Support Registrar's decision to refuse to accept a child agreement made under section 132 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act or appeals against a decision made by the Child Support Registrar in relation to an objection made pursuant to sections 82-85 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act. Forms 63 are used for all other Child Support applications to the Family Court. The same position applies in relation to child support matters in the Family Court of Western Australia. Statistics on the numbers of Forms 63 and 64 filed with the Family Court of Australia, since the introduction of review officers in the CSA during 1992, are as follows: Year Forms 63 Filed Forms 64 Filed 1992-93 579 1993-94 715 1994-95 780 1995-96 850 Comparable statistics on the numbers of Forms 63 and 64 filed with the Family Court of Western Australia for the same periods are as follows: Year Forms 63 Filed Forms 64 Filed 1992-93 74 1993-94 110 1994-95 181 1995-96 not available not available However, the majority of Forms 63 filed are applications for departures from administrative assessments made under section 116 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act or for substitution orders made under section 125 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. While data on the number of appeals filed on Forms 63 are not available, the anecdotal view is that there have been very fewperhaps less than 20 across Australia. In addition, there have been a number of appeals and applications for leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in relation to child support issues. There were two Full Court appeals relating to child support issues lodged in 1995-96. The number of Full Court appeals raising child support issues prior to 1995-96 is not available as they were included with 'other issues' in the Court's statistical records and it would be too resource intensive to justify manually examining each of the files to seek to ascertain the information. Issues raised in applications for leave to appeal to the Full Court were not identifies separately in the statistics prior to July 1996. (2) Information on the number of appeals filed on Forms 63 and 64 which were heard is not available. Two Full Court appeals relating to child support issues were heard in 1995-96. (3) Information on the percentage of appeals filed on Forms 63 or 64 that were (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful is not available. Statistics kept by the Child Support Agency show that there is an active caseload of approximately 400,000, of which 800 have been varied by a court order. Whether these variations are as a result of orders made by the Family Court of Australia, by the Family Court of Western Australia or by Magistrates Courts, and whether they were made pre or post the introduction of review officers in the CSA, cannot be determined without a manual examination of each file which would be too resource intensive to justify undertaking. Both of the Full Court appeals relating to child 27 support issues heard in 1995-96 were successful in that they were allowed. 70 (4) In respect of the relevant years no fee was 37 charged by the Family Court of Australia, the 72 Family Court of Western Australia or Magistrates Courts for the filing of a Form 63 or Form 64 or an application for leave to appeal to the Full Court, Between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1995 a court fee of $500 was payable in respect of any appeal to the Full Court of the Family Court lodged under section 94 of the Family Law Act. From I nil January 1996 that fee rose to $616. 10 Global Plant Genetic Resources (Question No. 957) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) What action will Australia be taking as a result of the June 1996 Leipzig conference relating to global genetic diversity in plants. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's estimate that half of the world's gene stores is in such a debilitated state of refrigeration that they are unable to fulfil the basic conservation role; if so, will the Government be responding to this estimate; if so, how. (3) Will these issues be considered in the context of Australia's ongoing aid program. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The June 1996 Leipzig International Conference on Plant Genetic Resources, which Australia attended, recognised the importance of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, in particular for the food security of present and future generations. The Conference recognised the serious threats to the security of plant genetic resources and acknowledged that efforts to conserve, develop, and sustainably use genetic diversity should be improved. A significant outcome of the Conference was the adoption of The Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of the World's Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has broad responsibility for Australia's policy response to issues relating to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Following the Leipzig Conference, the Australian aid program will continue to support activities and organisations which aim to conserve, develop, and sustainably use genetic diversity. Through AusAID and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), Australia provides significant financial resources to the conservation of plant genetic diversity and the development of plant genetic resources through breeding for increased crop productivity and resistance to insects and diseases. Australia also makes smaller contributions through the Grains Research and Development Corporation. AusAID and ACIAR are increasing their investments in global genetic diversity. Together the investment in 1996-97 is estimated to be $10 million, which represents an increase of over 50% compared to the previous year. In 1996-97, major contributions will include: AusAID support to International Rice Research Institute for rice conservation/improvement in Cambodia-$2.8 million (as part of a multi-year $10.5 million project beginning financial year 1996-97) AusAID funding for the International Fund for Agricultural Development-$1.6 million AusAID funding for a South Pacific Regional Forest Genetic Resources project-$.8 million (as part of a three-year, $2.6 million project, which commenced in financial year 1995-96) ACIAR support to International Agricultural Research Centres (lARCs) for programs on crop genetic resources conservation and development-$1.4 million (This is 16% of the total allocation to IARCs and represents an increase over the $1.1 million provided in financial year 1995/96). These IARCs comprise: International Rice Research InstitutePhilippines International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center-Mexico International Center for Tropical AgricultureColombia International Potato Center-Peru International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas-Syria International Crops Research Institute for Semi-arid Tropics-India International Plant Genetic Resources Institute-Italy International Centre for Research in Agroforestry-Kenya ACIAR's bilateral program is anticipated to provide approximately the same level of funding to plant genetic resources as in financial year 1995-96 ie $3.6 million or approximately 18% of ACIAR's bilateral research funds. In addition, Australia contributes to the Global Environment Facility (approximately $43 million in the 1994-97 period), which supports, among other things, plant genetic resource activities under its biodiversity portfolio. The GEF is a multilateral financial mechanism that provides grant and concessional funds to developing countries for activities to protect the global environment (2) This issue has not previously been raised with me, as the portfolio responsibility for such matters rests with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Nevertheless, my Department, including AusAID and ACIAR, is aware of the critical nature of the ex situ germplasm collections held in the 'world's gene stores' and the necessity that these collections be adequately conserved and curated. They are the building blocks from which improved crop varieties are developed. In providing funds to the core programs of the IARCs, the Australian aid program adopts a strategic approach which gives priority to those centres which have prime responsibility for conserving the collections of major crop species important to developing countries of our region and Australia-namely, rice, wheat, maize, grain legumes, potato, banana. In financial year 1996-97, the custodial centres for these key staples will receive $4.6 million in support of their germplasm and agronomy programs from Australia. However, the IARCs hold only 10% of the world's gene stores, while the remainder are held by national institutions in both industrial and developing countries. The Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of the World's Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture stresses the need for adequate resources to be made available to conserve and curate these national collections, as well as the international collections of the IARCs. At this point, national governments and institutions, with the assistance of the international community, have yet to marshall the resources necessary, through national, bilateral and multilateral sources to carry out this essential task. (3) Australia's support through AusAID and ACIAR, as reported in response to Question 1 above, confirms that the aid program continues to take positive steps to address this important issue. Obviously, there is always more that can be done, but without diversion of resources away from other priority programs, or a significant increase in the total resource base, it is not possible to do more than at present. Chemical Weapons Convention (Question No. 960) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Will the ratification by Hungary, the 65th state to become a party, bring into force the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (Paris, 13 January 1993). (2) Which states have signed but not ratified the Convention. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 31 October 1996, Hungary became the 65th state to ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction-also known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This fulfilled the conditions required to trigger a 180 day countdown to entry into force of the Convention. (Article XXI of the treaty stipulates that entry into force shall occur 180 days after the date of deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification.) Entry into force will thus occur on 29 April 1997, thereby advancing significantly a long-standing objective of Australia's foreign and security policy-the achievement of an effectively operational CWC treaty regime. (2) As of 6 December 1996, 160 countries had signed and 66 countries had ratified the CWC. The following states have signed but not yet ratifiedAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Cuba, Cyprus, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Holy See, Honduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, San Marino, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovenia, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, USA, Venezuela, Vietnam, Western Samoa, Yemen, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Enterprise Bargaining (Question No. 961) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Did his Department in its annual report on Enterprise Bargaining in Australia undertake a full statistical survey of workplaces with less than 20 employees; if not, why not. (2) If his Department does not undertake the survey referred to in part (1), will he take action to overcome this and include survey work on the coverage and nature of individual employment contracts among small businesses. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS 95) was a major data source for the 1995 Annual Report on Enterprise Bargaining in Australia. One component of AWIRS 95 was a telephone survey of 1075 workplaces with between 5 and 19 employees (the small workplace survey). This survey was representative of all workplaces in the Australian population of this size (excluding workplaces in defence, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting). Because it was conducted over the phone, the number of questions that could be asked in the small workplace survey was limited. There were no questions directly asking about individual employment contracts. Workplaces with below 5 employees were not included because the structured nature of the questionnaire means it is not applicable to very small workplaces. The AWIRS 95 small workplace survey was used in the 1995 Annual Report on Enterprise Bargaining in Australia to provide the data for the section titled '2.5: The incidence of agreements in small business workplaces' at pages 55-56 and 'Attachment 2.A: The incidence of agreements in small business workplaces' at pages 67-73. A full analysis of all the AWIRS 95 data will be publicly released in the form of a book in mid-1997. AWIRS 95 is the second survey of its kind run by the Department of Industrial Relations. The first was conducted in 1990 (AWIRS 90). AWIRS 90 also included a survey of small workplaces with between 5 and 19 employees, based on a sample of 350 workplaces. The sample size was increased to 1075 for AWIRS 95 specifically to allow more precise statistics for the small business component of the small workplace population. At this stage, there are no plans for a third AWIRS. Australian Meat and Livestock (Question No. 963)  Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: Does the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) ensure that vessels used in the export of Australian livestock (a) are seaworthy in accordance with international maritime safety conventions, (b) meet the International Labour Organisation Convention 147, related conventions and protocols concerning seafarers' conditions of employment, health care and accommodation on board and (c) have crews with competency levels to operate safely and in accordance with required international standards; if so, how; if not, will the AMLC do so urgently. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation does not have responsibility for the matters raised in the honourable member's question. Since the commencement of the trade all livestock ships carrying livestock from Australian ports to overseas destinations have been or are registered overseas. Responsibility for compliance of these ships with respect to seaworthiness, the International Labour Organisation (lLO) Convention 147 and crew competence are the responsibility of the flag state. All overseas registered livestock carriers are included in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) Port State Control Program (pSC). Any matters which are found deficient during PSC inspections are either remedied or placed in the hands of those responsible for doing so i.e., either the relevant classification society or the flag The purpose of PSC system is to ensure as far as reasonably possible that the vessel (a) is seaworthy in accordance with International Maritime Safety Conventions; (b) meets the ILO Convention 147 and related convention and protocol requirements concerning seafarers health and accommodation on board; (c) has a crew competent to operate the vessel safely, and (d) has the necessary personnel who are qualified in accordance with international standards. Australian Wheat Board (Question No. 964)  Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: Does the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) ensure Corporation that foreign registered vessels used in the transport of Australian wheat (a) domestically and (b) internationally are seaworthy, operated competently and provide crew with conditions of accommodation, health care and employment set out in international maritime conventions; if so, how; if not, (i) when will the AWB do so in its capacity as a significant charterer of shipping and (ii) for what period will the AWB use Ships of shame to transport wheat. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 the Australian Wheat Board (A WB) has power to transport, and arrange for the transport of, grain. In respect of international shipments, the AWB' s standard sales contracts contain provisions to ensure that vessels chartered to load bulk wheat are in all ways suitable. The contracts require vessels to be chartered on terms set out in the Australian Wheat Charter 1990 which, in tum, requires vessels to undergo, before loading, appropriate surveys to ensure that they will be loaded and operated in accordance with international requirements concerning safety of life at sea and pollution prevention; that crew competencies are certified; and that the vessels, including crews' living quarters, are clean and rust-free in all respects. The charterparty also provides for vessels to be able to load according to the custom of the port, always afloat, at a safe dock, pier, wharf or berth ordered by the AWB. The standard contracts require vessels to be classified in Lloyd's Register not lower than 100 AI, or top classification in American, French, Italian, Norwegian or other equal register, or ships state. not inferior to these classifications. The standard contracts also specify that the owners of a chartered vessel guarantee that, for the duration of the relevant charterparty, the minimum terms and conditions of employment of the crew are covered by an International Transport Federation (ITp) Agreement or a bona fide trade union agreement acceptable to the ITF. Domestic shipping of wheat is normally confined to shipments to Tasmania for which an Australian owned vessel is used. Department of Defence: Contracts (Question No. 965)  Defence, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Further to his answer to part (6) of question No. 839 (Hansard, 7 November 1996, page 6593), can he provide specific details of the soil types, environmental factors, munition size and type of clearance equipment mentioned in his answer. (2) What factors would have to pertain if former firing ranges were to be developed as (a) football fields, (b) netball courts, (c) racecourses or (d) heavy vehicle parking areas. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Specific details of the soil types, environmental factors, munition size and type of clearance equipment cannot be given, as this depends on the particular characteristics and history of the area in question. Some of the many possible factors in relation to these aspects include: Soil type: (a) depth for excavation; (b) consistency of soil (eg clay/sandy/rock); and (c) moisture levels. Environmental factors: (a) hydrology; (b) temperature (eg ground freezing point); and (c) vegetation. Munition: (a) size of munitions (eg 2000lb bomb or small mortar); (b) fusing type (level of risk); and (c) category of munition (eg white phosphorus or high explosive). Clearance equipment: (a) type of munitions being cleared; (b) metal detection equipment; and (c) final clearance and sifting. (2) The future development of former firing ranges, for example, as football fields, netball courts, racecourses or heavy vehicle parking areas, is not dependent on their proposed use but rather the effectiveness of the Unexploded Ordinance clearance operations. The considerations relating to munition type and size, soil types, environmental NA NA NA NA NA NA factors and clearance equipment, as outlined in response to part (1), would determine the effectiveness of clearance operations. Livestock Transport Ships: Ownership (Question No. 967)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) What was the (a) name, (b) nation of registry, (c) age, (d) ownership details and (e) management details of each livestock ship which visited Australian ports in (i) 1995-96 and (ii) 1996 to date. (2) Is he able to provide details on the composition of the crews of each ship. (3) Were any of the vessels identified in part (1) found to have safety deficiencies; if so, which vessels. (4) Were any of the vessels identified in part (1) detained by the Australian Maritime Safety Agency; if so, (a) which vessels, (b) at what ports and (c) for what period. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(i) Livestock ships which visited Australian ports from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1995 are listed in Attachment 1. Attachment 1 includes (a) ship's name, (b) nation of registry, (c) age of ship, (d) name of owner and (e) name of manager. (1)(ii) Livestock ships which visited Australian ports from 1 January 1996 to 30 November 1996 are listed in Attachment 2. Attachment 2 includes (a) ship's name, (b) nation of registry, (c) age of ship, (d) name of owner and (e) name of manager. The names of the owners have been obtained from Lloyds Register of Ships 1996-97 where possible, or from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's (AMSA) inspection records where the ship is not listed in Lloyds Register of Ships 199697. (2) No. AMSA does not record the nationalities of ship's crews when ships are inspected, unless there is a safety issue relating to crewing.

Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In August 1995, the Department of Finance distributed a survey requesting users of Budget Paper No.1 (BPI) to comment on the appropriateness of the format of Statement 3 and to suggest any changes they felt would make the document more user friendly. 600 forms were sent out, covering all parliamentarians, recipients of the CFT and all government departments and authorities. 53 responses were received, with only 4 responses from Parliamentarians. Of these 4 responses: one did not use Statement 3 at all; the other 3 respondents had the following comments to offer. Action taken is also detailed: make Statement 3 more reader friendly, particularly the table of contents and the numbering system: the table of contents remained unchanged for the 1996-97 BPI, but the index was improved. Changes to the table of contents are being considered for the 1997-98 Budget documents; and the Statements in BPI are produced by both Finance and Treasury and are completed to different timeframes. The numbering system of BPI caters for these differing timeframes and enables an efficient production process in final printing. However, Treasury and Finance are reviewing the page numbering for the 1997©98 Budget.; why are forward estimates included in outlays trends graphs and running costs tables given the volatility of the estimates? of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia (APESMA) Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers' Union (ALHMWU) National Union of Workers (NUW) Industry Services and Contracting Group Assistant Secretary, Employee Relations Commercial Support Program Director, Industrial Relations Human Resources Management, Industrial Relations inclusion of forward estimates data is an important part of the government's budgetary strategy; remove proportion charts as they do not provide any useful information: under review for 1997-98;a graph showing real outlays growth excluding asset sales would be useful: growth charts showing underlying outlays as well as total outlays were published in the Statement 3 Overview in the 1996-97 Budget. This effectively excluded asset sales; include more detail on measures: this issue is currently being addressed for the 1997©98 Budget; publish deflators (at least historical) to help with analysis: deflators for the budget and previous two years are published in Statement 2; tables in the Statistical Appendix to Statement 3 are published in constant prices and therefore should not require deflators for analyses; The remainder of the responses came from government departments and agencies who use Statement 3 for analysis. Of these: 62.26% preferred the Statement to continue in its present format; 13.21 % preferred a new format; two responses specified a preference for a portfolio/program focus; and 24.53% had no comment on the format of the presentation. All respondents suggested cosmetic changes to improve the current format, but they mainly preferred to keep the presentation on a function basis. Therefore, no significant change was made to Statement 3, other than to include more portfolio-focused information relating to measures in the Statement 3 Overview. Comcare: ADI St Mary's Accident (Question No. 1032)  Relations, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an accident which occurred at Australian Defence Industries (ADI) shell filling factory at St Marys in the last week of its operation in which four workers were injured. (2) Is Comcare the responsible workers' compensation authority for the former workers at ADI St Marys. (3) Has his attention been drawn to allegations Comcare intervened to ensure that a coronial inquiry was not undertaken into the incident. (4) Is it a fact that a coronial inquiry is not proceeding; if so, does this make it more difficult for the injured workers to take proceedings related to possible negligence. (5) Is there a precedent for Comcare intervening to ensure a coronial inquiry did not proceed; if so, what are the details. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes, at the time of the accident Comcare was the responsible authority and so manages their compensation claims. Early this year ADI successfully applied for a licence to 'self-insure' for the purposes of workers' compensation. (3) No such allegations have been made to me or, I am advised, to Comcare. Comcare further advise me it did not intervene in the coronial inquiry. In this case, the Coroner requested the report of Comcare's investigation into the incident under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. As the Comcare investigation was incomplete at that stage an interim report was duly provided. (4) I have been advised that the State Coroner, Mr D Hand, has determined that the provisions of the Coroners Act 1980, have been complied with and the holding of a formal hearing into the circumstances surrounding the explosion is not necessary. An order dispensing with the holding of an Inquiry was made on 22 October, 1996. This determination does not affect any decision the injured workers may make with regard to taking their own proceedings. The two proceedings are completely unrelated and, in fact, Supreme Court case law has previously ruled that a Coronial inquiry should not be used to set up civil action. (5) I am advised Comcare did not intervene in the manner alleged; it assisted the Coroner with his inquiry by providing its interim investigation report.
