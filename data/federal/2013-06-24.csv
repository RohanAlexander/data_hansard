I SEMDs and some of the structures that can be something accidental-and that is, as anyone will tell you, the best response. of setting structures in place so that people some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, medical waste, are often the people suffering the but they are covered by unions like United and the fact that these workers are not paid casual hours becomes particularly worrisome neglected and I believe, and as suggested by the unreported because it is a lapse in a systemsystem has broken down, that maybe they were have done. So prevention is highly necessary in these injuries. A healthcare facility is a receiving and giving care. Healthcare facilities and throughout the world they are exposed every day, including biological hazards such hazards. If we cannot get it right in there are obviously greater complications these workplace hazards, and with more than experiencing work-related injuries within in a year-one in 20-it is important to protect workers to come home safe-that makes good sense. Because their job is to care for the sick viewed as being immune to injury or illness. have gone through the member for Moore's door flus and the like, but somehow the member for treats parliamentarians and their staff. The and these workers are often expected to sacrifice patients. This motion will potentially result in a reduction infection to healthcare workers. I think the amendment that has been flagged by the member has an added benefit, in that it contributes healthcare system much stronger. Some of the include making sure that we have an adequate are not rushing and are not forced to treat many patients at a time. It is when people major hazards to healthcare workers through present serious health and safety risks. More than 200 people die in Australia each 170,000 people injured badly enough to need healthcare injuries flagged by the member for and we should be doing more about it, because people needing time off work is simply not focused on keeping all workers safe, be they should not have to suffer the loss of a loved change their life completely, because of The amendments proposed by the government-which, supported by the opposition-will make sure actively involved in the process of reviewing injuries so that we address all of the health workers and their relevant unions, who often on behalf of the individual-whether it be the union or the healthcare workers union; whoever making sure workplace health and safety issues workers and unions are very supportive of medical devices that reduce the risk We know that this is everywhere. One of that you are able to access the Qantas Club-I Qantas Club-and I note that even in those toilets Even though people are flying business class around sorts of people for all sorts of reasons might people's workplaces. According to the World injuries include: the overuse of injections our workers from injury. We want all of our moral sense and it also makes good economic and the injured, healthcare workers are often I cannot imagine how many parliamentarians over the last 20 years or so, bringing in their Moore has to be immune to those flus when he patients of healthcare workers usually come first, their own well-being for the sake of their of sharps injuries and associated risk of member for Shortland will be dealing with the for Moore.

Families one, or have them suffer an injury that could substandard work health and safety practices,. as I have flagged, will be that state and territory representatives are the existing code of practice for needle-stick and safety risks of biohazards broadly.

The healthcare making sure that there are safety-engineered of needle-stick injuries in Australia. the benefits of being a member of parliament is think it is even a more specialised part of the there is the capacity for there to be sharps. the world, there is still the reality that all be bringing sharps into their workplaces or other Health Organization, the causes of needle-stick and unnecessary sharps; a lack of supplies of disposable syringes, safer needle devices and and failure to use sharps containers immediately emergency situations or when they are rushed; needles after use, although one would hope lack of engineering controls, such as safer hand in the operating suite; and just that general with sharps. The primary global prevention of needle-stick of unnecessary needles. I say this on a day and their staff, to donate blood-and earlier Parliamentary Friends of the Australian Red people to give blood-but that is a different need people to give blood. Sadly, one in three blood, and we do not have enough people giving into winter. We need education about the universal precautions: and also the use of sharps containers for safe or in the other workplaces. The most effective the hazard, so substituting for injections by or removing sharps and needles altogether if injections; engineering controls, touched on retract, sheath or blunt immediately after mean that the more they are the norm or are and administrative controls, workplace controls these combine to make everything safer. (Time expired) Mrs MOYLAN (Pearce) (11:19): Can I thank motion before the House. It is a particularly opportunity to second the motion and to synonymous with healthcare workers, it is a little-known responsible for nearly 18,000 injuries to healthcare stick injuries are no respecters of people, because hospitals and other health providers right through The figure of 18,000 injuries is a minimum, reporting of sharps injuries is in the range Technology Association of Australia estimates per year. Worryingly, over 80 per cent of reported needle. That means that, of the potential contaminated needle, presenting a serious healthcare workers to dangerous blood-borne C virus and human immunodeficiency virus, or truly quantify, as injured workers suffer emotionally and must take time off work, which has flow-on system. But the costs we can quantify show sharps disposal containers; a lack of access to after injection, perhaps when people are in inadequate or short staffing; the recapping of that would not happen as much in Australia; the needle devices; passing instruments from hand to lack of awareness of the hazards associated injuries is achieved through the elimination where we are asking all politicians particularly, today I was with the representatives of the Cross, where we launched the campaign asking process. It is a much bigger needle, but we do Australians at some time in their life will need blood at the moment, particularly coming the elimination of needle recapping disposal, whether it be in the health workplace control measures include: the elimination of administering medications through another route, possible, so that we eliminate all unnecessary by the member for Moore, such as needles that use-they may cost more, but economies of scale legislated, the more the price will come down; and personal protective equipment. All of the member for Moore for bringing this important issue and I am very grateful to have the contribute to this debate. Whilst needles are fact that needles and other sharps are workers every year in Australia. Needlethey affect people from the cleaning staff into doctors, surgeons and dentists, in fact. as numerous studies have shown that underof between 30 and 80 per cent. The Medical that the actual number is over 30,000 injuries needle-stick injuries involve a contaminated 30,000 injuries per year, 24,000 will involve a health and safety risk and potentially exposing pathogens including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis HIV. The costs of such injuries are difficult to whilst waiting for the results of testing effects to the efficiency of our healthcare that more must be done to prevent the number of sharps injuries in our healthcare system. Estimated infected person in Australia are over $173,000 to the Australian government has been estimated billion in the next five years. These are huge prevented with proper protocols and the right chronic hepatitis C infection are the underlying causes of 4.8 per cent and 28.1 per cent of people receive liver transplants every year, $177,000 per procedure and long-term follow per year. It is all very well to talk about the human cost to the people that are left to manage diseases. In looking at ways to minimise the number Whitby and MCLaws concluded that the introduction elimination of butterfly needles should reduce per cent and almost have the total incidence safety syringes are safety - engineered medical They are defined as a non-needle-sharp or accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications feature or mechanism that effectively reduces be used for the collection of bodily fluids or arterial access is established, for the administration procedures involving the potential for occupational injuries from contaminated sharps. The usefulness of SEMDs is well established encouraged to consider using them, including directive to prevent sharps injuries. With the states and territories have implemented intergovernmental agreement signed by the the scope of those laws is unclear regarding employers manage risk by eliminating health practicable. However, if it is not reasonably minimised as far as possible. Needle-stick injuries will never be completely reasonably practical minimisation of risks is examination of costs with arguments that training than moving towards the use of SEMDs. The shows that training alone is simply not enough. A number of years ago BD commissioned a estimating the cost of needle-stick injuries acquisition cost of safety-engineered medical based on an uncomplicated, low-risk needle-stick low risk, is tested and is found to be negative lifetime treatment costs for a newly HIVper annum. The annual treatment cost of HCV at about $252 million per year and $1.5 amounts of money for something that could be equipment.

Unfortunately, that often leads to an on how to handle needles is more effective number of injuries across Australia, however, third party to develop a cost-benefit model for in the acute care setting in Australia versus the devices.

This is a very serious the time off work and the cost of medical when we consider possible action to minimise which could be done.

I the issue of using retractable needles became to talk about the efforts of Maurice Riddle, the Maurice, who is from my local community, was days a week for many years he has, on his own playgrounds and community parks of the area to he recognises the dangers those needles playgrounds and the public areas. As a result of of needles out of circulation and made the for that by being nominated South is a very important motion and I am glad previous life, as I think everyone in this House Health Services Union. This is one of the issues remember spending a lot of time in places like Service just out of Newcastle, and often the by a number of things: (1) they are lowest-paid health workers in the system; (2), backgrounds; but (3) what is most important they are often the people who end up with the sharps injuries or the needle-stick injuries. terms of the way in which the health system would have people who did not speak English educational standards and who were not well causing enormous stress both mentally and, happen. There was a real feeling of powerlessness within the health industry. They saw themselves, bottom of the pile. They were certainly at the up. And they expressed to me, and to anyone that they felt powerless to actually have a voice about. Over the last 20 years, undoubtedly there sharps are handled, and I do not think anyone But, when I was a union official visiting these other health workers, in changing the beds, was easier to bundle the whole thing up and example, Parramatta Linen Service, with these injuries. So the issue then became, and still is played a great role. I do not think you see other health professionals simply disposing where there are needle-sticks and scalpels that accident rather than by deliberate design, which The simple answer, in relation to what happens no, we have not. Education is important-it measures to make sure that this particular most vulnerable in terms of the chain in For that reason I was particularly pleased there to looking at safety-engineered medical hospitals where they are used already. The spoken about that in this debate-is always terms of the cost is always a very short-term the cost to the worker and their family through just on the economic basis and looks in the longer used.

16,Ms HALL,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Before I debate, I would like to put on record my thanks motion before the House and for his almost 15-year issues in the parliament. He has provided parliament, he has used his medical skills his healing hand to members on both sides And those first two points are not unrelated in operates. What I found most often was that you well, who had relatively low levels of paid who were being injured at the work, potentially, physically from what could actually too, because of the position that they held and many others saw them, as being at the end of the chain in terms of where sharps ended who would listen, their frustration at a system has been great improvement in the way in which in this debate is not conceding that is the case. places, quite often linen would come in where had also chucked sharps in the linen because it shoot it down the chute. It ends up at, for poor workers being subject to multiple sharps now: how do you deal with this? Education has the levels that you did in the past of nurses and of sharps within the linen. Nowadays, I suspect, get caught up in there, it is by mistake or by it used to be. But have we gone far enough? overseas as the best form of comparison, is: takes us so far. But we do need to look at other category of health workers, who I think are the which this happens, have better protections. to see in this motion that there was the reference devices and maximising their use. There are argument-and many other speakers have already put about the cost. But what they are arguing in cost, as opposed to the long-term cost over time: these sorts of injuries. When one argues this term, these are devices that should be being of education-the types of injuries that we see it is not going to get us all the way there, at these sorts of devices to further reduce the member on bringing this important- (Time start the substance of my contribution to this to the member for Moore for bringing this contribution to debates on this and other support and assistance to many members in this to keep this House operating and he has tendered of the parliament. I thank him for what he has done in that area. I also mention-and I think debating today-his contributions to drug providing a health perspective on that issue. thank him for his friendship. This motion raises health issues relating to Needle-stick injuries can be experienced by any other sharp object. That includes individuals in hospitals, aged care, mental health or community services. My daughter-in-law is services. She has told me that many nurses have on health professionals. We read regularly we know, as legislators, that this is an important know that we have been a little Data from the EPINetTM system suggests that approximately 30 needle-stick injuries per healthcare professionals suffer from a needle-stick known in Australia. The numbers are likely to reporting scheme. Numerous studies have estimated not reported with results ranging between 30 stick injuries decreases as the number of injuries more injuries there are, the less they are reported. stick injuries within the workplace. The attitude should be one of reporting incidents immediately, than that, the issue is pushed aside. I find person is experiencing their first injury, 84 drops to 63 per cent where a person has had where a person has had more than five injuries. Therefore, there are likely to be over 30,000 year. One in nine nurses in Australia has had at least Nurses incur the highest proportion of the total health professionals. Data reported from New needle-stick injuries pose a significant Preliminary results indicate that 40 per cent needle-stick injury in New South Wales are ago that the highest percentage of needle-stick medical officers. Most of the needle-stick injuries involved with previous reports by the International Healthcare of Virginia. The greatest hazard associated blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, causes immune deficiency syndrome. A further malaria, infectious mononucleosis, diphtheria, transmitted in that way. Transmission of it relates a little bit to the motion we are law reform, in particular his contribution to I strongly thank him for his contribution and I needle-stick and other types of sharps injuries. any healthcare professional who uses needles or from a wide range of occupations who work other healthcare services, such as social and a nurse and works in accident and emergency worry about the impact that sharps injuries can about such incidents in the newspapers and issue that needs to be addressed-and we bit slow in running with it. in United States' hospitals, on average, incur 100 beds per year. In Australia, at least 18,000 injury every year. The true rate is not be a lot higher than are reported under the NSI the percentage of needle-stick injuries per cent and 80 per cent. Reporting of needleincreases-which is really quite scary. The That shows a general attitude to needleshould be one of great care and the culture seeking treatment and having tests. Rather that extremely disturbing. For cases where the per cent of incidents are reported. But that number three to four injuries and to only 24 per cent So there is this very complacent attitude. needle-stick injuries occurring in Australia every one needle-stick injury in the past 12 months. needle-stick injuries in comparison to other South Wales public hospitals indicates that risk to healthcare workers in New South Wales. of healthcare workers who have experienced a registered nurses, and I made the point a moment injuries are incurred by nurses, followed by hollow-bore needles, and figures are consistent Worker Safety Centre of the University with needle-stick injury is the transmission of hepatitis C and HIV-which is the virus that 20 per cent of other pathogens-such as herpes, tuberculosis and syphilis-can also be pathogens may occur not only with freshly contaminated needles and sharp objects but carried dry blood. Once again, there have been blood. Transmission rates vary by type and risk is high for viruses such as HBV as it week. I think that the argument in relation to this the argument-speaks for itself. There are deal with this. The cost of needle-stick injuries system, due to the costs associated with the fluids and the prevention and treatment of blood-borne injuries can result in great stress for the injured do not think that we can underestimate the impact of these incidents are not reported shows that show that the worker may fear having it investigated. with and that health systems and governments an amelioration of a number of these problems.

Believe it or not, when I was in the retail union, I saw motion. You would not think that retail workers but in actual fact retail workers often have to where biohazards are encountered. I often came the most extreme environments-having to clean remember one worker, a cleaner who worked furniture shop had a large room of balls, where children being children, they would mess themselves, balls, so it was a pretty unpleasant job.

When combined with proven capacity to reduce the incidence of sharps Australia may have slipped behind similar nations can do better in the future. There is also, as other members have incidence of sharps injuries in our communities, been associated with illicit drug use, results catches onto those issues with more energy than but I suppose that is because of the uncertainty, implications that are all considerations in the healthcare workers are faced with this cases, as may be the case when a member of the beach.

They were encouraging their injured people firstly, assess the risk of developing infection.

Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:51): I would for Throsby for this motion, which talks in are being heavily exposed to rising energy confirm that point, and I am also very pleased about how critical manufacturing is to our right on those two facts. However, one must wonder, given the other supported, if he, in fact, is living in a parallel member's attention that, if my recollection this motion and the honourable member for Wakefield, impose upon Australian manufacturers the energy prices up, including gas. So, with the Throsby, to describe this motion as even slightly While the honourable member's motion expresses being heavily exposed to rising energy prices, only that he is part of a government that has tax upon those very same manufacturers but also increases a further five per cent. And let at the investment picture around the world to in this country is a debate not just about energy deal with climate change-but a debate about the bounty that Australia has been bequeathed sure that that works for the nation. is to decarbonise the economy, to diversify the critical aim, but in the meantime we have got to are not just utilised to create huge profits for companies, and are not just used as for windfall going, but they are also used to trigger and It would be a sad state of affairs indeed if, in Gladstone and exporting and getting very high in our own domestic markets.

The increasing market concentration, spurred on by Act, now known as our Competition and Consumer To answer that question, I start with what infamous Boral case: While the conduct must be examined by its effect on is the key-the effect on consumers. Let us therefore have a look at the effect for bigness's sake and which have led to this I will start with our food retailing sector. increase in market concentration in our supermarket consumer, during this period the Australian of food inflation in the developed world-not any period that you pick over that 30 years, increased faster than almost anywhere else like comparison of food prices in supermarkets anywhere in the world, shows that Australian prices for their groceries and their supermarket staples. We have seen the illusion of this phoney which is only undertaken on a handful of supermarket and we see that they have been anywhere else in the world. So where did we go wrong in our competition you only need two or a few companies in a market laws and our history tell us that, if you reduce reduce competition and the consumer is worse bigness sake is not an ideology of the free market; in central-planning economies-where a small know what is best. I believe it is simply the case that, the prices consumers pay-and that is exactly evidence in our supermarket retail sector. experience before I came to this parliament, when one of Australia's largest retailers Zealand. They went to their New Zealand suppliers the rebates-around 10 per cent, which is money they were to supply that Australian retailer. wholesalers said, 'We cannot afford to pay that our profit margin.' The response of the big wholesale price; we don't care.' And that wholesalers simply increased their wholesale more dominant we see our retailers, the more suppliers, and the higher the price the consumer will pay. first question to ask, therefore, is whether this the legislative settings of our Trade Practices Act, is in the best interests of the nation. Justice MCHugh of our High Court said in the the competitive process, it is the flow on result that on consumers of having laws which reward bigness drift towards increased market concentration. Over the last 30 years we have seen a massive sector. But, rather than benefiting the consumer has been slugged with the highest rates just for a short period of time but for almost consumer prices for food in Australia have in the developed world. And today, any like-forin Australia that you could make, with almost consumers are paying some of the highest price war between the supermarket duopoly, lines. We look at the other 5,000 lines in the going up and up and up, faster than almost laws? It has been a complete delusion that for there to be adequate competition. Our the number of competitors in a market, you off. So this idea we have had of bigness for this is the same failed ideology that we see group of all-knowing central-planners simply more concentrated the market becomes, the higher what we have been shown by the empirical I would like to give an example, from my of how that happens. It was in New Zealand, was opening up many stores throughout New and told them that they would have to pay paid back to the retailer by the supplier-if Of course, these New Zealand manufacturers and 10 per cent rebate, because that is greater than Australian retailer was simply: 'Increase your is what happened: to pay those rebates, the price, which increased the retail price.
