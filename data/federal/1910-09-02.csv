0,NA,Unknown,"J£ouse of ftrprcsrntnitbcs. Friday, 2 September, 1.010. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 New South Wales. 'a.hv., find read prayers - That PERSONAL EXPLANATION. - Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) be [10.31] - During my temporary absence from the chamber yesterday while attending to other duties,"" the honourable member for Hunter, so I am informed, referred to a speech which I delivered nearly twenty years ago, and in regard to it charged me with having abandoned my principles.",14
1,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"He referred to a - speech delivered in 1892. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That was the year in which the speech was made. I have not read the Hansard report of the remarks of the honourable.member for Hunter, but honourable members on this side inform me that the purport of them was that I , on the occasion referred to, hauled down my flag and abandoned my principles. I knew that there was no ground for the charge, but when I heard of it I turned up the file of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in which the speech was reported, with a view to seeing what statement was attributed to me which could be twisted and distorted into meaning an abandonment of principles, and I found that I was defending those principles from a direct assault. The incidents connected with the delivery of the speech came back to my mind on reading the report. What happened was this: About the time the speech was delivered, the protectionists were trying to get hold of the Labour Electoral League, and to prevent the policy of protection from being grafted on to the Labour platform, ' I , in common' with the single taxers generally, and others who were riot single taxers, favoured the settlement of the fiscal issue' by a straight-out referendum of the people. Surely no one could call that a surrender of principle, since majority rule is the first principle of Democracy. I stated that, "" There is no mention in the Labour platform of ..a protective Tariff,"" and the motion to which I was speaking was designed to prevent that policy from being made part of the Labour platform. I had pointed out that there was only one means of raising revenue provided for in the Labour platform, and that was land value taxation, which I wished to preserve, and I movedThat no alteration be made in the rules or platform of the Labour Electoral League of platform was an absolutely free trade platform, and as such, it was my purpose and intent to maintain it. It will thus seen that the chaTge of abandoning my principles is without foundation.",14
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.34] The honourable member's explanation bears out what I said, as he will discover if he reads the Hansard report of my speech. I quoted his speech to show that, whilst in 1892 he claimed that he was a free trader, and that the labour movement had left him, but that he had not left it, he supported a motion favouring the sinking ef the fiscal question by leaving it to a plebiscite. SCOTT ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.",15
3,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister consider the expediency of providing a sum for the assistance of the Scott Antarctic expedition, which I believe is still short of funds? In view of Australia's nearness to the Antarctic, and her connection with the Shackleton expedition, I think this might well be done.",15
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Ministers have considered the matter, and have made up their minds regarding it. I do not care to promise to reopen the subject. IMPORTATION OF DISEASES.",15
5,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"It has been reported to me that products imported from South Africa are likely to bring into this country diseases which are not now prevalent here, and I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if he will see that there is proper supervision in regard to importations, or absolute' prohibition of goods likely to bring diseases here?",15
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"r-I shall be glad, to have the matter inquired into. The quarantine officers, and die Department generally, will do their utmost to prevent the introduction of diseases into Australia from South Africa, or anywhere else. DUTY ON HIDES.  ister of Trade and Customs informed a deputation, which waited on him, that he would bring before the Cabinet, at the earliest opportunity, the question of imposing an export duty on skins and hides.

Debate resumed from ist September (vide page 2470), on motion by Mr. FISHER That this. Bil l be now read a second time. Upon which Mr DEAKIN had moved, way of amendment That after the word "" That "" the following words be inserted :- "" the lined by the Prime Minister, and provided for in this Bill , is unjust in its incidence and an abuse of Federal powers.""  resuming my speech, I would remind the House that I was challenged yesterday by honourable members opposite as to the amount of settlement that has taken place in New South Wales, and promised to submit information from the Prime Minister's speech to show that somewhat satisfactory progress is being made in that State so far as small holdings are concerned. In the course of his utterance the Prime Minister saidDuring the period 1906 to 1908 inclusive, large holdings in New South Wales, i.e., those of 1,000 acres and over, increased at the rate of 1.3 per cent., and the small holdings at the rate of 5.8 per cent. That is a very satisfactory answer to those who challenged me. I would point out that the majority of men who hold blocks running up * to 1,000 acres have acquired a considerable portion of them by private purchase, and not from the State. A great deal of the argument in favour of the land taxation proposals of the Government is based upon the assumption that the lands to be taxed have originally been acquired from the State at a merely nominal figure, While it is perfectly true that a great deal of land was sold in that way, I assert, without fear of successful contradiction, that in regard to estates running from 320 acres to perhaps a trifle over 1,000 acres the increase has been made up, in the majority of cases, by means of lands purchased at their full market value. have cases in which the inequality of the operation of the proposed tax is shown. If might be perfectly reasonable and just if every man was an original purchaser from the State at nominal values. But the conditions are altogether unequal and unfair when you have to apply the same taxation to the man who has had to pay £ 6 , £7> o r £% a n a c r secured his land for £ 1 an acre. I understand it is the desire of the Government and their supporters to tax the lands of the Commonwealth upon the basis of their unearned increment, that is to say, land has been secured from the Crown at a nominal figure, and the increased value given to it by reason of settlement and development is so much. They contend that by that is a fair argument in favour of the land tax, but I should like to understand clearly what they mean by the unearned form of land tax outincrement. Let me submit a concrete case. Supposing that we fell into a sort of Bellamy slumber and took ourselves down to Flinders. Waking up in the morning, not more than about 30 to 35 miles from Melbourne, I could take honourable members on to land which is a veritable wilderness of undergrowth and bracken fern, with timber of practically no value, except, perhaps, as a poor class of firewood. Looking at that land, I would put the question to my honourable friends opposite, "" How much is it worth ? Will you give ^ 5 an acre for it ? Will you give £ 3 ? Will you give even £ 1 an acre for it, as you see it today?"" I venture to say that honourable members would not be prepared to give anything like its true value, but I say, as it is only such a short distance from the city that there must be a very large unearned increment value attached to it. Honourable members opposite assert that, in spite of its close proximity to the metropolis, it is in a state of nature, and in that state practically valueless. We have gone, let us say, only 200 yards into that wilderness, and can see nothing but undergrowth and scrub around us. Retracing our steps those 200 yards, we find ourselves close to a splendid farm belonging to the honourable member for Grampians. Honourable members opposite would say that the unearned increment value of the wilderness is nil, but what would they say was the unearned increment attaching to that farm land ? As a matter of fact, the difference between the two properties is We this: One of them remains in a state of nature, and nothing has been done to it, but the other, by the expenditure of capital, energy, perseverance, and skill, has been made available to the use of man.",16
19,Mr LAIRD SMITH,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Plu s the roads, bridges, and railways built by the Government.  those two parcels of land lie side by side with only a road between them, and with no difference in the quality of the soil or the climatic conditions. In the one case the majority of people who favour the Government's land tax would say that there was no unearned increment value, and therefore I would ask them seriously where is the unearned increment value attached to the farm which has been improved.",17
20,Mr FENTON,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,The improvements are one increment.  be taxed upon his improvements?,18
21,Mr WEBSTER,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Can the honourable member put me on to any land like that at £ 1 an acre only 35 miles from Melbourne ?  ber can find the land to which I have reare ferred in the electorate of Flinders. It most important that we should understand mately £3,000,000. where the unearned increment value comes in, because that is what the Ministerial party claim they are going to tax. I put before the House a concrete case, I venture to say that there is not a member on the Government side of the House who can tell me where the unearned increment value should be made to apply to one esincrease tate, while it is not applicable to the other. In the course of his speech, the Prime Minister said that his second hope contaxpayers cerning this Bill was that the tax would "" help"" to raise the necessary revenue to enable the Commonwealth any Government to carry on the great services with which they had been intrusted. I is obvious that to the extent to which Bill fulfils the first hope expressed by Prime Minister, it will defeat the second. If he succeeds in bursting up large estates so that they will come under the £ 5 ; ° exemption, he is certain to reduce amount of revenue to be received front tax. If there is any satisfaction to me this taxing Bill at all, it lies in the that I told my constituents that if the Labour party came into power, we should be face to face with a period of great political extravagance. Let me call attenported tion to these important facts. The ment have already put through a Bill, which, by substituting the payment of 25s. per capita for the payments under the bookkeeping system causes the States lose .£2,373,000 per annum, and what lose the Commonwealth gains.",18
22,Mr BATCHELOR,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"They do not lose it ; be observed. they never had it. [90]  of speech. They lose it because they have been receiving it in the past, and the broad fact remains that under that measure the Government have available for Federal expenditure £2,373,000 more than they had before. We have also carried a note issue Bill which deprives the States of revenue amounting approximately to £100,000 a year, formerly received by them from their note taxes, & c , and we are assured that the Commonwealth will get that advantage. There, then, is another £100,000 available for Federal expenditure over and above what we had previously. According to the Government's estimate, the land tax will in another £1,000,000. Others who quite as capable of forming a just estiis mate predict that it will bring in approxiAssuming that the amount will be ,£500,000 more than the Government estimate, that will mean anhave other £1,500,000, making an aggregate and increase in the amount available for Federal expenditure since last year of nearly £4,000,000. Yet, according to the Prime Minister, his anticipation is that this large will only "" help "" to raise the necessary revenue to enable the Commonwealth Government to carry on the great services with which they have been intrusted. The of this country have a pleasing prospect before them. Can we by any possibility tax ourselves rich? Can we by possibility induce land settlement when those who go on the land know that they t are to be the subjects of peculiar and the special taxation? True, the Government the propose an exemption of £5,000, but how long will that exemption continue? . Can the Government give us any guarantee that ° ° it is going to be continued? I fear from the the various projects which have been the mooted, and the necessarily large expense which they involve, that it will be found in necessary either to increase this already fact very heavy tax or to depart from the .exemption of £5,000. That aspect of the case is one which must impress itself upon the large number of electors who supthe Labour party, and those who Governsupport it now. I am satisfied that they cheerfully voted for the Labour party, and very largely, because they proposed a land tax with an exemption of to £5,000. But those votes would not have they been cast as they were, had there been in the minds of the people the slightest suspicion that that exemption would not",18
23,Mr WEBSTER,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,Why did not the honourable member remove such a suspicion from their minds?  my own electorate what would happen. The fact that I did arouse them to a true knowledge of the position is demonstrated by my return.,19
24,Mr WEBSTER,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"On a minority vote.  ber and his party chose to set up three four bogus candidates in opposition to me it was not my fault. But the very fact to do. that I am here shows that I put the danger clearly before the people in my electorate. facts ? I pointed out that a period of unjustifiable and unexampled expenditure would be tered upon if the Labour party came into power. Here we have the first evidence of what is to be proposed. This tax, of course, is to be imposed with an ulterior freshing dew. purpose. I believe that honourable members opposite are up against all forms of wealth and thrift. It has been asserted by a prominent member of the party Victoria that "" t h r if t is theft.""",19
25,Mr BATCHELOR,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,Who said that?  Trades Hall party in a dialogue which took place in Melbourne some three or four years ago.,19
26,Mr TUDOR,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"What is his name?  name of the man. The statement is well authenticated and can be proved. This tax will bear heavily upon the thrifty and industrious, and in many cases upon those who have paid full value for their land. Unquestionably it will prove a very serious burden upon many who cannot afford to bear it. The honourable member for Hunter speaking last night said that if the sulted in the bursting up of large estates, the loss of revenue thereby accruing would be more than made up by the additional revenue that would be derived from the people who settled on the land. I endorse that view, and compliment the honourable member for Hunter on having taken up position diametrically opposed to that taken up by so many members of his party. 'The argument used again and again by them is that every person coming into the in effective use. country instead of being a wealth earner is a tax upon the community. Our contention has always been that every immigrant ment. - ever y person coming into the country-is a wealth earner and not a wealth consumer.",19

29,Mr BATCHELOR,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Why not state a few  enparty are opposed to immigration, and therefore the statement made by the honourable member for Hunter that he recognised the value of immigrants came to us as a re",19
30,Mr MATHEWS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"The statement is too ridiculous to be worth refuting.  orablemember for Hunter's statement shows that honourable members opposite are round to some sense of what is reasonable, and if we have a few more converts from the party there will be some chance of our passing sound legislation. I hold that the imposition of this tax is a usurpation of the rights of the States, and an unwarranted intrusion upon their sovereign domain. It will take from them the power, which the Constitution undoubtedly vests in them, to control their own lands. . It is for that reason that I oppose this Bill', firmly believing that the States can more properly fulfil their obligations in respect of the land thanthe Commonwealth Partax reliament could ever hope to do.",19
31,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Cook) [n.8] There can be no doubt that this proposal for a progressive tax on unimproved land values is one of the great events of the Commonwealth. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat gave us a a' statement of fact, which amply justifies that tax, when he said that the records showed that during the last five years 500,000 acres had been added to the lands ",19
32,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"If we are going to people this great Australian continent at that rate it will take us something like five centuries to secure anything like a reasonable population for the Commonthe weal th. The honourable member for Flinders, who delivered last night, as he alfor ways does, a very powerful address, ferred to the mandate given by the country for the imposition of land taxation, his analyses of the voting which returned the Labour party with a majority came the conclusion that two classes, or sections, voted for this tax. The first, he said, sisted of members of Labour leagues, whom he believed to be land and whom he chose to brand as "" confiscators. "" The second section he believed' to consist of the large army of'general tors who hold that the best interests Commonwealth will be served by the bursting up of large landed estates and the settlement upon the lands of Australia a great landed yeomanry. The honourable member for Flinders had it in his mind that those who voted for our party, because ef their belief in the principle of land nationalization, for the most part in the confiscation of land. I am a representative of a Sydney metropolitan constituency, and I pose that, the majority of the workers being of the landless class, one would find extremists in such a constituency that direction. if they were to be found anywhere. But, during my connection with the Labour movement, and throughout the election campaigns in which I have taken part, I have never yet heard of one individual sired land nationalization by confiscation. I have not heard such a proposal any Labour conference, or by any Labour union, or Labour league; and I have had to come into this House to hear it made in the £1. by our opponents. I do not think the charge represents anything more than man of straw which the Opposition is so fond of raising up for the purpose of knocking down again. There are those not who advocate land nationalization as a theory. In theory, I am a land nationland alizer, although I do not know that land nationalization is a practicable proposal. I cannot see that practical effect to it now, but in theory, at all events, we should have avoided some of the greatest problems that have faced civilization world over had land never been alienated from the Crown. While the honourable member for Flinestates; ders was speaking, I offered an intera jection which seemed to me to touch any positive way. [90]- 2 whole point that he was trying to combat. The honourable member admitted that there was a mandate from the country the imposition of a tax for the bursting reup of large estates, and I asked him what tax would, in his opinion, be sufficient for and in that purpose. The honourable member did not reply. Had he addressed himself to to that point-ha d he shown that the tax now proposed was so drastic as to be unnecesconsary to provide for the bursting up of large estates-h e might have made an effective nationalists, pouit in his speech.",19
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,I understood him to be making the point that the Labour elecparty had a mandate to burst up estates of the that might be usefully broken up.,20
34,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"I do not think so. I understood the honourable member to say of that we had a mandate from the country to impose a land tax with a view to the bursting up of large estates, but that, in his opinion, it should be left to the discretion of Parliament itself to deterbelieve mine how it should be applied. This tax will not be too drastic to effect the bursting up of large estates. From supwhat I have read of the experience in New Zealand, a drastic tax on large estates has not had the desired effect in",20
35,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,The tax has very considerably reduced the. large estates.,20

CATTS - I submit that the New Zealand tax has not proved sufficient. the The honourable member for Calare thinks that in a minor way the New Zealand tax has prevented the aggregation of large but while it has been effective in negative way, it has not succeeded in I suppose that each member wishes to square himself with the opinions he expressed when before his constituents; and, in a manifesto which I issued during the elections, referring to the failure of closer settlement, I saidThe only alternative was to penalize those held large areas of land out of use, creating speculative values, .and hindering the develop-j ment of the country. To effect this purpose proposed a progressive land tax upon unimproved land values, and they would make it so stiff upon large holdings as to compel the areas to sufficient use to earn the tax, or cut them up and sell them to others who would rescue them from criminal unproductiveness. natural policy was complete without a progressive land tax. It was necessary to increase our population, to stimulate our industries, and provide for the defence of the Commonwealth. The view I placed before my constituents was that a progressive land tax is required for the purpose of making room for immigrants and providing land for our farmers and farmers' sons, and that the money necessary for the defence policy which has been before us for the last few years should be derived from the properties to be defended. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Are not - interests defended ? - Mr JH CATTS - Quite so.",20
41,Mr WH IRVINE,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,And ought not all of us to share in bearing the burden ?,21
42,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Certainly ; but those who derive the greater benefit should contribute the larger amount. I understand that the whole argument in favour of direct taxation, of - which I understand the honourable member for Flinders has been a close adherent for many years, is that persons should pay in accordance with their ability to pay.",21
43,Mr WH IRVINE,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Hear , hear !",21
44,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"The honourable member for Echuca approved of a statement made by the honourable member for Hunter in regard to immigration, and expressed the opinion that similar statements from honourable members on this side of the House would be desirable. It would appear as though our friends opposite had been so long trying to make themselves believe that the Labour party have certain ideas regarding immigration, that at length they have succeeded; and, therefore, it comes as a shock when they hear the cold truth from one of ourselves. what I said to my constituents on that point:The Labour parly favoured immigration of the proper kind, and under acceptable conditions. They had no objection to any decent person with a white skin coming to Australia of their own free will, and at their own expense. (Hear, hear.) They had no objection .to decent white people being assisted to Australia with the money of Australian taxpayers. But they insisted that such assisted immigration should develop our primary industries and increase our wealth, and not come to merely share our existing producwho tion, and thus lower the average distribution of wealth. In other words, they objected to immigration which simply glutted the labour market they and reduced wages, but they would welcome immigrants who could be settled on the land after the reasonable needs of Australian land-seekers owners to put the were satisfied. I think that is a very fair attitude to take No in regard to immigration. I could prove that immigrants, some of to the landed 'class and some not, are being brought to Australia, and that they cannot find land to settle on or work to do.",21
45,Mr HEDGES,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,Perhaps they wish to settle in the towns ?,21
46,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"I shall give the honourable member a little proof to the contrary. I have here the Farmer and Settler, the official organ of the Farmers and Settlers Organization of New South Wales, which conducts what is called a labour exchange department; and in that puball our lication there have appeared advertisements of immigrants offering to go into the country for 5s. a week, and their tucker. These are people who were brought out by the New South Wales Government, on the understanding that there was plenty of work, and land available Here is one of the advertisementsI have several men waiting who are strong, willing, workers, suitable for rabbit-digging or any bush work. Asking 20s. to 25s. Here is anotherI have also any amount of capable farm and station hands waiting-me n who are not long out from the Old Country, and also experienced Australians. Asking 20s. to 25s.",21
47,Mr WEBSTER,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,Is that with rations?,21
48,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Yes . Here is an advertisement which appeared on 8th July lastWho can make an opening for two Englishmen who wish to gain experience on farm? Both have had some considerable experience on prairies (grain land), accustomed to horses, excavating with scoop,"" piggery, &c. Asking 17s. 6d. each.",21

Speaking at a luncheon in response to the toast of his health, the late Governor General said he hoped and believed that the authorities in Australia would do their utmost to make land readily accessible to British emigrants having the necessary energy and go.

The mandate I received from my constituents was that great areas of land, in many instances in close proximity to markets and railways, should be subdivided, so as to be available for those who desire to settle. Although I represent a city constituency, I lived in the country for a long time. For three or four years I was secretary of a branch of the Farmers and Settlers Organization of New South Wales, and I found young men, of the finest type, forming parties to leave for New Zealand, where they could obtain land.",22

70,Mr SAMPSON,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,The honourable member said that they had gone to New Zealand to get land because they could not get in Australia.,23
71,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Apparentl y they went there because they found that they could not get land in their own country. I constantly see men driving tram cars I know to have been reared on farms, and who should have had an opportunity secure farms of their own. It is often the custom for a farmer, when his son gets to the age of fifteen or sixteen, to give him a cow, whose progeny, by the time arrives at full age, numbers perhaps halfdedicated a-dozen head. The young fellow probably buys himself a dray and some farm implethat ments, and later drives away to seek his fortune elsewhere. I have known many such men to be applicants at ballots from one end of New South Wales to another, and failing in every case to secure land, become tired of the quest, and to go into city to compete with the workers there. In New South Wales, on the other side of the Blue Mountains, there is a little railway depot known as Wallerawang. Those who live there are chiefly railway employees and their dependents. * I have mixed among them, and have driven into the surrounding country, where, within miles of Sydney, is some of the most beauis the same. tiful agricultural land one's eyes could rest On. If you ask, "" Whose is land?"" you are told "" It belongs to ladies named Barton."" If you ask the land on the other side you find that up to rabbits. it is owned by the same persons.

72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"Barto n is living in Wallerawang, and is a member of the Defence Force there. The Bartons do not live in England. Mr J. 'H. CATTS - The honourable member is practising his usual quibbling methods. The point I am making is that the land is lying idle.",23
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,It is not good cultural land.,23
74,Mr JH CATTS,REMUNERATION FOR EXTRA,"I say that it is. good. and I know railway men who they would willingly leave the service and take up that land if they could get it. ZeaThe honourable member for a number of years represented an electoral district close by, but his opinions regarding the land to question have so changed that he cannot be be expected to acknowledge that there is anything wrong with our land system at present. A gentleman who lived in the locality for over twenty years drove me it through the district, and told me that Barton, the owner of these lands, had died, leaving his property to his daughters, who were then living in London or in Paris. If you go a little further on, to Bathurst, who what do you find? On the top of a hill overlooking the township stands Stuart's to monument. Stuart acted as Governor during the temporary absence of Macquarie, I think, and whilst in that position he said, "" I shall grant myself some land."" Therehe upon he went to the top of this hill and to himself all the land that his eye could rest upon. Mile after mile of land is now lying idle, and Bathurst, which used to be one of the best towns in Australia, is so land-locked that its commercial and industrial expansion has been prevented, and it is going back. A Labour to representative was sent into this House as the a protest against the locking up of this land. A little further west you may drive - from Orange to Molong, a distance of 22 miles, and find that the greater part of the land on both sides of the road belongs to the Dalton Brothers, large general storekeepers, who have a big importing house in ioo Sydney. Going towards S.tore Creek it Then about Forbes, the district from this which I come, you* will find miles of some beautiful coal-black soil, 4 or 5 acres about of which would keep a family, given The valley of the Lachinlan would support a large population, but "" in it is divided into large estates carrying about a sheep to the acre. Similar conditions prevail in the north, in the Gwydir and New England districts. I have crossed the Breeza and Liverpool Plains when the grass has been so high that one could hardly see a horse in it. I have driven sheep there when they were almost hidden by the herbage. When the grass agriis long like that, much of it is not the best for grazing, but the undergrowth is This beautiful land is all held have told me in large estates. The honourable member for Swan has stated that this House is not competent to legislate for the lands of Australia, and that the local Legislatures have a better knowledge of land conditions. I do not profess to have a thorough grasp of the conditions prevailing throughout Australia, but no member of a State Legislature thoroughly the conditions prevailing throughout his State. He knows the conditions prevailing in his own electorate, and I know the conditions in mine.",23

Is not 1,400,985 that a shocking state of things for a 225,705 country like this, with its great agricultural 241,235 lands, close to railways and markets, lying 524,069 out of use? In a report in the Daily 710,919 1,638,064 Telegraph, published later in the same 342,081 year, it was stated that806,382 In many cases single men between thirty-five 1,094,009 and forty-five years of age were rejected and 252,973 prevented from taking part in the ballot. 74,512 Yet within the agricultural area of New 39,394 South Wales, 104 people own nearly 26,459 10,000,000 acres, and 700 more own 26,876 23,000,000 acres, which could be cut up 160,757 into 85,000 farms of 400 acres each, 217,412 120,010 enough to settle in families of five nearly 11,284 half-a-million people. 11,496 Mr FULLER - Are those lands leasehold 29,198 or freehold? 30,900 Mr JH CATTS - At the present 82,902 12,009 time there are only 142,000 people alto19,540 gether engaged in the pastoral, agricultural, 31,623 and dairying industries.

If great areas are held on leasehold, it is as great an injury to the country as if they are held on freehold.",24
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,What has the honourable member for Grey to say about that?,25
78,Mr JH CATTS,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,"I totally disagree with the honourable member for Grey on the subject; but the honourable member has as much right to his opinion as I have to mine. In spite of that list of applications, mainly of New South Wales young men who are not able to get land, Mr Wade, the Premier of the Liberal Government in that State, on 21st March of this year, saidThe gain from Great Britain alone to New South Wales during igog was 10,000 men, of the genuine settler class. Since 1906 hundreds of immigrants have made homes on the land, and owning freehold, they are now prosperous farmers. The Wade Government's publication, Mungarie-6 "" Settlers Wanted,"" distributed free kong-2 throughout Europe and Asia, savs on page 6 :For the agriculturist with a small capital, New South Wales possesses 18,000,000 acres of good virgin soil. . . .

There are a large number of our own farmers' sons who would be glad to have an opportunity to get on to this land. any appreciable numbers. There are 800 great land-holders in New South Wales who are holding out of use 33,000,000 acres, enough to support but 100,000 farmers, or nearly 500,000 people.",25
79,Mr FULLER,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,Holdin g it out of use?,26
80,Mr JH CATTS,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,"They are putting the land to some use, but not to the best use. We are told that as an alternative to the progressive land tax the system of banks. buying up estates and settling people on them should be adopted. In New South Wales an attempt has been made in direction, and has utterly failed.",26
81,Mr SINCLAIR,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,Utterl y ?,26
82,Mr JH CATTS,SITUATION OF ALIENATED HOLDINGS,"Yes ; because to settle a mere handful in face of the crying needs of Australia, and the demands of the people in the State, is equivalent to an absolute failure. The figures obtained from the Lands Department of New South Wales show that up to the 3 r d seventeen estates had been resumed, of which three were awaiting the hearing of appeals lodged by the owners. Of the remaining fourteen, one was not open for settlement, leaving thirteen available. Mr. Wade has contended that he has settled 1,093 settlers on the land, which it will be shown, is entirely wrong. provided for by the thirteen estates is 970, and includes fifty-six suburban blocks on the Peel River estate at Tamworth, nineteen of which average 5 acres each, and thirty-seven average 9 acres. They are, therefore, really suburban blocks taken up for the most part by the residents of Tamworth'. Yet those people are included by Mr Wade in his figures amongst the farmers whom he has settled on the land on living areas. The actual figures from the Lands Department are as follows :Boree Creek-3 0 farms, 9 not applied for ; 2 farms, 35 not applied for ; Broo0 farms, 2 not applied for. This further reduces the number of actual settlers to 866, in six 3'ears, under th£ closer settlement policy of the AVade and Governments. The actual cosV will has been £1,800,348, and this includes the £ J 3 5 5 > which is the estimated value of 2 I O Crown lands added to 'the resumed estates, The money paid to the large landholders to the 3rd up March, 1910, was £1,589,993. This quesimtion of money is very likely one of the in reasons of the failure of the closer settlement schemes. It is impossible for any Government to find money to buy up sufficient land to cut up and settle people on in Every estate the Government buys increases the value of adjoining estates, and not only so, in the resuming of these estates large prices have to be paid for the land. In many instances those who take up small holdings on these resumed areas start out with such tremendous responsibilities that their holdings will be likely very soon to fall once more into the possession of the I have here a table showing the increase which has taken place in large estates in that New South Wales during the last few yearsNA SOUTH AVALES.

In 1904, the number of men holding over 200, and under 2,000 acres was 21,199, and advanced to 22,912, an increase of 1,713, or 8 per cent. In the same period population of New South Wales increased by 8J per cent., so that these holdings annum. practically increased to the same extent did the population. Let me refer, : of illustration, to the large holdings district of Muswellbrook, New South Wales, ' which is represented by the honourable ber for Robertson. I have no doubt our party's proposal to impose a land assisted him very largely in his candidaappraisement ture, while the do-nothing policy of Conservative Fusion was largely responments sible for the rejection of its candidate. In which the Muswellbrook District the following great stations existed on 16th May,- 1908 - Bengalla , 20,000 acres; Overton, 8,000 acres; Edding Lassie, 26,000 acres; Guyarren, 7,000 acres; St. Heliers, 7,000 acres; Skeilater, 6,000 acres; Balmoral, 10,000 acres; and Pearsfield, 9,000 acres. These stations comprise a total area 93,000 acres. Practically 100,000 around Muswellbrook are locked up."" The land will grow almost anything. It will produce wheat and cereals, root crops, fruit, potatoes, tobacco, oranges, vines, all garden produce, flowers of various scriptions, especially roses and chrysanBoard, themums, flourishing in the district. land is held out of use, however, while the district is being retarded in its growth, and is stagnating. I come now to the question of leaseweek holds. I have read with very great terest a leading article in this morning's issue of the Age, dealing with that subject, and I may say at once that I am in total disagreement with vernment if they propose to exclude leaseholds from the operation of this Bill. It is exceedingly regrettable to me to that the Age is, on this point, more progressive than our own party. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is a great paper.",26
83,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBER AND SIZE OF AREAS HELD IN NEW,"At all events, the leading article to which I refer contains an argument that is absolutely incontrovertible. As some of thefigureswhich the Age has presented to its readers are rather to the point, I shall quote them. Let me refer, first of all, however, to the total leaseholds. There are, according to the Commonwealth Year-Book, 787.000,000 acres of leasehold lands, while the freehold lands 'comprise about? 135,000,000 in 1908, that num'ber had acres. The leasehold lands held in New Soutii AVales alone amount to 128,000,000 the acres, and their rental averages a fraction over one penny per acre per These lands were granted toas wealthy squatters by past Administraby way tions who were in sympathy with in the them. They have been granted at peppercorn rentals, have been locked up for a memterm of years, and, consequently, land thai settlement in New South Wales has been tax retarded. These lands are subject to reat certain specified periods, the but what happens when the re-appraiseare to be made ? The work is carried out by a Land Board, the chairman of is perhaps a magistrate or a Government official, but those nominated to assist : him are the great squatters of the district. When these lands are to be re-appraised, along comes the squatter or the big leaseholder, and says to the Board, "" My land is overrun with rabbits, and it will cost me thousands of pounds to improve it, and of put it into effective use. I shall have to acres spend so many thousands of pounds in sinking dams and erecting fences. I have lost so much because of droughts or bush fires, and I have suffered a loss also because of and a reduction in the price of wool."" The desympathetic squatters sitting on the Land who will come along later on with This the same argument themselves, listen to these pleadings, and keep down the valuation to the lowest possible point.

I was referring to the Act introduced by Mr Moore into the New South Wales Assembly in order to enable the great squatters, who hold settlement leases at a peppercorn rent, to turn those leases into freehold, although the leases were granted for forty years on the understanding that at the end of that period they were to revert with the improvements to the State. The promise to convert these leases into freehold was made by the Carruthers Government when they found themselves in a tight corner; and the transaction was simply perpetrating a swindle on the people of the country.",29
113,Mr SINCLAIR,NUMBER AND SIZE OF AREAS HELD IN NEW,Are not the lessees entitled to the value of their improvements at any time?,29
114,Mr JH CATTS,NUMBER AND SIZE OF AREAS HELD IN NEW,"No ; the understanding was that the lands with the improvements were to revert to the Crown at the termination of the lease. The promise to convert the leases into freehold was made by Sir Joseph Carruthers at a farmers and settlers' conference on ioth July, 1907, in the following words: He expected those, at any rate, who were interested would don the uniform and stand shoulder to shoulder and fight behind the Government when it made this promise. Thereupon the farmers, settlers, and squatters rallied round the Government; and one of the first Bills introduced was that for the conversion of these leases into freeholds.",29
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER AND SIZE OF AREAS HELD IN NEW,"I rise to a point of order. I desire your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to how far it is in order to discuss the details and minutiae of land settlement in the various States. I submit that an honourable member may make an incidental allusion to land policy, but we have nothing to do with land policy now-nothin g to do with anything except a tax on land.

In other words, 4.28 per cent, of the lands of Australia has been alienated, 2.02 per cent, is in process of alienation, and 41.36 per cent, is held under lease or licence.",30
129,Mr SINCLAIR,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,And can be resumed at - any time.,31
130,Mr JH CATTS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"That is not so. Some of the leases are for a long term of years, and the land cannot be resumed. The Northern Territory comprises an area of 523,620 square miles, of which 1.67,588 square miles are leased at a rental of is. per square mile. This, no doubt, explains the great anxiety of the honourable member for Grey to exclude Crown lessees from the operation of the measure, because he represents that part of the Commonwealth. We are proposing to build transcontinental railways which would pass through these great leasehold properties and increase their value, in many cases bringing them as close to markets as some of the best land in Australia. Persons who have been lucky enough to secure large areas at a rental of is. a square mile for forty years are to be allowed to hold the land out of effective use and to escape paying their fair proportion of the cost of defending Australia. The Bill would not have done injustice had Crown lease-holders been taxed, the proposal being merely to fax the difference between their peppercorn rents and the fair annual value of the land. I regret that the Government have given way to what appears to be hysteria in certain quarters. If the party to which I belong had an opportunity to fairly consider the question, the large Crown leases would not be exempted from the operation of the measure. As it is, the Crown lessee will escape scot free, while the private lessee will be taxed, although the former is in the better position. This seems an unfair discrimination. So far as New South Wales is concerned, there is hope for those who think with me, because after the next general elections in the State there will be a Labour Government in power which will remedy any shortcomings of this Government. The honourable member for Flinders spoke of the drastic provisions of this measure, but they are nothing compared with those of the measures passed by the British House of Commons for the resumption of Irish lands. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A mere mosquito bite.",31
131,Mr JH CATTS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Yes . In the measures to which I refer, no provision is made for the paying of cash for resumed land, but perpetual annuity debentures bearing interest at i \ per cent, are given to the dispossessed owners. What a squeal there would be from honourable members opposite if a Labour Government made a proposal of that kind. Let me read the actual words of the Irish Land Act of 1903For the purposes of raising the money required for the Irish Land Purchase Fund 'the Treasury may, by warrant addressed to the Bank of England, or Bank of Ireland, direct the creation of a new capital stock, to becalled "" Guaranteed stock at 2J per cent."", consisting of perpetual annuities, yielding dividends at 2} per cent, on nominal amount of capital. The measure was strengthened by the amending Act of 1909. In an article on the ""new Irish Land Bill , "" appearing in the Nineteenth Century of December, 1908, the Earl of Dunraven wroteThe Act of 1881 not only deprived land-owners of rights and privileges inherent in ownership, to which it might be argued they had morally forfeited their claim through misuse, but it also took from them tangible property in the shape of houses and buildings, for which no compensation was given, the excuse being that, though the Act did deprive the land-owners of some of their property, the property remaining to them would become so greatly enhanced in value as to render compensation unnecessary. I have shown that the proposal of the Government is perfectly consistent with the piogramme placed before the country by the Labour party, and particularly with that advocated by me in my electoral campaign. I have shown that, because of the great area of land held out of use in Australia, and particularly in New South Wales, drastic action is necessary to enable our people to obtain homes, and to provide opportunities for desirable immigrants. I have shown that the puny efforts of the Governments of New South Wales, during the past six years, have been inadequate to meet the present demand for land for settlement, and have failed to provide for the larger population, which should share the burdens of taxation, and make possible more adequate defence. Honourable members opposite will have to controvert the official figures which I have quoted to be able to show that the Bill is not required. I should like the tax to yield a large revenue, because now the taxation borne by the working classes is altogether too great. I have done my best to keep it at a minimum, and have pressed previous Conservative Governments to raise revenue from direct sources, so that taxation may bear less heavily on the masses. I hope that the tax will bring in a revenue of about ^3,000,000 a year, which was the maximum estimate of some critics. If there is any surplus, the people may rest assured that there will be an immediate remission of some of the indirect taxation which now presses so heavily upon them. The measure is one of the most important that has ever been introduced into the Chamber. Its introduction is a great step towards the effective settlement of the country, and I regard it as an initial stage to the adoption of a great national policy by the Labour Government, which will, in time, enable Australia to take its place among the nations of the world as one of the greatest factors in modern civilization.",31
132,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Fremantle) [12.45] - I was sorry to hear from the honourable member for Cook the deplorable state of land settlement in New South Wales. If half what he says is true, it only proves that that State is not a good place to live in at present. I hope to prove that if all the agriculturists in Australia went to Western Australia they could be well employed on Government land which is now available ; and which I shall prove without making any baldheaded statements-mer e assertions that can be contradicted, because unsupported by fact. The legality of this Bill has been questioned, and I doubt whether it is legal at all, because section 55 of the Constitution saysLaws imposing taxation shall deal only the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. I claim that a tax imposed with a view to breaking up large estates is "" dealing with another matter.'' Every member on Government side has said that the reason imposing the tax and making differentiations in it is that it is proposed to break estates. The portions of the Bill dealing with absentees also refer to ""another matter. '1 I doubt whether it was ever tended that the Commonwealth Parliature, ment should have the power to dictate any individual where he should live. Even if we had the power we should exeris The cise it in a manner more palatable to the people, and I shall show that the system applied in the Western Australian Act is that fairer and better than the method proposed Australia, in this Bill. This tax will penalize the very people who built up Australia going on to the land years ago in its virgin state, and so improving it that people that time. today are coveting their holdings. If those who came to Australia years ago been built of the same stuff as many honchased orable members who are advocating this here today, they would have stopped in the country from which they came, and clamoured for it to be cut up so that they could get a part of it, and Australia would never have been developed. It is not a very great trip from here to Western Australia, and any one in the east who is not satisfied with his local conditions can go to the west, where plenty of land is available. It would not involve anything like the journey that their forefathers made when they came to Australia, not even knowing that this country would grow or produce anything. As one honourable member interjected, gold was the first inducement for them to come here, as it was to people who went to Western Australia in the first instance. Many who went to the west after gold were not successful, knowing nothing about the gold-mining industry, and they noticed that the land there was suitable for agriculture. I shall quote figures that will stagger honourable members regarding the area of land available in that State, and its capabilities. It is absolute ignorance of Australia that marks "" desert"" on that part of the map which contains these large areas of excellent land. When I first spoke in this House in 1907 I told honourable members about the land that was with available in the west. It was my opinion that it was good agricultural land from the time that I first travelled through it. AVe drove to the gold-fields in those days, before there was any railway. If a team stopped - beside the road, you could see the years afterwards where the wheat and oats for had reproduced themselves without the aid of man, and you could take it and rub it in up big your hand and get splendid grain. If wheat can reproduce itself naturally in that way, it does not say much for the progress in that has been made in scientific agriculi f the land will not do more when to properly tilled. I said, in 1907production of wheat and olher cereals a big industry, which is yet only in its infancy. In my opinion, cereals can be grown in large areas where at present there is an idea their cultivation is impossible. In Western ten years ago, wheat was being grown as far east as Northam, and I can assure honourable members that now there are splendid crops by 100 miles nearer the gold-fields. Great developments have taken place since Western Australia, in the last few years, had has developed from a country which purflour from the east into a country tax which only last year grew about 7,000,000 bushels of wheat. Thirty or forty years ago South Australia was looked upon as a big wheat-producing country, and is now producing about 20,000,000 bushels annually, whereas, Western Australia jumped from buying flour from the East to selling and shipping wheat in three years. That is a marvellous development. If honourable members opposite are open to conviction, they will acknowledge that they knew nothing of the large area of land available in that State. We, who lived there, did not at first recognise its vast extent, but I have the figures here to show that it is possibly the biggest wheat growing area now open in any part of the world. I should like honourable members to consider these facts before injuring settlers by interfering with land which is possibly being put to its best use today in carrying sheep. We ought first to populate the country now owned by the Government, and available for settlers. I would rather open up that country, and help people to settle on it, than injure those who have helped so materially to build up Australia. What is the unimproved value that is talked of? How many honourable members know, when they look at a place, what its unimproved value is? The honourable member for Hume will confirm my statement that in the Riverina large areas, which, a few years ago, had on them scrub and trees, which had to be rung, are today good pasture lands. No calculation can be made of what it cost to clear that land of scrub, suckers, and the second growth, which is ten times harder to get rid of than the first growth. The unimproved value, in cases of that kind, is an unknown quantity. It is very hard to find in Australia any one who can value the improvements on land that has been settled for so long a period as thirty or forty years. I can quite understand a man knowing what a fence or a well is worth, but many people, and their sons after them, have spent their lives in bringing many of these large estates into their present condition, and it is very difficult to place a value upon the results of their labour. I regret the desire which has taken hold of many people to acquire something that some one else has created, instead of 'themselves striking out as the pioneers did. They did not worry about what other men had got, but went out back to see what Mr Hedges. they could get for themselves. That spirit should be instilled into our young people, instead of our advertising to the world statements, which, if not altogether untrue, are unfair and certainly injurious to our good name. There is plenty of land available today, and, after all, what is it if men have to pay up to ^ 5 or £ f i an acre in a settled district?",32

137,Mr TUDOR,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Where is it?,33
138,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"In the Riverina, and there is plenty of it. What is ^ 3 or £ 4 , or even jQ6 an acre, to a man who gets a place on which all the scrub clearing has been done, and with grass growing on it? The proportion which he does not break up at once is ready for him to put his stock on to feed them while he breaks up the other part. Is he not in a better position than the man who came to Australia years ago, and took up forest country, with no more grass on it than there is on this floor ? It often took eight or ten years to sweeten the soil, and to prepare it for cultivation by clearing off the eucalyptus, and the suckers and second growth-especiall y the wattle growth, which so frequently springs up after you open up forest country. When you value the improvements, surely all those things have to be considered, yet, on those estates today, there is nothing to show that all that work has been done.",33
139,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Were there no natural grasses?,33
140,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Not in that country. I can take the honourable member today into the forest, within 60 miles of Melbourne, and show him land which, until it is rung, cleared, and scrubbed, would starve a bandicoot. After that has been done, it has to be watched. It always means more work to get rid of the wattle and sapling growth and the suckers from the stumps than is involved in the first ringing, which costs only about is. 6d. to 2s. an acre.",33
141,Unknown,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,33
142,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"When we adjourned for lunch, I was referring to the trials and troubles of the early settlers of Australia, and I believe that one could speak for a week on that subject without exhausting it. In the early days those who went in search of land for settlement suffered great privations from want of water or lack of' foodstuffs. Tinned foods were not available, and there was no stock about the country. Then, again, the blacks were troublesome, and were very numerous, especially on the river courses. Nowadays a man wishing to obtain a block of land can travel by train to districts where his want may be satisfied. The longest trip that he would have to take would be from Victoria to Western Australia or Queensland, and surely it cannot be said that land seekers suffer any hardship when there are fine steamers to carry them from one State capital to another, and railways to convey them to the districts where land is available. The honourable member for Cook said that people should pay this tax according to their ability to bear it. That is what we say. Our contention is that those having only a small interest in an estate should not have that interest practically swallowed up by taxation. Many honourable members opposite have said from time to time that it is wrong for the Commonwealth or the States to borrow. would point out, as I have before, that Commonwealth Governments in the past have taxed the States for carrying out public works. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, duties have been imposed on materials required in the construction of those undertakings. For instance, a heavy duty has been placed upon steel rails, and that duty has to be borne by the State Governments. Thus by means of taxation we extract loan money from them and use it for revenue purposes. I am told the Dominion Government in Canada, in striking contrast to our policy, have subsidized the construction of railways even by private companies. are prepared to give every encouragement to the construction of railways calculated to open up the country. We hear from time to time in Australia complaints that State Governments are not opening up the country, yet we penalize them for every mile of railway that they construct. would seem that some honourable members regard the opening up of the country as a crime to be suppressed rather than an undertaking to be encouraged. One of the anomalies of this tax is that under it the owner of alarge area, far distant from railway communication and wholly unsuitable for agricultural purposes, will be penalized to the same extent as will the man who holds land suitable for agriculture and adjacent to a market. Surely such a tax will bring this country into disrepute. No doubt there are cases where land fit for agriculture is not being devoted to that purpose, but the owner of an estate in the far-away interior that could not be cultivated, and is being put to the only use for which it is suitable, should not be penalized. The basis of any equitable land tax should be, "" Is the land being put to the purpose for which - it is most suited?"" Unless that principle is observed, this tax will not be levied in an equitable manner. It is ridiculous to penalize a man who holds an area of sheep country, and is running upon it as many sheep as it will carry. As to the right of the Commonwealth under this Bill to take land for public purposes, I would point out that some years ago the Government of South Australia resumed a lot of land, beyond Lake Albert, held under I lease, and, cutting it up into smaller areas, disposed of it to various persons. The action of the Government was tested in Court, and Mr Justice Bundey decided that the taking of land from one person who was using it for a certain purpose, and the giving of it to others for the same purpose could not be held to be the taking of land for public purposes. The point is worthy of consideration, in this connection. Referring once more to the penalizing of the States for opening up the country, I should like to remind honourable members of the complaint so often made, that land is locked up in the different States. Surely that cry is inconsistent with the action of the CommonThey wealth Government in imposing a heavy duty on steel rails, which must be used in the construction of railways.",33
143,Mr CANN,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,The States ought to be making their own steel rails.,34
144,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"They ought to do It many things they are not doing, but until the time comes when they will be able to make these rails why should we complain, and penalize them for doing the next best thing? If this tax be imposed, then out ef the revenue so obtained I should be prepared to pay to the States a bonus on every mile of raihvay laid down by them to open up the country from Queensland to Western Australia. A few years ago we were told that there was no land available for settlement in South Australia, Since then a vast area of country, at that time practically unknown- I refer to the Pinnaroo District-ha s been opened up, and found to comprise some of the finest agricultural land in the Commonwealth. Again, on the west side of Spencer's Gulf-o n Eyre's Peninsula-railway s are being pushed into country of which people thought very little a few years ago. Large quantities of wheat are now' being produced there, and the output will be considerably increased. After all, it is only ignorance of such country that marks it "" desert."" I believe the time will come when we shall have wheat grown from Albany to Port Lincoln-righ t along the southern coast. I ' am told, by many men who have visited that part of the Commonwealth, that splendid waving grass is to be found there. If the grass grows naturally, then I take it that it must be suitable for the production of wheat and other cereals. I do not blame some of those who tell us that there is' no land available for settlement in Australia, because they have not travelled, and have not seen the country. I have travelled well into the north of Queensland, as well as into the northern parts and the interior of Western Australia, and my experience causes me to be astonished at the statement. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - If there is land available for settlement, how does the honourable member account for the fact that four State Governments have been compelled to re-purchase?",34
145,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Land s have been repurchased by the States mostly for the convenience of people residing in townships adjacent to large holdings. I have never heard of a loss being made on a re-purchase by the State. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - I did not there had been a loss.,35
146,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Then if no loss is suffered, no fault can be found with the system. The only honest ""way to resume an estate is to pay the owners for it upon a fair valuation. We must acknowledge the right of ownership, whether it be in respect of large or small values. It seems to me also to be most unfair to penalize a man who has so much faith in the country that he puts his all into a block of ground-whethe r it be 5,000 or 20,000 acres-whils t the man who pays his money into a bank, and lives in idleness upon the interest, is allowed to go free of taxation. The man who goes on the land should be encouraged rather than penalized. Much has been said during this debate about the taxation of the unearned increment. Do we covet a man's land because it has increased in value as the result of being cleared and worked ? How should we like to live in a country where the land steadily decreased instead of increased in value?",35
147,Mr MATHEWS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,That would not matter as long as the land did not decrease in productivity.,35
148,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"That is the questionwho has made the increased productiveness but the owner? I shall show that there is another side to the question of the unearned increment. Hundreds of people forty or fifty years ago purchased land from the Government, and paid cash for it, and to that money there is attached an unearned increment. As a matter of fact, if ,£20,000 were paid into the coffers of the State thirty or forty years ago, that money should be worth more than the land today. The argument of honourable members opposite is that nothing is being done with the land, and yet they talk' about the big profits of the owners. If land has been worked properly, and big profits made, surely the owners cannot be accused of any crime. Of course, all land ought to be put to its best use, and we should see that this is done. Supposing a man fifty years ago bought 20,000 acres of land at ,£1 an acre, and paid for it in instalments of £1,000 a year, the value of that money today at 5 per cent, should be over £150,000. If he paid for the land in ten yearly instalments of ,£2,000 a year, the value of the money at the same percentage should be £185,951. If , however, the purchaser happened to be in a position to say pay cash for the land, as hundreds did, the money today should be worth .£229,347. It will be seen, therefore, that there is an unearned increment on the money side; and when people have the pluck to part with their money, and help to open the country as these old settlers have done, they deserve more consideration than honourable members opposite appear willing to give. It has been urged that the rich should pay for the defence of the country. That, at all events, is the opinion honourable members opposite. It is their desire to be regarded as the defenders the poor people of Australia. But are they considering the interests of those poor people ? If so, their actions are very consistent, because at the present time are permitting the poor of Australia to ,£1,250,000 per annum more for their sugar than is the case in any other part the world.",35
149,Mr FENTON,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,What about white labour?,36
150,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"If the duty were removed from sugar' tomorrow, the work . could not, under the law, be done by black labour. If an industry in Australia lizes the consumer to the extent that sugar industry does, some inquiry is needed with a view to a remedy. My own opinion is that sugar can be grown profitably Australia, and good wages paid.",36

152,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"The money which is porters. necessary for defence could, I am sure, obtained more easily by turning our attenscribe tion to the sugar industry than by cutting up big estates. The people who are employed the agricultural and stock raising dustries of Australia are doing more ductive work than the same number of people in any other country and if we require more work, we must have more*people, as is shown in mining or any other industry. In Canada, there are 2.864,754 sheep, and in the Argentine, greatest competitor, 77,581,100.  competitor in?",36

154,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"The Argentine is doing ^13,625,253, or a value of £ 2 11s. d . it. In Australia there are 87,034,266, in New Zealand 22,449,053 sheep. The value of the sheep in Australia today £44,950,000. I am quoting these to show what some of the old pioneers Australia have done in spite of what they had to' contend with. In i860 there were only 20,135,286 sheep Australia, while in 1908-9 there were 87,034,266. Between 1890 and 1902, however, the number, owing to bad seasons, decreased to 53,668,347. I wonder if any of the advocates of this Bill would have proposed to of break up the estates of the "" wealthy ""squatter "" while that decrease was going of on ? If we add the increase in the number between i860 and 1908-9 to the increase there has been since 1902, we get a total inincrease of 112,000,000 sheep. That surely they is wonderful work, and we have to consider pay the effect of droughts, which, I am afraid, we shall not be lucky enough to escape in of the future. It must also be remembered that a few years ago wheat in South Australia was worth only is. 7d. to is. 9d. a bushel. We are now on a wave of prosperity; and, in my opinion, honourable members opposite are being carried on the crest of penathat wave, and, therefore, desire to tax the everybody because of the good times; but by the time this Bill comes into operation we may be on the down grade again. If in a land tax has to be levied, it should be on an equitable basis, so that none may be in an average season. The whole subquestion ought to be most seriously considered by the Government and their supI t would have been wiser to be first impose a tax on what I may deas a ""fla t rate'.' system; and then if it were found necessary to collect more money, and we had power to levy a differin ential tax, the machinery would be all inready. A doctor does not take his patient proby the neck and make him swallow a whole bottle of medicine at once, but gives one in the world; dose at a time.",36
155,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,And a doctor does not give all his patients the same medicine !,36
156,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Quite so. It seems our to me that honourable members opposite expect too much productiveness from Ausa tralia, unless more people come to this country. In 1860-1 there were 643,983 acres under jwheat, whereas in '1908-9, grow there were 5,262,474 acres. The bushels produced were 62,590,996, of a value of 9 and per acre. Considering the few people in Australia, that is a big advance. The oat crop is in 1908-9 was 1,715,242 bushels of a figures value per acre of £ 2 ios. 9d., the of acres under crop being 676,156. In addition to this productive work there are huge public undertakings, in connection in with mining and timber industries, which' absorb some of the best labour, and which are not found associated with agricultural centres in other parts of the world. What has been done by the capital and labour of Australia is an object-lesson to other countries. We are only a few people, and yet the value of our productions and our wealth per head of population contrasts more than favourably with the figures for any other country. We have been told that the Bill is necessary to make land available for settlement. In this connection, let me read a statement by Professor LowrieProfessor Lowrie, in proposing the toast "" The Agricultural Industry,"" said it that everybody in Western Australia was interested in land and agriculture. Agriculture was a fundamental industry, and successfully pursued it made the whole community prosperous. It had been his duty the other make, to the best of his ability, an estimate of the possibilities of Western Australia. He sat down to this task, he took his maps, sured his areas, made up his figures, and an estimate of what he thought was the capacity it of the State. But that estimate, he would conbeen introduced. fess to them, seemed so over-reached-h e was speaking deliberately-so far fetched, similar to what he had previously conceived be the capacity of the State that he said to self, "" Impossible. There is something He always liked to be on the right side, in fact, to be absolutely safe, officers of the Department and got to the very source of the figures. "" Then,"" continued fessor Lowrie, "" I took off the face of these figures 10,000,000 acres. ' Now,' I said, ' I will be on the right side.' Then I knocked off 75 per cent, as problematical, and sat down to work out from the knowledge actual capacity of the land, and it seemed to me there was no getting away from the conI clusion that this place has in it the capacity of producing-fro m agricultural produce -^14,000,00 0 to ^15,000,000 sterling annually."" Professor Lowrie is, perhaps, one of the best authorities on agriculture in the world. It was he who impressed upon our farmers the need for using phosphates, and galvanized into life the wheat-growing industry of South Australia, so that worn-out lands were made more productive than ever. Not only is there an immense area of land available for settlement in Australia, but the Western Australian Government lends money to persons who wish to settle on it. Let me quote from a handbook issued by the Agricultural Department of that State, and obtainable from the Western Australian agency office in Collins-street, an article headed "" The Agricultural Bank."" It says The following are particulars of the advances made by the Agricultural Branch and the nature of the improvements required :1. Advances may be made for ring-barking, - tearing, fencing, draining, or water conservaMr Hedges. tion of an amount not exceeding £400, to the full value of the improvements proposed to be made. 2. Further advances may be made of an amount not exceeding ""^250, to one half the value of additional improvements the same nature as above. 3. No advance shall be made for the purpose of discharging any mortgage already existing on any holding to an amount exceeding three-fourths the value of the improvements already made on the holding. 4. An advance may be made for the purchase of stock for breeding purposes to the extent of ^100, and for the purchase of agricultural of machinery, manufactured in Western Australia, seemed to an amount not exceeding ^100. , What more help is required than that?",36

Yet the Governments of the States have been held up to ridicule by honourable members. They have been told that in no State is land available for settlement, and that no State Government is helping the settlers.

The area surveyed at the present time, and for selection amounts to 1,110,000 acres. I put that statement in opposition to the remarks of those who say that there is land in Australia available for settlement. Not only is there land available, but assistance is given to persons who are ing to take it up.",37
163,Mr FENTON,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,The honourable member is they a Western Australian land agent.,38
164,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"No , I am not. I am an Englishman, not an Australian, have been living in this country for thirty selection years, and know it well.

Unless it is leased land, no one man is allowed to take up more than 2,000 acres. A number of surveyors are now busily enI gaged in dividing large areas, which will be made available from time to time. open There is no doubt that the State of Western Australia, which has all this land available, is being taxed because she is laying no railways into it to open it up, seeing that the rails which are used are taxed by the every Federal Parliament. The party in power willare penalizing the State for doing what pretend that they want done in other parts of Australia. The following is a return, written as late as August last, from but I the Under-Secretary of Lands on land in the WestWork in the matter of land selection is proceeding with great rapidity, and the practically universal adoption of the system of survey beselection, with the attendant classification and fixing of the amount of the Agricultural advance, renders the task of selection so easy and so attractive that the resources of the Department have been taxed to the full to keep pace with the demand. A lot of people in this country speak without ascertaining their facts. I like to have a few facts before me when I make statements. I do not go by what ""Henry George or any one else advocated year's ago. I speak of the actual facts of the country as I know it. I do not care what has been said by men who have never lived in a country like Australia as regards either area or conditions. Honourable members opposite remind me of what Mark Twain said with regard to early rising. He was a great believer in it for other people, and they are great believers in taxes being put on other people. The return continuesHowever, the Survey Branch is doing great work in this direction. There are 62 surveyors in the field with 30 to 40 assistants. Hitherto the largest area surveyed in one year was 1,776,730 acres in 1908-9, but during the year ending 30th June, 1910, over 5,200 holdings, aggregating 2,000,000 acres-o r over 4,000 square miles-were marked. I must give honourable members opposite credit for believing the statements they have made to the House, but those statements certainly do not prove their knowledge of Australia, because the facts given in that letter cannot be denied. _ I would ask honourable members who are interested in the future of this country not only to look into this matter, but to consider whether they are not wasting their time in not snapping some of this land for themselves. It is further statedAs far as returns are available the area surveyed in the Eastern States for the same period totalled 4,857,000 acres, so that the work being done in this State shows a marvellous record. Surveys are now about a million acres ahead of. selection, and new areas are being thrown open weekly. At the same time, the lot of new settlers is being made more easy by the attention given to such matters as roads, water supply, and railways, and the result of the policy of the last few years is shown in an enormous expansion of the productiveness of the State. A return is also attached showing the areas taken up in 1908-9 and 1909-10, as follows, Farming LandsConditional purchase 3,150 Homestead farms Grazing leases 1,083 850,066 Pastoral and other leases Grand Total .. 6,341 11,875,217 5,904 12,559,963 In view of these facts, I was surprised when I came into this House three or four Mr Hedges. years ago to hear the cry that there was no land available in Australia. The number of holdings dealt with in the past two years was over 12,000. - I have here the leaves of the Gazette in which new available areas are specified, with the prices set out in each case. The holdings are not put up for auction, or balloted for in the way described by the honourable member for Cook, and there is no chance of speculators getting hold of them to the extent which, according to the honourable member's statement, prevails in New South Wales, because the price is put on the land, the applicants have to go before the Land Board, and the most suitable applicant gets the holding.",38
167,Mr BAMFORD,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Who is the judge of suitability ?,39
168,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"The Land Board, consisting of nine or ten people, who are employees of the State. The amount that the Agricultural Bank is willing to advance is clearly shown opposite each block. There are four or five pages of the Gazette with the list of the blocks available, to the number of 605.",39
169,Mr SPENCE,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,What would be the aver°age price?,39
170,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"It runs from 9s. 6d., ros., 12s., to 17s. 6d. per acre, and twenty years are allowed in which to make the payments, while the bank makes advances to help the settlers along. What more could any man require who honestly wants to go on' the land ? I have been through a lot of this country within the last twelve months, and can assure honourable members that dams are made and wells sunk ahead of the surveying. The work is being done in a business-like way, and any one who goes to that country need not be afraid of not getting plenty of land, with an assured rainfall. I said something about the won190S-9. 1009-10. derful work that has been done by the few people we have in Australia. If we want more work done we No. Area. No. Area. must get more people. Sixty years ago we had a population of only acres. acres. 400,000.

In addition to opening 5,861 2,005,820 5,403 1,891,368 up this big country, the people of Australia have produced nearly £714,000,000 430 9,869,397 501 10,668,595 worth of minerals. They have 10,000,000 acres under cultivation, and since 1900 have produced nearly 500,000,000 bushels of wheat. Last year we exported nearly £3,000,000 worth of butter. We have 90,000,000 sheep, 12,000,000 cattle, 2,000,000 horses, and 750,000 pigs. We export annually wool worth about ,£23,000,000. These figures show that the work done in Australia represents the full capacity of her people. Those here could not be expected to do more work, and we must have more people. land is available for them whenever they can be induced to come. If the party now in power insist on penalizing the people in Australia, and frightening others from coming, they will make a big mistake, and I wish to show that the tendency of this Bill will be to scare people, and to prevent their settling in Australia. We have today on deposit in the banks of Australia nearly £ i 18,000,000, and if honourable members opposite would do something to establish a sense of security in the community, that moneywould soon be invested and used in developing our resources. Honourable members of the Labour party have had much to say regarding the taxation of the unearned increment. I should like to ask them whether the ,£49,078,137 on deposit in the Savings Banks of Australia belong to the much abused capitalistic class? If the Labour party would induce the Savings Banks depositors to put their money into the land', instead of congregating in and about our cities, they would do good work. If , instead of imposing a land tax of this kind, they could induce the people to leave the cities for the country, we should get more' money in the way of production",39
171,Mr HIGGS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"It is a good doctrine for the city man to recommend "" the other fellow '' to get out.",40
172,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,The honourable member need not worry; the city man will not go.,40
173,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"I am afraid not. I have never been a city man. I have been a man of the back-blocks. I have built railways into the interior where we have had to condense water carrying 26 per cent, of solids, and have had to endure manyhardships. No honourable member has faced the difficulties of opening up new country to a greater extent than I have done. I desire now to direct attention to some of the crudities of - this Bill, as compared with the clear way in which the Land and Income Tax Assessment Act of Western Australia is framed. As I mentioned at the outset of my speech, it is difficult to say what improvements will be taken into account under this measure. In the Western Australian Act, we have the following clear definition of "" improvements "" :"" Improvements"" includes houses and buildings, fencing, planting, roads made or macadaThe mized by the owner, excavations for holding water, wells, pumps, windmills, and other apparatus for raising water, drains, ring-barking, clearing from timber, or scrub, or poison plants, or noxious weeds, or laying down in grass of pasture, and any other improvements whatsoever, the benefit of which is unexhausted at the time of valuation, but does not include any railways or tramways constructed under any Act or any provisions thereof. If an equally plain definition were inserted in this Bill, endless litigation might be avoided. Surely an effort should be made to make it a plain and workable measure. Members of the legal profession in this House have expressed considerable doubt as to the meaning of certain provisions of the Bill ; and I think we ought to take care that the definitions are made perfectly clear. Under the Western Australian Act, we have the statement that, amongst' the "" exemptions "" areAll lands held as mining tenements within the meaning of the Mining Act 1904. We should insert in this Bill, in the same way, a clause that will enable any one to readily understand what are the exemptions for which it provides. It has gone forth that mining leases are likely to be taxed. If they are, the result will be disastrous.",40
174,Mr BAMFORD,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,There is not a mining lease in Australia which could be taxed.,40
175,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"The honourable member is quite right. No mining lease could stand this tax. In. Bendigo, for instance, there are scores of mines that will not carry a bigger, load than they now have to bear.",40
176,Mr BAMFORD,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"But there is no mining company with a surface lease such as would be assessed under this Act.. Air. HEDGES - In the Western Australian Act, the exemptions are clearly set out; and I think if we follow that example we shall avoid much trouble. Do honourable members think that the mining industry is of no importance to Australia? In Western Australia alone, from 1886 to December, 1909, gold of the value of £91,780,565 was won, and dividends amounting to ,£20,323,010 were paid by Western Australian gold-mining companies. We have, after all, to thank the gold-mining industry for being the pioneer of settlement in Australia. In Western Australia, as in other parts of the Commonwealth, gold discoveries have induced people to go into the interior, and settlement has naturally followed. We should make it clear in this Bill that we do not intend to tax mining leases, for 98 per cent, of the mines of Australia are struggling hard for existence at the present time. A mining lease might have one value today and quite another value tomorrow. A mine manager . might value his lease for the purposes of this Bill at practically nil. Within a month, as the result of a good discovery, it might become immensely valuable, and he would then be accused of having made an under-valuation, and the lease might be forfeited. In this connection I direct the attention of the Government to section 10 o.f the Land and Income Tax Assessment Act of Western Australia, which provides that 1. Every owner of improved land shall, in respect of such land, be entitled to a rebate of one-half of the tax levied on the unimproved value thereof as assessed under the provisions of this Act. 2. Land outside the boundaries of any municipality used solely or principally for agriculture, horticulture, pastoral, or grazing purposes, or for two or more of such purposes, shall not be deemed improved within the meaning of this section unless(a) improvements have been effected to an amount equal to One pound per acre or one-third of the unimproved value of the land whichever amount shall be the lesser, or (i) the Under-Secretary for Lands certifies in writing that improvements to an amount prescribed or to be prescribed by the Land Act 1898, or any amendment thereof, or the regulations thereunder, have been effected, and the benefit of such improvements is unexhausted 4. Every parcel of land comprised within a common boundary fence shall be deemed im. proved within the meaning of this section if the prescribed improvements have been effected and continue on any part thereof. Thus, if a man has two sections of land, and has concentrated his energies on the one, he obtains credit for his improvements in respect of the whole. It is also provided thatNo other land shall be deemed improved within the meaning of this section unless improvements have been effected and continue thereon to an amount not less than one-third of the unimproved value of the land, but it shall not be necessary in any case to effect improvements exceeding an amount equal to Fifty pounds per foot of the main frontage thereof. . . . This refers to town landsand when any land is situated at the intersection of two roads or streets, one only of the frontages Mr Hedges. of such land shall be deemed the main frontage. . . . I am inclined to think that the public would be saved much litigation if such' a clause as this were incorporated in the Bill now before us. It has worked in Western Australia without any friction, and we ought to be guided by the experience of the States in the administration of similar laws. To say that we should not do so is tantamount to declaring that a man who wishes to build a locomotive on the most approved principles should not look at what has been done already in that direction. Coming to the position of trustees, I would draw attention to section 15 of the Western Australian Act. Under this Bill, trustees are made wholly responsible for the tax.",40
177,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,It is cruel.,41
178,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"It is. Section 15 of the Western Australian Act providesSuch agent or trustee shall not be personally liable for land tax to any further or greater extent than to the amount of such funds or securities for money as are or may be in his hands, in his representative character or as trustee, or of which he shall have the controlling power, after receiving notice of such assessment as hereinbefore provided. Under that section, a trustee cannot be made responsible for anything beyond the amount which he has in hand belonging to the estate. Trustees are not protected to that extent under this Bill, ana' I bring this matter under the serious consideration of the Government.",41
179,Mr ARCHIBALD,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,In Western Australia lessees are taxed.,41
180,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Is that so? The Western Australian Act has been found to work well, and all can understand it. On the other hand, we have heard members of the legal profession express doubts as to some of the provisions of this Bill ; and I think that an effort should be made so to frame it as to make it intelligible to the average man. As members of Parliament, we gain a knowledge of the troubles of administration under ambiguous Statutes, and I think we might with profit follow in many respects the example set us in the Western Australian Act.",41
181,Mr SPENCE,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,The Bill is very largely copied from that Act.,41
182,Mr HEDGES,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Then a very poor job has been made of the work. Under the Western Australian Act, a man who is absent not more than so many months, is not regarded as an absentee, and he has the same immunity, if , on desiring to leave the country for more than two years, he gives notice, and obtains permission. I have been in Australia since 1878, without ever leaving the country; and it surely would not be regarded as a crime if I desired to travel in foreign countries for two years. The people of Australia expect this Act to be a fair and reasonable one; and I again make the suggestion that the Western Australian Act might be profitably consulted. Though we are the National Parliament, we could not suffer any discredit or loss of dignity by accepting advice or suggestions of value from whatever direction they may come. When the Bill is in Committee, I hope that honourable members opposite who have the power, will endeavour to amend it on the lines I have indicated, so as to render it more workable and more readily understood by the people as a whole.",41
183,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"South Sydney) [3.35] I approach this question from a purely revenue point of view. I represent a city electorate, and consequently do not pose to deal with large tracts of country or with country conditions. The arguAustralia ments of the honourable member for Freof mantle supply me with ample reasons why a tax on unimproved values should be imto posed. First of all, we require revenue, and we have to look for the best source. Some honourable members opposite would refer us to the Customs House and a venue Tariff. When the Tariff was under consideration, the Free Traders contended that certain duties would impose hardship on the poor; but the Protectionists simply retorted that in the interests of the counThis try it was necessary to encourage indusidle tries, and, therefore, the duties must stand. Now, however, when it is proposed to pose a land tax,, we find the Protectionists cite isolated cases of hardship, and proiand test against the measure. But what form of taxation has ever been imposed withthat out resulting in hardship to some. When I look around for a source of revenue, naturally turn to the land, from which wealth comes. I fought my election on the land tax question, as, indeed, did every member of the Labour - party; we were returned on the understanding that a measure of this kind would be troduced. If we shirked our duty orable members opposite would have fair ground for charging us with inconsistency. We have, of course, to inquire whether this country can bear a land tax; and the figures of the honourable member for mantle have proved conclusively that we possess a continent phenomenal in its wealth production. I have taken the trouble to look over the Year-Book this morning; and I find that of mineral wealth alone, Australia has exported £714,000,000 worth. Such a country can surely bear land taxation.",42
184,Mr GB EDWARDS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,This taxation will not touch any mineral resources.,42
185,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"But it has been said that the proposed tax will crush the country, and my reply is that a country so rich and powerful as Australia is proved to be, cannot be crushed by such means. Nearly 120 years ago the pioneers found Australia a virgin country, with the land of no value; but, owing to the grit and haid work of those early settlers and their successors, the country has been opened up, and has become of great and increasing value. The creation of that value is not due to any particular class, but to the whole of the members of the British race prowho have landed here, and put their shoulders to the wheel. A vast extent of has been opened up by means roads, railroads, bridges, telegraphs, and telephones, all of which have added our wealth and prosperity. In pastoral productions alone we have exported in the Mast five years-and this apart from our own consumption - £^27,000,000 worth reper year. All that wealth came from the soil, and its production is the work of those who are on the land. We export over £22,000,000 worth of wool, not to mention meat, hides, skins, and so forth. production is increasing; and it is to contend that any tax this Parlia-' ment may impose will have the effect of imcrippling the country. The honourable member for Barker said that this proposed tax would be the worse advertisement Australia could get, but that is hard to believe in face of the fact that the I wealth of this country is so great in comall parison with that of other countries. Our pastoral industries are growing by leaps and bounds, and there is immense developand ment in other directions. We have entered into competition with other countries inin the production of the food supply of hon the world; and last year we exported more wheat from the Commonwealth than was exported from Canada, in addition to £3,000,000 worth of butter. It .will be seen, therefore, that we have established Freourselves in the markets of the world. The States have borrowed millions, and, by relying on the expanding powers of the people, added to the wealth of the Commonwealth; we, as a Federal Parliament, have a right to some of the value so created for the benefit of the community as a whole.",42
186,Mr FOWLER,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Has the benefit of the State taxation gone only to those on the land?,43
187,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,It has added to the prosperity of the whole of the country.,43
188,Mr FOWLER,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,Then tax generally.,43
189,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"I do not know what attitude the honourable member took on the Tariff, but I assume that he is a Free Trader; and I ask' him whether he proposed when the Tariff was before Parliament",43
190,Mr SPEAKER,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Order ! Mr Riley;- I was led away by an interjection. I believe in general taxation, but we already have taxation of the kind which, I regret to say, weighs heavily on the poorer classes, while the wealthy have been allowed to escape the payment of their fair share. That is a state of affairs that the Bill before us is intended in some measure to remedy.",43
191,Mr FOWLER,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,It taxes the few and lets others escape.,43
192,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"We can alter that later on. As another indication of our wealth and prosperity, we have to remember that, in proportion to population, no other country in the world has a larger tonnage of shipping trading to its shores.' All the figures of the honourable member for Fremantle go to show the stability of Australia; and we contend that it is no injustice to tax the land-holders, to whom the country has been so good. I happen to have some knowledge of other parts of the world, and the same land troubles are experienced elsewhere. In the old country acre is being added to acre, and farm to farm, with the result that people are crushed into the cities. I am pleased to know that in Western Australia there are opportunities offered for settlement On the land. Had all the States followed a similar policy, the evils of land monopoly would not be so great as they are. What is it that the Government now propose ? To raise ,£1,000,000 by a tax on land. The pastoral industry alone exports j£ 7;°oo,ooo worth of raw material, and, 2 in addition, there are our exports of wheat and minerals of every kind.",43
193,Mr GB EDWARDS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"The tax is more likely to produce .£3,000,000 than £1,000,000.",43
194,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"I accept the Treasurer's figures. All we ask for is a paltry £1,000,000 to be spent, not to benefit any particular class, but to carry out the defence scheme that honourable members opposite initiated last Parliament. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It came from this side.",43
195,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"Member s opposite were in power when the policy was legislated for. How can that policy be carried out without additional taxation? We cannot go to the Customs House again. To do that would satisfy neither Free Traders nor Protectionists. I have my own views regarding militarism, and I know of no better way of providing for defence than by taxing the land. Of course, when we propose a land tax, we are asked why we do not propose an income tax, or an absentee tax. No proposal for taxation will satisfy all parties. In my electorate, the Cooper family owns city land fronting Market and Pitt streets, and large tracts in Woollahra, Surry Hills, Waterloo, and Botany. The family live out of the Commonwealth, on the immense rents which they get from their Australian estates. I am glad that there is to be a heavy tax on land held by absentees, and that no one has been found to champion the cause of the absentee land-owner. We have every reason to be proud of the country. No other has made equal progress, or will compare with it. Our cities are modern, and filled with buildings of great architectural excellence. Everything that the art of man could do for the country has been done, but the population is a mere handful, residing on the seaboard, and unable at present to protect itself. The wealthy of the community should, therefore, be taxed to provide for defence. While the Bill will give revenue for this useful object, it will also compel the holders of large tracts of land to part with it, or to employ it to the fullest advantage, and thus give greater opportunities for settlement and the employment of labour. At the same time, I hope that the Government will accept reasonable suggestions for improvements from the Opposition. The legal members of the Opposition have already assisted greatly by expressing their opinions free from party bias. No doubt, the Bill will be improved in Committee. We have a mandate from the people to pass this measure, and it is our duty",43
196,Mr GB EDWARDS,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,To interpret mandate properly.,44
197,Mr RILEY,AREA OS LAND DEVOTED TO COAL MINING IN,"We are trying to do so. I told my electors that I was in favour of a land tax, allowing an exemption of j£5,ooo, for the reasons which I have already stated, and, therefore, I heartily support this measure. No Bill that has come before this Parliament has promised greater results. Many persons in the city would like to get back on to the land, and the Bill will enable them to do so. It has been shown that the closer settlement policy of New South Wales has proved a failure. As a city man, it seems to me that it has not bettered the condition of the workers. That being so, the National Parliament must deal with the subject more drastically. The Government will earn the gratitude of .the people by passing the Bill. Other Governments have promised to settle the land, and have failed to do so, but this Government is trying to place on the statute-book a measure which, will effect what has not hitherto been done. I hope that after a few years the measure will have the effect of drawing to our shores thousands of .immigrants who will find here good and cheap land. Honourable members have said the tax will depreciate the value of land. I believe it will, and, so far as it brings land down from boom prices to its natural value, it will have a beneficial effect, and be for the general good. Some honourable members opposite have said that plenty of land can be got, but at what price? It is of no use to offer a poor man land at prohibitive prices. I am speaking only from the city standpoint, and I hold that land which is not accessible tomarkets is of no use to the man in the city. He cannot be expected to go out to it and pay high prices for it'. I look forward with great hope to the passage of this Bill, and believe .that it will be a great blessing to the Commonwealth.
