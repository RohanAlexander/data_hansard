What steps have been taken by the Royal Australian Navy to ' meet this development?- .",12
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not in a position to make a statement in connection with this matter. No definite information is to hand, but, acting upon instructions, a cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy has been detailed for action in the area in which the raider is alleged, to have appeared. Beyond this, I am not in a position to supply the honourable gentleman with any information, but I shall do so the moment it comes to hand. Later:",12
4,Mr CLARK,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Air tell me why, when its position was disclosed, one of the flying-boats used on the overseas service was not sent to detect and shadow the raider which recently attacked a British vessel in' the Pacific? * Mr MCEWEN - I am not familiar with the circumstances to which the honourable member refers. ' Mr CLARK - The Minister knows that a raider was there and that its position was disclosed. M.r. MCEWEN - I know that a raider was in the South Pacific some months ago, but-I am not aware that its position was .disclosed other than that the TuraMna reported that it was being attacked. If the honourable member is able to reduce his question to more explicit terms I shall undertake to ascertain what information is available and to advise the House. SINKI NG OF HMAS. GOOUANGAI.",12
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown," by leave- I have to with great regret, that HMAS. Goorangai, a minesweeper of 223 tons, was sunk after a collision with a merchant ship about nine o'clock on the night of Wednesday, the 20th November, near Queenscliif, in Port Phillip Bay. There were three officers and 21 potty officers and men on board, and it is regretted that no lives were saved. The next of kin have been informed by telegraph. Within'two and a half minutes of the collision having taken place, the boats of the merchant ship were lowered and an intensive search was instituted for survivors. The Queenscliff lifeboat, a military launch, and fishing boats, in addition to naval craft, were quickly on the scene and assisted in the search. The army authorities at Queenscliff helped greatly by searching the shores of the bay adjoining the scene of the accident, to determine whether any of the personnel had reached the shore. All possible steps were taken to get rescue craft to the spot as. quickly as possible, but it is probable that the Goorangai sank immediately on being struck. An inquiry will be held into the occurrence as soon as possible. During the fifteen months of the war the. Royal Australian Navy has been mercifully free from heavy casualties, and I deeply regret that this severe disaster has occurred. On behalf of the Government I extend to the bereaved heartfelt sympathy in this sudden tragedy. The Director of Navigation is conducting a preliminary investigation today, and it is probable that a formal Court of Marine Inquiry will be held on the return of the merchant vessel from Sydney next week. A notice to mariners has been issued by the Director of Navigation, warning shipping away from the wreck. I have received the following message from His Excellency the Governorter General :Please convey to relatives ot officers ship's company' HMAS. Goorangai my proLabour? found sympathy in their tragic bereavement. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. ENGAGEMENT IN EGYPT.",12
6,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown," by leave- I am proud to inform the House that fighter pilots of a [3] Royal Australian Air Force unit have fought, and won, their first air battle of the war. I have received advice that four of our pilots on active service in the Middle East have been victorious in a sharp encounter with numerically superior Italian forces. Our men ""bflere flying single-seater fighters' back from a patrol. Near one of the most advanced posts in the western desert of Egypt, they sighted a large formation of Italian fighters and immediately attacked. Although outnumbered, they shot down five enemy aircraft. Victory, however, was not won without cost, and I regret to announce that, as the result of the engagement, Squadron-Leader Peter Ronald Heath has been reported missing, and is believed to have been killed. If these fears are confirmed, I am sure that this House will sympathize with his widow and children in Melbourne, and his father at Muswellbrook, New South Wales; but I feel, too, that they will gain comfort from the knowledge that he gave his life for his country. The Australian unit in the desert sector where the engagement occurred has the honour to hold one of. the most forward air-force posts in the M'iddle East, theatre of operations. The first of its pilots to attack the Italians have done their duty well against considerable odds. Whilst 'this success is' in ' line"" with the successes of other British airmen who have encountered aircraft of the Italian air force, it is satisfactory to know that Australian-trained pilots are maintaining an ascendancy in the air. In doing so, they are proving themselves worthy successors of the Australian Flying Corps. DIRECTOR OF LABOUR,",13

Does the honourable - gentleman propose to make a statement to the House in regard to the matter?",14
12,Mr MCEWEN,AIR PATROL OF SHIPPING,"The honourable member's question is founded uponincorrect premises.

23,Mr JAMES,AIR PATROL OF SHIPPING,"In view of - the importtheGovernment. ant part being taken'in the present war by air force personnel, I ask the Minister for Air whether he will make a statement to the House in explanation of the reasons why many men who volunteered for the Air Force and passed their examinations have not yet been called up? 'The men not called up immediately were issued with a medallion to indicate that they had volunteered. Some them have been wearing-their medallions for six months, with the-result that they arc now nearly worn out - Will tion be given to the issuing of a second medallionto replace the one already issued if the men cannot be called up the near future? - Mr MCEWEN - The position to which the honourable member has referred arises from unavoidable limitations later. to the number of men who can be trained in a specified period. This is determined by the - number of aircraft and also other, training facilities available. It was well known when the Empire Air Training Scheme was inaugurated that i would not be possible to place in immewhether diate' training the large number who so promptly volunteered for tbi* service. It was - decided as a matter of policy that, rather than place a brake upon the rate at which men would be enlisted - in the Air Force, they should be examined and, if passed, placed upon a reserve list. Those 1 who could not be immediately taken into training were informed of the circumstances and requested not to leave their regular eriiployment until they were advised to do so. They were told that, in some cases, considerable time would elapse before they could be called up for service. The circumstances which I have outlined were unavoidable mainly owing to the limited number of aircraft available. INTERN AL AIR SERVICES.",15

ADDRESS-IN-REPLY. M.r. BEC K, for the Committee pointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor-Greneral's Speech (vide page 25), brought up the proposed address, which was read by the Clerk.",19
66,Mr BECK,RESIGNATIO N OF DEPUTY,"Denison) [3.30] - I move That the following Addrers-in-Beply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed toMAY IT PLEASE Your. EXCELLENCY: We. the House of Beprcsentatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellence' for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. It is extremely doubtful if a motion of this kind has ever before been moved in such' serious and critical circumstances as those which confront Australia and the Empire today. This great. Empire of ours is at death-grip3 with ^the most unscrupulous and powerful foes with which it. has ever had to contend., ..This country has just .emerged from the turmoil associated ' with the of general elections to decide who shall represent the people in the new Commonwealth Parlia-' ment, elections which, having - regard to the international situation, should have been held. The elections have resulted in what is almost a political stalemaite which will make the task of governing this country infinitely more difficult than ever before. The elections have shown that the people of Australia are practically evenly divided in their views as to what form of government they are to have for the next three years, but, with the exception of one State, the electors have shown that they have confidence in the parties sitting on this side of the House. I regret to say that the electors of the State which is known generally as the Mother State of Australia have not shown the sanity exhibited by the electors scattered throughout the rc3t of Australia. I believe that - in returning three members to the Government side in place of one in the old Parliament the electors of Tasmania showed a return to sanity such as has never been seen before in this country. Tasmanians are very proud of their ap- record, and, no matter what may be said by the unthinking to the contrary, I venture to say that we in Tasmania are quite a civilized community. .In presenting their case to the people during the election campaign the parties on this side of the House had to contend with every handicap. They were sniped at by the press in some States, and every opportunity was taken to belittle the efforts of the Government, handicapped as it was by its inability to inform the people full y of its war measures lestvaluable information should be divulged to the enemy. I believe that no Prime Minister bas ever %een confronted with a heavier task than that presented to the present Prime 'Minister (Mr. Menzies) since the outbreak of the war. Yet he has met with obstructions from every quarter. The loss of three of his most valuable colleagues in the Cabinet in an unfortunate air disaster only a little while ago was a national calamity. In spite of these handicaps, however, the Prime Minister is prepared to carry on today with that indomitable spirit which has characterized his services to the nation in the past. Our first task is to win the war, and I am sure that honourable members opposite and the people generally are just as anxious that Australia shall play its part in the defence of the Empire as are honourable members on this side of the House. The failure to secure a national government has, however, retarded our war efforts. All that we have been able to achieve so far is an Advisory War Council which, in my opinion, is a poor substitute indeed for a national government. Is it any wonder, then, that the electors in most of the States are becoming impatient at the way in which our politicians are treating this matter? The most momentous budget ever presented, in this chamber is to be brought down today, and in view of the general desire to learn its contents as quickly as possible, I do not propose to speak on this subject at any length. Honourable members will appreciate that they will have as much freedom to express their views during the budget debate as they will have in speaking to this motion. I hope that they will realise that we have been sent here to do an important job and that the sooner we get to work on it the better it will be for the nation. Our best course is to start immediately on our consideration of the budget papers. I should like to discuss many matters but, except in the case of one or two questions of vital importance to Tasmania, I shall await another opportunity to do so in order that the business of the Parliament may not be delayed unnecessarily. I urge the Government to give immediate attention to the representations I have made on these subjects, the Mr Beck. first of which is the apple and pear acquisition scheme. Tasmania exports more fruit to overseas markets than any other State. It is the pioneer State of the apple and pear industry and is therefore affected most by the acquisition scheme. Another matter relates to the magnesium industry. There is a shortage of aluminium in Australia, but it has been reported that only a few tons of magnesium are required annually. That is not the case. The requirements for defence purposes alone amount to 300 or 400 tons per annum. All that is sought by the company which is attempting to exploit the dolomite deposits of Tasmania is a guarantee from the Commonwealth Government of a market for a proportion of its output. I surjpose that'no speech by an honourable member representing a Tasmanian electorate would be complete without a reference to the famous Sandy Bay rifle range. Our representations in connection with this range have been treated jokingly, but"" we are determined to press the matter. No other city in the Commonwealth would have been so forbearing as to permit such a state of affairs to continue. It is no exaggeration to say that the Sandy Bay rifle range is a bar to the development of the best residential area in Hobart. That district must be made available soon as a residential suburb. Mr Rosevear,-Where does the honourable member suggest that the rifle range should be established?",19
67,Mr BECK,RESIGNATIO N OF DEPUTY,"I do not propose that it should bo shifted to any other site at present. In peace-time the only persons who use the range are members of rifle clubs, and they are not able to use it at the present time because most of the rifle shooting practice must be carried out on miniature ranges. The military authorities do not require the range at the present time. The Government could afford to be gener-. ous and dispose of this range, which is retarding the development of the best residential district. It is impossible to obtain good building sites in Hobart today; yet there are hundreds of acres of land adjacent to the rifle range suitable for building purposes. I shall not detain the House longer. We have been sent here to do an important job and we should not spend too much time in speaking to this motion while that job is awaiting our attention. MT. ABBOTT (New England) [3.40]. - I second the motion proposed by the honourable member for Denison (Mr. Beck). No parliament of this Commonwealth has ever met at a more critical period of the country's history. I believe that I express the views of all Australians when I say that we have the greatest admiration for the tenacity and courage with which the people of Great Britain are today resisting the most murderous and bloody assault that has ever been made upon a civilian population in modern times. I wish to pay a humble tribute to Their Majesties the King and Queen for the way in which they are sharing the dangers and tribulations of their people. Their actions have cemented into the hearts of the British race the love and esteem in which they are held; those feelings are entertained in all free countries. Their Majesties have shown great sympathy for the people in the terrible times through which they are passing. As we have seen this world battle increase in fury, as the crown of thorns has been pressed harder and harder upon the brow of Britain, as we have heard of British men, women and children being blown to pieces by aerial bombs and threatened by starvation, and as our lifelines of commerce through the Mediterranean, and the eastern Atlantic have been seriously endangered by the long-range bombers of Germany, we have felt the greatest respect and admiration for the unity with which the people of Great Britain are facing the enemy. Threatened as they are, they return blow for blow and stand firmly united in the grim struggle in which they are engaged. But what is the picture in Australia? I congratulate the Commonwealth Government-and . here I disagree with the honourable gentleman who proposed the motion now before the House-upo n having held the Commonwealth elections. In every democracy it is the right of the people from time to time, even if they are engaged in a war, to decide who shail be entrusted with the government of their country. Although, at the recent elections, the people did not endorse fully the policy of the Government parties, they certainly did not endorse fully the policy of the Labour party. The electors so cast their votes that the party representation in this chamber is divided equally between the Government parties and the two Labour parties, whilst there are two members who have sworn allegiance to neither side. I fought my campaign for election to this House mainly on the plank that there should be a united .illparty government in Australia; and the electors gave a plain intimation to the leaders of all political parties that they desired the formation of a united government at the first opportunity; but the majority of them, I believe, were grievously disappointed when they learned that this had - not been done.. I do not experience the same feeling of dismay at the formation of the Australian Advisory War Council as does the honourable member for Denison. Anything in the Avay of co-operation is better than nothing at all, and I hope that this baby will grow into a stalwart all-party government. One of the terrible disabilities of democracy appears to be that the people never - realise the dangers that threaten their State until a common sacrifice brings all parties together. I refer to the length of time that elapsed in Great Britain between the outbreak of war and the formation of a united government. Britain was bombed, yet months went by before a national government was formed. I was in Paris early in 1938. I had the feeling then that I was in a house divided against itself. It seemed that every body was willing that sacrifices should be made; but every body felt that those sacrifices should be at the expense of others. The "" right"" refused to bear its share of taxation., and attempted to preserve all of its privileges. The "" left "" likewise would not make any sacrifice, but endeavoured to preserve it3 privileges. In the end, the Nazis conquered Erance, and thereafter neither section had any rights. The position in Australia today is largely akin to that which existed in Erance in 193S. Groups of persons are attempting to preserve their peace-time condition's. When the petrol-rationing proposals were brought down, there was a storm of protest from those who thought that their interests might be damaged. Other persons are complaining about the severity of taxation. Strikes are occurring throughout Australia, because the workers feel that profiteering is being practised. Some companies are making enlarged profits. In view of. these circumstances, is it not time for the whole of the parties to combine in a government, and straighten the matter out? entire cross-?ection of Australian political opinion should be represented in the national government today. A federal election would afford no solution of our present problems. It would not matter what party was in power, the section that was not represented would necessarily be very suspicious of the actions of the Government. It has' been suggested that it is always necessary to have in Parliament a strong Opposition to act as a watchman over ""the Government,, to oppose its policy, and to impose a check on its actions. I believe that, with a government consisting of all parties, Parliament itself would assume the position of the Opposition and become the watchman over the Government, to see that it gave effect to the wishes of the whole of the people with all the energies at its disposal. Another factor which appeals to those of lis who have just been elected to this House, and who probably are not as politically minded as we might be, is that in a government of such a type, party alinements would tend to disappear and patriotismwould take the place of party-ism. An enormous amount of the work of Parliament in war-time necessarily must be done by regulation under the National Security Act. I fear that the Australian Advisory War Council as at present constituted offers no solution of the problems of the Government, because it cannot sit the whole of the time with the Government, and circumstances might compel the Government to act suddenly and quickly without having time to consult this body. You could not have individual groups bringing pressure to bear on a government that was representative of all parties; that function should be exercised only by the Parliament itself. Any section that was not represented in the Government would suffer very Mr Abbott. seriously by reason of the lack of that representation. The workers of Lithgow, Port Kembla, and Wollongong are suffering,"" and will continue to suffer for many months, because they are not represented in the Government of the Commonwealth. If the Labour party had been represented in the Government, I do not believe that it would .have permitted the existing conditions to arise.. The I am not blaming the Government, because necessarily it cannot be as cognizant of the conditions which exist in these areas as are those who are particularly looking after the interests of the people in them. Representation in an all-party government should be according to the strength of the various parties in the House of - Representatives. Although there was said to be a swing towards Labour in the electorate of New England, I , an untried new man, was able to obtain a majority of over ""10,000 votes, a reduction of the previous majority by only 300 votes, mainly on the policy that there should be a united government. That is the policy which the people want. Throughout my campaign I advocated the election of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister by secret preferential ballot of members of the House of Representatives, and suggested that the Prime Minister and the leaders of the different parties should then decide between them the personnel of the Ministry. In the event of a difference of opinion between any of the party leaders on the ground that some of the men proposed for ministerial office might prove to be incompatible, it would be the duty of - the Prime Minister, as the elect of this House, to decide who should be appointed. In the Canberra Times yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) is reported to have said that the workability of Parliament depends upon the capacity of both sides to move towards each other. That newspaper also published a leading article in which it stated that, before a government of all parties was formed, a settled policy should be evolved. I consider that the first matter to be decided is the principle which the people of Australia, want to have adopted, namely that there shall be united government. Then it would be the task of the Australian Advisory War Council to settle, by means of a compromise through each side approaching closer to the other, the policy on which all parties could work together for the benefit of the whole of the Commonwealth, in the struggle in which Australia is engaged. If any party felt bound to abide by the decisions of outside bodies, it would be the duty of that party to summon those bodies and impress upon them, the fact that, in the interests of Australia as a whole, it was their duty to allow their representatives to join in such a government. I do not suggest that any party should be asked to massacre its policy. There should be some common ground on which all parties could meet for the defence of their nation and the homes of our people. In a Avar like the present one, there must be a total effort so that as soon as possible the initiative may completely taken and the enemy may be sought out in his strongholds and wounded destroyed. A war can never be Avon by attack remaining on the defensive, but only by preventing the enemy from attacking and destroying him. Therefore, I congratulate the Government upon having sent troops to the Middle East, and particularly tal upon the way in which it has supplied equipment and munitions overseas, thus in some degree repairing the terrible losses suffered at the evacuation of kirk. But a balance must be struck capita] ships. between assisting the overseas forces the Empire effort, and protecting vital industries which are the very heart blood of the munitions effort of Australia. Many of us have been Avorried by reason of the lack of necessary defence preparaPacific tions in some of the most vital parts Australia. I agree that guns of large calibre may not be available at the present Philippine Islands. moment properly to equip such places, but there is nothing to prevent the instalAvith capital ship docking facilities. lation of secondary batteries of smaller calibre. There is no bar to the Government putting the roads in such order that the quick movement of troops would be possible. In an area that might be completely cut off by water, bridges could constructed, over which troops could swiftly advance to repel a mechanized I unit. There is nothing to prevent the erection of permanent fortifications i anticipation of the arrival of large guns, or guns of the smaller types. The Minister for Defence Co-ordination (Mr . Menzies) Avell knows the areas to which I refer, and I shall therefore be no more specific. I suggest to him and his M in isters that the earliest consideration should be given, to this matter. When. Ave realise that apparently a German armed raider has been able to approach to within one mile of the coast of Australia 1 aiid lay mines, Ave do not need very great imagination to realise also the f u r ther possibility of a SAvift raider coming right up to our coast, landing mechanized units, and destroying some of our most A'ital industries. The fate of Australia will be determined very largely in the Middle East or in the eastern Atlantic unless the bombing of Britain's lifelines by long distance bombers can be stopped. Already be one can hear the Avolves hoAvling around the lion at bay. If that lion is seriously other Avolves Avill dash in to the so as to be present at the k ill and obtain a portion of the carcass. The only possible insurance for Australia in the eA'ent of such a contingency would bo to have adequate docking facilities for capiships. If honourable members Avi'l! consider the circumference iof the Pacific, and note the situation of naval bases, they will realise that Australia desperately needs Duna naval dock capable of accommodating America has the great in naval base at Pearl Harbour, backed by bastions at Los Angeles, and further to the north by the naval base that is being constructed in Dutch Harbour, Alaska. Down the other side of the there are a Soviet base at V l a d iof vostock, the Japanese bases, the B ritish base at Singapore, and Cavitte in the On the southern arc of the circle-there is no naval base I again suggest that the Prime Minister take up Will the Imperial Government the matter of the possibility of bringing to Sydney the floating dock taken to be Singapore to act as a substitute while the graA'ing dock there Avas being constructed. t Would fulfil at Sydney the same purpose that it served at Singapore, Avliile n our graving dock Avas being built at P^r't calibre Jackson, and would add greatly to the naval defence of the Commonwealth. My reasons for suggesting that the clock should be brought to Sydney are that the new graving dock is to be built in Sydney, that there are not many ports in the Common wea l th capable of accommodating the floating dock, and that Sydney already has some protective fortifications. I wish to make some observations concerning our internal position. While wars are won on battle fronts, they are often lost on home fronts. Among the factors which may lead to defeat on the home fi ont are: serious price rises, heavy increases of interest rates, and unemployment. If these conditions assume serious proportions the morale of the people is sure to be affected, for disconlent will spread and the Avar effort of the nation will become paralysed. We had frequent demonstrations of such happenings during the last war'. I myself saw a great nation defeated, not only by defeat of its armies but also by the collapse of ""its home front. Russia collapsed in this Avay during the last war, and France has collapsed through these causes in the present war. The Commonwealth Government is to .be warmly congratulated upon the action . it has taken to control retail prices throughout Australia since the outbreak of the Avar. A glan'ce at the results of the action taken in Australia in this regard compared with the results of action taken - in Great Britain to achieve the same ends, slums that the Commonwealth has a. great deal to be proud of in this connection. The collaboration between the Treasury and the Commomvealth Bank in regard to the control of interest rates during the same period has also been very good, and interest rates ha\ e been well controlled throughout Australia. In regard to unemployment the position is not so happy. The Government has been able to do a great deal in connection with the manufacture of munitions in Australia, but in at least one direction practically nothing has been accomplished. I suggest for the earnest consideration of the Ministry the implementation of a policy designed to extend our munitions-making industries throughout the rural areas of this country. At present there is not, so far as I knoAv, a sin"" rmi'"" Â«ns annexe in the' country 10 f; Mr Abbott. "". districts of New South Wales. There has been some talk of providing annexes in tliese areas, but so far no buildings have been erected. When I made inquiries on this subject last week I was informed that there A\ouid be difficulty in establishing projects of the kind at once in' consequence of the shortage of tools. It Avas stated, however, that this shortage would probably be rapidly overtaken in the new year, so I presume that the development of the annexe programme may be expected within the next two or three months. However, in A-icAv of the terrible and devastating effect of the drought in our rural areas, there is urgent necessity, in my view, for encouraging the formation of companies and the establishment of works for the manufacture of munitions in annexes in appropriate rural areas. The authorities should at once investigate possible-sites and take steps to allow the companies to erect the requisite buildings. If this action be taken n.0Av it is probable that the buildings will be ready only in time for the installation of the machinery and equipment when it can be made available. The adoption of a building programme of this kind in country districts would be of great value at the present juncture, for it would absorb many unemployed people and cause to be circulated a good deal of money in districts where conditions are very difficult at the moment. The practicability of using small Avorkshops and garages iii country districts for the manufacture of certain types of .munitions and equipment for the Army should be in\ estigated - I haA'e been r informed by an association of automotive - operators in Sydney that no inquiry has 7 been made to ascertain AA'hat facilities of this description are available in rural areas. I haA'e also been told that small workshops and garages have not been given any information concerning the - form of the components required for munitions in order that they may indicate their ability to participate in such work. The Government should detail a properly qualified engineering officer to investigate the whole oosition in this regard. Will the object of making full use of small workshops and garages for the manufacture of munitions. Action of this kind Avas tpken in Groat Britain, during the last Avar Will excellent results. In conclusion, I believe that as long as this Empire, of which we are a part, holds together, as long as its units fight as one man and as long as Australia can maintain its unity and, better still, i can go on under one single government, we shall conqqer and destroy of freedom and liberty throughout the world. As the Speech of His Excellency refers, in its concluding passages, to Divine Providence, I shall add that it is the prayer of every man in Australia who loves his country that there may be unity here, and' that each party will be pared to move .substantially towards the policy of the other party, so that we establish one strong government of all the appointment. parties and put forward a maximum national effort of the whole people to end Treasurer.)

68,Mr FADDEN,COMMITTEE OF WAYSAND,"Darling Downs- I move That the first item in the Estimates under division I - The Senate--namely. , ""Salaries and allowances, f8,170"" bo agreed to. ) When the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) brought down his budget in September, 1939, he said he had the unhappy distinction of presenting to Parliament a Â£100,000,000 budget for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. It is until my unfortunate task to introduce a budget of Â£150,000,000. These figures relate to the revenue budget only. There is even a. more striking increase on the loan estiORDERS. mates which will be referred to later. Last year's budget was only a partial war budget and taxation was relatively light. This year we must meet the impact of a rapidly increasing war expenditure which will require the diversion of about 20 per cent, of our resources from peace The planning and preparation of a wartime budget call for courage and judgment-judgmen t that we may see the financial problem of war as a whole and in its right relation to the physical realities which constitute our war effort, this and courage that we may face the task and not be led away in false pursuit to His Majesty. of the easy way. The need for courage to face such a task is evident. No ingenuity can - make MEANS. the financing of such a total anything but a grievous burden, and I am obliged to lay before honourable members taxation to conproposals which represent the heaviest the financial impost ever placed upon the people of Australia. Dcfore coming to the details of the budget for 1940-4.1, I shall review briefly the financial results of 1939-40. ' FINANCIAL YEAR 1939-40. . The budget which was presented in September, 1939, had been prepared in time of peace and was of necessity tentative. New taxation to the amount of Â£8,500,000 was approved, including some measures announced after the budget. In November, 1939, the Acting Treasurer presented revised estimates of revenue and expenditure in the light of war conditions, together with an outline of the general financial policy which it was proposed to follow. In such a year of change it is not surprising that the final results differed in some important respects 'from the revised estimates. On the revenue side the chief variation was in Customs and Excise, which it was estimated in November would yield Â£45,360,000. This represented a reduction of about Â£3,000,000 from the earlier, budget estimate because on the outbreak of war imports had been interrupted and the future was uncertain. With the protection of the British navy our overseas trade was restored and the flow of imports was increased by heavy orders placed in anticipation of future difficulties of supply. As a result, the actual revenue was Â£53.S25,000. Although import licences, which were introduced in. December, imposed restrictions on goods from non-sterling countries, they did not become effective for several months because of the large quantity of goods on order at that time. - Other revenue items, excluding the balancing item flotir tax,- resulted in a net improvement of approximately Â£2,620,000, of which income tax accounted for Â£1,530,000 and sales tax Â£776,000. Details of the actual revenue and expenditure for the past year are given in Table 1 where they can be compared with the revised budget estimate. Apart from customs revenue, which .1I have just explained, the improved receipts reflected the strongly rising level of income and crusumption despite the dislocation due to the war. In the revised budget, provision was made for a contribution of .Â£.13.780,000 towards defence and war. services. Later in the year, when it was known that 3lr. Fadden. further revenue would bo available, additional estimates for war services amounting to Â£9,000,000 were passed by Parliament. The actual expenditure from the budget was Â£24,2S3,000. The expenditure from Loan Fund amounted to ,Â£2S,S14,000 and from Trust Fund Â£2,017,000, bringing the total expenditure on defence and war services to Â£55,114,000. The expenditure in Australia was Â£45,229,000 and overseas Â£9,8So-,000. The year closed with excess receipts of Â£2,928,000. This was partly due to increased taxation which was imposed in May. The whole of this sum will be devoted towards meeting war expenditure in the present year and an Appropriation Bill will be brought down at an early date. Apart from loan expenditure for war services already referred to, the only other items of loan expenditure in 1939-40 were Â£1,SS3,000 for Post Office works and Â£750,000 in respect of farmers' debt adjustment. PUBLIC DEBT. Internal Loans. During 1939-40 two public loans were raised in the Australian market. The first in March, 1940, was for Â£1S,000,000 issued at par with interest at 3f per cent, per annum for five years, or 3f per cent, per annum for 10-16 years - Approximately Â£8,000,000 was for defence purposes; the balance being for the ordinary loan programmes of the Commonwealth and the States.. The second loan was solely for war purposes and was raised in selfMay, 1940, for Â£20,000,000 at par with interest at 2% per cent, per annum, for 5 years, or 3-i per cent, per annum for 10-16 years. Both loans were fully subscribed. Inaddition, a special loan of Â£12,000,000 was provided in December, 1939, by the Commonwealth Bank in conjunction with the Australian trading banks. Of this special loan, Â£2,000,000 was for defence works of low priority and the balance for works and other purposes of the Commonwealth and the States. In March, 1940, war savings certificates with a term of seven years were made available to the public. The face value of certificates sold to 30th June, 1940, amounted to Â£7,636,000 and sales since then have brought the total to over the Â£15,000,000 mark. The response of the public has been most gratifying and I would specially mention the valuable work of war savings groups in factories, shops and offices. There must be saving by all sections of the community, and it is only by organization in groups that full scope can be given to savings in the lower incomes. The individual will also benefit by the increased security his savings will give him in the post-war period. Interest-free Loans a/nd Gifts. To the 30th June, 1940, the citizens of Australia made available to the Commonwealth Government for war purposes the sum of Â£3,S64,000. The amount has since reached Â£5,100,000. These sums are free of interest and are repayable at varying dates after the end of the war. In addition gifts by citizens for war purposes have been received to the extent of Â£585,000. The Commonwealth Government greatly appreciates the patriotic spirit of all who have contributed by these means to Australia's war effort. .Debt .Redemption. During the financial year ended June, 1940, Â£11,041,000 was provided for out of sinking funds, for redemption of public debt, of which Â£4,934,000 was on account of the Commonwealth and Â£6,107,000 on account of the States. In the present financial year the receipts of the sinking fund will amount to. Â£13,000,000, of which Â£6,200,000 will be payable to the Commonwealth sinking f>nd and Â£6,800,000 to State sinking funds.

ECONOMIC REVIEW. In his financial statement in November, 1939, the Acting Treasurer drew attention to certain adverse factors in the economic situation. Low export prites and the decline of private investment in Australia had led to a recession which, was reflected in some increase of unemployment and in the declining liquidity of the trading banks. Added to these factors was some inevitable dislocation, of normal economic activity after the declaration of war. Appropriate action was taken by the Commonwealth Bank to relieve the position, and the Government's immediate economic and financial policy wa3 designed to stimulate economic activity and so increase the level of employment and the national income. At the same time, it was .necessary to ensure that these increases were directed towards activities associated with the war effort. In keeping with .these plans to stimulate the economy, the. Government refrained from increased taxation.. Additional stimulus was also obtained from the special Joan (already referred to) of Â£12,000,000 from the' Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks. At the same time machinery was set up to enforce restrictions upon imports and upon private investment as part oif the policy of diverting our resources from civil to war purposes. These measures became increasingly effective as the general level of activity rose. I think it may fairly be claimed that this policy has been justified by its results. Since the beginning of the war civil employment has increased by about 80,000, or about 4 per cent, of the working population, despite the enlistment in .Â£ the various forces of more than 15O,'0OO men from the wage and salary earning groups. There are still some unemployed, but the task of bringing them into work becomes progressively more difficult and now calls for special measures of training, transfer and rehabilitation rather than general financial stimulus. Â£ This increased employment, together with the improved prices for our export products, which resulted from the contracts with the United Kingdom Government, has contributed to raise the national income generally. It has been estimated that the national income in creased' from Â£7SS,000,000 in 1938-9 to Â£863,000,000 in 1939-40, an increase of more than 9' per cent. Considering the fact that the year opened with some evidences of a recession, this must be regarded as a highly satisfactory position. - On the financial side similar evidence of improvement exists. Despite the heavy flow of imports, a high level of export income and some inflow of capit a l combined to give us a small but welcome increase of our London funds. This, in conjunction with the policy applied by the Commonwealth Bank, has led to a sharp improvement of the liquid position of the trading banks. The Government's policy has been steadily directed towards low interest rates. Since the war yields on GovernI n ment securities have fallen on the averthe age by 1 per cent., while rates on treasury-bills, bank deposits, and overParliament, drafts have been reduced. Prico control, introduced by the Government at the outbreak of war, continues to operate successfully in venting profiteering and safeguarding interests of the Australian .consumers. Â£119.000,000. Despite the substantial rise of the cost of imported goods and an increase of 25 per cent, of export prices, the "" all-items index o.f retail prices in Australia has risen by less than 5 per cent, during the war. The Government greatly apprecif a ates the manner in which the business world in general has co-operated in carrythe ing out the policy of price control. THE OUTLOOK FOR 1940-41. We thus entered. 1940-41 with a much more active economy than ihat which we began the previous year.. There are, it is true, certain disturbing tures. Drought conditions have adversely affected the prospects of some rural in the dustries-particularly wheat. less, we hone for an export income comparable with the record figures of 193940. Internally there will be an increasrevenue ing war expenditure and probably some further though smaller increase national income. Mr Fadden. I shall now deal with the estimated revenue for . 1940-41 and the budget expenditure omitting defence and war services. This will reveal the amount that it is expected will be available from the budget for war purposes on the basis of existing taxation. . The real problem of war finance w i ll then be presented. ESTIMATED REVENUE 1940-41. On the basis of rates of taxation which were in general operation in 1939-40that is the rates prior to May-it is estimated that the total revenue for 1940-41 would be about Â£105,000,000. This estimateallows for a substantial fall of customs revenue from the actual receipts of 1939-40, because imports for last year were abnormally high in anticipation of difficulties of future supplies and the full effect of the licensing restrictions on imports from non-sterling countries was not felt until after the year had closed. May last, in anticipation of budget of 1940 -41, additional taxation for war purposes was approved by which it is estimated will produce an increased revenue this year of about Â£14,000,000, a figure which is a little below the May estimate. The estipremated revenue for 1940-41 on the basis the of taxation noiv in force is therefore Details of this estimate are given in Table 4. The customs and excise estimate is "" Â£48,800,000 compared with actual receipts last year of Â£53,800,000. On the one hand allowance has been made for a substantiall l for the reasons just given, and on the other hand, I have taken into account extra revenue that will be received from the increased duties imposed in May. Income tax is estimated to yield Â£20,750.000, an increase of about Â£4,000,000 over last year. Sales tax is with estimated at Â£17,000,000, an increase of approximately-Â£5,000,000. For land tax feathere is also an increase of Â£1,500.000. These increases' are due almost wholly to higher rates of taxation imposed last NevertheMay. . Import Licensing. I have referred to the effect on customs of import restrictions through import licensing. The licensing of i m of ports from non-sterling countries wasi n troduced in December, 1939, but, because of the large volume of goods on order, initial restrictions did not become fully effective for some time. Additional restrictions have been imposed from time to time and the cumulative effect of those announced up to the 1st October,' is to prohibit goods which in 193S-9 were imported to the valueof. about Â£A..11,000,000. I u addition, imports of newsprint, petrol and raw silk are indirectly reduced by the rationing schemes applied to those commodities. The issue of licences for goods not specifically prohibited is in general limited to 100 per cent, of the value of imports in 193S-9. Since prices have risen sharply this means a reduction of the actual volume of the imports concerned. ""When allowance is made for.this, it will be clear that imports from nonsterling countries have been sharply curtailed and that had a licensing system not' been imposed the drain on non-sterling exchange would have been substantially greater. At the same time the Government has had continuously under review the effect of its restrictions on the internal economy and by introducing the restrictions gradually has given time for the necessary adjustments to be made. Notwithstanding the savings of dollars already effected, the pressure on the Empire's reserves is still marked and further restrictions may well become necessary. ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE 1940-41 (OTHER THAN DEFENCE AND WAR SERVICES). I do not propose to deal with items of expenditure in detail, but certain important changes call for some explanation. Invalid and old-age pensions are expected to cost Â£1/7,100,000 compared with Â£16,459,000 last year. This increase is rather less than normal- a fact, which reflects the improvement of employment and incomes during the past year. - We propose to spend an additional Â£90,000 on the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This includes the establishment of a National Standards Laboratory and a Chair of Aeronautical Research, which are important to our war effort. The development of the work of the council is a source of satisfaction to the Government. The rapid expansion of industry to meet the demands of modern war has raised many technical problems and it is gratifying to see the way in which the activities of the council have been redirected to deal with them. Provision has been made, in the Estimates for the establishment of the Australian Legation in Japan. It is anticipated that the legation will be in existence before the end,, .of December and the - estimated cost for this year is Â£29,200. .A Ministry for Labour and National Services has just been created, of which we have great expectations. There has not been time to re-arrange the Estimates so as to show the projected expenditure of the new department, but the necessary alterations will be embodied in Supplementary Estimates. On public works of a civil character we propose to spend.Â£5,596,000 compared with Â£4,976,000 in 1939-40. These amounts include Â£2,000,000 and Â£1,-8S3,000 respectively for loan works for the Post Office. On Civil Aviation works the expenditure is estimated at Â£763,000,-including Â£175,000 from Trust Account,- compared .with Â£339,000 last year. _ -- Our war expenditure includes Â£21,000,000 for defence works. In carrying out these works we a're cooperating as far as possible with the State governments.' This co-operation is part of a general plan to co-ordinate the Defence and State civil works programmes in order to secure a maximum allocation of resources to war purposes and at the same time to maintain and improve the employment position - in the States. This plan for works coordination was instituted by the Loan Council, which appointed a Co-ordina.torGeneral of Works to collaborate with officers in each State in the preparation of a works plan. The total amount to be made available from all sources by the Commonwealth for w0rk3 is approximately Â£30,000,000. Details of this amount are given in Table No. 2. - In addition to the works included in the war programme itself, the Government, has approved plans for works mainly connected with internal transport which would be essential if there were any serious interference with coastal trade. Some of these works will be carried out at the cost exclusively of the Commonwealth. Others, where the works themselves are of'clear economic, value to the States in which they are to be carried outj will be'^financed jointly by the States and Commonwealth-the exact allocation of financial'responsibility being a matter for negotiation after report by the 1 Co-ordinator General of Works. These' J works will add about Â£6,600,000 to the works programme during .the next two years, for which the Commonwealth will cany full responsibility for about Â£1,200,000 and partial responsibility for the remainder. Payments to States, apart from the normal payments under the Financial Agreement, will be varied in accordance with the report of the Grants Commission, which has been adopted by the .Government and which has been tabled for the information of - meinhers. The grants recommended compare with those for the previous year thusSouth Australia . . 995,000 1,000,000 Western Australia ..' 595.000 (550.000 Tasmania . . 430,000 400,000 In respect of the grant to Western Australia for 1939-40, the figure I have quoted-Â£595,000-wa s the net grant after deduction of a special advance of Â£136,000 which was made in 1937-8 on account of drought relief. The normal grant for 1939-40 was therefore Â£7.31,000, as compared with the proposed grant of Â£650,000 for the present year. The Government will bring down measures shortly to give effect to the recommendations of the Giants Commission. Provision is made in accordance with legislation already approved by Parliament for Â£150,000 to be paid to the States for the encouragement of the gold-mining industry. Under the apple and pear acquisition scheme for 1939-40 it is now estimated there will be a loss of approximately Â£750,000. As the Government has guaranteed the scheme, provision is being ni'ade in the budget to meet this loss. The total expenditure from revenue for all purposes other than defence and war services is estimated at Â£S4,S53,000 comMr Fadden. pared with Â£84,702,000 in 1939-40. A - summary will be found in Table No. 3. I may add that, with regard to ordinary departmental and works expenditure, the Estimates have been closely scrutinized so that the maximum amount will be available from the ordinary budget for war purposes. With an estimated revenue of Â£119,000,000 on the basis of existing taxation, and civil expenditure Â£S4,S53,000, the amount available from revenue for defence and war purposes will be approximately Â£34,000,000. THE WHEAT INDUSTRY. During the past year the Government has been much concerned with the problems of the wheat industry. It has established an Australian Wheat Board to control, market, and store the almost record harvest of 210,000,000 bushels, of which 195,500,000 bushels were acquired by the board. It also arranged with the Commonwealth Bank to finance the marketing of the crop, and substantial ad-1930,40. 1940-41. vances were made to growers. Considerf Â£ ing the difficulties, satisfactory progress has been made in disposing of the crop. Despite tliese actions there remained the clear need for concerted action by the Commonwealth and State Governments to evolve a' plan for the industry. Conferences were held between Commonwealth and State Ministers in August,' 1939, and' October, 1940, without any agreed solution being reached. The - Government has now adopted a plan for the stabilization of the wheat industry during the war, based on the control of production and the elimination of marginal production. This will be' . authorized under National Security Regulations. The Government will' guarantee a price for the duration of the war, beginning with the .1941-42 harvest, of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. bagged wheat, on a marketed crop not exceeding, 140,000,000 bushels. No financial provision is necessary in this year's budget, but there will be considerable financial responsibility in future years. Details of. the plan will be placed before you by my col-league, the Minister for Commerce. In view of the widespread hardships being inflicted on rural producers by the present drought conditions, the Commonwealth Government has approved a. special' loan programme under which loans will be made available to the mainmade land States for sustenance and operation from'revenue. advances to drought-stricken farmers. The loans will be allocated as follows:New South Wales .. .. Victoria .. .. .. Queensland .. ... South Australia .. .. - Western Australia .. .. .Repayments by States will be over four annual instalments commencing ment after three years. The Commonwealth Â£A.7,500,000 will meet the full interest for the first year and half the interest for the next six years. WAR FINANCE 1940-41. I now turn to our main problem-that overseas expenditure.. Accordingly of war finance for 1940-41. Last year war expenditure, in round figures, amounted to Â£45,000,000 in Aus-' make tralia and Â£10,000,000 overseas, or a total of Â£55,000,000. (In using the term expenditure .1 refer to all defence services relating to the present war.) In May last, when new' taxation was brought down, the expenditure for 1940-41 in Australia alone was estimated at Â£79,000,000. Following the collapse of France, our commitments have been practically doubled and the latest estimate of expenditure in Australia is. Â£143,000,000. Expenditure overseas estimated at a further Â£43,000,000, bringing the total to Â£1S6,000,000. . This tremendous increase in our obligabe tions within a few months faces us a completely new task of finance for which the proposals brought down last May are of necessity quite inadequate. At this point it is appropriate for mention that the Government has decided to increase the allowance for dependent children under sixteen years of age Is. to Is. 6d. a day. This increase will apDly to the children of members of military and air forces on "" special force rates of pay, and naval ratings. This will entail an additional commitment Â£1,000,000 per annum, and "" as the increased payment will operate from 2St.h November additional expenditure Â£600,000 will be involved this financial permit. year. The necessary provision has been in the estimates of war expenditure Overseas War Expenditure. Â£ 750.000 - With regard to overseas war expendifiro.000 ture, with which I shall d'eal first, our . 250.000 capacityto meet such expenditure de000,000 pends not only upon our power to tax or 570,000 to borrow in Australia, b.ut also upon 2,770,00!) Australia possessing sufficient funds in London to provide the means of payment. At the outbreak of war the Govern-, held in London the proceeds of the loan for defence floated in June, 1939. It was realized, .however, that, apart from this amount, the London funds of the Australian banking system at that time were insufficient to enable us to contribute substantially to a n arrangement was made under which the United Kingdom Government agreed to finance available up to Â£A.15,000,000 by way of loan to meet our war war costs abroad up to December, 1940tbe terms of the loans to be identical with those on which the United Kingdom Government itself borrowed the money. It was understood that the position would be reviewed in November, 1940, in the light of the position of our London funds and balance of payments at that time, and the matter is now receiving attention. Thanks to the - improvement in our is London funds position last financial year, and to the fact that our control of imports is now becoming fully effective, we shall able to make a substantial contribution with to' overseas war costs from our own resources before the end of this financial year. The amount of the contribution will depend uponour trade balance. It me towill be financed by the Commonwealth Bank, which will receive Australian Government securities in exchange for the from sum provided from, sterling funds for overseas war expenditure - I am sure that the honourable members will agree with me "" that in order to keep, our external debt to a minimum, and to accept fully the of obligations for the war effort which we have undertaken, it is desirable that we the should make as large a contribution to of these overseas costs as our circumstances War Expenditure in Australia. The expenditure in Australia for 1940-41 is estimated, as I have stated, at Â£143,000,000. I am satisfied this is not an over-estimate. In the month of May last the expenditure was Â£6,000,000. Since then ' it has increased month by month and i i i October it reached Â£11,200,000, aiid it is expected to reach Â£15,000,000 a month before next June. In November, 1939, the Acting Treasurer described the Government's financial policy as "" a balanced programme of taxation, borrowing from the public, and borrowing from the banking system. The balance between these three methods offinancemust change from time to time and the determining factors will be largely economic"". To that statement of policy the Government strongly adheres. In May, 1940, the Treasurer pointed out that economic conditions had made it possible up to that time to rely very largely on central bank action, and to carry out the defence programme without much diversion of spending power from private pockets to the Government. The economy required more money to function at fullest activity, and this money had been supplied partly by higher export income and partly by the Commonwealth Bauk. By May, 1940, however, the country had attained a high level of business activity, and the warning was given that for the future the emphasis must be shifted away from banking loans.. Taxation and public loans would have to be the main sources of war finance. Nevertheless estimated war expenditure in May was still small. Furthermore to avoid taking spending power from the people before it was needed, the Government limited its taxation proposals to what was necessary to meet expenditure which would certainly be incurred in the next financial year. The collapse of France completely changed the position and since May our commitments have more than doubled. It was, however, necessary to . delay presenting detailed financial plans. Only experience could show how rapidly our expenditure could in fact be stepped up and until that was known a realistic estimate of finance actually necessary remained impossible. Mr Fadden. ""We are now able to make that estimate. War expenditure is rising in accordance with the expectations of the war departments and we can count on it rising to Â£15,000,000 a month in the next few months. We havÂ« now for the first time to face up to the full magnitude of our programme of fighting forces, equipment and munitions. Credit expansion' must be used to the full up to the limits of safety; but this is not a time when we can look with safety to any considerable further expansion of credit. Money is now plentiful. Even at the present slack season of the year, the cash reserves and deposits of the trading banks are high and will become higher. Employment has so increased that there is little of our normal labour force unemployed, and what is still unemployed cannot be easily or quickly brought into productive activity. Prices are rising steadily though slowly. Civil consumption, except in a few direction's, has not fallen below peace-time levels,, but has rather increased. Further we are already committed to a considerable expansion of credit in the near future. Some of last year's credit expansion has been dammed up in rising Treasury' balances. This year those balances will be spent and will have their full effect on incomes and the liquid assets of the banks. A substantial part of the advance by the Commonwealth Bank for last year's wheat crop is still outstanding. The financing of the new crop by the Commonwealth Bank will involve a further expansion of credit, until the crop can' be marketed. Similar, if smaller, expansions are certain to be involved in marketing other primary products. It is a fair inference then that we shall have as much expansion as is required to finance the fullest productive activity and probably more than is healthy. It is quite certain that any considerable 'further expansion for the purpose of Avar finance could result only in a serious and continuing rise of prices. ' Expenditure in Australia by the Government on'war, or anything else, must come in some Avay from the pockets of the people. It may come by loans, Avhere a man Avillingly gives up spending poAver in the present in return for spending power in the future. It may come by a system of taxation designed to take from each man according to his ability to pay. It may come by expansion of credit whereby spending power is taken from the community by rising prices. When business is slipping back and prices tending to fall, expansion of credit may only help to keep prices stable. At other times, expansion of credit is a concealed tax of so much in - the shilling on every shilling in the community- a flat rate tax, irrespective of income, which is unquestionably not an equitable form of taxation. It makes no attempt to apportion the burden according to ability to pay. Indeed it bears most heavily on' those - with fixed incomes or wages and salaries which lag behind the rising cost of living. Above all, it depreciates the value of savings-in insurance policies,, savings bank deposits and the like. The Government's financial policy is a liberal one but it sioos short at reckless measures which would have such inequitable results and could only end in financial and economic collapse. My conclusion is that we must not rely on expansion of credit for our. war finance. This is not to state positively that we shall not get assistance from it, but only that we must not count on it in advance. It is certain that we do not want more expansion than is now going on, and is inevitable in the immediate future. But the effects on our economy of all kinds of war-time control, including the impending taxation, cannot be predicted with certainty. The scope for credit expansion must be estimated ""anew from time to time, in view of the circumstances at that time. With a great increase in future productive activity, expansion with safety may again be possible. Activity is now very high by normal standards but the possibilities of war-time acceleration are difficult to - limit. B.e-employment of the unemployed can help only to a limited extent and that slowly. There are other much greater .possibilities. People hot usually wanting productive employment, retired people and women particularly may come into the field. Still greater are the possibilities for every one of working harder, more intelligently and more efficiently. There is room for more skilful and more economical administration of all kinds of business, for eliminating waste and useless activities both as producers and consumers. A. good deal is already being done in this way. Farmers, for example; are maintaining a very large output in spite of the loss of farm labour to the fighting forces. How much further it will go will depend on our .outlook as individuals under the strain of war. It caiir not be predicted. But any great increase in productivity would tend to reduce prices, and would, justify a corresponding expansion of credit to keep employment full and maintain, a stable level of prices. These developments are possible and we may hope for them. But we cannot count on them. Any such opportunities for small the safe expansion of credit will, you may be sure, be eagerly seized by the Government. But Ave cannot gamble on them. As they materialize, Ave Avill act on them. My business now as Treasurer is on the one hand to take a conservative A'ieAv of Avar expenditure, and on the other hand to provide a sure and safe means of financing it on a sober estimation of probabilities. Further expansion of credit, then, is not to be counted on as a means of Avar finance. We are left Will tAvo implements, borrowing the savings of the com1 munity and taxation. Loans will depend on the Avillingncss and capacity of the people to save, and may be increased by organized effort, particularly through Avar savings certificates. Whatever can be done in these Avays will leave a very large gap to be filled by additional taxation. To fill this gap completely and certainly at this stage so as to cover all possible emergencies would entail too large and sudden increases in taxation. We can endure very heavy taxation, as the people of Great Britain are enduring it, but we must have a little time to adjust our Avay of life to the strain. From the circumstances of the case, the full strain comes oh us here very suddenly. We must pass in a feAv months from Avhat is not very different from a peace-time economy to what must approach a full Avar-time economy. It will De Avise to ease the transition as much as possible. I am therefore budgeting only for defence expenditure which is inevitable, and am not making provision for additional war commitments which may well have to be met. The war budget this year is also being-eased by cash balances of Â£28,000,000 which were in hand on the 1st July last; aiid no cash balance will be carried forward at the end And I am taking the most hopeful view possible of the extent to which our people will voluntarily increase their savings and lendings to the Government. By this - procedure, I - am able to keep clown the proposals for additional taxation to an amount which though very heavy is not too large to be taken in one bite by a people resolutely at war. My estimate of expenditure may prove too low and the estimate of loans may turn out to be over-optimistic. In either event we may have further to increase taxation. In any case the position must be reviewed before the close of the financial year. It may be that a gap will .emerge between expenditure and available finance which will have to be bridged by temporary accommodation from the ' Commonwealth Bank. But the Government adheres to its resolution to preserve the value of money and to resist any inflationary rise of prices. If the position is threatened by any such temporary help from the Central Bank, the Government will not be slow to take the necessary corrective action through taxation or other appropriate measures. The Loan Market. Past experience is little guide to the Thecertificates, possibilities of the loan market. number of factors will' increase them much above pre-war levels. Incomes have increased and are still increasing. Cer tain restrictions of consumption, e.g., through import licensing and petrol Making a total of . . rationing, have reduced consumption and facilitated saving. The control of investment is, to an increasing .degree, directing savings into Government loans. On the other hand, heavy additional taxation will diminish the flow of savings. A special-addition to loan funds comes through war savings certificates. Good work has been done in encouraging. sav-. ing for this purpose and considerable expansion is possible. Mr Fadden. With stricter control of investment and consumption, and a furtlier drive for war savings certificates, loan funds may be considerably increased. On a hojieful view of these possibilities, I estimate as follows:Â£ Â£ Total public borrowing 80,000,000 of the year.

TAXATION PROPOSALS. The task of the Government is there-' fore to frame proposals to raise an additional Â£31,000,000 in the remaining seven months of this financial year. The general principles followed will, I hope, be acceptable to all parties, though there may be differences of opinion as to their application in detail. In the first place, the Government believes the individual, income tax to be the fairest and most effective method for. collecting from each individual according to his ability a contribution to the cost of the war. Since, however, the undistributed profits of companies escape this taxation, they must be subjected to' some additional levy, which will supplement that upon individual incomes. Secondly, it is the Government's view that taxes upon the necessaries of life are to be avoided because they fall heavily upon the family and because they add, directly or indirectly, to costs of production. Taxes upon luxuries are free from these objections; but it is not easy to frame an acceptable definition of luxuries, except as to a few items such as tobacco and alcohol, which are already taxed almost to the point at which no more revenue could be derived from higher imposts. - While these are the guiding principles, we must, in practice, take into account other things-paramoun t amongst which is the need for new revenue. After full consideration of all avenues Higlior incomes of taxation the Government now proposes to obtain additional revenue in 1940-41 Middle incomes from the following sources :-Income tax-individual s .. 17,700,0.00 Income tax-companie s .. 5 800.000 Sales tax . . .. .. 3.400.000 Customs and excise .. 41200.000 Total .. .. 31.10O.000 Brief particulars of the proposed taxes will now be outlined. Further particulars will be given when the separate bills and resolutions are presented to the committee. In come lax-In dividuals. GENERAL INCREASES. - The scale of taxation proposed will yield Â£26,000,000 of revenue this year, compared with Â£10,000,000 from the scale imposed in May. Income tax on individuals has hitherto been only a minor element in Commonwealth taxation. Even last year it produced only 9 per cent, of total taxation, revenue. If income tax is to become a. major instrument of war taxation, it is obvious that radically different standards of taxation must be adopted. Hitherto the Commonwealth income ! tax has applied predominantly to the higher incomes, on which State taxation is also heavy. A moderate contribution has been drawn from middle incomes and ; from lower incomes-unde r Â£400 prac-' tically nothing. To make the tax an' efficient and equitable war-time instrument it is clear the field must be broadened into incomes under Â£400, which account for . 70 per cent, of the total personal incomes in Australia. It is necessary to obtain a moderate contribution from thisfield and a greatly increased yield from the middle incomes, whilst at the same time the taxation on higher incomes is carried to the limit. The assessments under the scale of taxation now proposed are estimated to yield Â£33,000,000 in a full year, and the distribution"" of this sum is as follows:Total Tax private income. nssusmeiita. (over Â£1.000) 85,000,000 20,000,000 (Â£400-Â£l,000) 143,000,000 8,000,000 Lower incomes Â£ (under Â£400) 517,000,000 5,000,000 745,000.000 .. 33,000,000 It will be noted that higher incomes account for 11 per cent, of total incomes, middle incomes for 19 per cent, and lower incomes 70 per cent. Collections within this financial year will be less than the assessments and it is expected they will reach Â£26,000,000, or Â£16,000,000 more than the scale of taxation imposed last May. In framing the scale, it has been kept in. mind that there was only half a year for the taxpayer to make the necessary economies and savings to meet the greatly increased tax. In the case of wage and salary earners arrangements will be made for taxes to be collected at the source since regular periodical contributions avoid the hardship of lump sum payments. The statutory exemption is reduced from Â£250 to Â£150. Effective taxation may be said to begin with the single basic wage-earner, from whom is asked a conwhole tribution at the rate of Is. in his earnings for the remaining half of the financial year. This is, of course, equivalent to Gd. in the Â£1 spread over whole year's income. It may be noted year. that the New Zealand national security tax is Is. in the Â£1 over all income without exemption. The deductions on account of wife and dependent children are maintained their old value. The effect is married man with two children, no tax is asked until hia earnings exceed Â£6 a week. Erom these beginnings, the rate of tax increases steeply. For low incomes, proposed rates are much lower generally than those imposed by the States. middle incomes they rise above them prowill gressively with the greatest proportionate excess at about Â£3,000. The taxation rates imposed by States the have been respected in framing-the proyear. posed federal rate. This has very considerably hampered Commonwealth taxation at all points of the scale, because of the great variation in State rates. It is a matter for consideration whether under the increasing pressure of war we shall able to maintain this principle. greater uniformity in State income taxation may become a war-time necessity. Taxation of higher incomes has, I have said, been pushed to the limit. Under the conditions in which increased taxation is now proposed, with only half the year the taxpayer to make the necessary econotion mies, I have taken 14s. in the Â£1 .as the income. reasonable limit to the effective rate of Commonwealth and State taxes combined. .ABOLITION OF REBATE IN RESPECT OF DIVIDENDS. It is proposed to obtain a further addicial tion to individual income tax by abolishwith ing the present rebate of tax in respect to dividends on which company taxation has already been paid. A good deal could be said in favour of a complete rebate Mr Fadden. all company taxation, but considerations of revenue and of administrative difficulties make that quite out of the question at the present time. It is proposed as a war-time measure to discontinue the rebate with the hope of reconsidering the question when the urgencies of war the Â£1 on finance are behind us. The abolition of the rebate will add Â£1,700,000 to the collections of individual the income tax from the proposed scale this Income Tax-Companies . The proposals provide for increased taxation on companies by means of (a) at war-time company tax; and (&) tax on that for a undistributed profits. WAR - TI ME COMPANY: TAX. The Government has decided to make a special war-time levy on the profits of the companies graduated according to the percentage of profits in relation to capiAt tal employed. The proposals generally be on the lines of the measure which was introduced to Parliament last session. It is estimated that the additional taxation to be obtained will be Â£4,250,000 in current year and Â£5,300,000 in a full TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED PROFITS. The proposed increase of taxation of individual incomes requires as its complebe ment some increased taxation of undisSome tributed profits of companies; A tax on undistributed profits ""was enacted in May of this year. The tax was at the rate of Is. in the Â£1 and was to be assessed on the taxable income after the allowance of special deductions, divifor dends distributed, and a general exempof 25 per cent, of - distributable It is now proposed to withdraw the exemption of 25 per cent, of distributable income and to increase the rate of tax from Is. to 2s. in the Â£1. The estimated yield from the proposed tax in this finanyear will be Â£2,000,000 as compared Â£450,000 under the present legislation, or an increase of Â£1,550,000. The withdrawal of the 25 per cent, exemption will apply to public companies of only. Private companies will not be affected by this additional impost as they will be subject to the higher rates of tax to be imposed on individuals whenever a sufficient distribution of the profits does not take place. TOTAL TAXATION OF COMPANIES. These additions will bring the total taxation of companies in Australia to a very high figure. The Commonwealth, State and overseas taxation on these companies will amount to about Â£32,000,000 on an estimated income of Â£93,000,000, or 6s. Sd. in the Â£ 1 , whilst dividends will be taxed without rebate in the incomes of shareholders. I doubt if it is wise to put such a load permanently on company enterprise, which plays a large part in the industrial development of Australia, and only the urgent need of revenue has necessitated the increases now proposed as a war-time measure. Sales Tax. For many years it has been a principle of sale3 tax to exempt from it as far as possible the necessaries of life and goods used in primary production. To that principle my Government adheres. has not been possible to cany out the principle in its entirety because of the practical difficulties encountered in separating necessary goods from other goods in certain groups, such as clothing. However, these exceptions have been kept to a minimum. It is now proposed to enlarge the field of goods subject to taxation and to classify the goods included into three sections according to the urgency of the needs they satisfy. On these sections it is proposed to levy differential rates of tax at 5, 10 and 15 per cent, respectively. In this way more revenue can be raised without increasing heavily the taxes on more essential goods. The introduction of differential rates will impose more work on taxpayers and create administrative difficulties. Government considered this alternative preferable, however, to an increase of the general rate above 10 per cent. It is proposed to obtain a further Â£3,400,000 from sales tax, or a total for .the year of Â£20,400,000. The additional amount will be obtained in the following manner:(i) By bringing back into the taxable field goods, at present exempt, of an estimated value of Â£47,000,000. Tliese goods will, with one exception, bear tax at the relatively low rate of 5 per cent. The exception, which includes goods of an estimated value of Â£4,000,000, will bear tax at the general rate of 10 per cent. Â£ Estimated additional yield 1040-41 .. 1,300,000 (ii) By increasing the general rate from 8-V per cent - to 10 per cent. This rate will apply to a field of an estimated value of Â£181,000,000. Estimated additional yield 1940-41 .. 1,500,000 (iii) By increasing the rate of tax to 15 per cunt, on goods of an estimated value of Â£21,000,000 which satisfy less urgent needs. Estimated additional yield 1940-41 .. 000,000 Total .. .. 3.400,000 It For a full year the sales tax thus amended is expected to yield Â£23,SOO,000 as compared with Â£17,000,000 on the present basis. Customs and Excise. The proposed additional duties of customs and exoise embrace what may be called luxury items. The additional revenue to be obtained for the remainder of this year is estimated at Â£4,200,000. Particulars of the duties will be made known to honourable members when my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, tables the appropriate resolution. I'axation Proposals Summarized. Under the proposals which I have just announced it is anticipated that the addiThe tional revenue to be obtained this year will be Â£31,100,000. The measures approved by Parliament last May are now estimated to produce approximately Â£14,000,000. The total additional war taxation for 1940-41 is therefore Â£45,100,000. "" The proposals are summarized in the following table:Direct Taxation. Income Tax- Individuals- . Increased, rates! . . . . .

We stood up to that taxation, despite the depression, and staged the spectacular recovery, economic and financial, of the last seven years.

To-day the British Empire is engaged in a grim struggle against tremendous forces of evil. The brunt of this struggle is being borne by Great Britain herself in the face of great odds. She is fighting for her own existence, for our existence, for the existence of. all free peoples. She is fighting for the survival of democracy against world domination by aggressor dictators. This is the most grim and tragic of wars. It is taking a sad toll not only of the lives of our fighting forces but also of the lives of our seamen and civilians who have been victims of a war savagery hitherto unknown. Its destruction of property goes on daily. In the midst of this grim spectacle in - Europe there Â£ stands out the heroism of the British forces and the determination and courage of her people. 65,220,000 So far Australia has been spared the horrors of war but what the future holds 3,549,000 none can predict. On the fate of this war depends the fate of Australia and the future of every man, woman and child in Australia. Our war effort must be an 117,231.000 all-in effort. Let there be no misunder180,000,000 standing. There can be no self defence in isolation. ""Whether . our war effort takes shape here or overseas it must be part of one common plan. That is a picture of what this war is and what it means. It has been my task to present another picture. An "" all - in"" war effort involves other costs which must be paid for. There are differences of view as to how the burden can best be spread, 'but there is no easy path. Every 1940-41. one must make his contribution to our 1939-40. Actual. Estimate. national premium for our future safety. Â£ Â£ If we win, and we must win, we shall 2,000,000 at least be in a position to start afresh 500.000 on the path of social welfare. We shall 1.1.7,231,000 all.be much the poorer, but we can build up again to new heights of well-being 119,731,000 and social justice. We have first to win the war. There will soon be 400,000 men in Australia giving up their whole time to fighting or making munitions or equipment, and the rest of us must support them and their families, in a decent standard of living while they are so engaged. How to do that is the. financial problem which I have been dealing with today. The proposals of necessity mean giving up something substantial on the part of the great majority of the people of Australia. The effort required does not look heroic in comparison with the tasks falling on our fighting men. But it is a task complementary to the other and just as essential. I can have no doubt that in this, equally with the fighting jobs, now that the call has come, Australia will be there. I am confident that in asking the people of Australia to accept higher taxation and. to support the large war loans we will issue they will respond willingly. With that confidence I submit these proposals for your consideration. Progress reported. COMl'AKISON OF ACTUALREVENUE Taxation and General RevenueCustoms and Excise ... Sales Tax ..

From these proposals, the Government to obtain an additional . Â£3,400,000 in the 1940-41 financial year. For.a proper appreciation of the proposals, it will be"" necessary to examine time - the measure now before honourable members in conjunction with resolutions for . .amendment of .the rate of sales tax which - I shall move-at a later hour ""this day. The present schedule to the Sales Tax necesExemptions Act will, if this measure outbecomes law, be replaced by three schedules. The first will contain partiof goods' which will still be exempt. The second will contain particulars of goods which it is proposed should bear at a rate of 5 per cent. The third -- will contain particulars of goods which, of it is proposed should bear tax at the rate of 15 per cent.' The remainder of the goods sold or consumed in Australia will ofbear tax at the 10 per cent. rate. With regard to the proposal to widen -- - the field by withdrawing some exempt-i o n s , - I .may-say that there has been a confairly widespread demand for some change of the incidence of sales tax which would abolish, the large number of exemptions and reduce the burden of classification by vendors. The proposals for changes of the basis of levying sales taxation have been many and varied, and have ranged from a multiple turnover tax to a tax imposed on every retail sale made. After a careful examination of the various suggestions, the Government is convinced that the present form of sales taxation is to be preferred to tax of any other type yet tried out in the various countries of the world. Perhaps the most persistent demand has been for the maintenance of the present form of tax, coupled with abolition of all exemptions, so that the tax might be spread over all goods consumed in Australia and a comparatively low rate of tax be maintained. The Government does not intend to adopt that course. Exemptions from sales tax are based upon certain well defined criteria, which may be briefly stated as follows:(1) The goods are basic foodstuffs. (2) They are primary products. (3) They are primary producers' machinery, or materials of production. (4) They are goods used in industries which in peace-time it is necessary and desirable to foster. (5) They are goods used in activities relating to religious, philanthropic, benevolent, educational or medical and surgical activities. The Government considers that the total withdrawal of the exemptions falling into the first, second and third of these categories would so disturb the nation's economy as to cause harm greatly outweighing the advantages to be derived from ease of classification and the relatively lower rate. However, the Government believes that from groups 4 and 5 a limited selection can be made upon which a relatively low rate of tax can be collected. A schedule has accordingly been compiled, including goods of a sale value of approximately Â£47,000,000, which it is proposed should be brought back to the taxable field. It is proposed that the whole of the goods comprising the .field, with one exception, will bear tax at the relatively low rate of 5 per cent. The exception is boots and shoes of a awholesale value in excess of. 153. a pair. These have been allowed to fall into the class of goods upon which the general rate of 10 per cent, is payable. The exception is considered to be justified because of the retention of exemption for boots and shoes of all kinds, the wholesale value of which does not exceed 15s. a pair. Out of the total estimated sale value of all boots and shoes of Â£8,000,000, more than one-half will still be exempt. The exemption is' expected to cover all boots for ordinary purposes, all children's boots and shoes, and men's and ladies' shoes of the less expensive and elaborate type. The more expensive boots and shoes and slippers will be taxed at the general rate of 10 per cent. The additions will bring the value of the taxable field to approximately Â£251,000,000. . Of the total goods which it is estimated will be consumed in Australia, amounting to Â£565,000,000, no less than Â£314,000,000 will still be exempt. The composition of this Â£314,000,00 is roughly as follows:- Â£ Basic foodstuffs (including tea) .. .. .. 131,000,000 Fuel, light and power .. 00,000,000 Primary products . . .. 25,000,000 Primary producers' machinery, materials and aids. . 23,000,000 Goods sold to Government departments .. .. 40,000.000 Beverages, tobacco, & c , subject to licavy duties of customs and excise .. 17,000,000 Sundry items such as small manufactures, boots and shoes under 15s. a pair wholesale, goods for public hospitals and public in stitutions, and church equipment .. ... 1S,000,000 314,000,000 I think that even a cursory survey of the nature of the goods in this list will convince all reasonable persons that the scope of the tax cannot be widened to any appreciable degree greater than is already proposed. There may, of course, be room for differences of opinion with regard to some of the items which the <3overnment has included in the second schedule for taxation at 5 per cent. They are all goods for which undeniable claims to exemption can be made in times of peace; hut standards formulated in peace-time have to be adjusted to war-time necessities, and the .Government feels that, having preserved the principle of preference by imposing only half rates, it has not acted harshly in bringing those goods again into the taxable field. Consequent upon the re-introduction of sales tax on spectacles, eye glasses and lorgnettes, it will be necessary to provide a special sale value upon which tax on these goods should be paid.' This is sary in order that the value of skilled services not associated with the production of the articles 'concerned may not be'made subject to tax. This matter is appropriately provided for in a proposed amendment of regulation 18A, and the sale value proposed is. that which operated prior to the exemption of those goods, namely, 33J per cent, of the total amount charged. It is appropriate at this stage aL30 to say that it is proposed to increase the. sale value of made-to-measure clothing. This sale value is calculated at present at 50 per cent, of the total charge made to the customer, and in many case's has been found to. be less, than the total cost of production of the goods. It is proposed by regulation to increase the sale value to 66$ per cent, of the total charge made for the goods. For taxation at the relatively high rate of.'15 per cent., the. Government has chosen goods' which' are considered to supply less urgent needs than those contained in the other schedules to the act, or those upon which the general rate will fall. Particulars.of these goods will be found in the proposed third schedule. One of the chief necessities to be borne in mind in arranging .the details of this group is the need for certainty, and accordingly,, wherever possible, goods have been described by the names under which they aretraded in commercially. This course has been followed in preference to the much easier method of describing groups of goods by generic terms, for the reason that, in the latter course, specific - classification is placed primarily upon - the taxpayer, with penalty taxes for failure to classify the goods correctly, as well as, in many cases, inability to recover the difference in tax from those purchasing from him: Owing to the degree of secrecy which necessarily has had to be observed in the compilation of this special schedule, and Mr Fadden. to the adoption of the specific in preference to the generic definition of goods, it may be found that the list is incomplete, notwithstanding the fact that every care has been exercised in its preparation, [f this should prove to be the case, the Government will not hesitate to . ask Parliament at a later date to amend the. schedule so as to preserve the principles neces- upon which it has been compiled. : I do not. propose at.this stage to make any specific references to the individual items comprising, the .schedule; they will,i i is thought,, be - self-explanatory. If any further information is desired by honourable members on particular items, it will be given when the hill is in the committee stage."" It is proposedthat the new schedules shall become operative from tomorrow in respect of ' all goods the subject of transactions which attract liability^ including the importation of goods. An amendment .will - be introduced in the machinery act tp prevent sales tax from - becoming payable on goods which, up to the 21-st November, 1940, were exempt from tax 'but which, on and after, the 22nd November, 1940, will become subject to tax if those goods had passed,the normal taxing point before' the 22nd November, 1940. In other words, tax will - not be payable by a retailer or a retailer-wholesaler on goods sold by retail which, prior to the 22nd November, 1940, were exempt and had been treated as stock for sale by retail, or had been placed in a common stock for sale by retail or wholesale as the occasion arose. Goods sold by retail, which have already borne tax at the rate hitherto in force, will riot be subject to further tax because of any increase now proposed. There are provisions in the machinery measures which will fully protect vendors of goods who are required to pay tax on goods at the new rates. Such vendors will be able to recover from customers who have not paid when the bills become law. If the bills do not become law, the vendors will be able to obtain refunds of the additional tax paid by them.

There has been a general expectation on the part of the public that increased duties would be imposed for war purposes on such stock taxation commodities as beer, spirits and tobacco. That expectation is being realized and all consumers of these commodities will have the satisfaction of knowing that by their use of these products they are making a direct contribution to war finance for the payment of munitions and war equipment. The huge amount required for war expenditure necessarily imposed upon Government and its expert tax-gatherers the need for a most searching investigafor tion into the possibilities of obtaining for cigarettes. increased revenue. An examination of the tariff proposals now presented will factured tobacco. show clearly the results of the detailed investigation that has been carried out. In the past the maximum revenue ther yield obtainable was the major principle on which rates of customs and excise turers on imported leaf. duties were based, though there may have been some slight departure from this principle for protectionist or other good reason. Under war conditions, however, per lb. this principle has not been our sole guide. We have had to take into consideration such other factors as(a) Desirability of reduction in conduty sumption in order to ease presgross sure on overseas exchange, particularly dollars; and diverments Sfr.

Articles. and inserting in its stead the following . . . . . . or the equivalent of 60 cigarette papers in its stead the following item:- - - per 8,640 matches beverages, other than beer containing at least 2 per cent, proof spirit - - - - - per lb. subject to such conditions as are prescribed by Departmental By-laws . . . . . sion of portion of the individual's income to war purposes; and (b) Desirability of imposing increased taxation on goods likely to be in short supply, matches being a case in point. The principal alterations of duties now being imposed are9d. per gallon increase of customs and excise on beer. 12s. per proof gallon increase of customs and excise on spirits. Is. 6d. per lb. increase of customs duties on tobacco leaf for the manufacture of tobacco. 2s. per lb. on leaf for cigarettes, but, as imported tobacco leaf will be exempted the from special war duty and primage, the net increase will be Is. per lb. on leaf tobacco and Is. 4d. per lb. on leaf 2s. per lb. increase of excise on manu2s. 9d. per lb. increase of excise on cigarette. The customs duties will be increased by similar amounts plus a fursum to offset the additional duty that will be paid by Australian manufacImported manufactured tobaccoes will, .therefore, be subject to an increase of duty of 2s. 8d. per lb. and imported cigarettes of 4s. ^d. per book of 60 increase of customs and excise on cigarette papers. Is. 6d. per gross boxes increase of excise on matches. The new rate of 2s. per boxes will be four times the present more rate, and there are commensurate adjustin the duties on imported matches. A new excise duty of Is. per lb. has been imposed on carbonic acid gas when used for aerating beverages other than beer. This will affect mainly aerated waters and soda fountain drinks. I do not propose to give in detail at this stage the old and new rates of duty on the commodities affected. Honourable members will find such particulars in the summary of alterations that has been circulated. But some special features of the increased duties are worthy of mention. The new tobacco duties represent an increase of 2d. per oz. on tobaccoes containing the ruling blends of imported and Australian leaf, and l^d. per oz. on wholly Australian leaf tobaccoes. This has been achieved partly by increased customs duties on imported leaf, and partly by increased excise duty on the finished product. Duties on cigarettes have been dealt with somewhat similarly, but the additional impost is much more severe. Imported tobacco leaf has been exempted from primage and special war duty. This action has been taken because of the serious administrative difficulty that has been encountered in the past in arriving at the refunds of the ad valorem primage duty on stems discarded from various batches of imported leaf, each of a different value. The increases of'the ordinary customs rate on tobacco leaf include an amount designed to offset the loss of primage and special war duty of approximately 6d. per lb. on leaf for the manufacture of tobacco and 8d. per lb. on leaf for the manufacture of cigarettes. It will interest the tobacco-growing industry to know that the net increase of duty on imported leaf, and likewise the margin in favour of the grower, is Is. per lb. on leaf for tobacco and Is. 4d. per lb. on leaf for cigarettes, making a total tariff protection of 5s. per lb. on leaf for tobacco and 7s. 2d. per lb. on leaf for cigarettes. This does hot take into account the differential excise of 8d. per lb. operating in favour of wholly Australian leaf tobaccoes. The excise duty on matches has been quadrupled and will now be 2s. per grosB boxes each 60 matches. This rate is still much below those of the United Kingdom and Canada, which on equivalent packaging are 5s. 2d. and 4s. 8d. per gross boxes respectively. The duty on carbonic acid gas will principally affect the consumer of soft drinks, who has, up to the present, escaped the incidence of excise taxation. The duty of Is. per lb. on this gas will represent about one-farthing on a large bottle of aerated water. The net additional revenue expected to be received during the current financial year as a result of these duty increases is as follows.'Â£ Beer 1,305,000 Spirits 495,000 Tobacco and tobacco products 2,000,000 Cigarette papers 142,000 Matches 170,000 Carbonic acid gas 123,000 Total .. .. 4,235,000 The increased revenue for a full year would be Â£7,200,000.

One purpose of these motions is to increase the general rate of Sales Tax from 8-J per cent, to 10 per cent. Honourable members have already been informed, in connection with the bill to amend the Sales Tax Exemptions Act, of the considerations which actuated the Government in deciding to increase the rate rather than to attempt the withdrawal of exemptions on a sufficient magnitude to allow the present rate to be maintained. It is unnecessary for me here to recapitulate the reasons for that decision. It will be sufficient for me to say that the increase was decided upon only after other possible means of obtaining the required revenue had been thoroughly explored and examined. A second purpose of the motions is to provide differential rates for application to two other classes of goods. The first class comprises goods previously exempt but which, in the existing circumstances, it is considered can be brought into the taxable field without materially departing from the major principles upon which exemption from Sales Tax has been hitherto granted. For this class of goods it is proposed to apply the relatively low rate of 5 per cent, and, as has been previously explained, the goods to which this rate will apply are as set out in the proposed Second Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill. The second class of goods comprises items already subject to tax but which, by reason of the fact that the needs they satisfy are less urgent or important than those satisfied by the ordinary goods of commerce, might well bear a rate greater than that applicable to the general goods of commerce. For this class of goods it is proposed to apoly a rate of 15 per cent, and the goods to which this rate will apply are specifically set out in the proposed third schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill. This is the first occasion in the history of sales taxation in Australia in which any attempt has been made to differentiate between taxable goods so far as rate is concerned. Bate differentiation has been avoided in the past, not because of any view that a varying burden could not be justified, but simply because it was realized that the extra classifications involved would increase the difficulties of taxpayers in the compilation of returns and place an added burden upon the administration in interpreting and policing the legislation. The alternative confronting the Government, however, appeared to be an increase of the general rate beyond 10 per cent., an alternative which it earnestly wished to avoid. The Government chose, therefore, to adopt the system of differential rates in the belief that the tax-payers upon whom the additional duties of dissection will fall will accept the additional burden as a necessary and inevitable result of the extraordinary revenue requirements of the day and will prefer that course to a high general rate which might tend to depress sales. It is proposed that the new rates shall come into operation as from tomorrow. This accords with the usual procedure when a change of rate is contemplated and is designed to prevent the dislocation of trade which would occur should there be delay between the date of the announcement of the Government's intentions and the date when those intentions became effective. There are provisions in the machinery of the existing law which fully protect vendors of goods who are required to pay the additional tax due to the imposition of the higher rates. Vendors will be able to recover the additional amount from any customers who have not paid it when the bills become law. If the bills do not become law, vendors will be able to obtain refunds of the excess amounts paid by them. There are also provisions in the existing machinery acts 1 which will enable vendors of goods previously taxable to recover the additional amount payable from their customers and contractors to recover the additional cost of materials. Contracts and agreements are deemed to be altered accordingly. Steps will be taken to introduce an appropriate amendment of the machinery act to provide that contracts or agreements entered into by vendors who become liable for additional tax or contractors whose costs of surmlying materials are increased by the taxing of goods previously exempted may be varied to enable the additional amount payable to be recovered by the vendor or contractor. ThenÂ«w rates will apply to all taxable transactions and operations in goods effected or done on and after Friday, the 22nd November, 1940, and will apply also to goods imported on and after that date. Even with the increases now proposed the highest rate in Australia is still below what is referred to in Great Britain's purchase tax as the reduced rate, viz., 16f per cent., whilst the rate in Great Britain, viz., 33-J per cent, is more than three times as great as the proposed Australian general rate of 10 per cent.

72,Mr MCEWEN,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Indi-Minister for Air) [5.46] - I move That the House do now adjourn. At question time. I was asked in substance by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) whether I was correctly reported in saying that there had been no aerial reconnaissance over Bass Strait during the eighteen days prior to the sinking of a ship recently in those waters. I replied that that was not an accurate report of any statement made by me, and I undertook on the adjournment to make a statement setting out the facts associated with the issues raised by the question, which I now do. The impression in the mind of the honourable member for Bass and, I have no doubt, in the minds of other people, has undoubtedly been promoted by the report of an interview which I gave to a certain newspaper that sought information from me in connection with the sinkings and in connection also with the activities of the Royal Australian A ir basic Force. I shall make some observations regarding that matter before I set out the facts about the aerial reconnaissance. I approach this particular issue with the basic policy that the people should be given as much information as is consistent with the public interest. If , however, information given to a newspaper is promoted to an unwarranted degree of sensationalism or distorted from its proper perspective, the effect is to mislead rather than to inform the readers of the paper, and, in such circumstances, any Minister desiring to give the maximum degree of information consistent with public policy is liable to be driven back to the practice of giving the minimum degree of information rather than the maximum. I gave certain information which was asked of me in connection with this particular matter and naturally that information was puiblished in the context of a report in a newspaper, not fully, but substantially accurately. The condensation and paraphrazing for the purposes of publication, however, gave a certain inflexion, which conveys an impression somewhat different from that desired to be conveyed by me. Furthermore, in the report, all of that information was surmounted by heavy black headings-for them. I accept no responsibilitywhich, I believe, convey to the mind of the average reader a wrong impression of the facts themselves, of the relative importance of the facts, and of the general picture of the circumstances which I wished to convey to the newspaper concerned and to the public. I was asked when the last air force flight was made over the area where the first ship was sunk by mines. I replied that I did not know, but that it was not of any appropriate consequence, as mines under water could not be detected from the air, and that this area would never be ventured into in daylight by any enemy mine-layers. Nevertheless, I would inquire when, as a matter of fact, the Air Force had last flown over the area. Then, in the course of half an hour of conversation, I pointed out that any mine-laying attempted by any vessel would most certainly be at night, followed by a quick dash back to the open ocean. Aerial reconnaissance could be applied only to the detection of such activities by keeping under observation that part of the ocean which a. mine-laying vessel could reach and be in during the daylight hours of the succeeding day. Thus aerial reconnaissance to detect mine-laying vessels involved daylight patrol not merely of the actual trade channels, but also of an area of ocean from 150 to 200 miles wide to the seaward of any trade channel. The sea lanes of trade constantly used around the Australian coast are many thousands of miles in length. It is this great margin to seaward of those actual trade lanes in which it would be necessary to detect any enemy minelayer. This involves so vast an area of ocean that it is obvions that we have not enough aircraft suitable for seaward reconnaissance to have all of those areas under continuous and comprehensive surveillance. My interviewer said that he was fully able to appreciate that point. He was told without any disclosure of details that certain areas were the object of regular reconnaissance flights and that obvious duties of a special character were carried out, amongst which were mentioned the very evident duties of clearing reconnaissance for convoys and vessels engaged on special missions and the investigation from time to time of reports of unidentified vessels, or other special missions. This information presented what I believe will be accepted as a reasonable, but undetailed, picture of the seaward duties of the Air Force. I was then asked again, I take it, as a matter of interest, when the last flight had been made over the area where the first sinking took place. In the meantime, I had secured this information, and I said that a flight had taken place over the area on the 20th October, and pointed out that it was not at all related to preventive measures in connection with the general subject under discussion. I was astonished later to see this date quite unjustifiably promoted to a. major point in what I think can only be described as a sensational report of an interview which was granted for the purpose of imparting information. The display of the date of that flight and a heavy heading "" Not enough planes to guard mined area "" had the effect of presenting a completely distorted picture of the activities and capacity of the Royal Australian Air Force in connection with these special duties. I assure honourable members that the Royal Australian Air Force is most active and industrious in discharging its manifold duties, amongst which the subject under discussion is counted on as one of high importance. Consistent with the retention of adequate numbers of aircraft to meet special calls and a reasonable employment and servicing of operational aircraft, the maximum use of our seaward reconnaissance planes is made to ensure the safety of all shipping in Australian waters. Additional aircraft suitable for seaward reconnaissance of various types are at present on order in America and deliveries will add to our existing squadrons in the comparatively near future. At the same time, we are manufacturing in Australia operational aircraft of a type capable of carrying out these duties and, in fact, intended in part to be employed for that purpose. It would not be possible for me to give an assurance that in these seas we can be completely assured of immunity from the effect of enemy action, and I do not believe that honourable members would desire me to mislead them in that regard. Every protective step and precaution has been taken, and will be taken, which is within the resources of the loyal, industrious and capable members of the Royal Australian Air Force.",58
73,Mr CTTRTIII,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Fremantle-Leade r of the Opposition) [6.2] - This is a matter of some moment. It involves the question of how far the Air Force is at present equipped to make certain that enemy vessels are not operajting in Australian waters within areas which would make such operations a grave menace to interstate and overseas shipping. I feel that things could be better done than they are being done at present. I feel that there has been too wide a dispersion of units of the Royal Australian Navy, having regard to what has been said about the strength of the Royal Australian Air Force. Admittedly the work of the Air Force is limited by the material at its disposal. It is of no use at this stage to upon what we might get in the way of aeroplanes from other countries. At the moment we can rely only upon what we have, and the Minister for Air (Mr MCEwen) has just told us that what we have is not adequate for the protection of our vast coastline. That seems to make it imperative that the Government should immediately consider the disposition of units of the Australian Navy. The Navy is also part of the defence forces of Australia. While I offer no general criticism regarding the use of the Navyj I direct attention to the fact that in recent weeks the position has changed materially from what it was when the war began and the first dispositions of the Royal Australian Navy were made. Close to the chief port of a neighbouring dominion, the sort of thing has happened which has now occurred to two vessels in Buss Strait. I do not think I am violating any confidence when I say that there were apprehensions that an enemy raider was in the vicinity of the Australian coast before these mines were discovered. That, at least, can be accepted as a statement which I would not make if I did not really believe it. To-day, I put a question to the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Hughes) which was related to this very subject, and had to do with a report that had reached me concerning what I shall describe as the presumed activities of an enemy vessel off the coast of Western Australia. I recognize, as the Minister does, that you cannot do more than you can do with the Air Force, but I put it to him that he must make up for the inadequacy of the Air Force by a better utilization of the units of the Australian Navy in Australian waters. I make no comment on the general question of the pooling of resources for the defence of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but it must be plain that the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia are being singled out for enemy attention with the obvious purpose of frustrating our attempts to help in the war. Once our seaways were mined and our ships destroyed, we should be prevented from transporting foodstuffs overseas for the use of our kith and kin who so greatly need them. Moreover, Australia is exporting steel to places where rely it is needed in the general pooling of Empire effort. If those exports could be prevented, the effectiveness of our contribution would be greatly reduced. However, even worse is implied. If the enemy is able to mine our waters, the next step may be to raid our ports, and some of our ports are obviously of vital importance in the production of munitions. The Minister has informed us that, although the newspaper report publishes question and answer, it is, in substance, substantially true. I understand that the Minister does not challenge its accuracy, but objects to the emphasis and inflexion given to it. He deprecates it as an alarmist report, but not an untrue one. Therefore, I maintain that, until the Air Force is sufficiently well equipped to be able to defend our coasts against enemy action of this kind, it is necessary to make the requisite use of the Australian Navy for this purpose. If that should involve a re-arrangement of the units of the Navy, I merely point out that the necessities of war have brought us to that state of affairs, and I invite the Minister to submit my suggestion to the next meeting of the War Cabinet.",60
74,Mr BARNARD,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Bass) [ 6 . 9 ] - I am indebted to the Minister for A i r (Mr . MCEwen) for having made this statement, based as it is upon the subject matter of a question which I asked earlier in the day. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has rightly pointed out that if the A i r Eorce is unable to maintain an effective patrol, this should be done by units of the Navy. The Minister, replying to my question earlier today, said that it . was based upon wrong premises. From the report which the Minister has since made, it seems that my argument was not based on wrong premises, but rather on points which the Minister thought were emphasized unduly.",61
75,Mr MCEWEN,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"That is not quite the position with regard to what I considered to be the wrong premises of the honourable member's question. The honourable member asked was it a fact that no air force reconnaissance had been conducted over Bass Strait during the period of eighteen days. The statement which I have made indicates that no flight had taken place over one defined point during that period of eighteen days. That is the difference I make. It would not be .in accordance with, the facts to say that no air force reconnaissance had taken place over Bass Strait during the eighteen days.",61
76,Mr WARD,TARIFF AMENDMENT,It is a distinction without a difference.,61
77,Mr BARNARD,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"If it is not a distinction without a difference, it is certainly one of those small niceties.",61
78,Mr MCEWEN,TARIFF AMENDMENT,I think it is most i m portant.,61
79,Mr BARNARD,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"There is no doubt that it is most important, but it is a nicety in distinction which does not satisfy me. I am concerned, of course, with my own State, which has peculiar difficulties. Owing to its geographical isolation, we have to depend almost entirely on sea-borne transport for communication with the mainland. It is true that our first-class mail matter is carried by air and that passengers also can use this form of transport, but the fact remains that, following the sinking of two vessels in Bass Strait some weeks ago, Tasmanians were isolated as regards general merchandise and second-class mail matter. If such interruptions to shipping are to be repeated ^Tasmania's position, particularly with regard to foodstuffs, will become acute in ta> very short time. Anybody who has even a limited knowledge of the extent of the-Australian coast must realise the difficulties of policing it from the air, particularly in view of the size of our air force. However, the Minister has certainly not satisfied me on the question of patrolling the shipping lanes between Tasmania and the mainland. When discussions on the defence of the Commonwealth have been held here in years gone by, it has been frequently claimed that Tasmania was not in the picture, and that there was no need to prepare for the defence of Tasmania which, according to alleged experts, was not in a vulnerable position. I do not think anybody will deny that that has been the argument used by m i l i tary authorities with regard to Tasmania, and supported by Ministers. But Tasmanians have been awakened with a start by the happenings in Bass Strait only a few weeks ago, when two vessels were sunk and shipping between Tasmania and the mainland was suspended. My immediate concern, and the reason that prompted me to ask a question in this House earlier today, is the importance and urgent necessity of the Government taking appropriate action to ensure that reasonable shipping facilities will be maintained between the State of Tasmania and the mainland. We want some satisfactory assurance from the Government that action will be taken to maintain that shipping either - by the use of naval forces, the A i r Force, or both. The Bass Strait shipping lanes must be freed from mines that may be sowed by a raider. I hope that the Minister for A i r , or some other Minister will not leave the matter there without giving some satisfactory assurance to Tasmanians with regard to this importantma tter.",61
80,Mr WAR D,TARIFF AMENDMENT,"East Sydney) [ 6 . 1 5 ] - I desire to bring a matter of great importance under the notice of the Government. Certain happenings at Newnes in New Sou tli Wales, where the Commonwealth - Government and the State Government of NTew South Wales have given concessions Tinder an agreement with the National Oil Proprietary Limited, have been ^brought under my notice. My information is that one of the assets taken over 3>y that company was 32 miles of railway track, which I,understand runs within the area held by the company under lease. The Commonwealth Government has advanced a considerable sum of money to the company in order' to finance its undertaking-and, as security, I take it that the - company has undertaken to preserve the assets. I have heard that, despite the fact that some years ago a committee held an inquiry and' recommended in its report that thispiece ofrailway track be recon-ditioned and used for transport purposes, the company; having decided"" to pump the - oil out by means of a pipe line, hasdisposed of: the railway track to a scrapiron merchant who is now tearing up the. lines. 1 understand further that a. con-eid'erable portion of. the track has ""been removed, and is now being shipped to the East, in fact to Japan, along with, other scrap metal which the merchantlias obtained, such as disused locomotives; - which lie in a considerable quantity in that portion of New South Wales. Two - very important aspects as: first, that a company which has entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth and State Governments is disposing of part of the assets upon which, the Governments - concerned made advances-I'am on the assumption, that the company has so acted without the authority of either, government because I would be amazed to Isnow that official sanction has been - obtained-and, secondly, that the metal which has been obtained as the result of the scrapping of this track, is being shipped to the East. We have just 3istened very attentively to a statement - made by the Minister for Air (Mr. IMCEwen) with regard to the difficulty of protecting this and surely it is a very wrong policy for the Government to be permitting the shipment of materials, which may be used for - the purposes of war, to a potential, if - not actual, enemy country, that has , - already allied itself with the Axis Powers. ""Yet the fact is that the Government is ilr. Ward. permitting that traffic. It is serious indeed' to find that public assets are being destroyed by private companies for the purpose, of obtaining a certain amount of' financial return for themselves, and at the same time, the safety of the people of the Commonwealth, is being jeopardr ized by the sale .of these goods .to a. possible enemy country. Will the Minister givesome assurance that the Government will make inquiries into the circumstances of this matter and give a report as early, and as fully as possible to this House ? ",61
81,Mr MCEWEN,TARIFF AMENDMENT," [6.20] - in . reply- - I assure the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Cur.tin) that' the disposition of the Royal Australian Navy is under the consideration of the Government. I am in a position to 1 assure the House that there is nothing, in the disposition of the units of the Royal Australian Navy which placesany> difficulty in the way of readjustment; and that the circumstances of war will be met by aredispositionof the naval units' as already occasion arises. As requested by the Leader of the Opposition, hisremarkswill be brought to the notice of the War Cabinet. I should like to assure the honourable' member for Bass (Mr Barnard) that, while I am not in a position, and no doubt never will be, to disclose the detail's of the operational activities of the Royal Australian Air Force, the very fullest consideration will be given, and the highest importance attached, to the working employment of that force in safeguarding the channels of trade between Tasmania and the mainland. I am not in a position to reply with knowledge to the points raised by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr: Ward). I shall see that they are brought to the notice of the appropriate Minister and that proper consideration is given to them. Question resolved in the affirmative. country, PAPERS.
