1,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the State, where possible, has allowed its servants extra days during the Christmas season without inconvenience to the public, I ask the Prime Minister if , as on former occasions, he will allow the Commonwealth's public servants freedom for the two days following Boxing Day ?",14
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The request.. is a reasonable one. We shall ask our officers to provide for those under them having a holiday on those days, so far as that may be practicable.  not in Victoria-alone?",14
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Of course.,14
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I wish to know, from the Postmaster-General, whether any special allowance or consideration is given to the officials of the Postal Department, particularly the overloaded letter-carriers who have so much extra work to do during the Christmas season?",14
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"No - special allowance is given. Theletter-carriers, like all the other officials of the Department, must take the hard with the easy times. .They are paid for the work they do during the whole year.",14
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What is the number of persons in the ploy of the Government whose appointments have been made by the Public Service Commispermanent sioner ? 2. What is the number of. persons in the employ of the Government whose appointments have not been made by the Public Service Commissioner ? Ms. FISHER - An answer to the question about the number of permanent officers in the Service could be obtained within a very little time, but the other information will take - longer to get, and it will be necessary for the honourable member to state the date to which he wishes the return made up.",15
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Say , up to a month ago.",15
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,To the end of November?,15
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes .  noticei . Is.it a fact that the staff of the Federal Treasury is undermanned? a. Have two clerical officers recently been, transferred to other Departments and the vacancies not been filled? 3. Is the staff at present working overtime every night? 4. What are the names of the officers who have worked overtime since last May; how many hours overtime each worked; and how much each received per hour for such overtime? 5. What is the rate per hour of the salary of such officers during ordinary office hours, and how does this rate compare with the overtime pay? 6. Is there really any necessity for the staff being regularly called upon to work overtime?",15
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. No; except in the Notes Branch, in which the work has recently increased. Application has been made to the Public Service Commissioner for the appointment of additional L'fficers. a. Two clerical officers have recently been transferred to other Departments. an excess officer. The vacancy caused by the transfer of the other officer has not been permanently filled, but the staff has been reinforced by four temporary officers. _ 3. Four or five officers began to work overtime on Monday of this week. The remainder of the staff, totalling fifty-seven officers, are not at present working overtime, and there is no reason to anticipate any further overtime of considerable amount until June next. 4 and 5. A statement has been prepared, which the honourable member can see. 6. The staff is not regularly called upon to . work overtime, except at the close of the financial year, when overtime is unavoidable. We cannot obtain outside assistance for statistical and Budget work, and it would emnotbe desirable to employ such assistance. It is better to impose a little strain on the staff than to bring in new men. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS.",15

16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have not yet the facts before me, but I shall try to get them today. They have been asked for. On the 28th November I undertook, at One was the request of the honourable member for Wentworth, to make inquiries with reference to the statement that the Commonwealth Bank had made advances to four private banks. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has now forwarded the following reply- . I beg to advise that, as the management of the Commonwealth Bank is to be free from political interference, I respectfully _ decline to' answer this, or any question of a similar^ nature.

31,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [10.43] - So far as I am concerned the cardinal object tion to this measure can be put in a few We are already familiar with the proposals for conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, but the constitution at prethe sent strictly defines the range of our Federal power. It is now proposed that we shall enter the territory under State and legislate for the settlement of disputes between the employ6s of the State railways and the Governments representative of the electors of the States who control and pay them. The Commonwealth is to step between the representative Legislatures of the States and their employees on their railways. We are asked to set up an independent national authority, over and above tribunals already existing in the States, if any, and in every case intervening between the Parliaments of the States and their employees whom they employ and pay. The one simple and practical consideration is that, when the employer is a State, within its limits, a sovereign State, responsible for the burdens it imposes on its own people, and foe the conduct of its own business, if there be any intervention by another authority, even if that be a fraternal authority, the axe is laid at the root of the tree of State sovereignty, and State prestige, once and for all. We not only depreciate its standing and influence, but, so far, make thereafter the financial policy of that State, and its financial interests, subject to the incurelectors sion of another Parliament in another sphere. A Federal alliance between a central Government and associated States always involves a demarcation of spheres. Only thus can they avoid the authoritative supremacy of the central authority and the subjection of each State Legislature. The very essence, the vital principle of a Federal system is that, within their own spheres, and in their own affairs, the State electors shall be absolute masters of their own Houses. Whatever questions may arise, and there are some, as to the delimitations between the powers allotted to a Federal Government and those reserved to its Stateswhatever doubts may be entertained as to the drawing of the line of demarcation between particular points-ther e can be no question but that, once we step in between the employing authority, which finds the money, and carries all the responsibilities of managing the State railways, or any other undertaking, it is not only contrary to constitutional principle to permit such an invasion, dividing authority without dividing responsibility, but it is also bad business. It would be condemned out of hand by every business man as foreign to the essential principle on which these great undertakings must be carried on, whether by Governments or by their public bodies. This is a question of principle, and of fundamental principle. Mr Deakin. I admit that, in regard to the particular place at which we draw the line between^ our central and State powers, there may sometimes be room for argument; but contend that, in this case, there is no roonv for any such discussion. We leave with the States all responsibility for financingtheir own railways and for their employment in the development of their own territory. That responsibility to their electorsthey are bound to fulfil, otherwise the electors are ignored and defied. Therefore,, it is an inexcusable intrusion to step in and interfere between them and their employees in the matter of remuneration, so that the latter are taught to look to another Legislature instead of to that by which they were appointed-to another Legislature than that which is responsible for finding, the money, and for controlling the railwaysso as to pursue the best development of the country. These are very serious considerations. Moreover, there is now no limit to the power of the State in this regard. Its may, if they think fit, require their representatives and their Governments to establish in their own State some authority to which appeal may be made by the servants of the State, whether in the railways or any other employment, if they are aggrieved. That is perfectly within the bounds of State power, and a perfectly proper thing to do, if the State electors sodesire. The decision today rests with the Governments and Legislature responsible to, and representing, the electors. It is a matter between the people on the one side,, and their chosen representatives on the other. Intervention between them and in defiance of both by another body, however closely allied, and however authoritative within its own bounds, is, it appears to me,, an invasion, which cannot be justified. It is certainly not called for by any existing circumstances. The future of this continent as a whole depends largely on the development of its railway system. That system, which has already absorbed scores of millions of pounds, will be enlarged, and with every enlargement the number of employees will naturally increase. Those affected by any such amendment of the Constitution as that proposed will become larger and largerbodies, more and more capable of expressing their views, and certain to receive the attention of their State representatives. Under these circumstances, no one can suspect that any real hindrance exists, or that any obstacle will be found, in any State, to prevent its people from instructing their representatives in this regard. The States are perfectly free to act in this matter whenever and wherever they please. there is no constitutional or other obstacle in their way, and this not being, so far as I am aware, a party question, there is absolutely no let or hindrance to prevent, or even delay, the people of a State from grappling with this issue either in the way' now suggested, or in any other way they prefer. Under these circumstances, to ask us, the representatives of the same people, charged with Federal duties in the Federal sphere, to take on ourselves the task of invading the State areas in order to intervene between the State Governments and their employees, shouldering aside the States as employers, for their own public purposes, within their own territory, and on their own railways, is wholly unwarranted by anything in their circumstances, and is not warranted on any Federal principle. Let us reverse the positions. ' A proposition of this sort, if - supported, not merely by one but by the whole body of the States, suggesting that, for the convenience or advantage of some part of Australia, one or other, or all, of the States should be authorized to intervene between the Commonwealth Parliament, or Government, and the public servants engaged for our public purposes, would be met by honourable members of this House with an irresistible storm of disapprobation. 'Our constituents would insist, and properly so, that we ought to be masters in our own house, and that, in matters of the kind, we should permit no one to intervene. In this regard, in their relation as employers to employees, the States stand on a footing of equality with the Commonwealth as to rights and powers in respect to the principle involved. Either Government must, either govern or be governed. Interference by another body, whatever else it may mean or whatever else it may lead to, is a blow levelled at that very sovereignty which is the basic principle of our Federal union in both Federal and State spheres.",16
32,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [10.55] - I was first asked my opinion with reference to the proposal to bring railway servants under the Federal arbitration laws when I was a - candidate for the Senate in 1903. I then .stated that I was opposed to the idea, and I have not heard any argument since to cause me to change my mind. It has a l ways seemed to me to be absolutely wrong that this Parliament should, by means of an Arbitration Court, come between the As employees on the State railways and the Parliaments that employ them, and have to find their wages by means of taxation. The people who are responsible for finding the money are the persons, and they alone, who should have the say as to the fixing of the salaries, either through Commissioners, Parliament, or any other body or Court they think fit. to create. Apart from the principle I have spoken of, the insuperable difficulty of carrying out an award under the proposal before us has always appealed to me. Before a case could get to the Arbitration Court, it must mean that the Government and Parliament of a State had refused the request made by the employees; and thus we should start with the State Parliament and Government opposed to the whole proposal. Suppose we got an award, what would happen? If the railways were managed by Commissioners, as an independent corporation, as in Victoria, and they had sufficient funds in hand, as at the present time, they probably would comply with the award; but an award might mean the expenditure of many thousands of pounds, and, if the Commissioners were short of funds, they would either have to increase fares and freights, decrease the train service, or go to their Parliament, as the Railways Commissioners in Victoria had to do yearly until a few years ago, and ask that the necessary money be placed on the Estimates.. But, supposing that the Government declined to put the money on the Estimatesor suppose that the Government consented, but that Parliament refused to pass the Estimates-wha t would be the position? What would be the next proceeding? The Federal authorities could not stand by and see the decision of a Federal Court flouted; and something would have to take place. We may be told that no State authority would flout a decision of the kind, and so bring themselves, we might almost say, into forcible opposition to the Federal power. But we know what has happened in the past. It is possible that there may be in power in the States men like Sir Hector Carruthers or Mr Wade, who are prepared to fight the Federal Government and all its authorities, by force if necessary, as in the case of the wire-netting. We have to face that possibility; and, should such a state of affairs arise, the original trouble in regard to wages and salaries would be mild compared to that created by the conflict between the two authorities. If we had to resort to force, or the Federal Arbitration Court placed a receiver in charge of the State railways, the last stage of the trouble would be infinitely worse than the first, and no one could foresee the end. I do not think that what I have indicated is beyond possibility. _ If the railways belonged to the Federation, I should have no objection to placing the employees under the Arbitration Court, and applying to ourselves the same rules that we apply to private employers. But that is altogether different from the proposal before us, and, as I intimated when speaking on a former occasion, I intend to vote against this Bill, as I should have done two years ago if there had been an opportunity to separate it from the other powers proposed.",18
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [11.15] - This is one of the most important proposals with which this Parliament has had to deal. The honourable member for Gippsland, who has just resumed his seat, touched the gist of the matter when he spoke of the possibility of conflict between the Federal and State Governments. A dispute between railway employees and the State Government is postulated in the very Bill itself. If the Commonwealth Government is to step in and, possibly, say to the State Governments, ""You must give these railway men what they want, or we shall take the whole matter out of your hands,"" a very serious state of affairs will arise. I ask honourable members to note the language of the proposed amendment. It is to give the Parliament power to legislate forThe prevention and settlement of industrial disputes in relation to employment in the railway service of a State.",19
34,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member voted for this proposal in 1905.,19
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not for this Bill, nor this proposal, but for a proposal then before the House to bring railway servants under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. It was explained by Sir George Reid, and those of us who voted with him on that occasion, that we voted, not on the merits of the case, but for another purpose altogether. We voted to put an end to the alliance in existence at that time.",19
36,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And to bring about a stilt more unholy alliance.,19
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member should be the last to talk about an unholy alliance. While he masquerades as an Independent, we find him voting practically every time with the Government., Every one notes the difference between the way in which he argues for and against a» Government proposal. When he is opposing a Government measure, we hear none of those bitter recriminatory speeches that he is wont to address to the Opposition, and to some of his old colleagues on this side of the House. He simply makes a short statement, as he has done in this case, that he was pledged to vote against such a proposal some years ago, his statement being tantamount to the admission, "" If I could vote for the Government, I should do so, but, being bound as I am, I cannot do so.""'",19
38,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not bound by any party.,19
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but the honourable member has an eye on his electorate every time. .",19
40,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a big railway vote in my electorate, but I have the courage of my opinions. I am not considering that vote in opposing this Bill.",19
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I , too, have a big railway vote in my electorate, and I am going to vote with the honourable member. In considering this Bill, we have to determine, first of all, whether the means which at present exist in the States for the settlement of disputes between State railway servants and State Governments are adequate for the purpose. In New South Wales, the largest State of the Union, there are Wages Boards sitting almost constantly, I believe, and, on the whole, I should think, their results are proving fairly satisfactory to the men.",19
42,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will not give the railway men in Victoria either a Wages Board or the right to go to an Arbitration Court.,19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the honourable member and his party want this proposal carried so as to coerce the Vic1 torian Government.,19
44,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not a matter of coercing.,19
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, in his interjection, has let out the whole secret. It is not because this work can be done better by the Commonwealth, Constitution Alteration [6 DECEMBER, 1912.], (Railway Disputes) Bill. tout because the Victorian Government will not give the raihvay men a Wages Board.",19
46,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are the biggest sweaters in the community.,20
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to bear these interjections, because they show that the point which we ought to consider .first and foremost is as to what right we .have to coerce State Governments in the management of their own properties.",20
48,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are coercing private - employers.,20
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I doubt if that is the case. At all events, it is not the case in my own State. The honourable member for Cook, who is more intimately concerned with railway matters than is the honourable member for Maribyrnong, has said in this House that the conditions on our State railways .are better than those in outside employment. No doubt they are, and I would not have them one whit worse than they are. The only .thought dominating the Labour party in trying to carry this proposal is that there will be a chance of the men .getting before Mr Justice Higgins.",20
50,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not fair to make use of the Judge's name in that way.,20
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope that we may refer to him. The honourable member's colleague did not hesitate to quote in extenso opinions expressed by Mr Justice Higgins regarding the qualities of this legislation, when, in fact, he was taking it upon himself to enter into a controversy with the honourable member for Flinders. Mr J. H. CATTS - He is Judge, anyhow- a good Judge for the posk tion.",20
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Of course he is. But one would imagine just now that he was acting as counsel rather than as Judge.,20
53,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,20
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He is a good Judge, but I should not like to have him against me. He seems to argue altogether too much for a Judge who has to decide issues on a perfectly fair basis.",20
55,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think the honourable member ought to canvass the merits of the learned Justice in his official capacity.,20
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not. I am talking of what he does, and Mr. Speaker ruled the other day that we might discuss his judgments.",20
57,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,20
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think it can be shown that you did not stop another hon6569, orable member from referring to remarks made by Mr Justice Higgins.",20
59,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member proceed?,20
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is strange, Mr Speaker, that while you did not call to order an honourable member opposite when he was citing controversial statements made by the learned Judge, you will not permit me to reply to those statements.",20
61,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not say that.,20
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , why are you pulling me up ?",20
63,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is not entitled to discuss the merits of the Judge.,20
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not. I am discussing what he said in Court. Do you rule, Mr Speaker, that I may not discuss a quotation that was made in this House by another honourable member?",20
65,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall wait until the honourable member proceeds.,20
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am referring . to a statement made by the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and intended as a controversial reply to a statement by the honourable member for Flinders. It is, I think, the first time in the history of the Court in Australia that we have had the presiding Judge in such a Court replying to the statements of politicians.",20
67,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is now going beyond a mere statement. He is criticising the Justice himself, and a good not the statement made by him.",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ver y well, sir, I bow to your ruling, although I confess that I cannot follow it. I understood the' honourable member for Cook to say last night that under this proposed grant of power there would be set up concurrent State and Federal tribunals, either of which could be appealed to by railway employees.",20
69,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This Bill provides, not for an exclusive, but for a concurrent, power.",20
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows very well that under this proposal there will always be an appeal from one of these powers to the other, and that the Federal power will ride supreme over the power appealed from. If this proposal be carried the Commonwealth Court will have the right to step in even before there is a dispute on a State railway and arrange the wages and conditions6570 Constitution Alteration [REPRESENTATIVES.] of labour in spite of anything that the State concerns may do.",20
71,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y after State action fails.,21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is in error.,21
73,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is not an exclusive power.,21
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course, it is. This power relates to conciliation and arbitration for the ""prevention"" as well as the settlement of industrial disputes. Could the Commonwealth as well as the State authorities set about arranging wages and conditions with a view to preventing disputes? Could we have two Wages Boards dealing with the same matter at the same time? The honourable member who makes that suggestion knows very well that if this power be granted we can and must step in before any dispute has matured. This power, if exercised, would give the Federal Government the right to step in where there was no dispute.",21
75,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is ridiculous.,21
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not. The principle which I have just enunciated is that upon which Wages Boards throughout Victoria are constituted. It is not necessary that there should be a dispute in order that a Wages Board may be constituted to deal with a particular trade. Such a board is appointed for the very purpose of so regulating conditions in a trade as to prevent an industrial dispute.,21
77,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does this power deal only with disputes?,21
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but since it provides for the prevention as well as the settlement of disputes, it will give to the Commonwealth the right to regulate the railway services of the States with a view to preventing disputes. If the word "" prevention "" were omitted the honourable member's contention would be right. As it is, the proposal will give the right to the Commonwealth Court to inquire into the whole proceedings of the service from top to bottom. It could appoint Wages Boards, or any other form of inquiry it likes to institute for the purpose of preventing these disputes from coming to a head at all. My point is that, under the power which will be vested in the Commonwealth under this Bill, the Government will be able to investigate the whole of the services of the State railways, and to fix logs for them, even when no dispute has arisen. Consequently, they will be able to control the discipline of the State railways, deter(Railway Disputes) Bill. mine the wages conditions which shall obtain on them, and thus practically take their management out of the hands of the State Governments. The Bill means that, and nothing else.",21
79,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A Judge would need to be stark staring mad to allow that to .be done.,21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has only to imagine,21
81,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member imagines a lot.,21
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then I will not imagine it. I take the statement of the honourable member that the Government of Victoria is the biggest sweater in Australia so far as its railway servants are concerned. The honourable member for Cook has pointed out that the conditions enjoyed by the men. on the New South Wales railways are better than are those enjoyed by the railway servants in this State, owing to the establishment of Wages Boards there. Under thisBill, that will be a sufficient ""justification for the Commonwealth stepping in and making a log for the whole of the Victorianrailways.",21
83,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not mind that.,21
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , why doesthe honourable member say that a Judge would be stark staring mad to do it? It is the very purpose of this legislation.",21
85,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable memberwishes to deprive the railway servants of"" votes.",21
86,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not wish to deprive them of votes or of anything; else. I believe that they are being fairly well treated on the whole by the State Government, and I hope that they will alwaysbe well treated. If there are any men who deserve good treatment, it is those who are employed upon our State railways.",21
87,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They ought to have the same rights as are enjoyed by other men.,21
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Admitte d for-the moment. But that question is quite a different one from that which we are now discussing. Our railway men have as much right as anybody else to justice and fair play. But our Constitution has left the control of our railways in the hands of the States. The States have built their own railways. New South Wales has spent more than £50,000,000 in this direction. While we are going to saddle them with the responsibility of running their railways, and "" of making them:.. pay, we are going to take the control of their employees out of their hands.",21
89,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is the difference between a private employer.and the State as an employer?,22
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The position is - quite different. A. private employer, if he - cannot run his business successfully, may close down. But when we attempt to fix the conditions of employment on State - railways, to be logical we ought to go further and take over the management of rthose railways.",22
91,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I would Like to do that.,22
92,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would not, because I - do not think that we would get justice in Victoria.",22
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is well ""known that there can be no exercise - of concurrent power in connection with matters of sovereignty, and if there is anything which goes to the very core of the sovereignty of the Commonweath and of the States, it is these instrumentalities with-out which the Commonwealth on the one - side, and the State on the other, cannot !be carried on with any degree of success under one form of Federal Government. There is nothing so vital to a State as its ^railways. A State as such cannot exist .without railways. It cannot develop its territory without railways. If we take .from the States the power to manage their own railways, we might as well take over - those railways in their entirety, and I do .not think that would be a good thing to do .at the present time.",22
94,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A lovely Democrat. The - picture of inconsistency.,22
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sure that - the honourable member is a good judge. - He sits there jabbering all the time. Nobody can make any sense out of what he - says. He does not mind how ridiculous - he makes himself. Here is a law-the Constitution itself-whic h clearly disposes of the argument of the honourable member for Cook that there can be two concurrent powers in connection - with this matter. Sec'tion 109 saysWhen a' law of a State is inconsistent with a 'law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent 1 inconsistency, be invalid. Inasmuch as this Bill will confer upon the 'Commonwealth power to make a scale of wages and conditions for the whole of the railways of the States, those States must - inevitably lose the control which they now have over industrial conditions on their railways. The honourable member for East Sydney, who interjected just now, is a good judge of a Democrat. But I would like to remind him that there are many members of his own party to whom his gibe will apply just as much as it does to me. Before he begins gibing at other people I would advise him to go on a missionary enterprise among the members of his own party. I wish now to quote from a speech which was delivered by Mr. MCGowen, the Premier of New South Wales, and which bears on this very point. In speaking of the Unification of the industrial interests of the Continent, he said :With the six States remaining as now, where one State had better wages than others, there was a spirit of friendly emulation amongst the other five, but where they had only the centralized authority, a kind of medium would be struck, and there would be in reality a levelling down for some of the States. . . .",22
96,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,22
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m the debate of two years ago. That is the statement made by Mr MCGowen in the course of aninterview in Sydney during the. currency of that controversy. He was emphatically opposed to the Commonwealth taking over these powers, and he was certainly opposed to the Commonwealth taking over the control of the State railways. He said that the railway men of New South Wales are much better off than are the railway men in the other States, and it was of no use States, where wages and conditions are so much better than they are elsewhere, risking the averaging process which is the very essence of Federal control. Let my honourable friends opposite direct their energies to those States where justice is not being done; where industrial tribunals do not exist, and where conditions are not inaccordance with the high standard of social existence that we have today. But do not let them uniform the whole continent by Socializing its natural features. That is practically what this Bill means when it is resolved into its elements. There are many reasons which determine wages and condiof the tions-reason s which are local, and which have to do with climate and geography. It is idle endeavouring to uniform the whole continent as my honourable friends opposite often seek to do.",22
98,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is a most remarkable man after that.,22
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I doubt if the honourable member in his heart wants this Bill. At any rate, I know, plenty of railway men in New South Wales who do not want it-me n who say that they do not stand to gain anything from a process of this kind. I come now to the question of whether the Government have a right to interfere with the instrumentalities of the States in this radical and drastic waywhether, while leaving the States with their own responsibility, they have a right to step in and say to them, "" We will praotically manage your industrial affairs for you. We will take them out of your hands altogether, and fix such wages and conditions as we think you ought to observe."" When that day arrives it will be time for the States to say to this Parliament, "" As you frame and determine our outgoings, as you frame and determine our income, as by implication, therefore, you insist upon such and such rates being charged, you had better take over the complete control of our railways."" Surely, that is not necessary to insure that ployed upon our State railways shall get a fair and square deal in relation to the work which they are called upon to perform. My own opinion is that things are moving fast in that direction. It has been said that the lot of the railway employ^ has been materially improved of recent years, especially in some of the States. That is emphatically the case in regard to New South Wales employees. Good luck to them, I say. I hope that the improvement of conditions will continue, and that the men will be as well off as they deserve to be, in view of the dangerous nature of their employment, and the responsibilities with which they are intrusted. No man has a greater right to fair treatment than the driver of a railway locomotive.",23
100,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thes e men have thousands of lives in their charge.,23
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . I cannot conceive of any more responsible position than that of a driver of a railway locomotive. He takes his life in his hand every journey he makes. He is entitled to good conditions, and I do not think is in any case overpaid. Indeed, I should like to see that service more highly paid.",23
102,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ye t the honourable member is preventing that. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - No . MCGowen, the Leader of the State Labour party, says that the Government proposals will tend, by the adoption of an averaging process, to bring down the ratesof those who are best off, although, on the other hand, perhaps, the rates of those worse off may be a little improved. Thisaveraging process is not necessary, and will, not contribute to the soundness of our prosperity. Efficiency and prosperity are not likely to be gained by it. But what is proposed now is in keeping with the otherproposals. Every one is to be on the samelevel. To uniform the country as is proposed will in the end create greater inequalities than those we set out to cure. How is a Judge sitting in a Court in one part of Australia to determine the rates of"" wages for engine-drivers in Western Australia, Tasmania, and northern Queensland?",23
103,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has been done for theengine-drivers in private employment.,23
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How long did' it take?,23
105,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not long.,23
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the resultthe men em- considered satisfactory ?,23
107,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,23

109,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-They are better off than they were before.,23
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope so; but matters of this kind can be dealt with moreeasily and better by State authorities than by a central Federal authority. That beifig. my view, I shall vote against the proposal on the ground taken by Mr MCGowen, Mr Beeby, Mr Holman, and many otherLabour members who stand stoutly for State control of State instrumentalities. They say that what is proposed will not benefit the employees, who will be morequickly and more fairly dealt with by Statetribunals, acquainted with and guided by local conditions, than by a slow-moving, conservative, central tribunal.",23
111,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bendigo) [11.36]. - The proposed amendment is worthy of a-, wider discussion and greater ventilation than it has received, and it will be a pity if the debate collapses before honourable members have availed themselves of the opportunity to defend or to criticise it. I agree absolutely with the honourable memMr ber for Parramatta, that the railway servants of the States are entitled to most. favourable consideration, and that, no doubt, is the view of every member of House. One cannot but regret.the manifesservices tations of unrest and disatisfaction in some of the State railway services. Most honvidual orable members would like to see provision made by the Parliaments of the States for the redressing of the grievances of their ployes. I do not like to hear complaints by these men of the insufficiency of their payments, or of the unsuitability of their conditions, because a Government has not the excuse of insufficient financial resources. In many cases the railway authorities the States have not displayed the geneway rosity and liberality which I should like to see displayed, and on which I would insist as much as 1 could, were I a State member. Those who travel frequently by railway cannot but admire the work by the drivers of locomotives, in whose charge are placed so many human lives and such valuable' property. We must recoggreat, nise the dangerous nature of the occupation of a railway locomotive driver, and the greatness of the responsibility attached it. If I had my way, drivers of large engines would receive at least £ 1 a day; but I believe that those of the highest grade receive now only 15s. a day.",23
112,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member ought to be Premier of Victoria for a day or two.,24
113,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have always breaches fexpressed sympathy with jthe employees, but that does not prevent me from freely criticising this proposal of the GovernFederal ment. I doubt whether, in the final test, it would, if adopted, prove successful redressing the grievances of the ployes. At the outset I draw attention to the discrepancy between the title of Bill and the wording of the proposed amendment. The Bill is a Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution by empowercant ing Parliament to make laws with respect to "" industrial disputes in relation ployment in State railway services,"" whereas the enacting clause makes proan vision for legislation for conciliation . arbitration for the prevention and settleone ment of disputes "" in relation to employextending ment in the railway service of any State."" Large Inter-State disputes seem not to provided for, the intention being appadispute, rently that the Federal power should opeservice rate in connection with disputes within given State railway service. This power seems to be too limited in its scope. stead of covering great national upheavals, such as might arise from a strike extendthe ing by sympathy throughout the railway of Australia, it is confined to disputes in the railway services of the indiStates. Whatever justification there might be for giving the Commonwealth jurisdiction in respect to Inter-State disemputes, it cannot be urged in support of a proposal for interference in regard to disputes in the railway service of any particular State. Under this power, the Federal authority will have jurisdiction to interfere in the smallest and most trifling of dispute that may arise in any State railservice. It can be hardly thought necessary to create a Federal tribunal to deal with such disputes, yet, apparently, any dissatisfied individual in the railway service of a State, is to have the right done to appeal to a Federal tribunal. There might be some argument in favour of the Federal authority intervening in a far-reaching dispute, with ramifications in one or two States, not merely to preserve the peace, but to insist on proto vision being made for the carriage of the mails. It has been held in the United States of America that it is quite within the compass of Federal jurisdiction to intervene to prevent any obstruction to the carriage of the mails between two or more States, and it could also be urged that the Federation should intervene to prevent of the peace, or to secure the free flow of Inter-State commerce. That is a Federal idea, and whenever there is necessity for intervention, either in commercial or industrial matters, there in may be strong arguments in favour State emof the amendment of the Constitution. But the amendment before us the is not based on Federal considerations. It gives the Federal authority power to intervene in the most trifling and insignifidispute that may occur in the railway service of a State. The absurdity of such to ema limited form of constitutional amendment is that it might forbid intervention in Inter-State railway dispute, and, perand haps, prevent the Court from settling by hearing and determination, a dispute over two States. If the amendment before us is adopted, the Arbitration be Court will be able to entertain only one namely, a dispute in any railway of a State, to the exclusion of disany putes extending over several State railways, and this is surely inconsistent with In the title of the Bill. It seems to me that either the drafting is inadequate, or that the idea has not been properly expressed; and there may be a breakdown or unexpected consequences if the Federal authority is given jurisdiction over small disputes which might well be left to the railway authorities. That is merely as to the form of the amendment, and now I come to its substance or reality. I ask the House to consider the absolutely antiFederal character of a proposition involving Federal intervention in the government of State instrumentalities. We ought to have a reasonable, working, peaceful Federation, or no Federation at all. Federation means a complete demarcation and cleavage between State functions and State authorities, and Federal functions and authorities. The Federal principle means that there is such a division of power that each of the separate governing agencies is to act within its respective sphere, without overlapping and without any conflict, except such conflicts as may arise in law, which are to be determined by the High Court as the guardian and interpreter of the Constitution and the arbiter between the two governing agencies. This proposition, I submit, is absolutely inconsistent with, and repugnant to, the true principle of Federation. It means the wedge that, if inserted, will in the end shiver our Federation to atoms, because it will be absolutely impossible to preserve the Federal and State areas each independent of the other. The Federal authorities and the State authorities have their rights, powers, and jurisdiction preserved by the Constitution as it stands. here we have an attempt to grant to the Federal authority, or an authority created by Federal law, power without responsibility. It means giving the Federal agency and Court power to intervene in, interfere with, direct, modify, and determine the operations of the State railways without the consequential responsibility. The honourable member for Gippsland, in his short speech this morning, fairly and reasonably summarized the fundamental objections to this proposed amendment, and showed how absolutely unworkable it must be in practice. In each of the States the railways are vested in independent Commissioners who have the power to determine largely, if not completely, the conditions of employment. In New South Wales, I believe, the railway employees, in addition to the jurisdiction of the ComSir John Quick. missioners, have the right to apply to the local Arbitration Court and other industrial authorities. . This is a great concession which I think does not obtain in Victoria.",24
114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is a separate Board of Appeal in South Australia.,25
115,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is for punishments only.,25
116,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At any rate, in New South Wales, where there is a highly developed form of industrial legislation, there are special safeguards; and provisions for appeal over the heads of the Commissioners to an authority outside. That, of course, amounts to an interference with the independent governing of the railways by the Commissioners, but it is an interference by and a reference to another authority created by the State Parliament, which naturally undertakes to honour and carry out the decisions of the extra authority. In the Bill before us, however, it is proposed to create a Federal authority outside the State sphere of action and legislation, and to give that Federal authority the power to decide any railway disputes. Supposing that an award, and possibly a just award, were made in favour of the railway servants of a State, and the Railway Commissioners, backed up by the State Government and Parliament refused to carry it out, what would then be the position? We should have, on the one hand, the Federal authority ordering the award to be carried into effect, and, on the other hand, the State authorities refusing to recognise it. This would bring matters to a deadlock; and if there were no possiBut bility of a settlement, it would mean the chance of a civil war. I should like some competent advocate of this most extraordinary proposition to show how such a problem is to be solved without leading absolutely to the smash up of the Federation.",25
117,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wakefield) [11.55] - I "" y opinion this is a direct m challenge by the Federal authorities to the State authorities. On the occasion of the last referenda the strongest objections were those to the control proposed to be taken over State railways and State instrumentalities, and it was pointed out that if the referenda were carried, the Commonwealth Parliament would have the power to regulate freights on State railways.",25
118,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is not so. Mr RICHARD' FOSTER - That is not so now; and the exception that is made is a recognition of the objections raised on the last occasion, to this Parliament interfering in any way with the Railway Commissioners, so far as freights are concerned. The exemption of the railways under the trade and commerce power is an evidence that the Government are satisfied that the case of the other side in this respect was a good one, and that they made a mistake on the last occasion. In this Bill, however, the Government seek control over the railway servants of the various States. Of course there may be justification for discontent at times amongst railway servants, but, as a matter of fact, the men employed on the State railways of this country are better provided for than any other section of the industrial community. That view is borne out by information to the effect that the applications are always much more numerous than the vacancies in the Victorian railway service. I protest against any attempt to interfere with the control of the railway servants of the States, because it cannot have any other effect than to destroy the efficiency of the services.",25
119,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [12.0] - It is contended that these proposals are unnecessary, and too wide and sweeping in their nature. Dealing with this general charge and applying it first of all to the question of the corporation power, the honourable and learned member for Flinders said that the proposed power was unnecessarily wide for the purpose of enabling us to pass a general companies law, and would not assist us materially to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies. In support of this argument, he quoted Eddy on Combinations. I must remind him and the House that on a previous occasion he also quoted Eddy in support of the general contention, which he then very strongly advanced, that the States could not deal with this matter at all, and that it was necessary to vest in the Commonwealth Parliament sufficient power to deal with it. As for me, I shall leave Eddy alone. He is a fountain, so to speak, under which we may all hold our pannikins. The honourable member for Flinders' argument is that this corporation power is too wide, because it gives us more authority than is necessary for the purpose; that it will create confusion; because, he says, it will mean one law for persons and another law for companies. He quoted, in support of his contention, from the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins in the Huddart Parker case. The learned Justice, when giving his decision against the validity of sections 5 and 8 of the Anti-trust Act, to which I shall refer later, said, referring to the argument for the CrownI f it is right, the Federal Parliament is in a position to frame a new system of libel laws applicable to newspapers owned by corporations, while the State law of libel would have to remain applicable to newspapers owned by individuals If it is right, the Federal Parliament may enact that no foreign^' or trading, or financial corporation shall pay its employees less than 10s. a day, or charge more than 6 per cent, interest, whereas other corporations and persons would be free from such restrictions. If it is right, the Federal Parliament can enact that no officer of a corporation shall fie an Atheist or a Baptist, or that all must be teetotallers. If it is right, the Federal Parliament can repeal the Statute of Frauds for contracts of a corporation. . . That is a rather picturesque application of the reductio ad absurdum argument. I take no exception to it . There it is for what it is worth, and we have to ask ourselves what it is worth. The answer is, it is worth very little. It can be applied to anything. It can certainly be applied to our power to pass laws with respect to banking and insurance. I shall so apply it If it is right, the Federal Parliament is in a position to frame a new system of libel laws applicable to newspapersowned by banking and insurance corporationswhile the State law of libel would have to remain applicable to newspapers owned by individualsand companies such as banking and insurance corporationsI f it is right, the Federal Parliament may enact that no banking or insurance corporationshall pay its employees less than ios. a day, or charge more than 6 per cent, interest, whereas other corporations and persons would be free from such restrictions. If it is right the Federa' Parliament can enact that no officer ofan insurance or banking corporationshall be an Atheist or a Baptist. What is there in such an argument ? We have power now, and have always had power, to deal as we please with insurance and banking corporations, whether they be in a State or not. We have power to determine the law of libel in regard to newspapers issued by such corporations. We have power to deal with them in every phase of their operations. We have never used the power in such absurd fashion. This Parliament would never do so. No Parliament would be so utterly foolish as to attempt to do so. There is nothing in this kind of criticism at all, and the honourable member for Flinders, in seeking to apply it to the Bill before the House, did himself an injustice. It was not his usual method, since it is not argument at all. Let us come to his argument. The honourable member says that we ought not to have a law applicable to persons differing from a law applicable to panies. I do not agree with that statement, even if it were true that the granting of the power would have that result. Regard must be had to circumstances. A method suitable for dealing with one variety of felines, for instance, is not suitable for all. One does not treat a domestic cat and a tiger in the-same way, although both are cats. Methods sufficient for dealing with a small individual trader are quite sufficient to control the great Steel or Oil Trust. Methods suited to restrain a boy of ten or twelve years of age are futile and absurd when applied to an athlete in training, or to a strong man determined to use all his strength against us. The law in regard to corporations is not necessarily the same, nor ought it to be the same, as the law with regard to persons. is a potency in numbers, and we^ must recognise and prepare for it. In order that equal treatment should be meted out to all, whether they be great corporations or individuals, the law must have in its armoury a variety of weapons so as to be equally effective against all. As to the honourable member's contention that confusion would arise, I should like to know how it would occur. The honourable member's argument may be answered in two ways. First of all, there can be no confusion, for if we get that for which we are asking there will be, not two authorities, but one. We shall have authority under the trade and commerce power to deal with persons; we shall have authority under the corporation power to deal with corporations. Very well. There is no room for confusion in such a case. But suppose we get this power, and do not get the trade and commerce power. Is there anything wrong about that; ought we not still to have this power? Supposing we did have power to deal with corporations, why should the honourable member think that this Parliament would be so childish and absurd as to exercise that power to the extent and in the direction he has mentioned? Why should he suggest that, if Mr Hughes, we had power over corporations, we could decree that none but a Baptist should get employment in corporations; that a person who was not an athiest should not be employed by a corporation, or that none but teetotallers should be given employment. We have not exercised in that way the very great powers now vested in us. Need I remind the House that we have exercised them in a way which com- led the honourable member for Flinders, when speaking in this chamber in 1910, to say, "" Why not trust this Parliament and the people?"" When this measure was before the House in 1910 the honourable member certainly did not approve it. But, at the same time, I am bound to say that the grave and terrible consequences which he outlined the other day of obtaining such a grant qf power, did not then in- appear to him. At any rate, he did not tell us about them. Mr W. H: IRVINE - The honourable gentleman is entirely wrong there.",26
120,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have read the honourable member's speech very carefully.,27
121,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I used exactly the same argument, and I gave exactly the same illustrations, as I did before. There Mr HUGHES - The honourable member cannot get in a speech at this stage. I will say, again, if it will please the honourable member, that he did not approve this Bill in 1910, and that he does not approve it now. But the dangers which the honourable member now foresees, as attendant upon this proposed grant' of power, did not appear to strike him in 1910, or, at all events, he did not lay them before the House. Mr W. H . IRV-INE - That is where the honourable member is wrong.",27
122,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I wish to point out that the power for which we are asking is one which was believed by this Parliament, and in particular by the honourable member for Ballarat and his followers, to be actually vested in the Commonwealth. We are asking for power to deal with corporations. The honourable member for Flinders, in support of his contention that we we asking for too wide a power, said it was sufficient that we should deal with the status of corporations-dea l with them at their birth and at their death. I entirely disagree with him. The point is that we have no power now to deal with the behaviour of corporations. For all practical purposes we have no power to deal with them at all. That was clearly laid down in the Huddart Parker case. We cannot now pass a general companies law. It was certainly understood before the decision in that case that we had such a power. The Parliament acted not only upon that assumption, but on much more. The Parliament assumed that we had power to deal with the behaviour of corporations. I will prove it. When the Australian Industries Preservation Act was before this House, sections 5 and 8 were inserted to give that very power which the honourable member says it is necessary we should have. Section 5 provides that any foreign corporation, or trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth, that enters into any - contract, or engages in any combination with intent to restrain trade, or to destroy or injure, by means of unfair competition, any Australian industry, shall be guilty of an offence punishable by a penalty of £500. Under section 8, it was declared that any foreign corporation, or trading or financial corporation, formed within the Commonwealth which monopolized or attempted to monopolize trade or commerce, - should be guilty of an offence, and liable to a penalty of A 5 ° ° - The judgment in the Huddart Parker case decided, however, that those provisions were ultra vires of the Constitution. Therefore they have not been effective. It was at the instigation of the honourable member for Ballarat that the House inserted those provisions in the Bill. The honourable member was then, I think, Prime Minister, and he, and many of those now associated with him, heartily supported them. The Parliament approved the proposal. We have, therefore, a distinct recognition of the fact that the Government and the Parliament of that day believed that we had power, not merely over the States, but also over the behaviour of corporations. It was thought then that we had that power, and that it ought to be exercised. I see no less reason for its exercise today. Surely the need for it is not less now than in 1908. When the honourable member for Darling Downs, who had charge of the Bill providing for an amendment of the Anti-Trust Act, was dealing with it in this House, he said, in urging its acceptance^Our investigation leads us to believe that. In order that we may effectively cope with the it is necessary for us to secure the powers which the Bill provides. - Speaking of combines, he said- They are exercising their powers to the ment of the public. I would emphasize the point that the honcontrol us. orable member was referring to combines, including companies and corporations, covered by sections 5 and 8 of the Anti-Trust Act, which have since been held to be ultra vires. He went on to sayand it is because they are doing so that it is necessary for us to take action and to ask for these powers. The powers for which this Bill provides are not unknown to other countries, or even to our own law. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs was very emphatic. Admittedly, the honourable member for Flinders, if he approved of that provision, did so in a very lukewarm way. He is opposed to this proposal; but I may point out to him that he is now associated with those who supported it by ties so intimate that he cannot very well dissociate himself from them, their sayings, and their actions. Those who are associated with him heartily supported and advocated the passing of legislation providing for the very thing which we are now asking power to do-to control the behaviour of corporations. There is no power in the Commonwealth to even make a general company law, no power to deal effectively with corporations at all ; yet there is no sphere of human activity which demand the rule of law more. The field occupied by corporations, according to the very unsatisfactory statistics at our disposal, shows that in Australia there are ^300,000,000 invested in companies. Are we to have no control over a field in which this vast amount of capital is invested? Are our functions in regard to corporations to be confined merely to officiating over their entrance into the world, to bury them when they go out of the world, and to permit them to do what harm they may choose while they are here ? Are we to sit still while they behave as they please, to the detriment of the public? Is that the application of the advice, intimate and profound, which the honourable member gave us in 1910, when he counselled us to "" Trust the National Parliament."" There ought to be control of the conduct of corporations, as well as power to usher them into the world, and power to wind them up. I submit that companies stand in the same relation to evil, the community as children do to indifor viduals. Companies are the children of modern society. How absurd is the contention that society should not have power detrito control the behaviour of its own children. We must control them or they will Companies are the units by which commerce is now largely carried on. Corporations are largely the units of trusts. The honourable member says that it is not so. But I say that corporations are the warp . and woof of trusts and combines, that the overwhelming majority of the trusts and combines throughout the world are made up of the aggregation of companies, and that the great power with which the Sherman Act is vested is the power to dissolve trusts into their constituent elements, that is, into separate companies. Are we not to follow those elements and scrutinize their subsequent actions ? Are we to say, "" Get ye gone to your homes"" and then to lose control over them? How absurd to lose control just at the moment when control is most necessary. The honourable member for Flinders directed the same argument towards clauses 5 and 8 of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill as he has employed against the. general power which will be conferred by this Bill. While the honourable member for Darling Downs was speaking on that measure in 1908 he interjectedThe honourable member is proposing that a medicine which is suitable for a man in a raging fever shall be taken by a man who wishes to avoid a cold in his head.",27
123,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . But we all know that revention is much better than disease. onorable member's contention is that we should leave combines alone. He says in effect of a combine, "" It is only a little chap. Give him a hiding and that will cure him. After he grows up you can if you like, put him in gaol."" We know that the evils exist in the United States I say that the honourable member adopted towards this proposal an attitude which placed him in complete antagonism to those gentlemen who are responsible for almost every piece of legislation, including the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which was enacted by this Parliament before the Labour party came into office. To all, or nearly all, of this legislation the honourable and learned member for Flinders was consistently opposed. Yet now his former opponents hang upon his lightest word. His every utterance is inscribed upon tablets. The Opposition now tell the citizens, with an air of finality, "" He has said it . "" But when he said the very same thing in 1908 what did they do? They either voted him down or treated him with indifference, because the Bill embodying the principles which he then and now denounces, became law. The corporation power is the necessary complement of the trade and commerce power. The power asked for is not too Mr Hughes. wide. Less would be futile for any purpose, no matter how limited. I wish to say a word or two upon this phase of the matter. We have had an ample exhibition of the results of this Parliament taking, to itself insufficient power. Section 51,. , sub-section xx. of the Constitution providesThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace,, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to foreign corporationsand trading or financial corporations formed"" within the limits of the Commonwealth. It was thought that that provision vested this Parliament with power over corporations-no t only over their status, but over their behaviour. It was a contention which was based upon sound ground. In the Constitution which was drafted by the Federal Convention in 1891 it was proposed to vest in the Commonwealth power over the status of corporations only. But in the Constitution which was framed in Adelaide in 1897 the word "" status "" was deliberately omitted, and the Bill provided for vesting in the Commonwealth power over corporations without any words of limitation. The history of the Federai movement shows that as the Federal idea developed there was a tendency to vest The more and more authority in this Parliament, and consequently the honourable member for Ballarat was perfectly right in assuming that we had power over the behaviour of corporations. He acted upon 3 that assumption, and embodied the principle in the . Anti-Trust Act. But the High Court declared that, in spite of the plain words of paragraph xx. of section 51, we had not the power. Is not this lesson plain enough for every citizen to learn? Is it not clear that unless we have full powers over corporations we havenone? That power we are asking for now. That power he thoughtwe ought to havein 1908, and most of those whosit with the honourable member thought the same. The honourable member for Darlings Downs was emphatic about it in 1908.. Why has he changed his opinion ? Its possession will give rise to no confusion. There will be no dual control. Unless this Parliament becomes lunatic, there will be none of the absurd and foolish abuses of power at which the honourable member has hinted. We could now, if we chose, abuse our power of taxation by taking 19s. 6d. out of every £ i earned in this country. We could abuse our powers of defence. But Parliament does not do these things. Parliaments are conditioned by their environment, and are controlled by the people; Constitution Alteration [6 DECEMBER, 1912.] (Railway Disputes) Bill. I come now to the other Bill dealing with the proposal to amend the Constitution to give Parliament power to make laws .'in regard to trusts, combinations, and monopolies relating to manufacture or the production or supply of goods or services. The honourable member for Flinders said yesterday that this Bill would lead us into a legal impasse. He said that the power to deal with trusts, combines^ and monopolies in regard to the production of goods - or the supply of services would create very great difficulty, and would involve Parliament in endless confusion owing to the - divided control of the power to interpret the word ""monopolies."" He said that in regard to the Constitution Alteration -(Nationalization of Monopolies) Bill, Parliament had power to interpret that word, tout that in regard to monopolies in this Bill, the High Court would interpret it. He airged that there would be a clash of authority. He was asked if he could define the term ""monopolies,"" and he replied "" No . "" When dealing with . the matter upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I said that "" monopolies "" was a word which, so far, defied definition; that an attempt to define it only led - to more and more confusion. But whilst we cannot define a monopoly, it is quite simple to understand what a monopoly is. The honourable member for Flinders - argued that there will be a clashing of authority, and that as a result this Bill will be useless. Let us set out the position. The Bill deals with only - one class of combination, or trust, or monopoly, and not with all classes. with monopolies which affect the manufacture of goods or the supply of services. It does not deal with monopolies in regard to trade and commerce, or with combines in - regard to trade and commerce, but merely in regard to manufacture. In short, it provides the supplementary power to the trade and commerce power, so that very much of --the honourable member's ingenious argument falls to the ground, because it does not relate to all the trusts, combines, and monopolies, but only some of them. In brief, .this is a measure to enable us to get over the decision in E. C. Knight v. United .States, which I quoted the other day. That lays down quite distinctly that the trade and commerce power does not authorize us - to deal with trusts and combines in relation to manufacture. Therefore, even if - the full trade and commerce power is granted as we ask, we shall still be unable to deal with trusts and combinations and 6579 monopolies in regard to manufacture. That is, we shall have no power over half the subject. So much for that point. The Bill deals with trusts, combinations, and monopolies-the e things-and we shall have power over all, and not over monopolies merely. We may enact that any combination which does so and so shall be liable to such and such consequences. Now, a combination can be dealt with without reference to whether it is a monopoly or not; it is sufficient if it is a combination. A trust can be dealt with without reference to a monopoly. It is sufficient if it is a trust. Suppose that, under the proposed amendment of the Constitution, a Bill relating to trusts, combines, or monopolies, were passed, what the prosecution would have to prove is either the existence of a trust, or a monopoly, or a combine. It must prove one ot these three things in relation to manufacture or the supply of service. It need prove only one. Therefore, the interpretation of the word ""monopoly"" is not essential to the exercise of the power at a U - l f c J s effective without the word. The honourable member for Flinders says that there may be a clash of interpretation. Let us1 see if there can be. He has assumed that this Parliament will take no notice of a decision of the High Court, and that the High Court will take no notice of a decision of this Parliament. What reason has he for saying so? Suppose that a decision of this Parliament precedes a judgment of the High Court as to what is It deals a monopoly, are we to assume that the High Court will take no notice of that decision ?",29
124,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not even be evidence before the High Court.,30
125,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say that it would. But the same evidence which is before the High Court could be before this Parliament. That is to say, this Parliament is composed of men who are as well able to express an opinion of what is a monopoly as is anybody else. The honourable member himself pointed out that the High Court is so far from certain as to the meaning of the word ""monopoly,"" that one Justice says, "" This is a monopoly,"" while two others say, "" It is not a monopoly."" But he does not urge that as a reason why the High Court should not have the power which is vested in it. He says, in effect, "" You may come to loggerheads as much as you like."" Why, sir, how can there be more confusion than at present? The High Court, according to the honourable member's argument, may be quite unable to agree as to the meaning of a plain word. That is not material. They may be safely trusted to give a decision on something upon which they cannot agree. But if the Parliament differs from the interpretation which the majority of the Court put upon any word, that would be dreadful. Why! It is high time we understood where we are. Plain words are no longer plain. The High Court is going to tell us what "" industry"" means. At present it does not know. We were all under the impression that we knew. But evidently we do not. The Chief Justice of the High Court says that it is the most elusive and subtle of words. This declaration has so unsettled my opinion, that I propose to ask the House to amend the Constitution Alteration (Industrial Matters) Bill, so as to make quite clear what we mean, if by y words at our command we can do so. The High Court cannot agree as to what is the meaning of the word "" monopoly."" Here is the definition of it as set forth in the American cases. In the Standard Oil case, the dictum in the Mogul case was cited that "" Exclusion by competition is not monopolizing."" It was held thatMonopolizing within the Act-the Sherman Act-is the appropriation of trade by means of contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, or other unlawf u l or tortious acts whereby "" the subject in general is restrained from that liberty of . . . trading which he had before."" In United States of America v. E. C. Knight, 156, United States Reports, it was laid down that All the authorities agree that in order to vitiate a contract or combination it is not essential that its result be a complete monopoly. The Sherman Act provides thatEvery person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of trade or commerce, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour. The judgment from which I am quoting continuesI t is sufficient if it really tend to that end, and to deprive the public of the advantages which Sow from free competition. In the Northern Security cases, 196, United States Reports, 197, it was held thatIt need not be shewn that the combination in effect results or will result in a total suppression of trade, or in a complete but it is only essential to show by its necessary operation it tends to restrain Inter-State or International trade or commerce. Mr Hughes. In the case of the Standard Oil Company v. United States of America, 221, United' States Reports, 25, this was laid downNeither did Congress have in mind an absolute monopoly. This can only be obtained by legislative grant. In a country like ours, whereevery one is free to enter the field of industry,, no absolute monopoly is probable. It is sufficient to bring it within the act of the combination if the aggregation of capital tends to monopoly or is reasonably calculated to bring, about the things forbidden. In the case of the American Tobacco Company, 220, United States Reports, 106, it was shown that the combination controlled at least 75 per cent, of the whole trade in tobacco, and this was held to be a monopoly; but our Court has said that where 90 per cent, of a trade is controlled it is not a monopoly. Under the circumstances, I think we are doingright in asking for power to enable this a n Parliament to determine what a monopoly is. I cannot see why it should not be able to do so. It does not matter whether a combination absolutely excludes all persons from trading, if it tends to exclude them. If it substantially interferes with free opportunities, that is sufficient. As for this Bill, it is very necessary. It will not create confusion; it will prevent it. We are not confined tomonopolies. It will be sufficient that there is a trust or a combine. It does not matter whether we establish that there is a monopoly or not. If there is a combination, or if it is a corporation, we shall have power to deal with it, whether it is a monopoly or not. The honourable member for Flinders spoke about the clashing of the two authorities, but why should there be a clashing? The honourable member for Maribyrnong asked whether the Inter-State Commission could not decide this?To that the honourable member replied. "" No."" The honourable member for Maribyrnong then asked, "" Suppose the Inter-State Commission investigated a corporation and determined that it was a monopoly."" To that the honourable member for Flinders replied- "" The Inter-State Commission will have no authority whatever to determine the matter."" I ask the honourable member, ""Why not?"" The Inter-StateCommission can be given this power, and I see no reason why it should not be given* the power. Somebody must make inquiries. This Parliament appoints Royal Commissions or other bodies to make inmonopoly, quiries ; it does not do the work itself. Later the honourable membersaid, "" This is the very policy w t advocate."" It is the first time that I have with, heard of it. What does ""we"" mean? tion in Does it mean the honourable gentleman whether when opposing the policy of his colleagues, ©r his colleagues when opposing him.",30
126,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I referred to the policy of the Opposition as announced m this debate by its leader.,32
127,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There has been no suggestion by any one on that question of deciding what a monopoly is should be remitted to the Inter-State Comin its. mission. Certainly it is not the policy of superior honourable members opposite. I admit that accept. their policy is Protean; it changes from hour to hour, from election to election, so provided that no one can be blamed for standing it. One other point and I have done. The honourable member for Flinders said that since this Bill dealt with ''monopolies,"" which we could not define, and which the High Court would interpret, and since we propose to fix prices in regard to "" polies,"" the power for which we ask is vague and indefinite, and its exercise would be uncertain and of little use. My reply to the honourable member's argument is, first, that the power covers trusts and bines as well as monopolies. And, second, it is not proposed to regulate only prices controlled by monopolies. I said ' somement thing very different. I said that where there is free competition prices are reguteously lated by the law of supply and demand. There is no need for the law to interfere in such cases. The law of supply and mand operates under those circumstances. But when free competition ceases from cause to operate by reason of a combinaand conditions of work. tion, a ring, or an understanding, honorbunals able or otherwise, it is the business of the Parliament to see that the comwhole, munity is not exploited. It is untrue say that the law of supply and deis mand determines all prices at the predemand. sent time. The honourable member Flinders, in all his illustrations, exhibited a total inability to grasp some of the mon facts of Hfe. That is not to his dis8s. credit. Happily for him he has not had to delve and dive into these matters some of us have had to do. regarding trade axe those of a philosopher rather than of a man of affairs. In ing with this question of prices, let us go and demand? back to first principles. The honourable member saysI believe in the organization, both of capital and labour. I believe that it must go on, that it is an essential condition of modern gress. We must have continually increases of, and more complex organization in connection, capital, manufacture, labour, and producall their forms. But combinations, of capitalists, manufacturers, fruit growers, dairymen, producers, artisans, or workmen, are all subject to the same possible evils, and require the same kind of regulation. With those views I am in cordial agreement, and I thank the honourable member for so ably expressing my own views. I said, side that the speaking on the Bill I believe.in co-operation. I believe that both principles and its results it is so obviously to competition that sensible, civilized men can scarcely hesitate as to which they will Combination, instead of cut-throat competition, is very much better for the people, that it exists for the benefit of the people and not for the benefit of the few who misundercontrol the combination.",32
128,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are not agreed there. The honourable member states that organization excludes competition.,32
129,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Le t me now state the first principles of this phase of the economonomic position. The people have determined that every citizen of Australia shall have the opportunity to live under decent conditions. No semblance of serfdom, of absolute and servile dependence on the will comof another, is to exist if the people can by any means prevent it. To that policy Australia is committed. The duty of Parliais to see that every citizen gets a fair show, that the opportunities so bounprovided by Nature are made available to all. We have adoptedothe principle that a fair and reasonable return must be degiven for labour, embodied^-it in our legislation, and have established State any and Federal tribunals to regulate wages These trisay to every man that comes before them, "" Your labour is worth, on the so much, and you must be paid so to much."" That is an interference with what called the natural law of supply and Although, in a condition of free for competition, some men might be compelled to sell their labour for 6s. a day, comif a Court says that they must be paid or ios., they must get the larger amount. That is an interference with natural conas ditions to insure fair and reasonable opHis ideas portunities to all. Will any one say it is not a proper interference with what dealis called the natural law of supply But there is a sphere into which we have barely entered. What does a man work for? Not for £ 2 or or £ 4 a week-so many sovereigns and placed in his hand-bu t for a given quanprotity of commodities; he sells his labour for what he requires to eat and wear, and what is necessary for the maintenance, education, and recreation of himself and family. If the prices of these essentials to civilized man are raised by persons who have absolute control of the supply of them, if there is no competition for the sale or supply of such things, what becomes of the policy which has received the benediction of the Opposition, and the approval of every elector, or 99 out of every 100 electors, in the country? If prices are fixed by rings and wages by law, then to raise wages helps very little, for increased prices will always absorb every increase of wages. We have to lay down the principle that wherever the assurance of a fair and reasonable wage to all men is interfered with by anything which prevents the consumer getting the benefits of free competition, and by means of which the price of the necessary commodities and services are fixed by private individuals for their own benefit, then this Parliament ought to have the power to remove the restriction and insure either free competition, or, at any rate, fair prices. That is the .principle and the position. When we interfere with the law of supply and demand - in wages we must necessarily interfere with - the law of supply and demand in other directions. Wages are only another side of prices. If I receive £3 a week when prices are 100, and prices increase to 120, : my wage is no longer £3. been reduced by 20 per cent. - far from confining ourselves to monopolies in this matter, I lay down the broad principle that where there is free competition, there is no necessity to attempt, and we ought not to attempt, to - regulate prices which are then naturally 'brought down to that margin of profit above the cost of production which pays a man to - engage in the business. Trusts and combines, as Hobson has put it, are not satisfied with the fair profit received from a - fair competitive price, but raise their prices - so as to extort an excessive profit. There is just the difference between such ex' ploitation of the public and fair profit, that there is between interest and usury. We do not object to a man receiving a fair return on his capital, any more than we - object to a workman receiving a fair return for his labour; but when it is left to private individuals to fix the price of the - necessaries of life of every man, woman, and child in the community, is there to be - no power to review, to consider, or even to Mr Hughes. inquire into the circumstances under which they fix those prices? That is an intolerable and impossible state of affairs. I now turn to the industrial side of the question, only emphasizing in passing, that the position, as laid down by me, has not only been recognised by the Leader of the Opposition but has been put in practice by him, not in the way I propose, but in, at all events, a crude, if not barbaric, fashion. The honourable and learned member even fixed prices by .statute, and laid it dpwn that harvesters must be sold at a certain price under penalty. In speaking of that measure, the Leader of the Opposition saidThe intention was that the cash price should be fixed by lawThere is nothing ambiguous about that and that the credit price would, in consequence, be adjusted more or"" less accurately in relation thereto That does not show that Parliament was deceived or misled, but merely that it did not pass an Act which was as effectual as it might have made it under more favourable conditions. But I am assured that the Act has been efficient, and that the cash prices fixed by law are being charged today, also that the credit prices have been affected. That is a clear and undeniable statement by the Leader of the Opposition that it was desirable to fix prices, in a way which I think crude and do not approve. He made Parliament fix the price of harvesters, and Parliament is notoriously the It has most unfit body to do such work. So My time is almost up. I must hurry along. It is said that the power in relation to labour and employment is too wide; but that is what is said of every one of the powers proposed. However, the honourable member for Flinders, who is our unfailing source of inspiration-ou r rock of agessaid in 1910, in reference to the industrial powersBut whatever legislation we may pass, we cannot, unless we give the Central Parliament the final and super-eminent control, deal effectually with all the cases which may arise. . . . .1 do not see what we have to be afraid of. We, on this side, should not be afraid to give this Parliament a wider power because the governing political party is strongly opposed to us on these matters.",32
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What does the honourable member mean by giving this Parliament supereminent control?,33
131,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I mean the ultimate legislative power, so that the laws of the State shall be subordinate to its laws, if it makes any. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to that statement. Let him ponder over it. The honourable member for Flinders pointed out what is undeniably true, namely, that every word of the power as it stands in sub-section xxxv. has been the subject of endless debate, which is even now going on. When the honourable and learned member spoke, we thought that we knew what "" industry "" . and "" dispute"" meant; but we now find that we were in error. The honourable member said that this Parliament ought to have authority to make super-eminent laws. We are asking for that, and nothing short of it will do. The honourable member for Ballarat said, in the most unambiguous way, that the National Parliament should have power to make laws in reference to industrial matters in every protected industry. He did not then bother about State rights. On the contrary, he said that he was tired of waiting for the States to do something-in his own words, that it was hopeless to expect them to do anything. In the face of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition asked for such powers, that the new Protection policy is founded on fixing fair prices for the consumer and fair and reasonable wages for the workers in all protected industries, and the honourable member for Flinders said that this Parliament should have super-eminent power in this connection. Why should we not have this power ? Why should this Parliament not have an opportunity to maintain industrial peace? There never was greater need of such a power. According to the newspapers of this very day, we are now confronted with the possibility of a great maritime strike. In two words I shall tell the House the actual position. Some months ago the Arbitration Court made an award in reference to the Merchant Service Guild, which is composed of masters and officers employed on Australian ships. That award covered persons employed in Intra-State boats. An application was quite recently made for an order of prohibition. The application is now before the High Court. The Guild has stated that if the award is held to be ultra vires in regard to Intra-State shipping, they will lay-up all ships; and there is no power iri Australia that has jurisdiction to prevent that strike. If a strike be averted, it will not be because of the law, but because of the power and influence of organizations which honourable members opposite affect to despise. But this is an anomalous and even dangerous position. There ought to be no dispute outside, the power of the law to deal with. There ought to be power under the law to insure that, when a Court has fairly considered the merits of a case, and laid down conditions, those conditions shall be faithfully carried out by both masters and men. If the High Court declares that the Arbitration Court has no power to deal with Intra-State shipping, the members of the Guild will be denied what the Arbitration Court held to be fair and reasonable, and industrial peace will be seriously menaced. The objection that the powers asked for are too wide is the bogey which is continually being 'conjured up by honourable members opposite-it is the. bogey that the honourable member for Ballarat denounced when he was confronted with an Opposition led by the honourable member for Parramatta, who talked of new Protection and many other things with which the honourable member for Ballarat was at that time doing something more than coquetting. We are told of the many dangers of granting these wide powers, and yet only two years ago we were assured by the man on whom chief reliance is placed now for stating the constitutional position for the Opposition that Parliament ought to be intrusted with such powers. How are we to maintain industrial peace when there is not uniformity of laws-n o power to make super-eminent, laws-whe n before a case can be settled by the Arbitration Court 500 respondents have to be cited? As a matter of fact, in the Builders and Labourers case there are close on 500 respondents, each of whom has the right to be heard. The Tramways cases are being protracted simply because practically the same facts are being heard five or six times over. In my opinion, industrial peace is more precious to this country than even the opportunity pf honourable members opposite to get into office. Most emphatically, the proper and most straightforward course for honourable members opposite would be to declare that these powers are necessary, but that Labour men ought not to be allowed to exercise them; they should straight out declare that the powers should be intrusted to themselves, and not to a Labour Government. That would be an honourable and statesmanlike policy to place before the people. Tfie honourable member for Flinders, two years ago, made a speech to that effect-wh y does he not do so now? We on this side have not changed our policy in this matter. We have always advocated certain principles; we advocate them now. We demand a fair and reasonable wage for all workers, and fair and reasonable prices for consumers. We ask that every person in the community shall be protected, and that Archibald, W. O. there shall be fair laws for all men, rich Bamford, F. W.' and poor, whether they be corporations or Brennan, Frank individuals. In commercial trading or Brown, Thomas manufacturing pursuits, we ask that there .Cann, G. shall be vested in this Parliament power to Carr, E. S. secure industrial peace, and to stimulate Chanter, J. M . the commercial and industrial l if e of the Charlton, M . country-powe r to insure to all fair and equal opportunities to a fair share 'of that Fisher, A. abundance that God intended for all.",33

Clause 2Section fifty-one of the Constitution is altered by omitting from paragraph (xxxv.) the words "" Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State,"" and inserting in their stead the words"" Labour, employment, and unemployment, including(a) the terms and conditions of labour and employment in any trade,, industry, or calling; (b) the rights and obligations of employers and employees; (c) the maintenance of industrial peace; and (d) the settlement of industrial disputes.""",35
133,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney - At torney-General) [2.28] - I move That after the word ""Labour"" the word -"" and "" be inserted. I move the amendment so that the words ""Labour,"" ""employment,"" and ""unemployment "" shall be taken as standing each by itself. As it stands, ""employment"" and "" unemployment"" may be regarded as qualifying "" Labour.""",37
134,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the amendment intended to make the scope of the clause wider ?,37
135,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Possibly . I think that the amendment is desirable in view of what has been said by the Chief Justice of the High Court. Wewish to have power to make laws in respect to labour, and employment, and unemployment. I do not know what ""Labour"" means, though I Tcnow what ""employment"" means, and what "" unemployment"" means. Amendment agreed to.",37
136,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney - At torney-General) [2.30] - I move That after the word "" industry,"" line 11, the - word "" occupation "" be inserted. I make the amendment for what it is worth, having read the remarks of the - Chief Justice in the Merchant Service Guild case with very great care, interest, and some perturbation of spirit. I have searched the dictionary, and it is the best word that I can find for the purpose.",37
137,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [2.31] - It is diffi-cult for the Opposition to know what the Attorney-General means if he is not con'scious of his own meaning. I remember raising the question whether the leading words "" Labour, employment and unemployment "" were of equal weight, or - whether the Latin phrase ejusdem generis would apply. I take it that the title of .the Bill will govern the meaning of the word ""occupation,"" otherwise it may be - taken to cover other than industrial matters. That has been the rule adopted by the High Court, which has looked at the title of a Bill to get a general idea as to its scope. It is not intended to widen the scope of the Bill to cover every possible - occupation or calling.",37
138,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [2.32] - The Chief Justice said, in the Merchant Service Guild case, that "" industry "" is a most subtle and elusive word. It may be held not to include ""occupation."" Possibly ""calling"" does not include ""occupation."" ""Occupation "" may include those who are not included in "" industry."" The late Mr Justice O'Connor held that marine engineers were doubtfully included within the operation of the Act. Theirs is not a profession in the ordinary sense of the term as applied to the practice of law or medicine, nor can it be said to be a calling in relation to labour. If the word "" labour"" governed the remaining parts of the clause, it is doubtful whether they would be included, and we are desirous of including them.",37
139,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [2.34] - On e wants to know what to tell the people is the meaning of this measure; if we do. not know what it means, we had best ask them to reject the proposal it contains. I ask for information with a view to helping the Government. I do not think that the meaning of the word "" industry"" in general was discussed in the Merchant Service Guild case - heard last week in Sydney, at which I was present all the time. There were a few casual observations as to the meaning of the word "" industry,"" but the point raised in the case was whether a voyage between two ports within a State could be said to be the same, or part of the same industry as a voyage between ports in different States.",37
140,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Chief Justice said, "" Tell us what you mean by ' industry.'""",37
141,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the meaning of the word was discussed in the Jumbunna case and in the Engineers' case, but it was held by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Isaacs that the difficulty arose rather under the"" terms of the Act than under the terms of the Constitution, the definition of the Act being more restricted than the scope of the Constitution. I am afraid'that it may not be clear that the calling or occupation referred to is an industrial calling or occupation.",37
142,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,""" Calling "" is a word of the same kind as ""occupation,"" and if the scope of the Bill does not go beyond calling in relation to industrial matters, it will nob go beyond occupation in relation to industrial matters.",37
143,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would, I think, be correct to say that this is a Bill to give us power to deal with industrial labour and industrial occupation, but does it not go beyond that?",38
144,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A person must be employed.,38
145,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He must be an operative, a person capable of being employed. The relation of employer and employee must now exist, mere qualification for employment not being enough, but the last amendment of the law provided that a man may be an employ^ by being usually or ordinarily engaged in certain pursuits. I think that "" labour"" will cover dealings with industrial labour whether employed or not, and that the character of the labour, occupation, service and calling dealt with is indicated in the preamble.",38
146,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The insertion of this word does not alter the nature of the Bill.,38
147,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This is a Bill to deal with industrial matters. The difficulty of ascertaining the meaning of calling or occupation, in the High Court's decisions, was in relation to what Parliament meant, not in relation to the power of Parliament. I believe that this is a Bill to deal with calling, occupation, employment, and labour in industrial matters, but not in other matters.",38
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [2,39] - It seems to me that the Attorney General does not know where he is, but we should know where we are. We have been told repeatedly by honourable members opposite that they have no wish to interfere with the employment of school teachers, professois, and callings of that kind. As the honourable member does not seem to know what "" labour"" means exactly, we should try to define and limit its meaning as much as possible. In that view I propose to move an amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) putThat after the word "" unemployment"" words "" in industries"" be inserted.

'",38
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [2.47] - In the midst of all these legal gentlemen, it is somewhat difficult to find out exactly how we stand. The Attorney General tells us calmly, in spite of the fact that this is a Bill for the maintenance of industrial peace, and the settlement of industrial disputes, that there is a doubt as to whether strikes and locks-out come with the in its provision.",38
151,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no doubt at all , strikes and locks-out are not included.",38
152,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [2.48] - It has been stated that a "" strike "" Is not a "" dispute "" within the meaning of sub-section xxxv. of the Constitution, but there is no doubt, of course, that a strike is good evidence of something in the nature of a dispute having arisen. It has been said by the Bench that a strike in itself is not necessarily dispute within the meaning of the section.; and there can be no harm in the amendment. Amendment-agreed to.

153,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.2] - The business . that we might possibly transact between now and the hour at ^yhich we usually adjourn would be so immaterial that I think that, after the ordeal through which we have just passed, it is well that we should now adjourn. We propose to conclude the consideration of the last of the Bills providing for an alteration of the Constitution before any other business is seriously taken. That being so, the Constitution Alteration (Nationalization of Monopolies) Bil l will be the first business when the House meets on Monday, and we shall continue its consideration until the vote upon it is taken. That, I anticipate, will be at any time between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Tuesday, but not later.",40
154,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If honourable members opposite help us by keeping quiet, but not before 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.",40
155,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T be next business to be taken will be the scheme for the redistri. bution of the electoral boundaries of - New South Wales, and we shall dispose ot that business before we adjourn for the night. In view of the stage of the session which we have reached, I think that is only fair. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Hear ,",40
156,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If that Business is disposed of at an early hour we shall proceed with other, matters in the order in which they appear on the notice-paper. I appeal to honourable members on both sides of the House to present as concisely as possible their views on the several questions yet to be dealt with, in order that we may bring the session to an early anil happy conclusion. I ask for the co-operation of the Opposition so that we may all spend a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I move That the House do now adjourn. NOES! Mr JH CATTS- (Cook) [3.5] - I understand from inquiries that have been instituted that no special .provision is being made to cope with the large volume of mail Sir John matter that will have to be delivered in the metropolitan area of Sydney during the Christmas season. Representations have been made to me by the municipal council of Erskineville that last year the letter-carriers in that suburb of Sydney were entirely unable to cope with the work, and that, from inquiries made by the council, the Department does not appear to appreciate thoroughly the necessity of making suitable and adequate provision for the approaching season. I therefore ask MAIL the Postmastfer-General whether he will cause MATTER. special inquiries to be made, with a view of providing in the metropolitan area sufficient additional assistance to enable mail matter to be delivered, with despatch. I do not think that parcels consisting of Christmas presents, as well as important letters intended for delivery by Christmas, should' be delivered two or three days later. That has happened in previous years, and I ask the Postmaster-General to take precautions to obviate the recurrence of the difficulty.",40
157,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kalgoorlie-^-Postmaster General) [3.7] - The question of providing the assistance necessary to deal expeditiously with the Christmas business has engaged the attention of the Department for a considerable time. 1 may inform the honourable member that we intend to be guided by. the experience of previous years, and I hope that he will find existing in the locality mentioned by fiim during the approaching Christmas season a better condition of affairs than he says prevailed last year. Question - resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.8 p.m. hear.",40
