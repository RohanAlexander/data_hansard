I must congratulate the staff of the Clerk's last couple of months in getting this chamber, established. Obviously some finetuning changes of time to help smooth out the running of this quite well. We recognise that, as one of the is going to be quite a positive move.

This bill proposes service in a state or territory parliament are a transfer value paid from the state or territory to purchase Commonwealth service. If a transfer would be recognised on the payment of a transfer value. It is proposed that benefits paid under beneficiary is a member of a state or territory territory pension, but would not be reduced receipt of a state or territory parliamentary ensure that current members are not disadvantaged.

However, the restoration or partial currently hold an office of profit are estimated expected that in the longer term these additional made by the Commonwealth no longer recognising service, at no cost to the state or territory. outlays or change in long-term cost from the insignificant. However, there are two contentious matters the requirement in section 60 of the SICS) amendments to the rules of that entity. The therefore compliance with the requirements to consent to any proposed amendments to bill states that, as any express provision to ability to amend its own legislation, no action consent of the CSS board a condition for creating a further exception In the case of the PSS, the bill introduces trust deed without the consent of the PSS minister by signed instrument, which is a disallowable only the CSS should be exempt from complying Act, it should provide for this exception specifically regulations under section 60 of the SICS) is not proposed to take any action to provide Wednesday, 8 June 1994 in line with the requirements of the SIS Superannuation Act currently provides for the a holder of an office of profit.

Transitional arrangements will apply to impact of the changes in this bill because in the small parliamentary superannuation restoration of pensions to certain persons who to cost about $80,000 in a full year. It is costs will be more than offset by savings prior state or territory parliamentary Therefore, any changes in immediate budgetary measures in the bill are expected to be relatively that need to be looked at. The first relates to Act that the trustee of the CSS mus- approve CSS Act is part of the rules of the CSS, and of section 60 will require the board of the CSS the CSS Act. The explanatory memorandum to the that effect will be a restriction on parliament's has been taken to provide for making the amending the CSS Act. This may be construed as to section 60 of the SICS) Act. a provision that the minister may not amend the board. Such amendment can only be made by the instrument. If parliament intends that with the provisions of section 60 of the SICS) in an amendment to the CSS Act or in Act. A mere statement in the memorandum that it for obtaining the consent of the CSS board to NA Wednesday, 8 June 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE proposed amendments to the CSS Act may not with the provisions of section 60. The second contentious point relates to the investment manager should that step be considered board, as is in the CFM legislation, to be the removal of this key discretion, which is essential of a superannuation entity, would be contrary As the legislative provisions in the CSS Act of the SIS legislation, which introduced an entirely management of the superannuation industry, key provision of section 60 of the SI(S) Act thereunder. This is a fairly pertinent point to wind up as superannuation generally in Australia is seen a number of areas where this has not existed. that the honourable members speaking on this to be at a premium and at a very professional concern being expressed by a lot of people right sector, is how their funds are being managed, managed, how it is conducting its business members. I think there needs to be far more and an ongoing review of the system so that we and transparency within the superannuation industry. As far as superannuation is concerned, the ultimately wants to replace the current pension important to try to get people to provide for difficult. The private sector has been experiencing legislation that relates to private sector superannuation guarantee levy and the charge are partially because of the concerns of employers about the implications Of the extra costs and They will have to deal with the Employers have had the opportunity on a guarantee levy came into force in August last in Newcastle, in my electorate, to try to explain possibility of this charge. It was quite awesome getting caught in What they saw as another a further trap-they did not gqahead and extend that they had employed in such a way that superannuation guarantee levy threshold. Therefore, community and that is something We heard the honourable member for Bendigo people who have been contributing to superannuation housing, but that did not eventuate. That caused the community. A lot of people were relying by higher interest rates for housing, because 1743 be adequate to exempt the CSS from complying lack of discretion in the trustees to change the necessary by the CSS board, and the PSS sole investment manager until 30 June 1995. The for the prudential management of the funds to the provisions of section· 59 of the SI(S) Act. and the PSS Act existed prior to the enactment new legislative regime for the prudential the view may be taken that any exception to the should be found in that act or regulations made on. The key element and the key concern as far concerned is of prudential management. We have I suppose it would be fair enough to say bill today would expect prudential management level for the Commonwealth scheme. A major across the industry, particularly in the private how the superannuation industry is being and how it is looking after the funds of its attention paid to ongoing changes to legislation can get far greater accountability, flexibility government is going in the direction that it and social security system. It is terribly their own retirement, which at the moment is quite a lot of difficulties with the government superannuation schemes, particularly through the that comes as a result of that.

With respect to the public sector, I was honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) used unfunded liabilities of a couple of our state the taxpayers in those states. A key element local government, was to make sure that substantially cash funded. We have seen the levels of government throughout Australia. It call on some of these state funds.

There is a big nest government to use those in a less than prudential concerned.

Incentives for International Competitiveness Scheme (Question No. 1134) Mr MCLachlan asked the Minister reprethe Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 5 May 1994: (1) Do the guidelines for determining successful under the Incentives for International Scheme administered by the Clothing and Footwear Development (TCFDA) require companies to demonfuture viability. and increases in international through measures such as export growth, import replacement, quality improvement (2) Is the scheme intended. to accord a high priority to projects involving the further processing 5.00 of Australian raw materials. (3) Is it a fact that Torino Knitwear, a Victorian . satisfied -: review requested .by the 1.00 TCFDA· and conducted, by Arthur Andersen but unsllccessful in its flPplicationto the scheme March 1992;: if so, why was it unsuccessful. (4) Has it been established that Torino Knitwear uses only Australian wool bought directly from Australian mills, manufactures wholly within Australia and fully met the criteria set out in the TCFDA's strategy published in October 1992. (5) Did the Chief Executive of the TCFDA inform Torino Knitwear in writing in March 1994 that the choice was made to direct the TCFDA's funds towards those projects that best reflected the' Authority's priorities as set out in its 1992 strategy. (6) Is it a fact that it took 23 months to process and review Torino Knitwear's application after it was lodged in March 1992. (7) What is the average time taken to process applications. (8) Does the time taken to process applications meet the requirements applying to the scheme. (9) Was the time taken to process Torino Knitwear's application longer than average; if so, why. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. However, the Authority'S Strategy published in October 1992 indicates that this priority applies to companies in the textile industry rather than the clothing industry. (3) Yes. The financial review conducted by Arthur Andersen and paid for by the Authority was only one element of the Authority's evaluation of the company's application. The company was unsuccessful due to the need t() consider applications on a competitiveness basis. The company marginally met other criteria while other companies ftom the clothing sector in general, and the knitwear sector in particular, demonstrated they were undertaking investment projects with outcomes more consistent with the Government's objective for the industry. (4) The company uses predominantly Australian yarn. It uses imported yarn which is not available from Australian manufacturers. It manufactures in Australia only and marginally met the Program's criteria. (5) Yes. '(6) No. (7) The variations in the time companies take to prepare and forward information to the TFCDA as a result of differing company' sizes; strategies, structures, market segments and investment plans, and in the number of applications being considered by the TCFDA at any particular time, are so great it is not meaningful to refer to an 'average' time to consider applications. (8) There are no Statutory requirements regarding the time-frame for consideration by the TCFDA of applications. The Guidelines for applicants were prepared by the TCFDA to provide indicative time, frames only. It has proven generally not to be possible to meet these time frames. for the reasons outlined in the answer to Question 7. ' (9) Torino's application was originally considered in 1992. In late 1993, the TCFDA initiated a reconsideration of the application. In early 1994 the application was again unsuccessful. As the company's application was considered twice it was under consideration over a longer period than is normally the case. Department of Employment, Education , and Training:. Occupation of Times Square (Question No. 1148)",177
34,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice! on 11 May 1994: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 94i (Hansard, 3 May 1994, page 131) regarding the occupation by his Department of premises ,at Times Square in Canberra, (a) what is the annual cost of the lease of the premises and (b) on what basis is the lease calculated. Mr Free [Acting Minister for Employment, Education and Training]-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foll()ws: The annual cost of the Times Square lease is $5.83m. The annual cost is the product of the net lettable area and the cost per metre agreed under the lease (the rental rate) plus a provision for basement car parking spaces. The rental rate is to be reviewed to market valuation every two years from 12 March 1993. Tomatoes: Imports",180
35,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"On 6 June 1994 Mr Lloyd asked the Acting Prime Minister the following question without notice: My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. He will be aware that the tomato industry, in November 1991, lodged an application for the imposition of dumping and count¢rvailing duties on canned tomatoes from Italy. He will also be aware that duties were finally imposed in April 1992, successfully appealed by the Italians in June 1993, and then successfully counterappealed by the AntiDumping Authority in February 1994. My question is: why has the government only reimposed duties back to February 1994 rather than June 1993, as this would be the correct procedure and as this failure to do so has condoned the significant tonnage of canned tomatoes imported in that seven month period with a subsidy close to the total price received by Australian growers? Will the Government reconsider this incorrect and bad decision? The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Dumping and countervailing duties were initially imposed against canned tOlT!atoes from Italy in April 1992. The Italian exporter subsequently applied to the Federal Court to have the duties set aside on the basis that there had been several of law in the inquiry process. The court upheld the application and the duties were removed in June 1993. The findings. were challenged before the Full Bench of the Federal Court and, in February 1994, the Full Bench upheld the challenge. Following a brief inquiry by the Anti-Dumping Authority into a particular aspect of the .Court hearings, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction reimposed dumping and countervailing duties as from 10 February, the date of the orders .that gave effect to the Full Court's Decision. Turning now to the questions raised by the Honourable Member as to why the measures were reimposed as from February 1994 rather than from the time when they were removed in June 1993, the response is twofold. First, in accordance with Order number 35 of the Federal Court Rules, a judgement or order of the Federal Court takes effect on the day it was pronounced or made, unless the Court orders that it take effect at an earlier or later date. In the canned tomatoes case, as.the Court did not specify a date for the Full Court's finding to take effect, the findings came into effect on the date of the orders-l0 February 1994. To have this date overturned and an earlier date imposed would have required an application to the Federal Court by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. Thus the Minister, in deciding to reimpose the relevant duties, was unable to apply them from a date prior to the order by the Court. Whether the Minister should have applied to the Court to have the ability to impose duties earlier than February 1994 goes to the second aspect of th- tesponse.to the Honourable Member's question. Dumping that causes material injury is recognised internationally as a form of unfair competition. As all Honourable Members would know, this is explicitly reflected in the GATT. As a signatory to the GATT, Australia has upheld the right of all Australian industries to seek action against such behaviour. Duties are not imposed as a means of creating revenue for the Government. It follows that these duties should not be imposed if they do not have the effect of countering the effect of unfair competition. In the case of canned tomatoes, if the Minister had applied successfully to the Federal Court and had .the date of reimposition set at June 1993, how would this assist the Australian industry? Obviously, the vast majority of imports of canned tomatoes since June 1993 would have by now been sold to consumers by supermarkets throughout the country. To the extent that these imports may have caused material injury to the Australian industry, that errors induStry would gain no advantage now in having duties impos-d against these past imports. In contrast, the Australian companies who import canned tomatoes would be faced with a substantial bill-amounting, I am told, to over $3 millionwhich could conceivably cause considerable hardship to them. Under the circumstances, the Government is satisfied that the dumping and countervailing measures against exports of canned tomatoes from Italy should apply only from February 1994. Company Tax",180
36,Mr WILLIS,TOTAL,"On 12 May, Dr Hewson asked the Treasurer a question without notice concerning the estimate of revenue to be raised from companies in 1994-95 as a result of the compliance enhancement measures announced in the Treasurer's statement on tax policy of September 1992. Dr Hewson also wanted to know on what basis this estimate was prepared. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the then Treasurer's September 1992 Statement on Tax Policy it was estimated that an extra $750 million of revenue would be collected in 1994-95 through these compliance enhancement measures; it was estimated that $335 million of this $750 million would be collected from companies. Th- estimate for company collections through these measures was based on ATO research and experience that indicated the extra revenue could be raised by allocating additional resources to the following activities:. .. Large/Medium project which includes: acceleration of large case audit through greater availability .of high level technical .advice; expansion of rulings and determinations; .increased focus on international issues . contemporary commercial practices; expansion of business audit; expanded information reporting; and increased record keeping audits. Large/Medium Project It was estimated that the Large/Medium project would account for $250 million of the $335 million in 1994-95. This estimate was arrived at having regard to the following factors: In their evaluation of the large case Audit . program, Boston Consulting Group concluded that compliance would improve if taxpayers were made more aware of their tax obligations. It was conservatively estimated that the Large/Medium project would increase compliance by 2-3% by 1994-95, resulting in additional revenue of $200 million. This estimate· was arrived at after consideration of the indirect effects obtained in other areas from compliance activity (eg improved compliance from the announcement of TFN), and judgments based on the dollar value of and the strategic issues which would be covered by the tax rulings and determinations. In addition, the extra resources used in direct audit activity were estimated, based on past results, to yield an additional $50 million. Expansion of Business Audit Activities On the basis of past results it was estimated that the additional resources allocated to the expansion of business audit activities would yield an additional $25 million of revenue in 1994-95. Record Keeping and Expanded Information Reporting It was estimated that the reCord keeping and expanded information reporting component of the strategy would account for $60 million of the $335 million in 1994-95. This estimate was based on estimates of improved compliance due to better record keeping by business, and reduced opportunity for misreporting of income in industries subject t.o the expanded reporting arrangements.",181
