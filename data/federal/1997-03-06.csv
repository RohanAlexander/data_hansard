1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the notice lodged by Mr Martin relating to disallowance of Statutory Rules 1996, No. 277, being called on forthwith. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations - .. .Motion for Disallowance .: }\oJrMARTIN (Cunningham) (9.33 a.m.)I move: That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulahe, tions (Amendment), as contained in Statutory 1996, No. 277, made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, be disallowed. Mr Speaker, there is no doubt that this proposal, the first tranche of which has come before the House today for consideration, represents nothing less than an absolute betrayal. It represents a betrayal of Queensland; it represents a betrayal of tourism operators in Far North Queensland; it represents a betrayal of the Australian tourism industry; it represents a betrayal of the thousands of workers who are currently employed in the tourism industry in Queensland and, might I say, more generally in Australia. The term 'betrayal' is one that is often used in parliamentary debates, but I do not use it lightly. I use it on this occasion for the simple reason that the government has betrayed those constituents who supported them at the last election. There is no doubt that one of the major reasons that led to the support which was given to coalition candidates during the last election campaign in North Queensland was the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the government now in this country, went to the people of North Queensland with cast-iron guarantees about taxes, about surcharges, and about their support for the Queensland tourism industry. The now government went to the people of North Queensland in support of the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), Herbert (Mr Lindsay), Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), Capricornia (Mr Marek) and Hinkler (Mr Neville) in particular, the candidates for the Liberal and National parties in the last elecOrders tion, and said to the people of North Queensland, 'Read my lips: there will be no new taxes, there will be no new increases in existing taxes if you elect us to Canberra.' Indeed, the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, took himself to Cairns and told the people of Cairns and North Queensland, particularly those in the tourism industry, that that industry was paramount. He told them that there would be no increased taxes in the tourism industry; he told them that he believed the tourism industry was vital for Australia's economic future; he told them that if made Prime Minister, would ensure that Rules the jobs of young people and those people in the tourism industry more generally would be protected. What humbug! What absolute garbage! What have we seen? As I have said, we have seen betrayal. The member for Leichhardt will participate in this debate, and I am pleased that he will do so because the member for Leichhardt is a pretty honourable sort of a bloke. He has fought long and hard for his constituents in Cairns and for the reef operators. I have spoken to them, and they have told me that he has told them that he has come down here to Canberra and has spoken on their behalf. Behind the scenesÂ· he has probably done a bit of lobbying with ministers at different times to try to get across a point of view. But, my friend, at the end of the day it is still a sell-out. The fact that the government has decided to break the 500 per cent increase in the reef tax into two components is still a sell-out. The component we are debating today will increase the environmental management charge or reef tax from $1 to $2. That will be incorporated in the cost of the ticket. It will be on the face of that ticket so there will be some transparency and people will know that that will apply. In nine or 10 months time the second tranche of this is to come in. A new tourism charge will be levied on any person who goes and uses the facilities on the Great Barrier Reef. That tourism charge will be set at $4. It is a charge that does not exist now; it did not exist under us-there was no consideration of it existing under us. It is another a tax on people from around Australia and around the world who are attracted to North Queensland because of its magnificent coastline, because of the Great Barrier Reef, because of the facilities that have been put in place by not only marine operators but also others in the tourism industry. It will certainly earn for Australia considerable sums of funds in export dollars. Most importantly, it will underpin jobs in North Queensland. How do you think people will respond when, in 12 months time, for each visit to the reef, included in the cost of their ticket will be a $2 charge that the government has put on them as this reef tax? That is the first component. But then, as they walk down Trinity Wharf to get on a boat to go out to the Great Barrier Reef there will be a tax collector from GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, with their hand out and a stamp, saying, 'That will be $4, please, for every trip you make out to the reef.' So, if you go out on Quicksilver one day, and on another day you go out on another boat, and on another day you go scuba diving, and on another day you go on an aircraft to have a look at the reef, every time you will be slugged that increase of 500 per cent in the reef tax. The members we dubbed last year as the gang of five, who would not debate this and who represent those North Queensland electorates-the members for Leichhardt, Herbert, Dawson, Capricornia and Hinkler-should go and tell their constituents next year, when this 500 per cent increase has actually come in, what effect this is going to have on their tourism industry. You go and tell the small business proprietors, whom you purport to represent in this place. The Prime Minister comes in every day, Minister-as you know-and talks about small business and about how you will help small business. A great help to small business is a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax. Thanks very much. They must be cheering John Howard up in Cairns and Mackay. I see the member for Dawson up there. She must be really jumping up and down with delirium today because the Prime Minister is not only tax, going to oversee a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax, but isn't there something about the sugar tariff as well that affects the honourable member's electorate? I also saw one of the newspapers today quoting I think the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) as saying he was going to cross the floor on the sugar tariffs. Minister, I have heard that before. I also read before in some of the local newspapers up in Far North Queensland about the gang of five saying, 'If this 500 per cent increase in the reef tax comes in we'll have to cross the floor.' Well, my good friends, here is your big chance. Last year, when we tried to bring on debate in this place about the reef tax and the detrimental effect it would have on employment and the tourism industry in North Queensland, you wimped out. You all said, 'This is a technical motion. We're not going to support that. It's just a stunt by ,the opposition to try to bring the matter up for consideration.' Some stunt! If standing up for the jobs of young people in North Queensland and for the small businesses that run tourism activities in North Queensland is a stunt, then we stand condemned. If we are in this place trying to defend them and we are accused of just putting on some sort of a stunt, my hand is up: I am guilty. That is exactly what I am doing. I am defending Queenslanders-and I am from New South Wales. I am in here defending Queenslanders when the Queensland members of the National and Liberal parties should be on this side voting with this motion to disallow this first tranche. Interestingly, in this whole debate, we find that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has remained somewhat silent on this. Every time. I have put questions to him in this place on the reef tax he has said, 'It is not my area. You are directing it to the wrong person.' We used to call John Moore 'Mirrors' because every time you asked him something he said, 'I'll look into it.' Now we are going to call him 'Gunna'. He has moved on from being Mirrors 'I'll look into it,' to Gunna 'I'm gunna do something about it.' But he has not. This is the man who is supposed to represent the tourism industry-but he wimps out. He says, 'That is not my area. That's the Minister for the Environment's responsibility.' My very good friend the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) over here represents the Minister for the Environment in this place. Regrettably, it is a very difficult task for you today. You have to come in here, Minister, and follow me and justify why you said to the people of North Queensland there would be no increases in taxes and charges and that certainly any existing ones would not be increased. You have increased charges; you have done that with the reef tax. And it is not only the reef tax: when you look into the statutory rules we are debating today there are increases in another seven charges and taxes, everything from pontoon charges through to floating hotels-although there isn't one anymore. You have jacked the tax up. Do you know something that we do not? Do you think there is going to be another floating hotel coming to the Great Barrier Reef? Are you just getting ready to welcome them? 'Welcome to North Queensland. We want infrastructure up here, so we'll bring in another floating hotel. By the way, we've just increased the charges for you being there.' Pontoon charges have gone up too. They snuck these charges through and they told no-one about them. The interesting thing is that the minister for tourism, who is supposed to be promoting Australia's tourism, sits back, scratching his head, and says, 'It's not really my area. It is the Minister for the Environment who has done this.' He didn't know anything about it either. When this came in as a budget measure, not only was there no consultation with the tourism industry in North Queensland-and they were a bit upset about that-but the minister for tourism did not know about it. The member for Dawson gave him up. She was quoted in a local newspaper as saying that not even John Moore, the minister for tourism, knew about the 500 per cent increase in the reef tax. Of course, after the event, my good friend the minister for tourism came in here and said, 'That was a decision taken by other ministers. I had nothing to do with it.' Certainly, we are the first to admit we put in place the $1 levy on people who used the reef. The money was to go to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority so that we could see scientific work continue there. We did not have a problem with that. We put that in place and it was very transparent. What we did not do was cut the funding to GBRMPA as well. There has been a 3.2 per cent cut in funds to GBRMPA and, as a tawdry attempt to make up the funding for it, Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment, comes in and says, 'We'll have a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax and we will increase these seven other taxes as well. That way we'll be able to divert some of the funds to GBRMPA.' Don't hold your breath. I would not think too much of that extra money was going to be sent to GBRMPA. Not only is it not going to be given to GBRMPA to enable them to carry on the good work that they do but we have also had people talking about privati sing the marine aquarium up in Townsville as one way of trying to find money to give to GBRMPA. The aquarium is one of it's major attractions. There was a huge split in the gang of five when these suggestions emanating from North Queensland were made, as I recall in a very secret document that was not so secret and which, regrettably, had the member for Leichhardt's fingerprints all over it. It is no longer secret, is it? No, because too many people found out about it. What the honourable member did was slip it around and say, 'Get rid of the aquarium in Townsville. Sell it off. Great idea.' The member for Herbert, who represents Townsville and who is not here, is also one of the great reef tax advocates and he got a bit upset about that. We know that he got a bit upset about it. Anyway, I was talking about my good friend, the minister for tourism-and this is the tip: whether you are in government or in opposition, always carefully think about what you say and what you write, because at some stage it may come back to bite you on the hand. Mr O'Connor-He does sit on his hands a lot.",13
2,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"He does. I am always cognisant of your presence, Mr Speaker; that is why my language is always moderated. The minister for tourism now, who was the shadow minister for industry, commerce and public administration, wrote to the President of the Independent Boat Owners Association on 23 May 1995. What did he say? He said: Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the introduction of an environment management charge or reef tax. I appreciate you writing to me on this matter. I'll bet he did! To continue: I would like to assure you that the Liberal Party opposed to the introduction of an environment management charge. This is the minister for tourism now, writing to constituents-actually writing to Townsville people-'-saying they are opposed to it. Then it is introduced in here, now there is a 500 per cent increase proposed and this is the first tranche of it. How did the people of Queensland respond to the good old minister for tourism about this? I could say it no more eloquently than the Sunday Mail of 24 November 1996, in an editorial entitled 'Jobless pay'. It was about the reef tax proposal and it said: The reef tax, even in its watered down forrnthat is this grubby little deal that has been negotiated here, now with the $1 increase this time and the $4 next timeis simply ludicrous. Dead right there. It went to say: Every few thousand dollars the reef tax raises will put another young school leaver out of work, destroying job opportunities that might have otherwise arisen, had the tourist industry been encouraged, not nobbled. And then, interestingly, this comment: We have had few Ministers for Tourism in Canberrathat is Queenslanders, of course, and John Moore, the minister for tourism, is a Queenslander. You would not know it-this is an anti-Queensland tax. The Sunday Mail said: We have had few Ministers for Tourism in Canberra and that such an imposition should be introduced with a Queenslander in the job is an outrage. Some others were a little less charitable than that-some of the people in the tourism industry when referring to the introduction of this, in the first instance. Steve Moon, the general manager of Ocean Spirit Cruises and spokesman for the Cairns based marine tourism industry, whom the member for Leichhardt knows well, attacked the incompetence of Senator Hill when this proposal first surfaced and said in a press release on 6 November: We are calling on the Prime Minister to intervene in this issue, not only to resolve it once and for all, but also to maintain his own integrity after promisis ing the industry in Cairns it would not happen. It is imperative that Senator Hill be asked to surrender his portfolio to a more competent and efficient member of government to maintain any credibility for any future negotiations that may be required with industry. The feeling is that this time the government cannot be trusted. I did not say that. This is a tourism operator in the member for Leichhardt's electorate speaking on behalf of people about this antiQueensland, anti-jobs, anti-tourism tax that is being introduced. I just know the arguments that are going to come: 'Oh, it is only a $1 increase now and everybody will cop it sweet.' I will you what: they won't. They will not cop it sweet at the end of the day because what you have opened up here, by making a two for one tax, is an opportunity for governments of the future, either your government or any future government, to increase these taxes on tourism. We all know that the minister for tourism and the Australian Tourism Commission, as recently as two weeks ago, convened a very important seminar here in Canberra to talk about the fact that the Japanese tourists coming to Australia, proportionally, are starting to dwindle and we have to do something about that. The major impact where that is going to be felt is in North Queensland and yet here we are lining up and saying, 'We are going to hit you for an increase of $1 now and then we are going to hit you for $4 next time around.' How silly is that? It is worse than silly because, again, the Prime Minister stood up in Queensland, in Cairns, before the last election and said: 'No increase in existing taxes, no new taxes.' Broken promise No. I-that is what these regulations today do. Broken promise No.2: he said, 'We will look after small business and we will look after the tourism industry.' He is not doing any of that. These are antiQueensland, anti-jobs regulations. No.3: our friends up there, the member for Leichhardt and Senator Bill O'Chee-talk about sending boys on men's errands to go and talk to the tourism industry and try and negotiate a way through this dreadful problem that they had created for themselves-got up there and said to the tourism operators, 'Have I got a deal for you! Come on down. I am going to give you a two for one tax. We will increase it $1 now and next time we will give you a $4 increase. Aren't you lucky!' And they all rolled over. How stupid are the tourism operators as well-they cannot be left out of this-to roll over for such a stupid opportunity, to roll over for such a stupid tax to be increased?",16
3,Unknown,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Government members interjecting,17
4,Mr MARTIN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"No, no, it is no good getting excited because I have told them, my friend, that they are copping it both ways, coming and going. I will tell you what, I am prepared to go to the electorates of both our colleagues up the back of the chamber. In fact, on 19 March, the member for Dawson, I am on my way. Mark it down on your calendar. I am coming up to tell all your tourism operators how you vote on this, because you all said you would cross the floor. Here is your chance. Defend Queensland, cross the floor, vote with us and support this motion. (Time expired)",17
5,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Bevis-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,17
6,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.52 p.m.)-The government is obviously disappointed at the sheer hypocrisy displayed by the oppositionit is part of the new Labor approach-and the cynicism that has just been displayed by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in leading the debate for the opposition to oppose the regulations that will put in place an environmental management charge. I want to relate to the House some of the history but, before doing that, can I put into context exactly what is being proposed here. What is being proposed is a management charge to assist the maintenance and running of the GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and also to ensure that the many visitors to the park, both foreign and Australian, are able to enjoy the park in perpetuity with all the facilities. One of the things that has to be decided is who is going to pay. Let us have a look at what a couple of former environment ministers from the Labor Party said. The question basically is who should pay and how should payments should be levied. Senator Faulkner said in the Australian on 19 May 1994: 'I can't shy a way from the need to have a look at a user pays approach. The pressures from the number of tourists going to those world heritage areas is going to be enormous and we have a responsibility to protect their values.' Senator Faulkner acknowledged there were mixed feelings among environmentalists about the user pays concept, but he acknowledged the need that something would have to be done. A former minister for the environment, Barry Cohen, a man well respected in this House, was minister from 1983 to 1987. He said in the Australian, in his regular colu\1ln on 11 September 1996, when discussing the outrage fanned by the opposition about the introduction of the proposal of the charge in the budget, that 'most of it, unfortunately, is nonsense'. Mr Bevis-What did your mate Bruce Baird say?",17
7,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"He said 'most of it, unfortunately, is nonsense'. That is your own side. What he was saying was that the argument that you were putting was nonsense. He pointed out that the cost of running GBRMPA was somewhere in the vicinity of $25 million to $26 million and that that of course had to be met. We inherited a black hole-no doubt about that-and some decisions had to be made to fix up the difficulties that we inherited from you after some 13 years. The other point made by Barry Cohen in his article was: The official number of visitors to the reef last year was about 1.5 million. Of those, 550,000 were from overseas---one third from Japan and most of the rest were from interstate. What this environmental management charge is about-and I stress it is an environmental management charge-is protecting the reef. The concluding comment is the genus of what this is about. Let me quote Cohen again: The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest environmental treasure. The burden for protecting it is borne by all Australian taxpayers. Gradually, a larger part of that burden must be shifted to those who most enjoy ito-those who visit the reef. That is what this is all about. These regulations provide the opportunity for the visitors to that park to contribute to its ongoing maintenance. The member for Cunningham himself knows a little bit about this. He was involved in that report by the departments. It says here that both yourself and the Mr Martin-No, I wasn't. I didn't attend one hearing.",17
8,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Well, you are on the list of those who are supposed to have been involved in the committee. It's a bit late now to say you didn't attend. If you are one of those members of the opposition who do not go along to things, that is your problem. Your environmental spokesman at the current time, Dr Lawrence, was there. Mr Martin-I didn't go to one bit of the deliberation.",18
9,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Your signature is on the final report. Let me quote the report, because what it says is quite important. It goes to the central issue, yet again: A convincing argument can be made for charging those who benefit most from world heritage areas, either financially or as visitors. It is argued that while Australian taxpayers as a whole contribute through government funding to world heritage management, those who reap special rewards from the areas by earning a living from tourism or through their experiences while visiting the areas should make an additional financial contribution. The committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the move in the 1996-97 budget to increase the environmental management fee. That is something that the current environment spokesman for the Labor Party has subscribed to, so we find it a little bit cynical, a little bit hypocritical, when you put the argument into the full context, to hear what you have had to say today. The EMC, the environmental management charge, was introduced in 1993 by the former government as part of the cost recovery process. It is a charge on tourist operators for the commercial use of the Barrier Reef Marine Park and is generally calculated on a per head per day basis that best reflects the level usage by the operator. The proposed $4 tourist charge, which is part of the regulations, will be levied directly on tourists. Revenue from the EMC contributes, as I have said, to the management and to research functions. The level of EMC compares very favourably with fees charged for use of other areas of high natural value, such as Kakadu, Uluru and many state run national parks. Kakadu and Uluru, for example, charge $15 per person entry fee and the New South Wales government charges $12 per day per car for eptry into Kosciusko National Park. Tourism is the largest and fastest growing commercial use of the marine park. GBRMPA has advised that direct and indirect expenditure on tourism is estimated to exceed $1 billion annually. So to impose a charge on those who are visiting, in a fair and equitable manner, as we have proposed in the regulations, is in line with the sentiments expressed by your own senior senator, Senator Faulkner, and also a former minister, and also has been endorsed by your current environment spokesman, Dr Lawrence. When we initially introduced the EMC, it was set at an unrealistically low level of $1 per head to facilitate its introduction. After collection costs are deducted, the charge currently achieves net revenue of about $1.2 million, compared to total GBRMPA budget appropriation of $14.75 million in an industry of about $1 billion. The reef is one of Australia's greatest environmental assets and it is widely recognised as such around the world. It is the base upon which the Queensland and much of Australia's international tourism industry is built. An active management, not a passive management, is going to be required to ensure that the reef environment is protected. Mr Bevis-The Queensland government attacked you for it.",18
10,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I understand that Queensland have removed their charge. Mr Bevis interjecting,19
11,Mr WARWICK SMITH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Because it is recognised as a national asset. You are the only other Queenslander on the other side in this place; you ought to be able to see the value of what is being proposed here and recognise the national significance of the reef, its importance to the tourism industry and therefore the need to be responsible about how we deal with this issue. When we proposed the environmental management charge in the budget-we moved from $1 to $6--there was considerable discussion which involved many of my colleagues. The member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), who will be speaking in this debate, was one of those who discussed with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) about how the charge might best be introduced. It will be moved to a $4 visitor charge from 1 January 1998. It will be operator paid and will be levied at a rate of $2 per visitor. It will be to protect the reef; it will cost recovery in accord with the requirements and the need to ensure that this important natural asset is going to be managed in a proper way. As I said, the recognition of the need to do so under a realistic proposal was put in place in the budget. The industry has raised a number of concerns with the proposal, in particular they claimed: the increase was somewhat unfair on families who would face a compounding charge-for example, a family of four would face a charge of $24 per day, which is a substantial cost impost on a family holiday; the increase will be felt more keenly by small operators; the daily charge would have a significant impact on the cost structure of bare boat charter hire; there was a potential for a tourist to pay more than $6 per day if they undertake a number of activities in the one day; and the last proportion of the tourism industry is subject to fixed price contracts and pre-sold tickets, and these are fixed up to 18 months in advance, which would limit the industry's ability to pass the increase on without severely impacting on profitability. Following consideration of all of these claims, a number of modifications were made to reduce any impact of the proposal on the industry. We have demonstrated that, where there are concerns in trying to address the fundamental principle, we are quite prepared to consult with the industry, with the residents and with the local members to come up with a regime that is fair and equitable but gives effect to that fundamental point that I made at the beginning: we must do something in the national interest to ensure that the management of the Great Barrier Reef is done in an active way and that those who benefit most from it are asked to make the highest contribution. That is only fair. This government is about fairness. We have a commitment to fairness and ensuring that those who are going to be subject to decisions that we make are treated in a fair way. The EMC was increased from $1 to $2 per head with effect from 1 January 1997. This has been accepted by the major tourism industry associations as a reasonable charge be on operators, particularly as the previous amount of $1 had not been adjusted for CPI movements over several years. You committed yourselves to the principle of user pays, but you left the fee at a level that was totally and completely unrealistic. Did it do you any good? It did not. The people know that governments have to make decisions for the fairness of all and in the national interest. What has happened for North Queensland? The coalition won and it has made tough decisions in this area which are often hard to sell, but these decisions have been accepted and are seen to be fair. This is certainly fair. It has been done in the context of wide consultation with the industry. Two cabinet ministers have been involved-Senator Hill and Minister Moore. Minister Moore is from Queensland and understands as much as anybody the needs of and developments in tourism. He is a very good minister. He is very experienced--one of the most experienced parliamentarians in this nation. He has prosecuted the case for tourism, the need for tourism and the growth for tourism. We know that it has to be done in the most responsible way. Our natural asset the Great Barrier Reef is protected by the activities of this environmental management charge. Those opposite describe it as a tax. You know and I know and everybody in this chamber knows that this motion of yours is based on cynicism. It is hypocritical. What you are trying to do is walk away from the sensible development of public policy we have seen for our national parks and our world heritage areas. You go to another country and try to walk into a world heritage area for nothing-it just does not happen. It is not real life. This proposal has been through extensive consultation. It marries together the two principles that we think are most important: protecting this national treasure, this natural asset, of world heritage significance and making sure that those who benefit most from participation in the wonders of visiting the bute towards it in a fair way. This proposal has been spread over a period of extensive consultation with the industry, with local residents and with local members. Local members had a very significant input into the development of how this environmental management charge would be put in place. They deserve to be congratulated because they know that if government is doing its job it has to be fair and has to govern on behalf of the whole nation and not just for sectional interests. That was the point Barry Cohen made back in September in an article-a fair and decent article. I quote it again because I think it is a good point to finish on: The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest environmental treasure. The burden for protecting it is borne by all Australian taxpayers. Gradually, a larger part of that burden must be shifted to those who most enjoy it-those who visit the reef. How true. How appropriate. Yet there you are trying to walk away from that fundamental principle. We have done it in a fair way. We have done it with consultation. We reject the motion by the member for Cunningham.",19
12,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The proposal that the government has initiated to increase this reef tax is quite simply a broken promise. It is without doubt bad policy and it is a threat to jobs. If the members from North Queensland-the gang of five-had any integrity in this matter, they would be pursuing that issue if not the others. More than anything, it is a betrayal of Queenslanders. Queensland people in those areas-in fact, pretty well throughout the state-voted for this government in numbers unprecedented. The Liberal and National parties have never before enjoyed the support from Queensland that they got at the election last year. In return for that support, they have had broken promises and an attack upon the state's most significant employer and significant export industry-tourism. That is what the Howard government has done to repay the enormous support for the Liberal and National parties at the election last year. They have broken a fundamental promise and have attacked one of the state's most significant reef will contri- industries. Let me first, though, go to some of the points raised by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). He was fond of quoting from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on this matter, and I have no doubt, from the advice that the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) was given by the Chief Government Whip, that he will be doing much the same. Before they get too carried away with it, and I notice the member for Leichhardt was a member of that committee as well, the member for Leichhardt might like to be reminded of the comments that his committee report included-with the committee having a majority of government members. Whilst it went along with the tax hike, it said that it was concerned by the fact that three of the well-recognised principles of setting fees had been disregarded. These are principles that the government had said it would honour, these are principles that the industry said were appropriate but, because they have to toe the party line over there, they say, 'Yes, we'll agree with the increase but, by the way, we've got a few problems, and one of the problems is it just doesn't meet any of the criteria,' The report went on and said that, for example, only six months lead time had been given, and that this situation had now changed. Mr Entsch interjecting",20
13,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The simple fact is the member for Leichhardt faced a rebellion in his backyard, and he should be the last person to stand here in this place and talk because, of all the people who have had duplicitous approaches to this issue, it is the member for Leichhardt. He has been a hero in his own town. When he gets back up to Cairns, he is the saviour of the tourism industry because he is going to fight this tax, he will fix it for operators. That is what he says when he is in Cairns, but the people in Cairns need to know-and I can assure the member for Leichhardt they will be told-that when he comes down into this place he votes for the tax. When he has an opportunity to actually do something to give effect to his tough words, he lies doggo, he turns belly up, he is gone. Where is he to be found? He is not on the battlefield. He cowers up there behind the other members of the government and votes with the government every time this issue has been before the parliament. The member for Leichhardt will have an opportunity to correct that record today. He will have an opportunity, as will the other members of the gang of five, to actually do here in the parliament what they said back home they support. I doubt very much they will. They will all toe the line. As cockies comer over here has toed the line on the tariff debate, they will toe the line on this as well. It became clear in that report that there were serious misgivings. The report went on and said: In addition, the funds raised will be used to partially reduce the level of Commonwealth funding to GBRMPA rather than to enhance visitor services. That says that this money is not going to help the Great Barrier Reef. In spite of the fact that more money is being collected from people going to the reef, GBRMPA gets less money to protect the reef. There is a bit of an inconsistency there, which the minister sort of glossed over in his comments. If in fact this money was intended to protect the reef, why has the funding made available for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority been reduced? Why is there a three per cent cut in that? Why is there a three per cent cut when your rationale for increasing this charge is to do the oppositeto help the reef? This is simply a case of the rhetoric of government members not matching the facts of where the money goes. The report went on and said: The committee views the way in which the increased charge is being introduced and implemented as unfair to tourist operators and it is likely to the undermine the joint approach to these things. If that was the view they held then, nothing has changed since to correct that problem. While referring to the comments of the minister, I should also remind him-as he was fond of quoting a former member of parliament on our side, Barry Cohen-that he might like to take the advice of Bruce Baird, who, of course, was a minister. Mr Warwick Smith-Who?",21
14,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Bruce Baird, remember that name? He had something to do withMr Warwick Smith-Not Tasmania.",21
15,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Not Tasmania, no. He had something to do, as I recall, with the New South Wales government. Mr Martin-Liberal government.",21
16,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Sorry, the New South Wales Liberal government, thank you. Bruce Baird has been scathing in his criticism not just of the tax but of the way you have handled this. There has not been consultation with the industry, and the industry has said that many times and so has Bruce Baird. It is not just Bruce Baird who has said that; the Queensland government are not too fussed with you. You could not get someone more right wing in this country than the Queensland government and they are pretty unhappy about the way in which you have handled all of this. The Queensland government in fact has decided not to go ahead with a charge that they were proposing in the marine park because of your government's insistence on pursuing this reef tax. I will quote from a Townsville Bulletin of November last year. In talking about the reef tax, it said: Meanwhile, the Queensland Government has decided to exempt popular tourist islands from plan to introduce entry fees to the State's parks, costing the Government more than million in lost revenue. Environment Minister Brian Littleproudthe National Party ministersaid Cabinet had decided yesterday to exempt islands, primarily those in the Great Barrier Marine Park, because of the Federal Government's refusal to back down on its 500 per cent increase in the reef visitor tax. This would have hit tour operators and others with unbudgeted taxes from two directions. Un budgeted taxes from two directions! You are persisting with your tax on them. The article continues: Mr Littleproud said the exemptions to the ParkPass scheme would include about 50 islands He actually went on and said he would be calling on the federal government to fund the shortfall. I wonder whether you got that letter, Minister, from the Queensland Minister for the Environment saying, 'Pay up. Because your stupidity, we in the state of Queensland have had to forgo $1 million in tax revenue, so we want recompense.' I wonder if you remember getting that letter. The minister referred to the history of and it is important to acknowledge that this tax was introduced in 1993 by the former Labor government. It was introduced as a charge of $1 with a provision and an underWhat taking that it would not be increased beyond the CPr. The amazing thing in this debate that in the past I have heard members of government attack us because we were the ones who introduced it. Mr Warwick Smith-Not beyond CPI, was it?",21
17,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"That is right. We have been attacked because we introduced it, but a few moments ago the minister was attacking us not because we introduced it but because we did not increase it enough. He was attacking us a moment ago because we did not increase the $1 by Cpr. On the one hand, you have got the member for Leichhardt, who, no doubt, has run around North Queensland-he may well try to introits duce this into the debate today-saying that national we are guilty because we introduced a $1 $1 charge in 1993. On the other hand, his minister attacks us not because we introduced it but because we did not make it high enough; we didn't increase it. They have attended to that problem in one fell swoop. Don't the worry about the CPI increase. With this mob Reef the CPI increase is not an issue. The Liberal Party government has decided, with the National Party in tow, that they are going to double the $1 to $2 and throw in another $4 just for good measure. They think that by turning a $6 fee into one of $2 and another of $4, the people will say, 'That's a good deal. We are a lot better off now because instead of having to pay $6 we only new pay $2 here and $4 there.' That is some deal. As the shadow minister said, 'Have we got a deal for you. Come on down: $2 today and $4 tomorrow, and you are better off out of it.' That is a lot better than paying $6, Minister! The simple fact is that when we introduced the charge it was only $1. We did not inof crease it. What is more, every cent of that dollar went to GRBRMPA. Every cent of that dollar went to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What have you done? Instead of giving the money to the this, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, you have increased the charge from $1 to $6 and you have cut the money that you are giving to the protection of the Barrier Reef. sort of hypocrisy is that? It does not matter what else you say in this debate; that is is the fundamental issue that you are the misleading the people of Australia on. It is somewhat ironic that when we introduced this charge in 1993 not only were we attacked for introducing it but the member for Braddon claimed at the time that this was the thin end of the wedge. He said that this $1 was going to grow. Mr Martin-And he was a Tasmanian.",22
18,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,He is a Tasmanian. Mr Warwick Smith-Sometimes be's confused with me.,23
19,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"That would be a sad circumstance. In 1993 the member for Braddon said that this is evil, this is wrong-'it is the end of the wedge' - a dollar today and who knows what it will be tomorrow. The truth is that under us tomorrow it would have stayed at a dollar. But the member for Braddon had a crystal ball that we had not contemplated. He obviously knew from the inside that when you lot got in it would be the thin end of the wedge and you would take the $1 that we applied in 1993-all of which went to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park-and you would tum it into $6 in one fell swoop. Mr Martin-He had a vision.",23
20,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As the shadow minister said, he had a vision, and I guess he is a man who, from time to time, probably thinks he does have visions. It would be remiss of me in the short time available not to make some reference to the fact that the most senior member from Queensland in this parliament has some responsibility in these matters, as he is the federal Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). You can probably forget the tourism part of that portfolio, and I have got to say that he has not had too many wins in industry policy either, come to think of it. The member for Ryan, who is the most senior member for Queensland, presides over the tourism portfolio while all this happens. It is simply unthinkable that a Queensland member of parliament, much less the most senior Queensland member of parliament, would preside over the tourism portfolio and watch an increase in charges being applied to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park visits. Mr Entsch-The reef.",23
21,Mr BEVIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area-and the reef-are clearly one of Australia's greatest assets. Those of us that have had the privilege to visit it can say from experience that it is truly a beautiful area that deserves to be preserved and made available for all to see. It is also a major source of revenue to the tourism industry throughout North Queensland. It is not just Roylan's Cruises or the Quicksilver tours or those other craft that go out to the reef that would be affected. The entire provincial coastline, virtually from Bundaberg north, would be thin seriously affected if tourism to the Great Barrier Reef were to be reduced. It is a simple fact that tourism to that area is under some threat. The Japanese tourists that have provided the bulk of visitors to that area are not coming in the numbers that they once came in. I was up in North Queensland towards the end of last year talking to some of the operators. They were lamenting the fact that in Japan there was a long weekend and typically the Japanese people have their fourday holiday and head out of town; but whereas in previous years literally thousands of Japanese came to North Queensland, last year they did not tum up. The understanding that the North Queensland tourism industry had was that at that time they had been outpriced by Hawaii. The people left Japan, went to Hawaii for their long weekend and then went back home, rather than coming to North Queensland. The simple fact is that that was before you lot increased the costs. What you have done is increase the charge. Of course, for some operators--or most operators-who pre-sell 12 months, 18 months, or two years in advance, what you do is take that money not from the tourists but from the operators. You are directly attacking the viability of those operators. It is simply untenable that that could happen. But for it to happen when a Queensland member of parliament was the minister in charge is disgraceful. It has not passed the ire of the press from Queensland. The Sunday Mail in November last year said: The reef tax, even in its watered-down form, is simply ludicrous. They got that right; it is simply ludicrous. They went on to say: Every few thousand dollars the reef tax raises will put another young school leaver out of work; destroying job opportunities that might have otherwise arisen had the tourist industry been encouraged, not nobbled. That, my friends, is what this government is doing to the tourism industry in the Great Barrier Reef: they are nobbling it. If the gang of five-the National Party and Liberal Party members representing those Queensland seats-had any integrity in this matter, they would stand up here and do what they say when they are back home. The home town heroes have got the opportunity to live up to their rhetoric when they go back home. Today is your day. Stand on the other side of the parliament with us and stand up for your electorate. (Time expired)",23
22,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I must start by saying that I am somewhat bemused by the cosmetic concerns on this issue shown by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Their limited involvement and obvious lack of understanding of the industry would suggest to me that this dissenting motion smacks of some sort of political opportunism. There are a number of members on this side of the House, including me, who have a real understanding and appreciation of our marine park operators and who have expressed real concerns about the initial proposal and the flowon effect that it would have to business operators and their communities. We chose to do something about it in the early days. I took the time, as did my colleagues, to speak directly to the operators. We were able to convince the minister, over a period of three months, of the adverse effects the implementation of the original initiatives would have on our industry and the community generally. I have to say that, while it may have taken a bit of time, at least the ministers were prepared to listen. Through working very closely with the operators, we were able to put forward a proposition where we are able to get concessions that were certainly not allowed by the previous government and accommodate their needs and concerns to make sure that this will have a minimum impact on their industry. I make absolutely no secret of the fact that I and a number of my colleagues publicly supported our business communities and our marine park operators, those people whom we were elected here to represent. Had the budget proposal gone through in its existing form, a number of us would have most definitely voted against that proposal in this chamber. We made that very firm commitment. Through protracted negotiations with the operators-and the member for Cunningham suggested that the operators were also to blame for this; that they rolled overMr Martin-They did.",24
23,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"They have a hell of a lot more business acromion than that. They put forward a proposal, which over time we were able to negotiate our way through, which would give them additional benefits or recognition that was never given to them by Labor. You talk about transparencyMr Martin-How was a 500 per cent increase in the tax",24
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Cunningham has had his go.,24
25,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This proposal was signed off by the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators and the Reef Tourist Industry Council. The first proposal they put forward was to increase the EMC from $1 to $2 commencing on 1 April 1997 and no further increases for two years from the date of implementation of the increase with further increases by regulation, but no higher than the previous CPI increase. They were seeking child concessions. It was their suggestion that the charge be split. They suggested that we look at a tourist visitor charge. They also requested that there be consultation with the industry to make arrangements for implementation and collection of the visitors fee. There are a number of other things that they also requested. They wanted a one-day maximum charge for multiple activities, a threeday maximum charge for multiple day tours or charters, a part-day charge for sunset tours, child concessions, retention of existing rates for beach resort hirer and resort activities and exemption from the EMC for transient charter vessels. They also wanted an inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of the authority. Their argument was-and I certainly support it-that if private enterprise is expected to contribute towards a government bureaucracy, then it is only reasonable that private enterprise be guaranteed that the money they are investing into that bureaucracy is wen spent and not squandered, as has been allowed to happen by the previous government. They were also interested in having the EMC identified on their ticket. One of the interesting things to note when talking with the operators was that they were very keen to continue to pay the EMC. They wanted to pay it. There was no argument about that. But one of the biggest beefs they had with the previous government was that it forced them to conceal that cost in their ticket. You would not let them identify it. Given the contribution of marine operators to the management of the marine park, both in kind and in cash contributions, I thought it was extremely unreasonable that the previous government wanted them to sneak in a costMr Martin interjecting",24
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member for Cunningham knows better.,25
27,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"They forced the operators not to show that they are not only utilising this resource but are also contributing to it in a significant manner. We were able to allow them to do that by being transparent. They can put on their ticket that there is a $2 charge, which is the tourist operators' contribution to the management of the resource that they are utilising. It is a $1 increase. Remember that for three years there was a CPI factor which had not been taken up. They were quite happy-in fact they offered to increase that. There is a rounding off factor which means that it will be some time before the charge reaches $2, but we have tied it into future CPI increases. I think it is important to realise that it suggested to the operators that we lock in that $2 charge and have no further increases and that any further costs be put back on the tourists. They did not want to do that. They insisted that the CPI factor be included in there because they were only too happy to pay their share of the cost of the management of that resource. Mr Martin-Are you telling me that $1 is",25
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will stop interjecting. I call the honourable member for Leichardt.,25
29,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. There were a number of other things that they were very keen to see happen. We have agreed to conduct an inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of the marine park authority. That will come out very shortly. We will make sure that the money that is invested by these tour operators is very well spent. We will also be looking at ways in which we can ensure that the tourist operators, the marine park operators, have a greater say in the operations and the conservation of the marine park through GBRMPA. Once again, this is a very important gain for them. It was always believed by the previous government that only their bureaucrats and the government had a knowledge of conservation and that those people who were sustain ably using it had no way at all of being able to contribute from a management perspective. I am glad to see that that has been thrown out the window. Mr Ronaldson-We've fought hard on this issue.",25
30,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Absolutely. I might also say at this time that the member for Cunningham raised the question of additional costs-six or seven other charges. Those nonstandard elements of the EMC were always in place. They were only increased by the same factor as the EMC charge on the operators. One of the other things that was brought in here which is important to acknowledge is that we did lock in on a one day maximum was charge for multiple activities so that, if the operator is operating more than one glassbottomed boat or pontoon-snorkelling activities or whatever-they still only pay that one single cost. Any suggestion that we have introduced these additional six or seven taxes is very misleading. Mr Martin-You have increased them all.",25
31,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"We have increased them certainly, but we have increased them in line with the EMC charge, which is most appropriate. I wish to refer to a report, which the member for Brisbane alluded to, entitled Managing Australia's world heritage. As we have acknowledged, the member for Cunningham played a very active role in it, as did the shadow minister for the environment. I am also on that committee. Paragraph 8.40 of that report states: The committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the moveI repeatIt supports the move in the 1996-97 Budget to increase the environmental management fee by $5 It goes on to raise other concerns, and they are reflected in the final submission. A lot of those concerns were already addressed in the agreement that we were able to reach with the tourist operators. Another point I would like to make is on cost recovery-paragraph 8.4 of the report. It states: A convincing argument can be made for charging those who benefit most from world heritage areas, either financially or as visitors. It is argued that, while Australian taxpayers as a whole contribute through government funding to world heritage management, those who reap special rewards from the areas by earning a living from tourism or through their experiences while visiting the areas should make an additional financial contribution. This was not a dissenting report. Both the member for Cunningham and the shadow minister for the environment participated. They are members of this committee, and that was the one that wasMr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member continues to suggest that I participated in the work of this committee. As he well knows, he was not there when this report started in the last parliament, but he is a member of it now. I was not involved in any aspect of this report's consideration.",26
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! There is no point of order. There are other forms that the honourable member for Cunningham could use. The honourable member for Cunningham will resume his seat.,26
33,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This section of it was certainly considered during my term in parliament. The honourable member for Cunningham was in fact a member of that committee at the time in which this was considered. Mr Martin-I was never there, and you know it. He's misleading the House, Mr Deputy Speaker.",26
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will cease interjecting.,26
35,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"He is a little sensitive, Mr Deputy Speaker. At this point we are only talking about the $2 EMC. The other charge which I will briefly go on to is the $4 charge levied on the tourists for the use of this resource. I have to say that, as was recommended in our report and is now acceptable world wide, people are expected to contribute towards the cost of management and maintenance of world heritage areas. It is not unreasonable to expect that tourists, and a large number of those come from overseas, pay a fee. These are people that expect to pay it overseas. It is not that they suddenly come to Australia and find that this is a whole new thing-suddenly paying for the use or access to world heritage areas. It is practised world wide. At Uluru and at Kakadu there is a $15 charge per person to get into that. Nobody complains about that. They expect to pay it. A lot of them think it is okay because they feel that they are contributing to the management of that resource. We were able to delay that till I January 1998 to allow them to facilitate that. I think that that in itself is very appropriate. I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of my industry groups, particularly those in my region-Ed Green, Steve Moon, Terry Russell and Mike Burgess for their assistance and support. (Time expired)",26
36,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I would like to thank the whips, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government Â« Mr Warwick Smith) at the table and the shadow minister at the table for allowing me to make a brief contribution to this debate. Let me commence by saying that I have never heard such arrant hypocrisy as has come from the Labor side in this debate today. I say 'hypocrisy' because this environmental charge was introduced by the Labor Party when it was in power. I am well aware of the circumstances of it because I was the person chosen by the tourist industry to negotiate with the government at the time. I negotiated with Mr Bruce Derrick who is the CEO of the Southbank Corporation-my mind is very clear on this-and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) would be aware of his competence in the field. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said that this money had to go to GBRMPA. What we negotiated with GBRMPA itself was that this management charge would go into facilities on the reef. You failed miserably in that and allowed GBRMPA to become a bureaucracy in its own right. Mr Martin-We didn't cut it by 2.2 per cent in the budget like you have.",27
37,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Yes, you did. Not only that, you were so sensitive about this environmental charge that you would not even let the operators put it on their tickets. You said it was a tax. If it is a tax, you created the tax, not us. Mr Martin-We did not increase it either, did we? One dollar-never increased-in 1993. Never increased since. You guys-500 per cent.",27
38,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I have a very clear conscience on this.,27
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Cunningham! And I remind the honourable for Hinkler to address his remarks through the chair.,27
40,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have a very clear conscience on this. When this new charge was announced, I called my tourist industry together-I did not slink away to some comer-and held two big public meetings in Bundaberg and Gladstone to find out what their real concerns were. In conjunction with my colleague the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), we took a proactive stance on this. We went to the minister, we showed some of the unfairnesses in it and, to his credit, he removed them. For example, multiple charging in the $4 charge was removed, the one day maximum for multiple activities and the three-day maximum for multiple day tours and charters were introduced. The hypocrisy of the member for Cunningham on this issue just blinds me. For example, you have never complained about $15, $7 and $10 charges to enter national parks that have been set up by your Labor colleagues in the states. Now you want to bag the government for doing the very thing that a few minutes ago you wereMr Martin-You stood up in Cairns and said you wouldn't do it.",27
41,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I have never said that.,27
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will cease interjecting. I remind the honourable member for Hinkler to address his remarks through the chair and ignore the interjections, which will now cease.",27
43,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I just reiterate the point that I was there when we negotiated the fee, and the tourist operators wanted it to go into facilities on the reef. That is where it was meant to go. You failed in that. You failed in identifying the charge. As a result of your $8 billion black hole, we have had to find money right across the broad spectrum of all industries in Australia and, unfortunately, tourism has to take its share of it. The tourist operators recognise that. As I said, I held these two public meetings. The things that the tourist operators were concerned about were not identifiable transparent charges that could be seen improving access and facilitation to the reef. They did not object to that at all. They objected to the bureaucracy of GBRMP A. I got a litany of problems. I can remember one. On one particular island, GBRMPA wanted this particular operator-under very heavy threat-to remove some lantana. It was dreadful and shocking that this lantana should be on the resort's enclave on this island. Some time later, lantana was found on the part administered by GBRMPA. But it was not a worry then. In fact, one person was foolish enough to ask, 'Will the leaves fall down and help provide mulch?' That is the sort of nonsense that went on. Tourist operator after tourist operator got up at those meetings and told me that they wanted us to make GBRMPA more accountable. They did not object to some reasonable increase in the charge as long as it was transparent, as long as it went back to the reef and as long as we did not have unfair multiple charging. My colleague and I went and saw the minister. No-one likes introducing a new management charge to any business anywhere, but we had to do it in the circumstances. One of the things we were able to obtain from the government was an inquiry into GBRMPA, which you failed to do in your term of office as GBRMPA's bureaucracy burgeoned. Let me make one covenant: I do not criticise GBRMPA for its pure science. I know the value of its pure science. But I have found from tourist operators that the way the ticketing was done and the way that the permits were issued between GBRMPA and the Queensland state government were a massive bureaucratic nightmare for the operators. They are the things that we have asked to be addressed by way of this inquiry into GBRMPA. Other things we obtained from the government were a more simple method of collection-which will be implemented-and a consultative process with the industry to give tourist operators representation in the councils of the tourist industry, something the member for Cunningham's party did not do. You did not give the tourist industry a proper consultaland tive process. I have found that my tourist operators, while they would prefer these charges did not go on, are not particularly concerned in the way that the member for Cunningham has said. He has threatened to come up and tell my tourist operators what a dreadful chap I am. Please do. Mr Martin-I didn't say that about you.",27
44,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Please do, because I will recite, like the litany of the saints, the failures of the Labor Party in tourism in Queensland. How can you get up in this parliament and say, 'We the Labor Party are concerned for the Queensland industry'? For six years, your state colleagues sat there in office and pegged the grants to those very same tourist authorities you were referring to between Bundaberg and Cairns. For six consecutive years, your state colleagues did not increase the funding to the tourist authorities by one cent. You bureaucratised the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, and now you come into the parliament and cry crocodile tears about the fall in Japanese trade. If Japanese trade has fallen in Queensland, you can put it down to the years in which the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation was under the control of the Labor Party. But if the member for Cunningham would like to come into my electorate-I would very much welcome you-I will debate you on any platform on what our party has done for tourism. The whole spectrum of tourism in Queensland was kicked off by a National Party government. It founded the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, which became the most effective marketing organisation in Australia. I note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) was once the deputy general manager of that corporation and did a magnificent job, I might add. It set such a sizzling pace for tourism in Australia that do you know what happened? Even the Australian Tourist Commission had to lift its act. That is what happened. We set a new standard for tourism in this country. Do not come into this House and cry crocodile tears about the Japanese trade and cry crocodile tears about Bundaberg to Cairns, because your party failed that part of Queensabysmally. Come into Queensland and debate this matter with me. I have no conscience worries about this at all. I called my industry together-they did not call me-and we talked these matters through. I consulted with the leaders. The environment charge has been accepted. We do not find it particularly pleasant but we know how to take our responsibilities. If ever I have seen a motion that just reeks of arrant hypocrisy, it is the motion before us today. Question put: That the motion (Mr Martin's) be agreed to. The House divided.

45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Jeokins)Before asking honourable members to leave the chamber, I remind them of the expectation about dress within the House. There is some leniency about the wearing of coats but I hope that honourable members, especially the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), will have due regard for arrangements to ensure that they are appropriately dressed. I know that on this occasion the honourable member for Paterson has had a very long walk into the office but perhaps he could leave earlier. Honourable members who are trying to dob in other honourable members will realise that there are various standards and that we would indicate from the chair that those standards should be recognised. NA SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",29
46,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS,"Braddon-ParIiamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.57 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill together with the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Application to the Commonwealth-Reduction of Benefits) Bill 1997 forms a further component of the package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The other components of the package, the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 were introduced to the House on 13 February 1997. This bill ensures that the superannuation contributions surcharge applies to all noncontributory superannuation schemes operated by the Commonwealth-essentially the judicial arrangements. The bill provides that the trustee of such a scheme is not to be taken to be an officer, authority or agent of the Commonwealth. This bill also provides that the Minister Finance may give directions in relation to the discharge of superannuation contributions surcharge liability of the trustee of certain Commonwealth unfunded defined benefit superannuation schemes. The bill further provides that compliance with a direction by the Minister for Finance in relation to the discharge of superannuation contributions surcharge liability of the trustee of certain Commonwealth unfunded defined benefit superannuation schemes is taken to be a payment of surcharge by the trustee. Recovery of surcharge liability is governed by provisions contained in the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Application to the Commonwealth-Reduction of Benefits) Bill 1997. These provisions ensure that the application of the surcharge does not result in a contravention of the Constitution. Financial implications The financial impact of this bill is considered to be negligible. The estimated revenue impact of the package of surcharge legislation was set out in the second reading speech to the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Brereton) adjourned. NA SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH-REDUCTION OF BENEFITS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading . Mr MILES (Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.01 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Application to the Commonwealth) Bill 1997, forms a further component of the package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The other components of the package-the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997; the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997; the Termination Payments Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, the Termination Payments Surcharge Imposition Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997-were introduced to the House on 13 February 1997. The bill provides that the trustee of a Commonwealth non-contributory unfunded defined benefits superannuation schemeessentially the judicial arrangements-may reduce a member's benefits to pay a superannuation contributions surcharge liability. The remuneration of a current judge is protected under the constitution from reduction during his or her continuation in office. This bill ensures that new appointees are subject to the surcharge.

47,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site, Deer Park, Melbourne. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Department of Defence proposes to enter into an agreement with the Victorian Urban Land Authority for decontamination of the site of the former Albion Explosives Factory at Deer Park in Melbourne's western suburbs. This would be part of a package of arrangements which would also allow the Urban Land Authority to develop the 460-hectare site for housing, industrial, retail and community purposes, setting land aside for nature conservation purposes, for open space and for habitat protection. Sale of undeveloped or developed clean areas of the site would be carried out by the Urban Land Authority. The decontamination of the site would be managed by the Urban Authority. The return to the Department of Defence for the sale of its land would be a series of payments from the Urban Land Authority, based on the value of the land assessed in an uncontaminated state. Under these arrangements, the net cost to Defence for the remaining remediation works is estimated to be $3.84 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",31
48,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of operational facilities at RAAF Base, Darwin. The Department of Defence proposes to provide the base with the facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. RAAF Base Darwin forms part of a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of Darwin. Together with RAAF Base Tindall, it is used for operational training and by the air element of the Australian Defence Force in northern Australia, often in conjunction with regional air elements. The proposed development works would enhance the operational effectiveness and capability of RAAF Base Darwin as a forward operational base and air defence base for Darwin. Of paramount importance is the improvement of safety associated with ordinance loading activities. The estimated outturn cost is $59.5 million. It is anticipated that construction will start in May 1997 and be completed by November 1999. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 13 February 1997, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",31

The Department of Defence proposes to redevelop up to 11 existing defence communication facilities and to construct new facilities on three greenfield sites. The proposal will provide for the installation of modern, state of-the-art high frequency radio equipment to satisfy the needs of the Australian Defence Force. The development proposal will provide for access roads, security, engineering services and buildings to house the transmitter, receiver and management functions. The program has been approved in the August 1996 budget context, and the current estimated cost for the building works a11d services aspect of the program is $75 million.

50,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I advise that the government will be supporting amendments 1, 2 and 4 of the schedule of amendments made by the Senate, given that they were proposed by the government in the Senate. In respect of amendment 3, I advise that the government accepts the amendment, with reservations. This amendment rejects enhancement to the visa capping powers proposed by the government. These amendments would have included provisions allowing for the capping and queuing of visas for spouses, dependent children, aged parents and re-idents of Australia and would also have enablw enhancements to be made to the visa Â¢,ftpPng:powers alluded to under the title 'cap .d tel'$Unate. provisions' . In a sense it is disappointing that they were nQ- acceptable to. the Senate, because the cllpacity ,to use those provisions, which the government believes may have to be used in the future, does mean that they can have consequences which are far more onerous than they need be. For that reason, I want to encourage my colleagues. in the Senate to look at some of those matters afresh. However, I take this opportunity to advise that the government will shortly be proposing consequential amendments which will allow for capping and queuing in respect of parents, and which may be more acceptable to the Senate.",33
51,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Firstly, I take this opportunity to welcome the government's position with respect to amendments 1, 2 and 4. These amendments flow from a welcome and constructive relationship that has developed notwithstanding significant differences that still exist between the opposithe tion and the government. When these matters were first brought before this parliament, I expressed the opposition's view that a number of the measures were harsh and unjustifiable, but I made it plain in discussions with the minister at the time that, where we could reach common ground, the opposition was seeking, in so far as it was possible, to enable that to happen. The opposition was very concerned that a gulf had opened up within the public sphere of debate on immigration matters in an environment that had been made too heated by the remarks of the Independent member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the circumstances whereby those remarks were not immediately repudiated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). At a later stage this parliament itself had to express an agreed position which was ultimately unanimously adopted-in the absence of one or two members-and which put us all on the record as condemning absolutely any discriminatory policy. That did not leave the situation as one in which there were not significant differences between the government and the opposition in relation to specific program proposals which were being advanced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). It was the opposition's view that the gulf between the two parties was unhealthy in the way in which the community ought to proceed on these matters. It is true that there has in the past been a recognition both on the part of the opposition and the governing parties that it is healthier for the community if common ground can be found for these issues-whilst there can never be absolute bipartisanship--and divisiveness not allowed to foster. There were further discussions between the minister and me and in those discussions I indicated to the minister that we could perhaps seek some common ground on some of the issues which had hitherto divided us. A number of these matters were taken up by the minister, for which I thank him. As a result, the minister undertook not to proceed with the English education charges, at least for the current budgetary period. I do not know what minister's intention is with respect to the next budget round. That is a matter between him, the Department of Finance and his colleagues. We held the view strongly that it was wrong in principle to increase the English language education charges. In opposition the government itself had said that English was the glue that held our community together, and it seemed to us hypocritical and inconsistent that the government in its first budget was proposing to increase charges for people newly arrived in this country so that the cost to them of acquiring those necessary skills would be increased. In recognition of this, the minister has accepted the deletion of the increased English education charges in the proposal for a single visa charge. So the minister gets his way, in administrative simplicity, for the way in which the visa scheme operates but the parliament, in a sense, expresses the correct precedence that it gives to the importance of English language. (Extension of time granted) The parliament through this mechanism gives proper priority to the importance of ensuring that those who do arrive in our country are able to access English language services and at a cost which is not excessive. The other area which was recognised by the minister as one which could be modified was in relation to de facto and interdependency applications. The opposition has never taken the view that it is inappropriate for the government to insist on verification of the substance of de facto and interdependent claims for relationships before people come to this country. There has been some suggestion that we were intending to be so irresponsible, but that was certainly never the case when we were in government, and in opposition we indicated in our comments on this bill that we stood ready to assist the minister with all reasonable measures to make certain that any looseness in the system could be dealt with. We supported the minister on a number of matters, including the establishment of a twoyear probationary onshore arrangement so that when couples, whether they be married or de facto or interdependent, arrived in this country the legitimacy of the ongoing relationship could be monitored and, if for some reason it was found during that period of time the relationship had not been sustained, the person who had been given the visa would then not be able to be treated as a permanent resident on that basis any more. That seemed to be a fair approach. We did, however, have genuine concerns about the application of a scheme that would have required a two-year prior cohabitation arrangement outside of Australia for people to establish the alleged legitimacy of a de facto or interdependent relationship. We noted, for example, that this seemed in practice to rule out the efficacy of what was a beneficial arrangement that this government and the previous government had recognised as appropriate. The minister was not saying that he would discontinue the interdependent and de facto relationships, but the practical import of saying that you needed a continuous period of two years living together before you could access that claim would have made it very difficult. Many people who have travelled overseas and established relationships and regard them as akin to a marriage-like relationship and regard themselves as having given the same kinds of commitments would have found it impossible to access that scheme. Indeed, one of the things that would have flowed from that, I believe, would have been an increase in the so-called sham marriages. In other words, people who had otherwise legitimately put themselves forward as couples, who had established a permanent and ongoing loving relationship which they intended to continue for the rest of their lives and, on that basis, who had come into Australia as partners would have been compelled to have gone through with a marriage ceremony which they really did not desire. There are of course some people who, for various reasons, choose to have relationships not consummated formally by marriage. That would have had an impact. More importantly, it would have also created a situation where that avenue of rectifying what would have been basically a bar to the efficacy of the de facto arrangement was not available to interdependent couples. The interdependency class is predominantly utilised by people who form same sex relationships. It certainly does not require that as a matter of law but predominantly it is so used, and of course such persons are not in a position to formalise their relationship by a marriage-like ceremony. So it would have opened up an area of discrimination in public policy. (Extension of time granted) In those provisions, the minister has undertaken that, in exercising his powers to create regulations under these provisions, the period will be at no greater than 12 months. Whilst this itself may create some particular instances of hardship, the minister has also recognised that, by providing that, there be discretion residing in himself which can be called upon in circumstances where that is necessary. Such circumstances may arise, for example, in instances where the legal regimes of overseas jurisdictions are such as to bring upon people having de facto or same sex rily be paid. relationships social or penal consequences of an adverse kind. The minister is aware of these matters and I am certain that we can regard him as being appropriately aware of those matters. r tbink there is a good solution here in the sense that the informal arrangements that used to exist-the benchlI).ark for a period of prior cohabitation-are now, as a matter goirig to be .set by regulation. That clarifies the matter and people will understand precisely where they stand. It allows the minister the capacity to respond to those particular ces where some particular hardship does emerge and allows him the power to deal with those matters. The minister has also picked up a number of concerns in relation to the comments made by the opposition regarding the power to remove from Australia people who have made false representations on their applications come here. This was not an area where there was any policy difference between the government and the opposition but a concern that we did not open up a situation where statelessness might be an issue. In the second reading speech in the Senate, the Minister Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, representing the Minister for Immicitizenship gration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, dealt with those matters in a way which we regarded as acceptable. I might just mention briefly, too, that allowing a one-year residency period overseas before de facto and interdependent relationshould ships are accepted in the normal course distinguishes those relationships from married applicants. Because the law will now nise that difference, there is a technical amendment which goes to ensuring that this set is not inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. Most members of the Senate who spoke on this matter, and indeed I suspect most mema bers of this House, would prefer that not to have to be the case as a matter of principle. Nonetheless, it is required. To achieve the social policy objective of getting clarity in this area, the opposition has reluctantly accepted that that is a price that must necessaI tum now, finally, to the issue of the capping arrangements that the minister has referred to. Perhaps if I allowed the minister to respond to those points and then deal with that issue separately, that would be convenient. The minister is anticipating some further steps in relation to those matters and perhaps we might speak briefly on those before the of policy, debate concludes.",33
52,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (11.29 instana.m.)-I do thank the member for Denison (Mr Kerr). In relation to the last matter he raised, there will be a further speaking opportunity when I propose the consequential amendment.",35
53,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Are you doing that today?,35
54,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, immediately. That is perhaps a more appropriate time to address to the capping matters, because I do have a more lengthy contribution to make on that. I do welcome the cooperation that has been extended to try to find areas of common ground. It has meant, of course, that the government has been able to achieve greater cost recovfor ery, which was an election commitment. It has ensured that we are able to deal with the deprivation issue-a situation which, before, has allowed people to come here deceiving us as to their status when they migrate and to cure that by taking out Australian citizenship a fairly short time after their residency. That is not a matter that be allowed to go on. And of course there is the cohabitation issue. It is regrettable in the context of the welrecogcome coincidence of view that we have reached on these matters that the honourable member saw fit to take a whack at the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He is always keen do this. The Prime Minister has always taken the view that he should assert positively government's position on issues of race discrimination and has done so at every opportunity and continues to do so. The interesting aspect of the Prime Minister's approach is that when we undertook very extensive consultation on the government's development of the proposals implement the race education campaign two issues came out very strongly from all the people who we were talking to. The first was: should it be called an anti-racism campaign? The people we were talking to said, 'No, is too negative. We do not think it is priate.' Second, they said, 'Whatever messages you are going to give, they need be positive. You will not change people's attitudes by berating them, but you can as, change people's attitudes by bringing them along with you in a better understanding our cultural diversity and what it means for Australia.' That was a very strong message us. Interestingly, it was the approach that the Prime Minister took on this very question. It is interesting that we have often talked about getting a bipartisan approach on these matters. I have been on the other side of House and have had to deliver on bipartisanresources ship. I have to say that when I was in opposiunreasonable tion I found that former prime ministers ministers would hand down from on high the government's position and then berate us there was not agreement with the position that the government had taken because we were some way depriving the government of some accommodation. bipartisan support which had long been a feature of this policy area. Mr Kerr interjecting",35
55,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Let me just say that I that would welcome from the opposition the same sort of bipartisan approach that I took when I was in the member's position. You may .want to use some of the words that I used describe the position we would reach. When we were able to agree, I used to describe it a 'coincidence of view'. I hope we are able achieve more coincidence of view. The government does have its policy commitments and we will be looking at the issues to as ones that ought to be pursued. As to the cost recovery issue, we have certainly said the that we will not proceed with the English and education charge. The Senate has taken a view on that matter. I do not think it is yet ready to reconsider that approach, but I hope it will in the future. We have withdrawn that matter so as to be able to proceed with it on another day. I expect to come back with to proposals to enable the Senate to relook at this question. (Extension of time granted) I hope that the Senate would look at the question, which I have posed before in this House, of the extent to which we can reasonably that expect the Australian taxpayers-in other approwords, other Australians-to pay for the English language education of the family to members of those who access Australia through, say, the business migration program say, investors bringing millions of dollars into Australia and the view that, if you come of with a spouse or children who do not have English, there should be a subsidy for the cost to of teaching those family members. I take the view that if you come through the skilled categories-that is, if you are in the categories where people are expected to have resources and skills that are going to enable the them to earn an income in Australia and to maintain themselves-it is not to ask that you meet the full and cost of the education in English of your spouse and dependants. I do not think that is if a matter it is unreasonable to press. I hope that on that matter the opposition may see the in light. I hope that we may be able to come to On the issue of the de facto and interdependent categories, the interdependents are not dealt with in this bill. I can regulate in area, obviously subject to the approval of the Senate and this House, in the same way that I am seeking power to regulate in relation to de facto relationships. I have always seen to the de facto and interdependent categories as like in this context, and when I propose as regulations as a result of the passage of these to amendments I will propose like amendments for the interdependent class. I noted that John Laws wrote of my compromising in this area that I was in some way a wimp. It ought to be clear that we are putting in place very significant provisions to enable us to deal with bona fides questions. The reason that we are of the view that there should be a reasonable cohabitation period for de factos before arrival in Australia is in order to be able to substantiate that the relationship is one of an enduring character, not one that has been conveniently cobbled together for the purposes of migration. Our policy argued that it should be two years, the parliamentary committee had argued before that it should be at least one and the former government thought that it should be six months but because of the Sex Discrimination Act was told that the relevant provisions had to be removed. That effectively meant that de factos could theoretically have a relationship of a week. Sure, somebody had to make a judgment as to whether it was bona fide, and it may be a difficult test to satisfy in those circumstances, but that was the position my officers were put in. We are seeking here a provision for a cohabitation period, which we think is reasonable. The 12 months as a compromise is a position that we are to agree on. But let me make the point as to why I think it is appropriate in this area to have that distinction. Marriage does bring with it some consequences. One consequence is that you can only separate through a process of divorce. That may be relatively easy in Australia under our Family Law Act.",36
56,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,But it has property consequences.,37
57,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"But it does have property consequences and, if there are children in the relationship, it has consequences there. This is different from a de facto situation where the parties can agree to separate without the consequences of that particular legislation. That is what I believe is the substantial difference. I confirm that I will be allowing in the regulatory framework that I am proposing for me and my delegates to exercise discretion where there are circumstances in which it is illegal or inappropriate for people to be able to cohabit for the required period and that that factor can be taken into account in the appropriate cases. Question resolved in the affirmative.",37
58,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: (1) Page 8 (after line 25), after Schedule 1, insert: Schedule lA-Amendments related to limits on visas Migration Act 1958 1 Subsection 5(1) (definition of aged parent) Omit the definition. 2 Subsection 84(3) Omit "", dependent child or aged parent"", substitute ""or dependent child"". 3 Subsection 87(1) Omit "", dependent child or aged parent"", substitute ""or dependent child"". This amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996, which has been circulated, is consequential upon the acceptance by the House of the amendments made by the Senate. Earlier this week the Senate rejected amendments to the Migration Act designed to enable this and future governments to deliver a balanced and orderly migration program. This rejection of the full range of enhancements to the capping provisions of the Migration Act is very disappointing to me. As I have said before, delivery of a balanced and orderly migration program is, in the government's view, the only way of restoring community confidence in the way in which the program itself is conducted. The government is on track to deliver its migration program of 74,000 this financial year. However, this was not helped by the disallowance by the Senate of some of the key measures last year, and I have elaborated before on the impact of those decisions. In relation to aged parent applications, after the majority of family test was rejected, we saw a 126 per cent increase in applications in the month immediately following. Similarly, we saw the rate of applications in the spouse category change. They had been trending downwards significantly month by month and when the rejection occurred the trend was upwards-not in the same order but it was still a trend upwards. We will be able to deliver the program this year, however, without the need to cap. The reductions that we had achieved early in the stage were sufficient, but with the time lags in processing applications we do believe that we will be able to deliver the program without the need to cap and terminate applications in the aged parent, spouse and dependant categories. However, the very significant increase in aged parent applications following disallowance, as I mentioned before, could well mean that next year capping will be required in relation to aged parent applications. The majority of family test would have distinguished those applications from those in the balance of family test quite considerably. I have given some directions in relation to processing. Certainly we are processing applications in accordance with the l-w, but we will give priority to those who satIsfy the majority of family test rather than the balance of family test. If it becomes necessary to queue, obviously those that will be postponed will be those where the lesser test is satisfied. But, obviously, with the growth that has occurred in the aged parent category applications, there is an expectation that next year we will need to cap. In relation to the spouse category, there is also that possibility, but decisions as to the direction and size of next year's program will be taken by the government in the next couple of months, and I am presently engaged in extensive community consultations as a lead-up to that decision. In that context, I would not like to predict at this stage what may be required in that area. In discussions with the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as he has alluded to, and in Senator Bolkus' s statement in the Senate to this bill, the opposition has indicated that it is prepared to support the cap and queue powers in relation to aged parents, but not in relation to spouses or dependent children. As a result, the government has reluctantly accepted the Senate's amendment to this Migration Legisbtion Amendment Bill (No.3). However, we are now moving what I am told are consequential amendments which will extend the cap and queue powers to aged parents. The capacity to cap and queue aged parents will reduce pressure on other parts of the program and make it less likely that the government will have to consider using the cap and terminate powers in migration classes where that is the only available mechanism. In the context of this bill, the government does not intend to continue to pursue the other amendments to capping powers. However, we believe that the ability to cap and queue all parts of the program is a necessary and appropriate power for the government to have. We will continue to press this point and see whether we can get further agreement in relation to those matters from our colleagues both here and in the Senate. The amendments I have moved today are straightforward. The first item in schedule lA is a technical amendment to section 5(1) of the act omitting 'aged parent' from the list of definitions. This is consequential to the other two items, which remove all references to 'aged parent' in the act. The second item in the schedule omits reference to 'aged parent' in section 84(3) of the act. The amendment has the effect of removing aged parents from an exemption from determinations suspending processing of visa applications of a specified class. The third item in the schedule omits reference to 'aged parent' in section 87(1) of the act. The amendment has the effect of removing aged parents from an exemption from determinations placing limits on the number of visas in a specified class that may be granted in a specified financial year. I commend the amendment to the House.",37
59,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I could not help having a bit of a wry smile when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) rose to describe the manner in which he had participated in what he said was a coincidence of interestsMr Ruddock-Coincidence of view.,38
60,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Coincidence of view or an attempt to get something of a more bipartisan position in relation to his period of time as shadow minister. He referred to the fact that from time to time during the last 13 years ministers may have come forth with proposals and then berated the opposition if they did not immediately fall into line. I thought to myself, 'The more things change, the more things stay the same.' I do recall on the very day that the Senate overturned the minister's regulations which sought to do much that he has now proposed by way of this legislation-to propose the cap and queue arrangements and measures designed to affect the right of immediate family members; that is, husbands, wives and dependent children-the minister came into the parliament and indulged in a fairly pointed dorothy dix attack on the opposition. I thought that was par for the course, but I discovered that it was really revenge for the slights that he suffered in his time. Let us get to the basic point that is at issue here. The issue at stake is the principle that was established in legislation-it was proposed by the now minister when he was spokesman for the opposition and agreed to by then government-that is, we would exempt direct family-husbands and wives, dependent children and aged parents-from arrangements relating to the power of the government to determine or to cap entry to this country. But even at that time there was a distinction between, on the one hand, husbands and wives and dependent children and, on the other hand, aged parents. Whilst the act prohibited the minister from capping those categories, inherent in the arrangements was a recognition that people coming to this country did not have an absolute right to bring their aged parents here because of the balance of family test. That balance of family test meant that, where people did not have at least half their family in this country, they could not avail themselves of the right to sponsor their aged parents to come to Australia. So it was never an absolute fundamental right that anybody who was a permanent resident of this country could inherently bring their aged parents here. I have sought, in discussions with the minister, to try to disaggregate, to break out, the two parts and to say that we hold it as part of Australia's traditions that no government has a part to play in determining who we should or should not marry or to interfere with that fundamental right of all parents to have care of their dependent children. We believe that it is unthinkable that the government should seek such a capacity. It is not necessary in the management of the program. In the spirit in which this debate is being conducted, I will not seek to use some of the evidence to debate this issue in detail, but I would simply make the assertion that it is completely within the minister's power to deliver a program of the size of that which he has undertaken to deliver without any recourse to draconian measures which would go to the fundamentals of family formation. I only believe that the minister knows this. It is true that there has been some recent one-off pressure in the numbers of people coming here under the marriage visa class. Much of that, of course, flowed from the aftermath of the decision-right or wrong-to admit some thousands of Chinese after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and the recognition that those students who were here could remain. Naturally, some have married Australians in Australia but many have sought to bring their partners out from China and, as they are now permanent residents of this country, the law has facilitated that. That is a one-off situation which may have sustained some increasing pressure. In a sense, that is working its way through the pipeline. I think the minister would accept that some of the pressure that he might have expected to exist no longer exists. As the demographics have worked through, I think the minister is increasingly seeing that some of the fears that he might have harboured when he first took office are less real. We would say that it is a fundamental family right to be able to have one's marriage partner and dependent children in Australia. We note, for example, that in the United States that is an absolute right. In most analogous countries it is an absolute right. A United States citizen has that absolute right; in fact, the spouse is not even counted as part of the immigration program. It is not really an immigration related issue. The minister recognised as much when he was the driving force to put into the legislation those measures which say that it is no part of the government's task to deal with those matters. In fact he said that it would be an unconscionable thing to do that. He said that if a government were to do that it would cause agony. Fortunately, the government will be spared that agony by the minister's welcome concesakin sion today that he will accept the compromise proposal that I floated with him some while ago; that is, we would offer to him our spirit support were he to propose a capping mechanot nism in relation to the aged parents matter. He responded by saying that, whilst this was not what he was seeking, he would recognise that that would significantly reduce the pressure that might otherwise exist in having to deal with other categories of the program. There are a lot of politics in this. The first time we discussed these matters it was indeed the intention of the opposition to propose exactly this amendment in the Senate, but the minister, determined to at least try his in the Senate to see whether there could be agreement on his proposals, insisted on taking be made. this issue to the wire. Instead of an agreed package being wrapped up in the Senate when the matter was debated there, the matter has now come back to the House and the minister is proposing an amendment to his own legisnarrowed lation. I guess ministers are entitled to try their hands, but I think it is a bit unfortunate that we had a debate on this point that need not have happened. There was an opportunity to get closer to that coincidence of outcomes with less rhetorical impact in the debate. I will make a couple of other points about this matter. In the debate in the Senate those representing the minister and speaking on behalf of the government frequently asserted that the minister was seeking a compassionate power to cap and queue applications for husbands and wives and children so he would not have recourse to the cap and kill sions. I think it is at least significantly ful that the minister has any capacity, as he asserts, to cap and kill. If he does have those powers, it would require the most extraordigovernments narily strange reading of an act which, cause of the minister's intervention when in opposition, has at least on three occasions clearly expressed prohibitions against steps that would allow the government to interfere in that fundamental family formation issue. I think that the minister would be heading into a legal minefield and a moral quagmire to do that. If the power does exist it would be to Borbidge's threat not to appoint a senator if a casual vacancy arose. In other words, it would certainly not be within the of the legislation and I suggest probably within the letter of the legislation. We have had this sort of veiled threat before that the minister would prevent Australians from being able to marry a person of their choice or have care of their dependent children and would use crude mechanisms to achieve that family were we not to fall into line. We are not going to fall into line in relation to those kinds of threats. We do not believe this parliament should fall into line in these matters. The minister is on record, in his previous incarnation as opposition spokesman, hand saying that it would be unconscionable-I think that was the word-that such a proposal We cannot take the politics out of this entirely. Significant areas of disagreement will remain. But I welcome the fact that the gap in the public policy area of debate has been somewhat as a result of these matters. I think that is healthy for Australia. I know there are some on my side who feel uncomfortable about the degree to which this middle ground has been achieved, particularly in relation to Sex Discrimination Act changes which are seen as a matter of principle, and some who believe that no ground should have been yielded in relation to the aged parents issue. Nonetheless, this is a matter of seeking to make intelligent public policy contributions to an issue which is always important to Australia's public debate and discussion but more importantly in the context of the present provitimes where debate has been allowed to doubtbecome so heated. I thank the minister for at least recognising that, from time to time, it is the case that dump things onto the parliament beand demand adherence and for recognising that it does require a process to work through it to try to get to a position which is going to be acceptable to the community, the parliament and all the parties in this House. I put on record my appreciation and thanks for the way in which the minor parties in the Senate have contributed to a sensible resolution of this debate. All on the non-government side in the Senate who have played their part in this debate deserve those warm words of thanks. They all came from different positions, but in the end they said that the government ought to draw back from some of the more extreme measures it was proposing, but did so in a constructive way. I conclude by saying that we will support the amendment because it was an amendment that we were prepared to move in the Senate. I think that we can say that some common sense cooperation has occurred. We firmly say that no government should restrict the most fundamental of human rights-the right to marry and start a family. I think the outcome is one which sustains good public policy.",38
61,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I conclude this discussion on the amendment moved to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) by welcoming the support for the amendment as proposed. I concur that it has never been an absolute right for people to bring their aged parents to Australia. We have had to make choices as to who would or would not be able to bring their parents to Australia. I understand that. If the amendment is intended to suggest, however, that capping should not apply in other parts of the program, I do not follow it through to that conclusion. The cap and terminate power is in place, and it was put in place by the former government. The provisions are there. It is regrettable to me that cannot move to use, if necessary, provisions that would not be as harsh on the people involved but would achieve the same outcomes so far as government policy was concerned. It is for that reason I have sought a power which would enable me to cap and queue applicants in the category of spouse and dependent children-not that I would look wantonly at using that power. I acknowledge that it is a significant step for a government to take, but it does depend upon the extent to which you are faced with a problem. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is always keen to go back to the time when I commented on these matters in 1989. We were dealing with a very different situation in 1989 to the situation we are dealing with today.",41
62,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,You were in opposition.,41
63,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, it is not a question of government and opposition. It is a question of the size of the program and the size of the relevant cohort of people we are dealing with. In 1989 we had a larger program, but the number of people who applied on the basis of a relationship with an Australian was much smaller. If I remember correctly, I think the figure was around 14,000 to 17,000. It was of that order. With a much smaller program of almost 74,000, I would have been faced with spouse, de facto and fiance applications of the order of 33,000 if I had not implemented some of these other measures. So almost half of the total migration program would have been people who were in a relationship. The difficulty we have is that, while we are endeavouring to implement a whole range of measures-many of which have been supported by the opposition-totest people's bona fides, we are still concerned as to what impact the additional applications from people seeking to access Australia on that basis is having on the balance in the program itself. It was for that reason that we sought to have a cap and queue power. A cap and queue power is one which enables us essentially not to deny a person we entry but to say, 'Your entry cannot be guaranteed at a particular time. It will be perhaps next year, but you will still be in the same order in the queue based on when you lodged your application.' A cap and terminate provision would operate quite differently. The cap, when it is reached, means that all existing applications are terminated. The impact of that on the parties involved is that, if they still wish to pursue an application to access Australia, they have to lodge a fresh application. If a minister were not so minded as to waive or refund the fees on the first application, people would be faced with a very considerable cost impost. That could be readily fixed, as I have suggested, by waiving the fees. People would then be in a race to put their application into secure a good position in the queue. In fact, some people who had applications in the year before",41
64,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,They shouldn't be in a queue.,42
65,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,That is what you assert.,42
66,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Dependent children in a queue! Infant children in a queue! Come on.,42
67,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,I am simply saying that would be the situation if that power were used. The honourable member for Denison has suggested there is some doubt about the power. He has changed his position somewhat since we had a discussion about how I would apply the power and the legal basis upon which it would be applied. In the beginning he was telling me that I had no power; now he asserts it is doubtful. Let me assure the honourable member that there is no doubt as to the legality of regulating to establish the appropriate class and the legality of the acts taken while those regulations are in place. It was not a veiled threat.,42
68,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,It was.,42
69,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"No, it was not. It was an up-front comment. It was not a veiled threat at all. I have made it perfectly clear what I was intending to do and I, as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, would face the consequences of that decision. I accept that. There may well be consequences. Some people may be distinctly unhappy that we have taken such a decision, and I can understand that. But I have been perfectly upfront about it. There is nothing veiled about it. I have simply wanted it to be known that - ere ought to be some good sense shown and the government should have a range of provisions that would enable it to manage the program. As I said, the government is not about denying entry to people, particularly its citizens. But the government is saying that the question of when people enter is a matter that can be addressed. I do not apologise for wanting to test the numbers in the Senate either. I am not in a position to know what is in the minds of the Independents or the minor parties in the Senate when they vote on these matters. At times it has been suggested around this place that you can secure support in the Senate. All I can say is that I have not known in any of these matters where support can be secured. I find out on the day matters are presented for a vote where some of those in the Senate actually stand on these matters. The interesting aspect in relation to this measure is that, when it was dealt with in the Senate, the Australian Democrats at first said they opposed it and then said they supported it. Then, when they changed their mind and decided to vote against the measure, they told us it was because there was a misunderstanding and they thought they were party to the deal between the opposition and the government on this matter. The fact is that decisions on these matters seem to change during the debate at times. Honourable senators make it clear that they will announce their decisions on many of these matters when they actually deliver their vote. I must say, on this matter, I did not note from either the honourable member for Denison or his advisers any greater certainty than I have as to what the Senate might be able to do on this question. I think it was appropriate to test the numbers. I will continue to test the numbers. I have made it clear that this is an area in which such a power may be needed in the future. But I do not intend to rail about it. Obviously, if the Democrats were of a mind to look at these questions again, I would welcome their support and introduce another bill at an appropriate time for this matter to be dealt with if it emerges that that support is forthcoming. I would not want, in the spirit of commenting about these matters, to lose any support from the minor parties or the Independent senators by suggesting that I am any less grateful for the support I do receive on particular occasions. Obviously, when there is that support forthcoming, I am appreciative of it. I make the final point-one which I hope all the Democrats will keep in mind when they look at the position they have adopted on these questions-that the Democrats are the party that have said in their policy that they believe we can have a net zero migration. That would mean a program of 28,000 people. They then tell me that we should accommodate all refugees and applicants on humanitarian grounds. That brings the number down to about 16,000. If you take into account the New Zealanders who have an as of right entry-and I have not heard the Democrats advocating that they should be denied thatthat brings it down pretty close to 2,000.",42
70,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Do you count them?,43
71,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,We do count New Zealand.,43
72,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,But why?,43
73,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"There was a time in which we thought they were going to be the seventh state of Australia. We are endeavouring to put in place common border arrangements, a bit like we have in other parts of world. Putting that aside, we are left with 2,000 places. I do not know how you will decide how to allocate 2,000 places in the of the program unless you have some very significant powers in relation to cap and queuing and cap and terminating applications. I find it very difficult to understand, as a proposition, how you can advocate on the one hand a net zero migration and, on the other hand, deny the government the powers to achieve a balanced program with 74,000 people. That is what these measures were designed to deliver-a balanced program with 74,000 people. You would have to use much more draconian measures and apply provisions much more draconian than anything I have proposed if you were seriously going to argue that net zero migration was the policy you were intent on pursuing. I just draw those comments to the attention of my Democrats friends in the Senate. I do it as softly as I can. I think it does leave them with a very interesting dilemma that they will have to resolve at some stage. I will invite them to have a look at this matter again because I will be pressing with the wider amendments at another point in time. Amendment agreed to. NA Public Accounts Committee Report",43
74,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I present the following report: Report 348-Advisory report on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996. Ordered that the report be printed.,43
75,Mr SOMLY AY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It is my pleasure today to table the report of the review of Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the Tax law Improvement Bill 1996. The bill is the second tranche of legislation to replace progressively the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The first tranche of legislation has also been reviewed by the JCPA, in report 345, and is currently before the Senate. The fact that this bill rewrites existing law the does not diminish its importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than tax laws. It rest should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all, from taxpayers to the tax office. The act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is nearly 3,500 pages long, it cannot be easily read or understood, it no longer has a recognisable structure and it has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the last 60 years. The cost to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro-economic reform. The defects of the 1936 act have been known for some time. Indeed in 1993, the JCPA report 326-a report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the ATO-recommended that tax law be simplified. That task is being undertaken by the tax law improvement project, known by all as TLIP. TLIP is rewriting the old act in five legislative packages. The subject of this report, the Tax Law Improvement Bill, is the second package. Complaints about the faithfulness with which the Tax Law Improvement Bill reflects the old 1936 act focused mainly on two divisions-division 42 dealing with plant depreciation, and division 70 dealing with trading stock. Accordingly, most of the committee's recommended amendments to the bill refer to clauses within these divisions. For the most part, the bill itself has been well drafted and the complaints have been few. The greatest debate during the inquiry has centred around what has not been included in the bill rather than what has. Time after time, the committee has received evidence from people and organisations frustrated that TLIP's narrow policy mandate has precluded it from simplifying the policy complexities that underlay the 1936 act. As a result, real simplification of the tax law is not being achieved. In report 326, which provided the genesis for the rewrite project, the JCPA recommended that the 1936 act be rewritten in order to simplify it. The committee believes that the previous and current governments have chosen to interpret 'simplification' in the narrow sense. TLIP's role is to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. TLIP does not have a mandate to make anything but the most minor policy changes. It is true that TLIP is able to make limited, small policy changes with the approval of the Assistant Treasurer. However, the changes have only been made where they have had no significant revenue impacts and where the changes help to clarify the operation of the law. The critics are concerned that, by having this very limited mandate, TLIP is perpetuating unclear or unworkable sections of the 1936 act in the Tax Law Improvement Bill. The committee concedes that there is an immediate and pressing need to reduce the complexity of the 1936 act. This reason alone is sufficient justification for the rewrite project. However, the committee believes that TLIP needs an expanded mandate to give greater latitude to contemplate 'small p' policy issues. The committee has recommended accordingly. Of course, TLIP would still have to refer any broader policy simplification recommendations back to government for final approval, but TLIP could at least consider a greater range of policy simplification issues that are of such concern to the private sector and which currently have been excluded from the rewrite. In report 345, the committee responded to the lack of progress on tax policy reform of any magnitude by recommending that a revenue committee of parliament be established. Such a committee would be concerned with tax policy simplification issues that are beyond TLIP's mandate to consider. Preferably, the JCPA should be given additional resources by the government to undertake such a function. Failing that, the JCPA recommended that a joint standing or joint select committee on revenue be established to undertake the task. The JCPA believes that the arguments for a revenue committee of parliament remain equally valid. For this reason, the committee continues to press the government for a response to the recommendation. In fact, the committee believes that. a revenue committee could complement TLIP's activities-if TLIP were given an expanded mandate-by coordinating and assisting the consideration of 'small p' policy issues. The adoption of these two major recommendations-TLIP with an expanded mandate and the establishment of a revenue committee-will facilitate the government's pre-election promise to allow greater private sector involvement in tax law simplification. The committee has also made a number of other policy recommendations which are beyond TLIP's current mandate to implement. Some of the recommendations are quite specific; others call for a wider review. All are urgent. They include recommendations for review of the entertainment and noncompulsory uniform provisions in the law. One witness rightly called these provisions 'mind numbing in their exactitude' and they should have no place in progressive income tax law. Such reviews will take time, with appropriate consultation to resolve. They should receive urgent attention by government, but their resolution should not delay passage of the Tax Law Improvement Bill. As I mentioned, the major professional and industry bodies, while supporting the rewrite process in principle, have expressed concern with the way it is being undertaken in practice. The committee was concerned at the strength of the criticism by these organisations of aspects of TLIP's work. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government allow greater private sector involvement in TLIP's decision making processes. TLIP's senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. The purpose of having these positions is to bring private sector experience and advice within TLIP. The positions play an important role, particularly as the committee notes the perception held in parts of the private sector that TLIP tends to take a pro-revenue stance when interpreting and rewriting ambiguous sections of the 1936 act. Although both positions have been filled in the past, a vacancy has existed for one of the private sector positions since December 1995. The committee is concerned at the delay in filling this position and believes that this needs to be done promptly. A stronger private sector presence in TLIP's senior management will help provide valuable private sector insights and perspectives and also reassure the private sector about TLIP's impartiality. This position would be most appropriately filled by a tax expert with a legal background. The committee believes that, even with both the above positions filled, there will remain a need for greater private sector involvement in TLIP's senior management. Accordingly, the committee has recommended additional funding be provided to allow TLIP to hire tax specialists on short-term contracts as different parts of the 1936 act are rewritten. There has been extensive consultation on draft versions of parts of the Tax Law Improvement Bill since July 1995. Nonetheless, critics have argued that TLIP has introduced changes into the bill before parliament that were not included in the final exposure draft version. There is argument over the significance of these late changes and whether there should have been more time to debate them. There will always be a balance to strike between allowing as much consultation as possible and ensuring that the legislation is implemented. TLIP will need to strike an appropriate balance for the next tranche of legislation in particular, which rewrites the capital gains tax provisions. For its own part, the JCPA has not had time to review the bill as comprehensively as it would have liked. The committee will seek greater time to consider future tranches of legislation if they are referred to the committee by the House. Ultimately, the confidence of all parties in the consultative process is vital if support for the project is to be maintained. The government will need to schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation. In summary, the JCPA continues to support TLIP's work, provided that the government supports the committee's recommendations for improvement. Completion of TLIP's rewrite process is the most efficient way of simplifying the 1936 act quickly so that tax law can once again be understood by business and tax professionals. Just as importantly, the next generation of tax professionals will be able to start their training and careers with a clearer and more usable act. Ultimately, however, tax .simplification requires more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of policy complexities. It needs a wide ranging review of tax policy at the still federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The committee urges the government to consider this. On a final note, the committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to the JCPA. Some have given evidence to the committee three or four times. We also thank the various officials from TLIP and the committee's consultant, Mr Michael Bannon of Duesburys. On a personal note, I would also like to thank my colleagues from both sides of the House and from both sides of the Senate who undertook this inquiry for the efforts they put into it. I would also like to thank the staff of the JCPA for the effort that they put in. The quality of the report reflects their effort. I particularly mention James Catchpole, Donna Christophers and Yolanda Rao. Those of us on the committee wish James a very successful wedding day on Saturday. We look forward to him getting back to work after his honeymoon. The committee believes that the efforts of all have generated a sensible and well informed debate. The result should be better legislation.",43
76,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I endorse the comment of my colleague the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am proud to be Deputy Chair. I start with a quote from a coalition policy statement for the last election: The Federal Coalition has three concerns with how this process has developed. That is, the process of tax law improvement and the rewrite of the tax act. It goes on: First, with only minor exceptions, participants in the tax law simplification project have not been allowed to advise on policy. They have been limited to undertaking a rewriting exercise. they have not been consulted on new tax bills before they enter the parliament and whether they conform with the principles of tax simplification. Third, they are under resourced, particularly with respect to the time required for private sector participants to fully participate in the reform process. That quote from the coalition's policy document is particularly relevant to the report that we brought down today, because it raises some issues which, after 12 months in government, still have not been addressed. The rewrite of the tax act was an initiative commenced by the previous government and one which had broad support across the chamber. Although we occasionally railed each other on the committee about our being against business on this side of the House and the other side being vehemently for it, the truth of the matter is that it is more a situation of disagreeing slightly on the paths but of having in many respects some broad principles of agreement. One of those principles of agreement is the question of red tape as it impacts on business. There can probably be no bigger example of red tape that impacts on the operation of business at all levels than the tax act, because it is, as has been said earlier, a huge, extremely complex document and one that needs urgent and extensive review and reform. However, having said that, there are problems with the TLIP process. I bear no grudge against TLIP themselves-I think they are doing a good job in difficult circumstances because, as was mentioned by the member for Fairfax, the fact is that they are under-resourced. One of the two private sector positions on TLIP, as was mentioned earlier, has not been filled since December 1995. Obviously, in a situation where the principal impact of the tax act and any rewrite that occurs is going to relate to the private sector, it is essential and crucial that there is serious private sector involvement in terms of the development and conclusion of any rewrite. We now have a situation where, for just over 12 months now, one of the two positions on the TLIP body has been vacant. In fact, it needs to be filled urgently. The committee has Second, also made a case for the extension of that from two to three positions, and I certainly support that. Another issue relates to the question raised by the member for Fairfax and taken up in the report about the need to address the question of expanding TLIP's mandate. Unfortunately, because of an illness in the family, I was not able to attend the recent committee hearing on this piece of legislation. However, as someone who took part in the earlier consideration of the first tranche of bills that came forward I say that the song remains the same. There is a serious need to consider a range of issues which might appear to the untrained-and I consider myself to be that in this area-to be not of major significance, but there are significant issues coming up which would be best determined as 'small p' policy issues. In fact, it is an issue for government and for this government to address. As their policy statement says, significant changes could be made which would have a real benefit in limiting red tape if those issues were taken up. The report mentions a number of these in recommendations in terms of highlighting what the particular issue is but agrees that TLIP is not in a situation of being able to resolve them. The report basically urges the government to take action on those issues. Going on from that, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Fairfax, there is the question of a revenue committee of parliament. The question of a revenue committee of the parliament to consider these sorts of issues is something which the government has to address. It is one recommendation from an earlier report which the government at this stage has not commented on, but it is an issue of significance. A range of these sorts of matters is coming forward, not only in terms of the rewrite of the tax act but of other legislation. There is a range of issues there which I do not believe this parliament is effectively scrutinising or making recommendations on. It is something which the government must address. As to the wider question of resources, I mention it with respect to TLIP itself, and also in terms of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or, if the government decides otherwise, another form of committee which could perform the role of a revenue committee. The fact is that in recent times the public accounts committee has regularly been getting requests to do reports on regulations of this type. On this occasion a totally unrealistic time line was given for reporting. I understand there are some reasons for that with regard to the question of operative dates and the need to get legislation through speedily. There is certainly no doubt that the legislation is broadly supported, but the fact of the matter is committees cannot properly consider matters if they do not have the time to do it. Luckily I think this particular change in the legislation has had less controversy attached to it than earlier ones, but certainly I suspect that components which will come through later will require significantly more time for them to be considered properly, to allow matters of contention, hopefully, to be resolved, and to ensure that better legislation is brought before this parliament. Going on from that, I would also like to say that I think the committee itself has done a good job on this occasion, given the limited time. I would like to congratulate the staff of the JCPA associated with that because they have played an important role yet again. I would like to congratulate TLIP, the private sector representatives who took part in the consideration of these issues, for doing what on short notice was a competent job in an area that will certainly require further consideration in the years to come. I would also like to congratulate James Catchpole on his forthcoming betrothal. I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Consideration in Detail Schedule 1, items 6 to 9. Consideration resumed from 5 March.",46
77,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"The proposed amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill relates to robots and machine tools and is another example of an opportunity forgone for this industry. I would like the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) who is at the table to understand the massive shift that has occurred in the Australian economy in the last 10 years in the direction of manufacturing and manufacturing for export. Since the mjd-1980s, manufactured exports have come to constitute 31 per cent of total exports-and that is up from 19 per cent. It is also predicted that, with the right sorts of industry policies in place, this percentage could be over 50 per cent by the year 2010. That is not to say that we will move away from our natural resource base, but it is to argue that we have to do more to it before it leaves the country. We have to value add, and we cannot do that without a manufacturing industry, we cannot do it without innovation and we cannot do it without the support mechanisms which get industries into that position. The category in the national accounts that refers to the higher tech manufactures, the elaborately transformed manufactures or ETMs, in the same period has in fact almost doubled, going from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. I would ask that the minister not be frivolous about this because, whether he understands it or not, he has carriage for manufacturing industry, in fact for all industry in this country, although he seems only ever interested in the tourism side of his portfolio with his various visits around the place. But the real issue is whether Australia wants a slice of the action. The growth in world trade is in elaborately transformed manufactures. Australia has shown a capacity to get into that field but, unless we actively encourage that, assist industry, support them and get into the marketplace, we will not be part of the action. All the other countries with whom we compete are giving assistance to their industries, so there is no such thing as a level playing field. It is true that we have achieve a level playing field but, before we get there, there has to be recognition of support mechanisms for the companies that are trying to compete. One of the groups which make up elaborately transformed manufactures has been in this area of robots and machine tooling. In the last three years this industry has increased its production by 50 per cent, increased its exports by 200 per cent and, indeed, its exports have grown by 20 per cent each year over the last 10 years. And why? Because Labor was prepared to put in place an environment and assistance that enabled them to get there. But that assistance has now been cut away. These industries directly support employees in suburbs close to me-Preston, Coburg, Moorabbin and Dandenong-in industries that did not exist before Labor's strategy of encouraging this type of manufacture. But it does not stop with the direct activity. We have to understand what these companies do. They are at the high tech end in terms of technology and innovation. Take laser cutting which is important in terms of manufacturing processes associated with steel, textiles and shipbuilding. So it is not just an important industry in its own right; there is the impact it has on those other industries which we are also getting into export activity in this country. The reality is that increasingly manufacturing is being driven by technology. That requires encouragement for software development, the process activity part of it, as well as the innovation. Yet these are programs that have been cut by this minister. He has cut the bounty, cut the R&D and has left industry to do it on its own. But they will not do it on their own. These are companies that, because of the activity they get into, require longer lead times for the investment to mature. That is why we have to take active steps to get them into the game. If the minister thinks that his policies are working, he should reflect on the latest national accounts figures, published yesterday. What we have is a graphic example of his policies driving our manufacturing sector into to reverse. In the last quarter alone we saw the manufacturing industry's production slump by 2.6 per cent. Let's just put this in some sort of contrast. (Extension of time granted) In Labor's last term, from the March quarter of 1993 to the March quarter of 1996, manufacturing output under us increased by 9.6 per cent, underpinning GDP growth of 13.8 per cent. Understand the importance of that. We were able to achieve economic growth of better than four per cent. That is why we got unemployment down. We had not solved the unemployment problem but we had punched a big hole in it. We got it down from over 11 per cent to just over eight per cent and we were on track to get it down to five per cent. That is only because we were encouraging economic growth and only because we were prepared to recognise the importance of the manufacturing sector to securing economic growth. But what has happened since the election? Since the March quarter, since this government was elected, manufacturing output has gone down. Under Labor, manufacturing output went up; it has only taken them nine months in office to see it go down. What is worse is that the biggest slump has occurred in the last quarter: a 2.6 per cent fall in manufacturing output-and this after the massive cuts into industry programs brought about in the last budget. The announcements made by the government in the budget have put all these investments on hold because those in the manufacturing industry do not know where they stand with the bounties, they have been told they are not going to get the R&D expenditure deductions and they have had their Export Market Development Grants Scheme cut. They have had all sorts of programs cut from them-$3.9 billion in cuts-and that is why there is a slump in the manufacturing industry. It is no wonder that industry is calling you to be replaced. You have failed them. More to the point, you have betrayed them because you pretended in the last election you would support them. You went to the election saying you would retain these programs and, as soon as you got into office, you dudded them. You turned around and said, 'All of these programs are business welfare. You do not deserve it. Get out and do it on your own. ' Well, you can see from the figures released yesterday the impact of your strategy. You are driving manufacturing into reverse and you sit there and shake you head. You will not even get up and defend the basis on which you have cut these programs. In the case of the machine tools and robots industry, your own Industry Commission recommended the continuation of this bounty-and you ignored them. You commission reports into the future of the industry, they advise you on a course of action and you ignore them. Why? Because the Treasurer is driving your agenda. You tell us that you are always in there fighting against the Treasurer, that you are taking on Peter Costello. But you are a wimp. You get done every time. So you go around whispering to people, 'Come in and help me. I'm getting done by all these Treasury fellows in there.' The reality is that you cannot win an argument. That is why the manufacturing industry has given up on you. They happen to think you are a nice bloke. They do not mind you going to lunch at their boardroom table. But you are totally ineffective, Minister. You might be decent company for them but they are looking for more than that. They are looking for a future for their industry. They are looking for a vision for the manufacturing industry and they are looking for a partnership with government. Labor delivered that partnership and Labor delivered growth. It delivered growth in terms of the economy as a whole, it delivered growth in terms of manufactured exports and, most importantly, it delivered jobs growth. We cannot solve our current account and we cannot solve our unemployment problem unless we generate net exports. You cannot generate net exports on free market ideology for because Australia is too small a marketplace. It suffers from distance and you have to compensate for the distance we are from that overseas markets. We did have a policy that was about protecting inwards in the days of Black Jack MCEwen and the previous tory government. But Labor opened up the economy. We opened it up to global trade and we were succeeding. The harsh reality is that you are driving it into reverse. This industry is a classic example of yet another one that is going to suffer under your inane policies. I just hope that you have a look at these statistics. Get some analysis done by your department; get it to do something constructive in showing you how you have driven manufacturing backwards in this country.

78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Truss)The member for Hotham will cease interjecting. Members who wish to leave the chamber, Johnston, R. would they do so quietly and promptly. Schedule 1, item 10.",50
79,Mr MOORE,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not surprised that not too many people are moving, because the lunchtime theatre provided here by the opposition is enormous. So we all ought to stay and see the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in action, because this is his warm-up. The new, hot tempus fugit, here he comes-there is no doubt about him. I move: (4) Schedule I, item 10, page 5 (line 27) to page 6 (line 4), omit the item, substitute: 10 Subsection 4(1) (definition of period to which this Act applies) Omit ""30 June 1997"", substitute ""31 December 1997"". 11 Section 10 Omit ""I July 1997"", substitute ""I January 1998"". 12 Paragraph 10(1) Omit ""30 June 1997"", substitute ""31 December 1997"". . The purpose of this amendment is to extend the termination date of the shipbuilding bounty from 30 June 1997 to 31 December 1997, as announced by me and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 16 December 1996. This change will improve the alignment of assistance to the Australian ship industry with key overseas competitors. As I have stated on another occasion, the government, in the interim, will closely monitor progress towards implementation of the OECD shipbuilding agreement. The government has already announced that it will review the need for any further extension of the bounty beyond 31 December 1997 during the second half of this year. I commend the amendment to the House.",50
80,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"This is another pathetic explanation by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). He comes in here and laughs that this is his lunchtime entertainment. The problem is, Minister, it might be lunchtime theatre for you, but you are an observer, not a player, and as the minister you should be playing seriously. That is why the industry will not take you seriously. In fact, I was tempted to think, as you were bumbling through your lines over there, as you always do, that in this debate you are like that little person who sits in the semicircle, helping people who have forgotten their lines. That is what you have been reduced to. The bounty that we are dealing with on this occasion relates to the shipbuilding industry of this country. There have been many indefensible decisions taken by this government in scrapping bounties but, of all of them, the shipbuilding bounty is the most indefensible. Why? Because it is an industry which has seen production grow by 200 per cent under Labor's program, exports grow by 150 per cent and employment grow by 50 per cent. It has created jobs in regional Australia: in Tasmania, in Fremantle, in Darwin and in Adelaide. It currently employs 3,000 people directly and 10,000 indirectly-and they are going to wipe it out. Already, Austal Ships, a Fremantle fast catamaran builder in Western Australia, has announced, because of this decision, the layoff of 300 people. In Tasmania, this shipbuilding industry is the largest single private employer in the state. We see at the table the member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), selling out Tasmania again. You are a disgrace in your representation of Tasmania because you will not stand up for jobs, you will not stand up for regional development and you let the minister go into cabinet and get rolled by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) every time because he does not have the capacity to win the argument. What we need is a change of minister, but you will not get any change of direction from the Liberal Party. They are committed to this free market ideological approach, to the belief that the level playing field exists when it not. What do we have in the shipbuilding industry? A circumstance in which our shipbuilders have to compete on a five per cent bounty with companies in Norway at 14 per cent bounty, Denmark at 13 per cent and Italy at 25 per cent. Our companies have been able to compete where we have five and they have had 25, but they cannot compete at zero. That is what you do not understand. What we also have is you reneging on your deal to the industry . We, as a result of the campaign last year, forced the government to retreat on the ships bounty and we did it on the basis of showing how ridiculous, inconsistent and hypocritical this decision was. Mr Moore-Hypocritical?",50
81,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Hypocritical, I do say, Minister, and you know why? Because you were prepared to payMr Moore interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (HOD. J.A. Crosio)-The minister has had his chance. It is a government amendment before the House. The honourable member for Hotham has the call.",51
82,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"The minister was prepared to spend $23 million subsidising the import of ships into this country, but he was not prepared to spend $9 million supporting the export of Australian vessels. That is why I said you were so hypocritical, so stupid, so inane; and yet you are the industry minister. Let me just go to the agreement that we were able to force you to. You agreed to extend the ships bounty not back to the period we indicated, which was June of this year, but to December. But you know what he told the industry at the time? The minister and Mr Costello, in a press release they put out announcing the backdown on the ships bounty, said: The extension of the shipbuilding bounty to the 31 December aligns assistance for Australian shipbuilding industry with key overseas competitors. It does not. And you know why? Because, under the Australian arrangement that he is putting in through this legislation, the industry has to have completed the vessel by the end does of this year. These things take 12 months to build, so unless the order was there before Christmas they have no hope of getting itand the order was not there before Christmas because they had frozen the bounty. Yet the OECD countries, with which the minister says they have to compete, can complete the vessel for up to three years after this period. He has told them that he will align them with the OECD, but he has ratted on them again. This minister cannot be trusted to deliver simple commitments, and we will be saying that not only have you ratted on the industry but also you have dudded Senator Harradine in the Senate, because your commitment was to support full restitution of the bounty and you have not done it. (Time expired)",51
83,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PAIRS,"This measure is about the shipbuilding industry, an industry which is now exclusively export. The government's measure on this industry is anti-export, anti-jobs and also antiWestern Australian and anti-Tasmanian. The shipbuilding industry in Western Australia has, for the last handful of years, been a thriving export industry. It has created jobs in Fremantle and south of Fremantle and it has created exports. It is a vibrant, vital exporting industry. And what does this government do in respect of the shipbuilding industry? Exactly and precisely what it does in respect of any government measure to enhance export or trade or industry-it guts it. This is a consistent course of conduct that we have seen from the government with respect to industry measures and to trade measures. Whether it is research and development, whether it is a bounty, whether it is export market development grants or whether it is DIFF, it is debacle after debacle. It is anti-export, anti-jobs and, in this case, it is anti-Western Australia. People do not need to rely upon my assertions or those of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for this point to be made crystal clear. We saw in Tuesday's Australian Financial Review an article entitled '$275m in lost exports: Angry ASA chairman blames Budget cutbacks.' It states: In a stinging rebuke of Government policy, ASA chairman Mr John Rothwell has told the Industry Minister. Mr John Moore, that Australian shipbuilders were now at a ""huge disadvantage"" to their European competitors. The effects of the government's measure will be job losses in Western Australia, lost exports and a substantial diminishing of the international competitiveness of Australia's shipbuilding industry. In an article in the West Australian on 26 February entitled 'Warning on ship jobs' there are comments by Wavemaster and Austal Ships, both Western Australian shipbuilding companies, with Austal Ships warning that 300 of its 800 workers would lose their jobs after July on the basis of and, as a direct result of, the government's measures in this bill. The Western Australian Minister for Commerce and Trade, and Leader of the National Party at the state level, described this particular measure as 'bloody nonsense' . The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) likes to parade to the community that he is a big supporter of industry. But we saw in the hit list story in the Weekend Australian last weekend that it is really a complete admission of failure. Here is the industry minister trailing his coat saying that, in the case of industry and with him as minister, Moore means less. He is not capable of standing up to the economic rationalists in the cabinet-the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who defeats the industry minister time after time. I oppose this particular measure. It is an example of where, as far as the industry minister is concerned, 'Moore means less': less export and fewer jobs. This measure is anti-exports, anti-jobs and anti-Western Australian.",52
84,Mr SAWFORD,PAIRS,"I would like to correct the shadow minister for trade: it is not only anti-Western Australian and anti-Tasmanian, it is also antiSouth Australian. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 exposes for all to see that, when it comes to shipbuilding in this country, this government, this minister, are suffering from a bewildering and monumental policy blindness. As far as shipbuilding is concerned, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) cannot be anything but a tabula rasa. When it. comes to shipbuilding and manufacturing, Australia is becoming terra incognita. We are really becoming a dark continent. This is a foolhardy measure and it displays for all to see the continuation of the coalition's apathy towards anything in the manufacturing industry and shipbuilding in particular. It continues a trend when the coalition was last in government. In its last year in government, eight per cent of jobs in manufacturing were just swept away and now it is doing it in the first years of its new coalition government. Shipbuilding is a success story and the minister is about to apply a blow torch to it. It appears that increased production, increased exports and increased jobs in shipbuilding do nothing for this government and do nothing for this minister. The manufacturing industry, under Labor, increased its exports by over 400 per cent. But, under this government and this minister, it is simply wallowing away. It believes government should get out of the way. Government wants no role in business or manufacturing or anything to do with shipbuilding. This government is completely negative on anything to do with the shipbuilding industry. The responsible minister is ignored in cabinet. He has been sidelined permanently and he needs to be replaced. It is a terrible message that you, Minister, and this government are sending to the shipbuilding industry and to manufacturing in general. The abolition of the shipbuilding bounty defies common sense. The government wants a five per cent cut in support to Australian builders of vessels, nearly all of which, as the shadow minister for trade pointed out, are exported. The Australian shipbuilding industry is a world leader in high-speed catamaran production. Look at the success story: production up 200 per cent; exports up 150 per cent; employment up 50 per cent-it is a great story, Minister. What is the government's response? Give it a belt around the ears! Do not be concerned with jobs, or growth, or progress, or the battling families which this government so fraudulently purported to support at the last election. As the shadow minister pointed out, how is Australian shipbuilding expected to compete against Scandinavian countries with around 13 per cent and 14 per cent, and Italy with 25 per cent, if this country's rate is at zero? Would anybody in the USA or European countries follow this sort of economic madness? The USA is not going to agree to this OECD agreement. This minister shows no consistency. He gives $23 million to Shell and BHP so they can import ships built in Holland, but he gives nothing to Australian shipbuilders. He will not even give them $9 million.",52
85,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,You are talking to the chair.,53
86,Mr SAWFORD,PAIRS,I was hoping the minister would listen. Mr Moore-I cannot hear because of all the chat. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio}-If the minister would give it a break he might hear what is being said. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has the floor.,53
87,Mr SA WFORD,PAIRS,"I would like the minister to get up and explain his actions to the House. I would like him to explain them to the company which lost $225 million in contracts-it lost jobs, its employees suffered, families suffered, and the nation suffered. The impact of this particular measure goes far wider than just shipbuilding. It sends a chilling message to all manufacturers in this country. It tells them that, whether they be in the steel industry, the car industry, the pharmaceutical industry or the plastics industry, no matter where they are in Australian manufacturing, this government does not give a damn. This government is simply going to expose manufacturers, hang them out to dry and let the market rip. The signals are pretty clear. Those employees and employers that Labor helped through the shipbuilding bounty-the battling families that this government purported to support at the last election-have been hung out to dry. Where is the leadership? It has gone missing. Where is the concern for economic growth? Where is the concern for jobs? Where is the concern for battling families? Where are these relaxed, comfortable paths down which manufacturing industry can go to expand and grow? This government puts tacks, spikes, and booby traps on that path-it does everything it can to stop them. Minister, do this country a favour-resign! (Time expired)",53
88,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"The real problem with this debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill is that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will not enter into it. He has moved the amendments that he has circulated, but he will not answer the questions that have been put to him. The Chief Government Whip is hovering. He is concerned about the length of this debate, but the debate could have been curtailed if the minister had addressed the issues put to him. He will not do that. I understand your frustration, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the minister's continual interjections, but his interjections have been the only exposure we have had to what he is thinking. Some of those interjections, unfortunately, have been inanities. We want to see some response to the industry's concerns about the shipbuilding bounty. The basis of the extension of the bounty to 31 December-the only revelation that was in the short combined press release of the minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello )-was that this was to enable our arrangements to conform to the OECD agreement. As the Australian Shipbuilders Association said on behalf of the industry, that is not the case. In his contribution to this debate, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) put the position of the ASA, but the minister refuses to address these issues. What the opposition is asking the Minister, on behalf of the Australian workers who are working in a very successful industry, an industry which is now export directed, is to indicate what the future will bring. What if the OECD agreement is not fully ratified? What about the inconsistency between the agreement and the provisions of this bill? When will that be addressed? When can the shipbuilding industry act in the knowledge that it is operating on a level playing field? When will the industry find that free trade does equate to fair trade? Because this bounty only goes to the end of this year it is likely, as has been said repeatedly, that jobs in this particular industry will go offshore. What Australian manufacturers want the minister to say is what he will do to prevent jobs going overseas. What will he do to protect Australian jobs? As the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has said in his contribution, it gives a very bad signal to not only the shipbuilding industry but to other industries as well because there are big tests just around the comer. There is a big test for this minister and a big test for his government in its reaction to the Productivity Commission report on the automobile industry. The other big decision that has to be made is in relation to the pharmaceutical industry and the response to the continuation to the factor F plan. In both those cases, industry plans that have been successful have driven those two particular industries into an export orientation. Those plans have ensured that there has been job growth and ensured that Australia has entered overseas markets in a competitive way. What is the government going to do to ensure that those industries continue to grow? It is not only the protection of the present numbers of employees or the present trades that they have at the moment, it is the potential for increase, the potential for ensuring that successful industry sectors can continue to grow that is so important. It is disappointing that whilst the minister has sat through the consideration in detail stage of this bill-and I applaud him for his stamina in doing that-he has not entered the debate. He has just gone through the formal motions of putting his amendments. He could have saved a lot of the parliament's time if he had addressed those issues that have been raised by the opposition. It all gets back to the one question. What this minister is being asked is: what will he do to protect Australian jobs? What will he do to support Australian industry to ensure that it has levels of employment that will increase? If he has set a target for manufacturing industry then he will not reach that target unless he takes appropriate action to ensure that those jobs are protected. Bounty is one aspect. There is a whole range of other policy tools that he can use. What we would like to see from this minister is some action.(Time expired)",54
89,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PAIRS,"I wish to comment on this bill, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. I join with the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) in expressing the Labor Party's concern about a government decision that is going to result in the export of Australian jobs. The member for Scullin is correct, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has failed yet again. The reality is that as a result of this decision we have undermined our capacity to maintain a decent shipbuilding industry in Australia. I would have thought that Australia, as an island nation, should be giving support to the shipbuilding industry. The truth of the matter is that as a result of this government's decision, Australian shipbuilders will only receive the bounty for ships until 31 December this year even though, for example, the average car ferry-our main export-takes around 12 months to construct. That is what we offer to Australian industry. What occurs overseas? We hear the government concern about mainstream Australia at the moment, about ensuring that there is a level playing field. This is what a level playing field means in the mind of the minister. While we are denied assistance beyond 31 December this year, European and overseas shipbuilders will continue to receive the bounty and assistance of between nine and 25 per cent for at least another three years. The minister wants the Australian shipbuilding industry to believe that there is no impact as a result of this decision. I will tell you what: it is a national impact. It extends across the length and breadth of Australia. Not just our coastline but also our industry inland depends on the shipbuilding industry for the purposes of fabrication of parts used in the shipbuilding industry. Let us go to the state of Tasmania. Unemployment is at 10.2 per cent. This is not of concern to the minister or the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but of concern to Tasmania and of concern to Australia at large. What will this decision do to the largest private sector employer in Tasmania, Incat, one of Tasmania's most successful shipbuilding enterprises? I know, for example, that the Prime Minister, when he goes to Tasmania, likes to stroll around Incat's shipbuilding yards, to glow in the glory of the success on the employment front, one of the bright spots on the employment front in Tasmania. I'll tell you what: he will not be welcomed there by the shipbuilding industry, especially those workers and their families, in the future. This decision will not only sabotage employment opportunities in Tasmania, it will sabotage the expansion program of this company. The company has already had its capacity to employ young people undermined by government decisions, following a decision which says that because it employs 100 people already, it cannot access ancillary payments for new apprentices to the firm. I might also say in passing that Incat has already lost innovative research program assistance as a result of changes in previous government decisions. The shipbuilding bounty is an investment in jobs. It is an investment in the industry that Australia, as an island nation, ought to support. If the bill is passed, the shipbuilding bounty goes at the end of the year. The whole basis of the firm's expansion to European and Asian markets will be kicked from underneath it. I know that from the minister's point of view that is probably of little worth to him, because he is not too interested in inspecting shipbuilding yards in Tasmania. But I can already see the itinerary of the trip overseas to inspect foreign shipyards because he will have exported Australian jobs to foreign shipyards. It will be a good itinerary. He will trip around the world and look at ships that we will be importing to Australia, having successfully undermined the capacity of Australian industry to grow, to export and to create jobs. It is about time the Australian community sent the message loud and clear to the minister and the cabinet. Its anti-job strategy is unacceptable. The revised employment figures just released today clearly show that the employment growth is not as good as the Treasurer at the dispatch box a couple of weeks ago led the Australian community to believe. Vote for Australian jobs; vote for the Labor party proposal to extend the bounty and ensure that industries such as those in Tasmania that are vitally concerned with the future of the shipbuilding industry are protected, so that we protect Australian jobs and support mainstream Australia. The government is to be condemned. Frankly, rather than planning overseas trips to look at foreign shipyards, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism ought to be concerned about Australian jobs and Australian families. Companies such as Incat are companies we are proud of. It extends to South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, to name a few states. It is about all Australians benefiting from bounties that give assistance to Australian industries. It is about decent industry policy; it is about the future of Australia; it is about regional Australia; it is about jobs and job growth. We need it as a nation. (Time expired)",55
90,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Hotham) (1.18 p.m.)Madam Deputy Speaker, by agreement, there is just over 10 minutes left in this debate and I will be the last speaker from our side in the next five minutes. I am leaving the last five minutes for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to get up and defend the fact that he reneged on an agreement with the Australian shipbuilders' industry in this place. I tell you why you have reneged, Minister, and I want you to take note of this because I want you to use the last five minutes to defend your outrageous position. When you announced the backdown on the ships bounty, you wrote to the Australian Shipbuilders Association outlining what the OECD arrangements were, and you said: Commitments made to support shipbuilding prior to the date of entry into force continue, provided that a vessel is delivered within three years from the date of commitment. A commitment made in January 1997 would apply to a vessel delivered by January 2000. That is what you wrote and said to the Australian shipbuilders industry. In case it is news to you, I can hand you a copy of your letter. The next important step in this equationkeep this in mind, Minister-is that you told them what the OECD arrangements were. They could finish within three years of entering the arrangements. In the press release that you issued with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announcing the backdown, you said: The extension of the shipbuilding bounty to 31 December 1997 aligns assistance for the Australian shipbuilding industry with key overseas competitors. Little wonder that, when members of the Australian Shipbuilders Association saw your subsequent announcement, they sent a letter back to you on 14 February which said: It seemed, just prior to Christmas, that the industry was back on a level playing field with its OECD country competitors after some sensible reconsidering by the government. That has proven not to be the case. The government has failed to address the issue correctly and, once again, the industry faces turmoil and a very uncertain future. On 12 February, in a press release headed 'Clayton's shipbuilding bounty', the same organisation had this to say: Whilst the industry was initially very excited and relieved by the announcement, it has proved to be nothing more than a disappointing teaser and, in reality, of no value at all. With construction time of an average car ferry being around 12 months, this effectively means that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build a ship with the aid of a bounty. It is regrettable that, due to previous deliberations by the government, our industry has lost substantial contracts with a total value exceeding $275 million. Understand this: the cost to budget was $9 million, and Australia loses $275 million. Great investment, Minister! You dabble in the share market-or you used to until we forced you out of it-and I am sure you w-u!d not think that was a great return on the dIVIdend. The Australian Shipbuilders Association goes on to say: Austel Ships was faced with shedding 300 of their SOO-strong work force, with many other yards downsizing proportionately. The issue of moving operations offshore has reignited as a serious option for future viability. Over 13,000 Australians are employed directly and indirectly by this industry which earned in excess of $500 million in exports last year. You are decimating this industry, but worse of all you are deceiving them. You tell them that you will reverse the decision, and then you do not implement that. Minister, did you write to them telling them of the OECD position? Did you, in announcing the backdown, say that the extension was based on, and aligned Australians with, the OECD position? Why have you reneged on that agreement? You have an obligation to this House, in which you are accountable. If you do not answer, you will be seen as a deceitful person who is not prepared to back his decision. You are required to come into this place and explain yourself. You have betrayed the manufacturing industry but, worse of all, you have deceived the shipbuilding industry of this country. Members of that industry entered discussions in good faith and you have ratted on them. As we all know, people do not like rats. You have an obligation to explain yourself. I invite you to do so.

91,Mr LATHAM,CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Werriwa) (1.36 p.m.}-The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996 mirrors the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 introduced by the previous government. The bill arose in response to the decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the Crawford House Press case, which identified an anomaly in the voluntary administration scheme for companies experiencing financial problems. The bill's primary aim is to allow recognition of the debts incurred while a company is under a deed of company agreement, voluntary administration, by the liquidator as debts or claims that are provable in a winding up situation. The Crawford decision found that under the existing law this is only possible where the scheme is undertaken by an appointed administrator, and not the company itself, as was the case in Crawford. The bill rectifies this but does not afford any priority to new creditors when a company is under a deed of company agreement. The issue of priority remains a contentious one in a legal sense. The bill also contains a retrospective sion to protect liquidators who have interpreted the Corporations Law as originally intended when the voluntary administration scheme was introduced. The 1995 bill raised the question of priority for creditors of a company after it has entered a deed of company agreement. Where the deed allowed for the appointment of an administrator, it was accepted that any new debts were provable and received priority in any subsequent liquidation. However, the Crawford case held that if debt is incurred by the directors of a company in lieu of an administrator, the debts not only do not rank but are not provable. The proposed legislation will allow such debts to be provable but not with any priority. At the time of the 1995 bill, the then justice minister, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), argued that this issue was complex and needed more detailed consideration. The bill, he suggested, was not intended to make any substantive changes to the operation of the law. Although the current government has taken a similar approach with the identical 1996 bill, it has made clear its intentions to refer the matter to the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. The government's rationale for pursuing the same bill is centred around certainty and stability in the knowledge that a number of insolvency practitioners have been operating on the assumption that the 1995 bill would become law. Apart from the issue of priority, the opposition sees no other points of contention in this particular piece of legislation. This bill is essentially giving legislative effect to an established common law principle and proposes amendments to the Corporations Law. I take this opportunity, however, to make some observations on the government's recent approach to a number of issues in amending the Australian Corporations Law. Two days ago, for instance, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was widely reported for his supposedly tough stance against 'the excesses of the 1980s'. He claimed that people 'should remember the excesses of the past and use provithem as an example to curtail their animal spirits'. The irony is that corporate excesses are not a thing of the past: they are alive in the present, illustrated in the form of the obscene remuneration of company directors and executives which plagues any notion of corporate responsibility in this country. It is an issue which the government has sought to conveniently sweep under the carpet but it is one which will not go away. The Treasurer has said of novice investors, 'We don't want their first experiment with equities to be a nasty one. We want it to be a safe and encouraging one,' as if the majority of Australians have money to burn in the same way as the government's shareholder-rich front bench. These issues are of major concerncorporate responsibility and the level of corporate salaries being paid throughout Australia-in working class electorates such as mine and yours, Madam Deputy Speaker. These questions of public morality and double standards raise a great deal of interest. At a time when ordinary Australian workers are being forced to exercise wage restraint, chief executive officers in Australia are being offered, and are accepting, lavish remuneration packages which most Australians will never see in their lifetime. All we have from this government is an ineffective response which, according to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), sets out an edict that if you are not a shareholder in a unit trust then you are, by definition, a public sector bludger. At a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is promoting open competition in the labour market, competition is limited to a select few when it comes to corporate Australia. Under this government, Australian workers will not see a real pay rise for a long time. We are confronted with this government's ideological obsession with labour market deregulation and its opposition to the concept of a living wage. Yet the government has done nothing in this legislation and nothing in the Treasurer's public statements to restrict the obscene level of chief executive officers' salaries. The Prime Minister has completely avoided the question of legislative and non-legislative means to address this important issue. Equally, the Treasurer's recent comments advocating corporate governance failed to address good corporate morality in the regulation of public companies, where the issue of director and executive salaries is an important part of the overall debate. The disclosure in October 1996 that a CEO of Coles-Myer received a $1.2 million rise in salary-increasing it to $2.8 million in the previous financial year-resulted in widespread public criticism. For instance, the Australian Financial Review quoted one institutional investor as having said: . . . the Bartels package was obscene given that Coles' earnings and share price had, on average, underperforrned on the All Ordinaries Index since his appointment four years ago. This view, spread right throughout the community, highlights the fact that the investment and public community believes that any additional remuneration paid to directors and executives ought to be performance based. The debate over the level and composition of executive salaries has aroused several sources of concern through the years. On one hand, it is argued that remuneration packages offered by Australian companies must be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors and managers of the highest quality. Advocates of this view believe the performance of companies in any country and its consequence in the economy depends to a large extent on the directors and senior executives who direct them. On the other hand-and this is the view that I would argue-shareholders and other employers of companies have a right to expect a proper balance between the need to offer incentives to top management and the incentives to other employees for their contribution to the success of the corporation, particularly when ordinary wage earners are being called upon constantly to exercise wage restraint. Associated with these employee rights, the general public also has an interest as consumers-an interest in making sure that they are not victims of price inflation driven by the excessive remuneration packages paid to directors and senior executives. I turn now to the question of overseas comparisons. In 1995, two reports were published in the United Kingdom as a result of public and shareholder concerns with executive salaries-the Greenbury report and the Report of the Employment Committee of the House of Commons. The former highlighted serious deficiencies in the existing provisions for disclosure of directors' remuneration in the UK Companies Act. One of its major recommendations was: . .. the way forward . . . lies not in statutory controls, which would at best be unnecessary at worse harmful, but in action to strengthen accountability and encourage enhanced performance. Much significance was also attached to the need for full disclosure and that individual directors' remuneration should detail all elements in the packages of each individual director by name and ought to include the value of pension and other benefit entitlements earned. This is an important point in the companies law: that full disclosure of the full extent of remuneration should be in the public interest, fully part of the public accountability process. The House of Commons report concluded that formal regulation of levels of executive pay is unlikely to be effective nor desirable and recommended that the disclosure requirements laid down in the stock exchange rules be consolidated into the Companies Act for large companies. In Australia, of course, we accept those recommendations because of constitutional provisions which make it very difficult to directly regulate the level of executive pay. It was further recommended, though, that shareholders be given the right to approve any new incentive schemes for the directors of publicly listed companies. The report cited the practice in the United States-a practice which should be of great interest to the House-where shareholders vote regularly on the adoption or renewal of share option schemes and on certain cash bonus plans. Most importantly, the Employment Committee saw a greater and active role for institutional investors influencing companies towards best practice in corporate governance. The US requirements for disclosure of executive pay are often hailed as instructive for Australian purposes. The US has strongly embraced the restructuring of executive remuneration along the lines of performance based indicators. This is supported by the US tax system, which disallows corporate tax deductions for remuneration exceeding $1 million per annum unless it is performance based. That echoes a point I made in debate just a and few days ago, that when we talk about reciprocal responsibilities in Australia it should not only apply to the social welfare sector. The allocation of government resources for business related purposes means that those corporations have a very important social responsibility in how they use government assistance. They should not be using government industry assistance to strip down companies, to minimise tax, to engage in public immorality, or to engage in poor practices of corporate governance. Corporate Australia needs to be as socially responsible as any part of the social welfare sector and, at a time when the government is talking about work for the dole and the Prime Minister talks the language of social responsibilities, why aren't those responsibilities also being extended to corporate Australia? What is good for the social welfare sector should also be good for the business welfare sector. That is an important principle to which the Australian Labor Party adheres and will be trying to advance in debates in the House for many years to come. Turning now to the deficiencies in other areas in the Australian Corporations Law, section 239 of the law provides for disclosure in limited instances. Information pertaining to director and executive remuneration is also derived from schedule 5, which provides for a limited and inadequate form of disclosure. The absence of any requirement that the component parts of remuneration packages be disclosed is a major defect in its provisions. Shareholders have a legitimate interest in knowing the company's remuneration policies, the proportion of individual packages which are performance based, and the criteria for measuring performance. At present, schedule 5 disclosure provides no information on any of these significant matters, a very real public concern which the government should be addressing. I urge the government to introduce reforms in this area. Australia's current disclosure rules for director and executive remuneration clearly lag behind the transparency advocated by international standards, particularly in the United States. An Australian author on this subject, Jennifer Hill, has argued that recent developments in remuneration have attempted to align the interests of the shareholders and the self-interest of company officers by creating remuneration packages where both groups have an interest in making the company successful. One technique for achieving this alignment is to link a substantial proportion of executive remuneration to corporate performance. The need to update our disclosure requirements is clear. The increasing internationalisation of security markets makes it imperative that Australian standards of corporate governance keep pace with international developments. The Treasurer, in his approach to corporate governance, cannot have it both ways. He cannot Claim to be a reformer of corporate governance, yet choose to ignore a pivotal issue in the debate, that is, the question of disclosure for executive and director salaries. The Treasurer has made clear his belief that the Corporations Law should be viewed through an economic construct, yet in the Australian Financial Review on 28 January he preached the value of 'legal and ethical requirements' . This creates an interesting contradiction. On one hand, the coalition has argued that there is much to commend the economic analysis of Corporations Law, hence its shift just after the last election to the Treasury portfolio. A necessary by-product of this paradigm suggests that the corporation has a duty to maximise profits for shareholders, possibly instigating some harsh economic objectives. On the other hand, the pursuit of any social objectives are severely undermined by the constraints of the purely profit maximising economic model. Achieving the correct balance between legal requirements and selfregulatory codes of conduct is an aspect which the government should be willing to address in the remuneration debate. There are numerous options available to this government to address the issue of executive remuneration, a by-product of which will be the promotion of the principles of corporate accountability and corporate responsibility. This is one of the great advantages of promoting full disclosure and assumes added weight, given that shareholders have the ability, under corporate governance theory, to remove directors with whom they are dissatisfied; that is, disclosure of remuneration allows shareholders to better assess the board's performance and remuneration policies and to carry out their role as corporate monitors. Another benefit of disclosure is that it is less interventionary than other methods designed to control the level of remuneration, such as encouraging judicial limits on remuneration or, as in the United States, placing an indirect cap of $1 million on non-performance based remuneration under the tax law. The options I have briefly outlined are open to the government. I urge them to address the remuneration issue as integral to any examination of corporate governance and any debate relating to amendments to the Corporations Law. If it is good enough to apply this question of social responsibility in the social welfare sector, it should also be applied in the business welfare sector when it comes to the Corporations Law and when it comes to the framing of reciprocal responsibilities in industry policy. If government is providing assistance, corporations throughout Australia have a social responsibility to make the best, socially responsible use of that assistance. We have seen too much in Australia of the excesses of companies that do not bear a proper weight of social responsibility. The Treasurer talks about those excesses as if they are a thing of the past. In fact, they are a thing of the present. When I talk to ordinary Australians in my electorate, as you would do in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, about the level of executive salaries, they sense the public immorality of the double standard: the wage restraint for the ordinary PA YE taxpayer and wage earner compared with some of the obscene levels of salary that are being paid at the top end of town. It is time for the government to not only apply social responsibilities to one part of the Australian community, but to do it across the board.",58
92,Mr RICHARD EVANS,CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT,"Doing business in Australia is toughtougher than anywhere else in the world. It is tougher than in America; it is tougher than in Asia; it is tougher than in Europe. It is tough because not only do you have to contend with the ups and downs of the market and the many vagaries of the domestic consumption, but businesses have to deal with bankers, creditors, debtors, suppliers and all sorts of government departments for every operation of the business. They have to contend with accountants, advisers, insurance agents, credit agents and, of course, unions-those marvellous organisations who remain in the jurassic era of industrial relations. Doing business in Australia is quite tough. When everyone and everything seems to be against you and a little bit of sunshine appears on the profit horizon, another whack seems to come your way. Some say Australia is the toughest market in the world in which to do business. Some say that if you are successful in business in Australia, then you would be successful anywhere else in the world. I would agree with that notion. Australian business operators are the most resourceful in the world, and given the chance we are better than any international competitor. Business is tough in Australia. One of the reasons it can be tough is because many of the business men and women who determine business principle and policy are those that do not risk their own funds. Risking your money, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the ultimate leading edge feeling. The ultimate buzz in anything is risking your own money: putting it all on the line, risking the house, risking the family, risking security, having the will to go through start up, the to risk it all. Someone once said that nothing can withstand the will that stakes its very existence its achievement. In other words, 'I'll do it or I'll die. I'll climb that mountain or I'm not coming back.' Strange things seem to happen to people who risk their existence on their activities, and things do in fact happen. In Australia many small businesses are in fact facing their mountains at the moment. They need a hand, and this bill goes a small way in providing that support. I do not begrudge those policy makers who sit in their high-back chairs gambling with other people's money. But that is a bit easy. Gambling with other people's money is really the ultimate pure power, but there is nothing more powerful than gambling with other people's money, other people's investment, other people's future and other people's lives. Gambling in business is part of business, and that is why it is so tough. But the risk and the pure passion in business comes when it is your own money. That is why we need this legislation. We need any legislation that protects investment. Be it a creditor investment or a plain operational investment, this type of protection is in fact good. It is good for those involved, good for healthy business practice and good for business investment. In June 1995, Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in the Crawford House Press case that, where persons are dealing with a company under a deed of company arrangement, as opposed to dealing with the deed administrator, and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. This is totally unacceptable. In other words, if you are dealing with a company under a deed and you are supplying a service, some money, a product, or whatever it might be, you would lose it. You would not have any claim to that if that company was wound up. That is totally unacceptable, and that is what this bill is all about. This is a view no doubt agreed to by many will members of this particular House and others within the professions dealing with these types of issues. In fact, Justice Cohen stated that the result of the case was not the intenon tion of the legislation and called for urgent legislative amendments to the act. Industry bodies, the legal and insolvency profession and informed commentators have supported the call for amendments. In October 1995, the previous government, under the stewardship of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the former minister, brought to the Hou-e amendments designed to overcome problems associated with the act uncovered by the Crawford case. However, the bill failed to pass through the House prior to the 1996 election and accordingly lapsed. Part 5.3A of the previous Corporations Law, which commenced in June 1993, providdealt ed for companies to enter into a scheme known as voluntary administration. This scheme allows a company in financial diffition culty to enter into what is called a deed company arrangement with its creditors. is seen as a more flexible form of administrawill tion as opposed to other forms of external administration. This enables continue trading for a period with a view to producing a better return for creditors would be available if the company was wound up lmmedi.ately. Using this method can i-l"".fCsult in saving the business of the - y "",itb its creditors. ;'Ii""is very easy for a business to get into ttou- ana this costs the economy through the crumbling of the small business sector, ultimately impacting upon employment and other social issues of the community. mentioned in the second reading speech, bill seeks to effect two substantive changes the Corporations Act 1989. The first amendspouses, ment proposed by the Corporations Law a Amendment Bill 1996 is designed to ensure to that debts incurred by the company while worth of debt. under a deed of company arrangement are admissible to proof against the company in a subsequent liquidation of the company. The second amendment will validate acts done by liquidators prior to the commencehave ment of these amendments; in there is a retrospective approach to it. On that basis, debts incurred by a company while under a deed of company arrangement were admissible to proof. The liquidators may have done such acts in ignorance of the irregularity in the Corporations Law which the bill designed to correct or in anticipation of passage of the bill. This legislation recognises the other side the business coin, and that is the creditors; those businesses which may invest time, product or finance in good faith to a strugthat gling business yet have no security of their investment. The bill will financially benefit the creditors, including government creditors, of companies which are liquidated immediately following a period under a deed of company arrangement. In particular, the amendments will ensure that creditors who have with a company under a deed of company arrangement will be able to prove, in a liquidation of the company following terminaof the deed, for outstanding debts and of claims arising while the company was under This deed. We need these amendments because it help business. Government understands the needs of business and wishes to respond the company to to these needs. After the high-rolling 1980s we are all only than too aware of the dangers associated with businesses and corporations that allow their debts to get so far out of control. The whole economy suffers as a result. In my own home state of Western Australia, a previous Labor government continued to bailout big businesses to such an extent that the ones that had to do the bailing out in the end were the taxpayers. We have already seen the damage done As when wily failed businessmen appear to this miraculously have their assets suddenly to appear under the names of their trusts, children or in fact relatives leaving substantial amount of assets that are unable be dissolved to pay their millions of dollars",62

94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On 27 February 1997, the is honourable member for Canberra asked a the question without notice as to whether the cleaning contractor for Parliament House, of Limro Cleaning Services, has implemented a blanket policy not to authorise any leave without pay for any employee. I am advised Limro Cleaning Services did issue a notice to their staff in January 1997 concerning leave without pay policy but that the notice did not accurately reflect all of the elements of the company's policy. The company has now clarified its policy in th:'tt regard. I am advised that Limro's policy has clarified that applications for leave without pay on compassionate grounds when all other leave has been taken will be considered subject to occupational requirements. Limro' s contract requires its adherence to awards and formal industrial arrangements and I am advised that the company was not and is not in breach of the award. NA",63
95,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) will be absent from question time today. She is attending the National Family Day Care Council conference in Adelaide. In her absence, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will answer questions normally directed to her. As advised yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) is overseas on government business and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will answer questions in his place. NA Sugar Tariffs",64
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. On Tuesday, you announced your government's zero tariff for the sugar industry and said that that decision and attitude have been endorsed very strongly by the Queensland government. I ask the Prime Minister: have you seen the comments by the Premier of Queensland urging the government to rethink its plans? He said: We need to be very careful in withdrawing support structures from Australian industries ahead of major trading partners doing the same thing. Prime Minister, as Australia is already comfortably below its Uruguay Round obligation on the sugar tariff, with the next WTO agricultural round commencing in 1999 and with many of our export destinations with sugar tariffs at 100 per cent or higher, why are we going it alone on the sugar tariff? Why cannot the industry have the single desk selling arrangements for the tariff after 1 July?",64
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question, and I note again that he has decided to go down this very opportunistic course on tariffs just as he has decided to go down an opportunistic stalk on motor cars. By the time the Leader of the Opposition has held that position for a couple of years, there will be an encyclopaedia of contradicting statements. In the statements he made there is no credibility-opportunism is the name of the game-no consistency and no capacity to formulate policy, just racing after every little apparently populist twist. More specifically on the issue of sugar, could I first of all make the observation that, as I understand it, for the last two years the domestic price of sugar has been below world parity pricing. If that is in fact the case, I fail to see the relevance of a passionate argument based on the removal of a tariff. Do you not understand that if the domestic price is below world parity the tariff is a bit irrelevant? It has been below the world parity price for the past two years. So far as Mr Borbidge is concerned, the advice that I have, and the advice I had at the time that I made the statement-and it remains my understanding-was that the position of the Queensland government was one of strong support for the Vaughan committee. I have in fact been advised by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who made inquiries of Mr Borbidge's office this morning, that that quote in the newspaper was not in relation to sugar but was a generic quote about protection.",64
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. While we are on the subject of opportunism, Prime Minister, do you not in fact recollect yourself saying last our year that, as far as tariffs were concerned, from this point on it is nothing for nothing?",64
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Drder! The supplementary question, if it was one, is not in order. Public Service Reform",64
100,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service. Can the minister inform the House of the rationale for the reforms to the Public Service announced yesterday and whether the sorts of arrangements that the government is now proposing have been canvassed in the past? Is it proper for governments to make changes to the Public Service?,64
101,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest in the topic. In fact, I am going to the electorate of Makin tomorrow, and I look forward to a good day in the member's electorate and seeing for myself the good work that she does as the member for Makin. She is one of a large number of quality members on this side of the parliament. I particularly appreciate the question because it is timely. I met last night with the public sector unions and had a general discussion with them about the processes which the government proposes to discuss further, both the reform of the Public Service Act-in fact, its complete rewriteand the processes for industrial arrangements generally in the APS in the period ahead. We had a pretty long meeting-a couple of hours or thereabouts. Obviously there are a lot of points which will need further amplification and clarification. I was also pleased to see in the Canberra Times this morning a statement referring to Doug Lilley of the CPSU-Wendy is in Geneva, apparently. He is said to have said: The position had been imposed on the unions as a fait accompli outside of the negotiations surrounding changes to the Public Service Act and on that basis the unions would probably have to live with the government's decision. Generally speaking, the tone of the meeting was good and I look forward to further discussions. It is certainly appropriate for the government to be making these changes and proposing them because the fact is that we could do a lot better in human resource management in the APS. The rationale for the government's proposed reforms to the public service is very simple. Although the public sector is obviously different from the private sector, the fact is that they both live in the same world and they both operate within the confines of the Workplace Relations Act, which was passed last year through this parliament. Our objective and our desire is to allow the APS to have flexibility within its management systems so as to take up the opportunities which greater flexibility and management of human resources will provide. Ultimately, that is very good for people who work within the APS. It is certainly appropriate from the taxpayers' point of view to ensure that we deliver services efficiently, and it is good, ultimately, for consumers that we are able to do a better job. The key to the new system is the simple proposition that, above a safety net, individual organisations are best suited to determine their own arrangements for pay and conditions. The question also asks: is this is a new concept? The truth of the matter is that it is not. If members go back to 1993 and 1994, I think they will remember that Paul Keating gave a very interesting speech to company directors in Melbourne when he set out his vision for a new industrial relations system.",65
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The undelivered vision.,65
103,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The undelivered vision. The reality is that, once he made that statement, Bill Kelty was on the phone and we ended up with one of the greatest paybacks to the trade union movement we have ever seen and we got Laurie Brereton and his infamous unfair dismissal laws to boot. I have been doing my reading of that time and I want to compliment the former Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Gary Johns, for some of the speeches that he gave on behalf of the front-bench of the now opposition. It is very interesting. One of the things he said was: It is essential that managers in the APS grasp the opportunities available to them under the APS agreement through the agency bargaining mechanism. In other words, if you go back and do your reading, you will see there is a parallel between Labor's industrial relations policy and its ultimate capitulation to the trade union movement and the parallel policy it publicly espoused in respect of better management in the APS and the ultimate capitulation to the unions on the APS service wide agreement. We will, of course, abandon the service wide approach as a matter of general principle as we evolve the system to more direct arrangements at the agency bargaining level. We do so, as I say, to improve the circumstances and opportunities for all associated with the APS and particularly, ultimately, for consumers and the taxpayer in the efficient delivery of those services. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme",65
104,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the minister recall slashing $500 million from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme last year? Is the minister aware of the hardship caused to ordinary Australian families by the decision to force people to pay up to $3 a script more for their essential medicine? Does the minister also agree that increased charges for pensioners were a massive breach of the Prime Minister's promise to 'maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits'? If the minister understands these things, how can he explain his secret plan, outlined in this outrageous document, to cut a furtherMr Costello-Ha, ha!",66
105,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are laughing, are you, Treasurer? How can he explain his secret plan, outlined in this outrageous document, to cut a further $800 million from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, forcing families to pay up to an extra $5 a script for their essenthat tial drugs? How do you explain that, Minister?",66
106,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With respect to the non-concessional rate going up from $17 to $20, what we did was keep the safety net the same, at $600. So any family that is a high user of pharmacy will actually pay no more, quite contrary to the last budget of the Labor Party when you reduced the safety net from $400 to $600. So the simple fact is that any person with a chronic illness under your last budget was hit another $200 a year more. So do not give me the cant and hypocrisy as to what happens under the $3 extra a script. It will be paid by people who are infrequent users, and anyone who is a chronic or heavy user is protected. As to the document that you raise, I have not seen that document and I cannot comment on it.",66
107,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker! I have a supplementary question for the minister. I am intrigued that the minister does not know what this document is, but he can assure the House he has not seen it. Given that this is a note to the minister, can the minister also assure us that neither he nor any of his staff have seen the document?",66
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will allow the question and invite the minister to address the exact specifics.,66
109,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unless you have something that is signed off by me, of course I have not seen it. Women",66
110,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that Saturday is International Women's Day, could the Prime Minister outline the progress made by the government so far on the election commitment to provide greater opportunities and choice for Australian women? . Mr HOWARD-I thank the honourable member for Bowman for that question and, with International Women's Day in prospect for Saturday, it does give me an opportunity to remind the House of the achievements of this government in fulfilling the election commitments we made. In answering that question, rather than draw upon statements were made by the coalition in the lead-up to the election, let me for a moment draw upon a statement that was made by the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, the current member for Fremantle, when she addressed the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing on 6 September in 1995. It provides a very interesting benchmark against which we can judge the decisions that have been taken by the coalition government since it was elected. I know that the member for Prospect and many other members opposite are interested in these issues, and I will take a moment to run past the criteria laid down by the former Labor minister the achievements of the coalition government. The member for Fremantle said that from a dialogue with women's groups four priorities emerged. The first was the difficulty women faced balancing work and family responsibilities. Dr Lawrence interjecting",66
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't get too excited; there is quite a while to go. I am quoting you quite faithfully in doing this. The second of the four priorities which emerged was a fear of violence, the third was health and the fourth was the need for more women to enter public life and assume dec-sion making responsibility. Let me start With the last of them first. We have behind us the greatest ever representation in the House of Representatives of women, and it has taken the Liberal and National parties, without the ideologically pursued approach of a quota, to deliver it. You have seen the Labor Party look absolute hypocrites. They danced at the conference, they threw the streamers, they burst the balloons; but when it came to a safe seat there was not a woman in sight so far as the Australian Labor Party were concerned. They are hypocrites on the issue of female representation within their ranks. Applying the Carmen Lawrence test, on that fourth priority we have passed with flying colours. Let me go back to the priority of balanci!lg work and family responsibilities. In two major areas the coalition has more than implemented the commitments that were made at the time of the last election. We introduced the family taxation initiative, which has given to many women and men",67
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,67
113,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interested that those opposite sneer; the smarter ones amongst you do not sneer. You should have been present at a conversation I had with a leading trade unionist only a few weeks ago. When he was talking about the last election he said, 'I knew that when you crowd put forward that proposal about a family tax initiative an already difficult task was going to be made impossible. I only wish that Keating and Beazley had had the brains to introduce such a proposal.' Martin Ferguson is nodding over there. Martin knows that I am right. The family tax initiative gave enormous additional choice for men and womenwomen in particular-in relation to balancing their work and family responsibilities. Of course, we are particularly indebted also to my colleague the Minister for Ind-s-r-al Relations for the much greater flexlblhty under the Workplace Relations Act. One of the great aspirations of women in the Aus-r.alÂ­ Ian community is to have more opportumtIes for permanent part-time work so that they c.an effectively balance their work and famIly responsibilities. Who stood in the way of greater permanent part-time work? It was the trade union movement and the Labor Party. Who swept away the barriers to permanent part-time work? It was the Liberal Party and the Minister for Industrial Relations in the coalition government. So once again, we delivered on the commitment and met the benchmarks-not our benchmarks, but your benchmarks. The first priority of women, according to your consultations, was to have greater opportunities to balance work and family responsibilities. In those two key areas-taxation and workplace relations-the coalition has delivered in spades, and that is why our policies have such wide support. The second priority was a fear of violence. Everyone knows the contribution that - he national gun control laws have made-wIth, I acknowledge, the support of the Labor Party and the support of the states. Everyone in this House knows that some of the strongest supporters of uniform gun control le-i-lati-n were women, particularly women hvmg m rural and regional areas of Australia. All of us have experienced going into those areas and having women come up and say, 'I am so glad you had the courage to introduce those laws. They have changed the atmosphere of violence in the Australian community.' Mrs Crosio--Bipartisan!",67
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the member for Prospect does not like this. She - bsolut-ly hates this because she does not lIke being reminded 'of the way in which the coalition has performed in these ar-as. It i- not o-ly in relation to gun control. It IS also m relatIOn to other areas of crime and violence. We are spending $13 mi11i-n over thr-e years in relation to areas of cnme prevention. We also have a new approach in relation to media violence. We have put more resources into counselling in relation to domestic violence. We have put more resources into counselling in relation to marriage guidance and relationships. Much as the Labor Party does not like it, we have put more resources into these areas. We have given a higher priority to these areas. You talked about it. We have done it. You talked about it all the time, but we have actually done it. In the area of health, listed as the third of the former minister's priorities, from the middle of this year we will be putting up to $450 million into giving people-individuals, couples and families-greater incentives to take out private health insurance. There have also been initiatives in the area of superannuation. We have provided greater flexibility in the superannuation system. We have catered for women who are in the work force for a period of time, then go out of it and come back into it. We have recognised the intermittent character of the working lives and the working careers of Australian women. You never did that because the ACTU would not let you do it. The ACTU objected to the flexibility that we have brought in. Very proudly may I say to the member for Bowman that in the last 12 months we have kept faith with what we told the women of Australia. But there is more to be done; we do not take any smug or complacent attitude to what has been achieved over the last 12 months. The women of Australia can rest absolutely assured that we are not a government made up of rhetoric; not only are we a government made up of the greatest number of women that have ever represented one side of politics in the history of the Australian federation but also we are a group of people in a government that has delivered and is absolutely committed to the principle of equality of opportunity for men and women in the Australian community.

117,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, this week-end.",68
118,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This week-end contains International Women's Day. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we want to pursue policies which will allow genuine choice for women in the roles that they undertake in our society. We want to ensure that they get access to affordable, high quality child-care; that they get access to affordable, quality education and training; and, that they get equal remuneration for secure work of equal value",68
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is on indulgence. We are not going to debate the issue.,68
120,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not debating it. I am not going to attack the government for one minute. I am not going to abuse your indulgence for one second, Mr Speaker. We are committed to industrial relations provisions which allow the balancing of work and family responsibilities. We are committed to equal access to justice, security from violence, strong anti-discrimination legislation, and proactive policies which ensure women's equal participation as citizens. Those are the positions that we stand for. People can make their own judgments about the government's position.",68
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Do you have a question?,68
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and relates to these matters. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the decision of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, supported by two Commonwealth representatives, to cease legal aid funding for victims compensation cases on the following grounds: In view of the Commonwealth government's funding reductions, the only responsible course of action for the commission to take is to implement these expenditure reduction measures. The commisthey sion deeply regrets the impact these measures have on clients. Is the Prime Minister aware that as a direct result of that a 27-year-old blind woman, who alleges she was indecently assaulted by a staff member of the group home she lives in, has been denied legal aid to pursue a victims compensation claim? What action will the Prime Minister take to ensure that women who have been denied legal aid as a result of the budget cuts have their eligibility restored, or is 'for all of us' really just for all of us with a bit of money? . uM,.r HOWARD-That is not a bad performanÂ¢e from. a ""bloke who was a member of a govemiIlent that spawned the Bonds and the Skases of the 1980s.

125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Prospect.,69
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your father was right about the deterioration in the class values of the Australian Labor Party when he made that immortal comment, 'When I joined the Australian Labor Party it was composed of the cream of the working class, now it is run by the dregs of the middle class.' Let me return to the question of legal aid. Mr Beazley interjecting",69
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It took you a couple of minutes to get to your question, so I ought to take a couple of minutes to get to'my answer. Let me say in relation to legal aid that there is one very simple principle involved in legal aid and that is that we will pay for our responsibilities and we expect the states to pay for theirs. Instead of you directing that question to me, why do you not go and ask your Labor mates Jeff Shaw and Bob Carr why will not fund their responsibility under will the criminal law of the state of New South Wales. Lucas Heights",69
128,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed",69
129,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,69
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my left!,69
131,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She's radiating!,69
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks. I express a general warning to all in the chamber that I will not tolerate this increasing disorder. I call the honourable member for Hughes.,69
133,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Has the minister seen a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald referring to young families in my electorate of Hughes voicing concern at the prospect of a nuclear reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights? Would the minister advise the House and my constituents of steps the government is taking in relation to the spent fuel problem at Lucas Heights?,69
134,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. I am aware of the articles that appeared in today's Sydney Morning Herald. As I explained to the House yesterday, a reprocessing facility using Synroc technology is just one of the options the government is compelled to consider after 13 years of inaction by the Labor government. The fuel used by the ANSTO research reactor comes from the United Kingdom and the United States and under treaties with both countries we have the option of returning the waste fuel to them. Approximately 700 fuel rods are from the United States and 900 are from the United Kingdom. The options not only in regard to cost but also in regard to whether we have to take the waste back from the United Kingdom or the United States as immediate level waste once it has been reprocessed have to be very carefully considered. For instance, the 900 United Kingdom rods would come back to Australia as 250 cubic metres of concreted intermediate waste. If those rods were reprocessed using Synroc, the amount of waste would be but two cubic metres. That is one of the factors to be taken into account. For the information of the House, I should explain that, in basic terms, Synroc, as the name suggests, is a synthetic rock which encases radioactive materials just as rocks do in nature. It effectively traps and immobilises the waste. After a period of time the radioactive by-product gradually expires. At the same time, any processing involving Synroc would result in significantly lower amounts of radioactivity than procedures currently in use at ANSTO. It is irresponsible for the opposition, the Democrats and the green groups to be scaremongering on the issue. What these groups do is distort the facts and confuse the issues and it is no wonder that some people and some families in the electorate of Hughes are rightly concerned because of the information or misinformation directed at them by the opposition. What the Labor Party did by their inaction was make Lucas Heights a de facto storage site. Then there were the claims of the environmental groups which quite frankly do not make sense. They protest if we store spent fuel, they protest when we ship the spent fuel somewhere else for reprocessing and they protest at any suggestion we reprocess our own spent fuel. Do they also want us to stop carrying out the life saving operations for cancer, thyroid disease and other illnesses? The spent fuel at the centre of this whole issue is a necessary, unavoidable by-product of having effective medical treatments in Australia. During this year more than 260,000 Australians will have a nuclear medicine procedure. On average one in two Australians can now expect one in their lifetime. As a result of these procedures, some 35 spent fuel rods are generated by the Lucas Heights research reactor every year. The government knows the seriousness and sensitivities of this whole issue. It does not help the people of Hughes or the wider community for the issue to be clouded by misinformation and blatant political opportunism. Medicare Levy",69
135,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the health minister remember the coalition's pledge at the last election not to increase taxes? Will the minister now admit that the decision in last year's budget to force high income earners without private health insurance to pay a higher Medicare levy breaks this promise?,70
136,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Have you just got around to reading the last budget?,70
137,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just listen and you might learn something about what your ministers are up to. How does the minister explain this document, which confirms that he is secretly planning to reduce the income threshold at which the new Medicare levy will cut in and force middle income earners to also pay the new higher levy? Minister, isn't this just the next step towards your ultimate goal-the goal outlined in Fightback-at which families earning more than $50,000 will pay this extra Medicare levy? Finally, if you seriously claim you are not aware of this document and you are not aware of what you and your department are proposing to the ERC, how can you seriously claim to be a competent minister for health for this nation?",70
138,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My department works on a whole range of things all the time. Any department would be expected to do so. I think it is unreasonable to expect me to comment on a document that I am afraid I cannot recollect seeing. Small Business,70
139,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the implication of yesterday'S national accounts on small business in my electorate of Petrie? What are the prospects for growth and cash flow for hundreds of thousands of small businesses around Australia?,70
140,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and acknowledge her own interest and involvement in small business, coming from the family she does which has been in small business for so long. One of the proudest achievements of this government in its tax reform project since it was elected in March 1996 was to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That was a decision to make sure the government would not artificially inflate notional income and collect the tax when that income had not actually been received. That was introduced in relation to the current year of income at a cost of some $180 million. It was an element of fairness for small businesses, self-funded retirees and other people who pay provisional tax. The government did not change the formula to reduce the provisional uplift factor to six per cent just as a one-off. This government changed it forever. This government put into legislation a proposal that would prevent the continuation of unrealistic provisional uplift factors by putting a formula into the legislation wbichapplies to GDP growth in nominal terms over the course of a preceding year. With the results of the GDP for the December 1996 quarter, the application of the formula produces a provisional tax uplift factor for next year of 5.95 per cent, rounded again to six per cent. That will be the provisional tax uplift factor in relation to the next year of income. Harnessing the provisional tax uplift factor to the growth in nominal GDP is fair for taxpayers, but it was not always the case that it was done. Back in 1990-91 the then Labor government had a provisional tax uplift factor of 10 per cent in a year in which incomes subject to provisional tax fell by 4.1 per When incomes went backwards, the Australian Labor Party government assessed people on the basis of a 10 per cent rise. In 1991-92 the Australian Labor Party applied a 10 per cent provisional uplift factor when incomes fell by three per cent. In 199293 the Australian Labor Party applied a provisional tax uplift factor of eight per cent when incomes subject to provisional tax rose by one per cent. With figures like that, it is no wonder that small business is saying this is the first government that ever gave them justice in relation to provisional tax. This is the government that developed on it, and this is the government that has enshrined it in legislation for good. Nursing Home Care",70
141,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Last year the government's budget revealed that older Australians would be forced to sell their homes to get nursing home care. This year, according to this secret document, the government is planning to make another terrible attack on older Australians which would deny nursing home residents a tax break for incontinence aids-especially important for women-and other essential medical support. This document says that the government will take $157 million from nursing home residents. Prime Minister, why is this government so cruelly targeting older Australians?",71
142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know what document the shadow minister is referring to but, as she has asked me a question, let me take the opportunity to say a couple of things about the deliberate scare campaign she is waging to frighten the section of the population she is meant to represent. Let us understand what this shadow minister has been about. This shadow minister has been about scaring old people ever since she arrived here. She has not been about trying to promote decent policy. She has not been about trying to improve the lot of older people in the Australian community. She has been about trying to scare them. You know that. Her leader knows that. Everybody who sits on the cent. front bench knows that. She has probably been told by her leader to do that, just as he probably told Senator Ray to run a smear campaign in the Senate-a smear campaign that he, himself, does not have the courage to join. Let me return to the substance of the question, about some kind of attack on the policy announced in the last budget by my colleague in relation to residential aged care arrangements. Let me again remind the House and the Australian people that the model employed in that policy announcement was a Labor Party model. It was not a model that we invented out of thin air; it was a Labor Party model. It is a model that is designed to guarantee that we will be able to repair the deteriorating capital structure of nursing homes in this country. Anybody who understands anything about nursing homes in Australia will know that, unless you get more capital into them, the quality of care provided and the environment in which old people are looked after in those homes is going to deteriorate. When you have left us with a budget black hole of $10 billion, it is a bit hard to turn to the budget for supplementation. It is only natural and proper-subject to proper, fair, reasonable Labor-devised income tests and Labor-devised models-that we should seek to apply the same approach. You can conduct your scare campaigns as much as you like. Nothing can alter the fact that our approach in these area is fair and balanced. What is more, in relation to the nursing homes, it borrows the model you applied to hostels. Murray-Darling Basin",71
143,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is the government aware of the significance of the problems facing the Murray-Darling Basin, where my electorate is? Mr O'Keefe interjecting",72
144,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Basin's problems include degraded water quality, restricted water flows and uncoordinated environmental management. In contrast to the former government, does this government intend to take these problems seriously?",72
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted that at least one member of the Labor Party front bench is getting the message. As soon as the member for Murray got up, the member for Burke said, 'The world's greatest environmental package.' And you are right. I say to the member for Burke, 'You are right.' What is more, you and the Australian people will hear a lot more about this, because unlike the Australian Labor Party-you tried to stop itwe are actually interested in measures to regenerate the Murray-Darling Basin. I say to the honourable member for Murray, whose electorate I will be visiting next week-and I look forward to visiting that great regional area of Australia-that the Murray-Darling Basin does, as she and many other members know, contain some of the great river systems in Australia. It supports a population of two million people. It has one-quarter of Australia's cattle and half of Australia's sheep. Three-quarters of the irrigated land in Australia is embraced in the Murray-Darling Basin. It has, however, suffered badly through very poor management over many years. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, I am pleased to say, will provide $163 million to help revitalise this great river system of Australia-an amount of money that the Labor Party fought day and night, 24 hours a day, to stop being provided. The only way it could responsibly be provided was out of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. That project will improve water quality by reducing salt and nutrients, it will establish environmental flows capable of sustaining natural processes, it will develop integrated management strategies of river systems and it will encourage ecologically and economically sustainable land use. As I said, I will be visiting the honourable member's electorate next week and I will have great pleasure to open the Torrumbarry Weir, which is an important infrastructure project which will provide water for irrigation but also take account of environmental needs. I will also take the opportunity to announce a program to be delivered in conjunction with the local community to ensure better use of scarce water resources. That program will bring both economic and environmental benefits. I say again to all those members on this side of the House who want to do something to restore the great Murray-Darling Basin of Australia that the Liberal and National parties know the importance of this great system to Australia's economic, agricultural and environmental future. That is why it will have a call of $163 million out of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia-a trust the Labor Party was dedicated to stop and a trust which the Labor Party is no doubt dedicated to destroy. Immigration: Social Welfare Benefits",72
146,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, is it true that, despite the two-year waiting period, newly arrived migrants are stilled entitled to family payment of up to $124.90 per child per fortnight, up to $19.24 per fortnight family tax payment, the maternity allowance of $866.70 and, in certain cases, can still get the dole-equivalent special benefit?",73
147,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that the government, in furtherance of an election commitment, did significantly tighten the eligibility of newly arrived migrants. It did extend the waiting period to two years. It did so in the face of very strong criticism from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian D-mocratS:; Once again, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats thumbed their noses at the verdict of the Australian pe6pte, despite the fact that we went to Australian people and said, 'If you vote for us, we will do this.' What does the Australian Labor Party do? It criticises us. It is also true, as the member for Oxley says, that there are other entitlements that were not affected by the decisions taken by the government. I think we have the balance right. I think that, if people come into the Australian community, it is reasonable to say to them, 'You are not entitled to certain things until you have been here for a period of two years. But if you become part of the community and you begin to make a contribution and if you are in work you pay taxes, then you are entitled to them.' Obviously, if someone is working and is paying taxes, they entitled to participate in the family tax initiaask tive like any other person. I do not think that is unreasonable. In all of these things, it is a question of getting the balance right. Just as we get the balance right between the environment and the development of this country, we also get the balance right between making sure that new arrivals in Australia do not impose unreasonable burdens on people who have been here for longer periods of time. Equally, once a person has become part of the community, they should not be treated as a second-class citizen. They should be treated as a full and equal member of the Australian community, irrespective of where they came from. I think we have the balance right, I think the Labor Party got it hopelessly wrong, and I think the Australian people agree with the balance that we have struck. Uncooked Canadian Salmon",73
148,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Has the minister's attention been drawn to Canada's request for the establishment of a dispute settlement panel on Australia's decision not to allow imports of uncooked Canadian salmon? Has Australia's decision been based on a thorough risk assessment procedure using internationally agreed principles? What will the Australian government's response be to this request for a panel? Mr Crean interjecting,73
149,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really needed to stand by my oft repeated statements that I have great confidence in Australia's animal health status. I thought perhaps next time. I might make it on Australian salmon. I believe that all members of this House would acknowledge that this is a very serious matter indeed. We have a situation where our fellow Cairns traveller, Canada, is at serious disagreement with a decision that we have made. On 20 December last year, I announced that current restrictions on uncooked salmon imports would remain after thorough AQIS risk assessment. Canada announced last night our time that, in line with its international rights, it would the World Trade Organisation to convene a dispute settlement panel-new territory indeed for us. I have a copy of a release here which I am happy to table. Formally, that request will be considered on 20 March in Geneva. I want to say that, as the Deputy Prime Minister said last week, Australia will vigorously defend its position. AQIS has undertaken an exhaustive and complex risk assessment based on internationally accepted principles. It has used comprehensive scientific analysis, resulting in this exhaustive document which members might be interested in perusing at their leisure. AQIS decided that entry of uncooked salmon presented a degree of scientific complexity with attendant risks substantially greater than many other access requests. They found at least 20 diseases of concern, and they established the likelihood that some diseases would be present in imported product; that there were significant gaps in knowledge of diseases, including carrier status and infective doses; and that there were mUltiple pathways by which exotic agents could enter our waterways. Furthermore, AQIS established that if something did get here, eradication would be virtually impossible. It needs to be remembered that Canadian cooked salmon imports continue to be allowed and that they are currently running at some $25 million worth of imports per year. This has not created any quarantine problem, and there has been no change to those arrangements. Quarantine is a critically important matter for all Australians, as I am sure all members of this House will acknowledge. At the end of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the former government-with our support and that of farm organisationssigned onto an agreement which, for the first time, brought agricultural trade under international disciplines and began the process of winding back damaging production and export subsidies as well as beginning to open up previously closed markets. We also signed onto agreements relating to non-tariff barriers to trade, including quarantine measures. This again is important for Australia as a major net food exporter in stopping unfair trading practices. The stakes are actually very high. If countries are found to be imposing restrictions which are not scientifically and technically justified, then they would have to verse such measures or make other compensation. It is for that reason that Australia has undertaken such an exhaustive and comprehensive study on the salmon request. We have acted entirely properly in formulating this decision. Australia's action remains totally consistent with our trade rights and obligations. In fact, we are often criticised internationally for adopting too conservative an approach to quarantine policy. I want to make it quite plain that this government does not and will not apologise for such a stance. We will not place our own industries or environment at risk where scientific analysis warrants quarantine restrictions. Our quarantine service and assessment process is of world standing. We have no intention of placing our clean, safe reputation at risk. Child Care",73
150,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Last year the government cut $500 million from child care, costing Australian families around $20 per week extra in childcare fees. Minister, this document addressed to you, which I have in my hands today, reveals the government's secret plan to take a further $400 million from child care. Is it not a fact that this means that Australian families will have to pay another $20 a week for child care? Why is this government continuing to punish Australian families?",74
151,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point is that, as I have already stated, I do not know the document to which the shadow minister is referring. The second point is that it is utterly reasonable for any department to look at a whole range of options before a budget. It does not mean that I will agree with any of them; it does not mean that the ERC will agree with any of them; and it does not mean that they will end up in the budget. If you want to find out what is in the budget, wait until 13 May. Legal Aid",74
152,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question today is addressed to the Attorney-General. Attorney, is it a fact that state and territory legal aid commissions have funded a series of actions designed to defeat the right of the Commonwealth government to deny entry to illegal immigrants; is it an appropriate use of taxpayers' money for state and territory legal aid commissions to fund non-citizens and non-residents in their attempts to overturn the decisions of the Commonwealth government to deny them entry to Australia; and, given the limited amount of money available for legal aid, is such a use of taxpayers' money depriving Aussie battlers of legal aid funding that would otherwise be available for matters of Commonwealth responsibility such as family law?",74
153,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am advised that some actions taken in relation to immigration decisions have been funded by state and territory legal aid commissions. But the Commonwealth does not have precise figures on legal aid funding for immigration as legal aid commissions do not collect data according to citizenship, and not all of the data collected by the commissions is available to the Commonwealth. State and territory legal aid commissions are currently independent of the Commonwealth and are independent of the state and territory governments as well. They currently establish their own guidelines for funding of legal aid. Citizenship is not a criterion in legal aid commission guidelines for assessing eligibility for legal aid. However, the question from the honourable member for Fisher-and I know he has a particular interest in the subjecthighlights some matters of considerable concern to the government in ensuring that legal aid dollars are appropriately spent. I have spent some time talking about 70 per cent of referral funding that is allocated by legal aid commissions to 20 per cent of the cases. In one matter that has been drawn to my attention, a representative class action was brought by a group of boat arrivals. While they were in detention, there was an application to the Federal Court which was dismissed, an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court which was dismissed and an application for special leave to appear before the High Court which was dismissed. The Commonwealth incurred legal costs of over $350,000. In addition, there are legal aid costs on top of that. My colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs revealed last year that the Commonwealth incurred an estimated $2 million of the costs of the detention of the applicants pending the conclusion of the proceedings. All of those costs-legal aid costs, Commonwealth costs and detention costs-were ultimately borne by the Australian taxpayer. I am advised that this is just one of a number of cases where legally funded applications have been pursued unsuccessfully through every available channel. Such cases must be of as much concern to the Australian public as they are to the government. The government has announced that from 1 July 1997 Commonwealth funds for legal aid will be applied to matters arising under Commonwealth law which include immigration matters. The Commonwealth will clearly articulate its priorities for legal aid funding when the new legal aid arrangements are implemented. I can assure the honourable member for Fisher that in the setting of these priorities full account will be taken of the concerns he has expressed. In response to a number of questions that have been put to me in the course of what I have been saying, I would ask the members opposite who asked those questions to say what they think would be done by a person who did not qualify for legal aid. You should be applying the standard of an ordinarily prudent, self-funding litigant. Legal aid is not to run the whole gamut. Government Promises",75
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does he recall saying on Meet the Press last Sunday that he could not introduce a GST because he had looked the Australian people in the eye and promised not to? Does he recall his other promises to maintain pensioner entitlements, not to increase taxes, not to increase child-care charges and not to increase nursing home fees? Having broken each of these promises in his first budget, does he deny that the secret document confirms that he is now planning to break each one of them a second time? Has he forgotten that prior to the election he looked pensioners, middle-income families and nursing home residents in the eye and promised that he would protect all of them? Are promises to the sick and the aged less important?",75
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly recall that during the election campaign I looked the families of Australia in the eye and said, 'You'll have a family tax initiative worth $1 billion', and they got it. I looked the small business community in the eye and I said, 'You will have capital gains tax relief', and they will get it almost in double measure on 1 July. I looked the self-funded retirees of Australia in the eye and said, 'We will give you the same tax rebate as other people have got at the same age', and they got that. I looked the Australian public in the eye and said we were not going to touch the Medicare system, and we have not touched the Medicare system. We looked a lot of groups in the community in the eye and we have delivered on those commitments. I know that it galls the Leader of the Opposition and I know that it galIs all of those people who sit on the front bench, but the fact is that the judgment of the Australian people after 12 months of this government is that we have stayed true and kept faith with the commitments that we made to the Australian people. I am very proud when I go round this country, when I talk to the families of Australia, when I talk to the small business men and women of this country, when I talk to self-funded retirees and to many other sections of the Australian community, and they believe that they have a government whose word can be trusted, unlike the government they so unceremoniously threw out. When it comes to the credibility of the two sides of politics in Australia, nothing can compare with that chilling judgment of Gary Gray when he was talking about preparation for the last election campaign. He said, 'When the public thought that we stank-which we did-when they didn't believe us any more, when we couldn't make any credible commitments any more, the only thing we realIy had to run on was Paul's leadership.' That was admission of an honest man, but it was also a counsel of political despair. It was the admission of an honest man, of Gary Gray, saying that the Australian public did not believe the Keating government. Of course they did not believe the Keating government; they believed us. That is why they put us back and that is why they continue to support the policies and the program of the coalition government. Women in Sport Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Is the minister aware that this Saturday is-contrary to the belief of the Leader of the Opposition-International Women's Day? Is the minister also aware that the 2000 Olympics mark the centennial of the participation of women in the Olympic Games? Can the minister advise the House of sporting programs that are of direct benefit to women, and can he also advise whether these Australian programs are cost-effective?",76
156,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I am aware of the fact that Saturday is International Women's Day. Indeed, the Prime Minister elaborated on it extensively earlier in question time. It is also important to note that the 2000 Olympic Games will be the centennial of the involvement of women in the Olympics. Despite there being far fewer numbers at Olympic Games, including Atlanta, female athletes have won a disproportionately high number of all medals won by Australians at the Olympics. In certain Olympic sports, particularly swimming and track and field, Australian women have been outstanding. For example, since 1948 and including Atlanta, Australian women have constituted just over 30 per cent of the track and field team but have won 75 per cent of alI the medals and 11 out of the 14 gold medals-which is a pretty good record. In swimming, women have won 15 of the 25 gold medals won by Australians since 1912. I am advised that the 2000 Olympics in Sydney wilI mark the centennial involvement the of women in the games. The federal government has entered already into a joint arrangement with the New South Wales government to support a program to celebrate this centenary. The program will include training seminars, the production of resource material aimed at schools focusing on girls and physical activity, and the recognition of the achievements of Australian sportswomen between the years 1900 and 2000. Liaison with SOCOG, the Sydney organising committee, and the International Olympic Committee to conduct a gala function during the 2000 games honouring past Olympic medal-winning females will be conducted. Working with local government, another area of my portfolio, will also be a priority as we develop policies to assist and promote the involvement of women in local sport programs. The implementation of this program will, I trust, represent a suitable acknowledgment of the tremendous contribution female athletes, and particularly Australian women, have made during the last century to the Olympic Games in sport. I think it is probably worth mentioning to the House some of the outstanding achievements that have just taken place by sportswomen from Australia. Only a couple of months ago, Kirsty Marshall was the first Australian to ever win an aerial freestyle skiing world championship. Emma George, who would be well-known to many of you, has bettered the women's pole vaulting record by some 30 centimetres-an outstanding achievement. Cara Honeychurch is now the tenpin bowling champion of the world. Karrie Webb, as we know, has elevated women's involvement in world golf to new heights. The Olympic Games saw Cathy Freeman, Susie ONEILL, Samantha Riley, Melinda Gainsford, Megan Still in rowing, and many others do a wonderful job. Softball came third. Mr O'Keefe-What about the hockey team?",76
157,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are too many to mention. They have done a fantastic job and I know that the member for Lindsay, a first-class rower in her own right, is also keenly supporting the development of women in sport. She, like others, will be interested to know that the Women in Sport unit at the Australian Institute of Sport is collaborating with the Office of Status of Women to further the opportunities from government, in partnership I might say with the states and local government, to make sure there are continuing opportunities so we can produce more stars to be in Olympic Games and also local competitions. Unemployment",77
158,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer the minister to a secret performance report on your department's job programs which highlights, one, in January 1997 performance for only one of the nine key job targets matched the department's performance in January 1996; two, subsidised job placements have fallen well below government targets; three, the number of placements in January was half that in October; four, youth unemployment placements have fallen well below your government's targets; five, long-term unemployment targets are in significant decline",77

177,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. Read the Hansard. Veteran Community,79
178,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,PAIRS,"ANNE KELLY-My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to the government's health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas launched last October. What benefits has the policy delivered to the veteran community, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans and, most particularly, Australian South Sea Islanders?",79
179,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Dawson for her question. She has a very strong and keen interest in not only the people of rural and regional Australia but also our veteran community. She mentioned the South Sea Islanders. I know she has one of the largest-if not the largest-number of South Sea Islanders in the electorate of Dawson. In acknowledgment of the fact that 30 per cent of our veteran community live outside metropolitan Australia, last October the government introduced its rural and remote health policy for the veteran community. The problem is that it was 13 years too late. They had 13 years to deliver to the veteran community but they did not do anything or acknowledge the fact that they even existed out in regional and rural Australia. I would like to highlight a couple of tives and bring to the notice of the House how those trials and how those initiatives are impacting on our veteran community. The rural medication trial, for instance, targeted veterans who had particularly high incidence and usage of medications. At least 97 per cent of those veterans trialled in that process had some problem with their medication. We were able to fix some of those problems. For instance, one veteran who was taking up to 15 medications is now down to five medications. That has meant, and is related to, a much better health outcome for that veteran community. We now have established a link with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of this country, which is able to put in place annual health care programs for our veterans who live in rural and remote Australia. I want to touch on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The member for Leichhardt has a particular interest in the welfare of Torres Strait Islanders. He is the first federal member to establish an office on Thursday Island because of his particular interest in Thursday Island and the Torres Strait Islanders. Since he has been there, and following my visit there, we have been able to initiate through the Queensland health department permanent podiatry clinics for those entitled veterans in the Torres Strait islands. Given that there is a very high incidence of diabetes in Torres Strait Islanders, this service will be particularly beneficial for those who live on those Torres Strait islands. The veteran community of this nation gave unselfishly to this nation. Their service is our heritage. We should never forget that. We have not forgotten those who live outside metropolitan Australia.",79
180,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Double Orphan Pension",79
181,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yesterday the honourable member for Moore asked me a question on the double orphan pension. I said I would refer the matters to the Minister for Social initiaSecurity. In this matter the answer the minister has provided is: yes, the current rate is $37.50 for a double orphan pension and it is judged to be adequate. It is intended to address any additional financial strain of caring for an orphan child. The needs of different groups are also addressed through the existing system of family assistance aside from the double orphan pension. The vast majority of persons receiving double orphan pensions also receive family payment, which aims to provide help with ongoing costs of raising children. Pensioners with dependent children receive family payment at the maximum rate, which is $124.90 a fortnight for each child aged 13 to 15 years and $96 a fortnight for each child under 13 years. Other supplements and assistance are available according to carers' circumstances, such as the guardian allowance for sole parents. The government is also providing additional assistance to families through the family tax initiative. Some state and territory governments also provide supplementary financial assistance for carers of orphans. If you want to get further information about the family tax initiative, it can be obtained from 'You and your family'. It demonstrates there the additional benefits are quite substantial, around $7.70 a fortnight for a single child and $19.20 for a family who are eligible for parts A and B, which I suspect in most cases they will be. NA Plagiarism",79
182,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Last year the member for Werriwa raised with you the issue of whether or not it is a breach of standing orders to plagiarise material and present it to the House as one's own. In reply you criticised the practice and commented on the possible need for additional standing orders and some difficulties associated with it. I ask you to consider the matter again in light of the substantial unattributed and thinly disguised borrowings from a published article appearing in People and place Vol 4 No 3 commencing at page 37 and entitled 'Medical manpower: the continuing crisis' written by Dr Bob Birrell in a speech delivered by the member for Bradfield on 4 November last year. Given the previous matter, which resulted in the member for Cowan apologising to the parliament for his unattributed use of writings, will you come back to the House with your recommendation as to how this latest matter could more properly be dealt with? Could you also advise members whether the recently introduced moral rights legislation, which I understand in some circumstances requires attribution of the source of copyright works, has any implications for the conduct of members in the House? I seek leave to table to a copy of the article and the speech with side notes to indicate where the borrowings have occurred. Leave granted.",80

Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: arising out of that-and I seek your guidance on this-the member for Leichhardt gave a personal explanation claiming he had been misrepresented, but in fact it was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that misrepresented the circumstances in that last question and his response, and I believe he should take the opportunity, similarly, to apologise to the House.",80

201,Mr MCLACHLAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Honourable members will recall the sadness and dismay which the nation heard the news of the I accident at the high range training area near Townsville shortly after dusk on 12 June The accident occurred during an exercise to practise the recovery .of Australian citizens held hostage by armed terrorists. Six Black Hawk helicopters and 24 aircrew from the 5th Aviation Regiment and 43 soldiers of the Special Air Service were a live-fire airmobile assault on a simulated terrorist position. As the formation reached the target zone, two helicopters The lead helicopter crashed to the ground upside down and was consumed by The second helicopter entered a flat spin before crash landing in an upright position. It too was destroyed by fire. Eighteen Australian the servicemen perished and a further 12 were of 1996injured-some critically. Equipment worth $37 million was destroyed. There were heroic acts in the face of this terrible accident. The reaction at the crash scene was cool headed, courageous and swift. the confusion of the collision and the crash and the danger of flames and exploding ammunition, those at the scene acted quickly and decisively to evacuate the injured. I am advised that the Army will be proposing a number of awards to recognise brave and conspicuous service in the immediate aftermath of the accident. The professional response of local ADF units, the Queensland Emergency Service, the Queensland Police and the staff at Townsville General Hospital undoubtedly saved further lives. The Department of Defence acted swiftly to ensure that the injured survivors and the families of those who lost their lives were paid such compensation and provided with as much ancillary support as existing legislation allowed. This was done as quickly as was possible. I know from letters which have been sent to me that the sensitive assistance of family support bodies and the overwhelming support of the Australian community were of great comfort to the families of the victims, to their comrades and to those close to them. This was the largest peacetime disaster to strike our armed forces since the Voyager collision of 1964. Nevertheless, the training activities which so unfortunately culminated in this accident are essential to our national security. This is particularly true with just three years remaining before the Sydney Olympic Games. Training for counter-terrorism operations is inherently dangerous. It takes our forces to the cutting edge of capability. It demands degrees of speed, stealth, precision, accuracy and lethality beyond those required of any other element of the Army. But such training also demands a careful balance between safety and realism. This can only be achieved through meticulous military preparation and planning and the execution of a staged progression of training which reflects the difficulty and danger of the task to be achieved. This need to balance safety and realism is at the heart of the report which I will table today. Following the accident the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General John Sanderson, appointed a military board of inquiry. The board was required to establish the primary and contributory causes of the accident and to make recommendations to prevent another tragedy. While it was also to make recommendations in relation to possible disciplinary action, board was not constituted as a court and had no powers or authority to make findings in relation to offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act. With the exception of matters concerning national security, the inquiry was open to the public. The survivors and the next of kin and families of those who lost their lives were provided Commonwealth funding to attend the hearings and received legal representation as required. The board of inquiry was extensive and thorough. It conducted hearings in Perth, Townsville and Sydney over a period of three months. It took evidence from 144 witnesses, accepted 215 written exhibits and considered numerous instructions, correspondence and statements. The board's report, which was submitted to the Chief of Army on 20 December last year, reflects this thoroughness. It comprises more than 7,000 pages in 17 volumes. Since submission to the Chief of Army, the board's finding and recommendations have been studied in detail by technical and legal experts within the Army and the Department of Defence. These experts have confirmed the adequacy of the board's report and advised on corrective action to minimise the probability of further accidents. These recommendations form the basis of the Chief of Army's report which was submitted to .me last week. In his report, General Sanderson addresses the findings of the board of inquiry, the advice of the panel of experts and, most importantly, the steps to be taken to reduce the risk of further accidents. The board found that the immediate cause of the accident was that the lead helicopter, Black 1, turned right and converged on an adjacent helicopter, Black 2. As a result, Black 1 struck Black 2 with multiple rotor blade strikes, causing both aircraft to crash and be destroyed by fire. But, as is almost always the case with accidents of this nature, the events immediately preceding the accident do not stand in isolation. The board found that, while there was no single reason for the tragedy, there was a chain of events that successively and the cumulatively led to a situation where the accident became what the board describes as the inevitable outcome. During the early stages of the board's proceedings, there was a good deal of speculation about the causes of the crash. At that time and until today, the government took the position that it would not comment on matters before the board. The findings of the board clearly dismiss some of the more widely speculated causes. It found: There were no mechanical defects in the Black Hawk helicopters involved. In fact, the aircraft's design unquestionably prevented a greater death toll. The accident was not caused by unserviceable night vision goggles . . NQ . - I\otswere fired in or at any aircraft whi-b;Were causal to the accident, nor was -;--#--{ - r;:anceexplosion prior to the The board identified 16 directly causative and 1!. furt:h- 26 - ntributing factors. It found a ft--gebetweeh these factors, although it did not place"" it separate weighting on each of them. The board found a number of long-term systemic factors which contributed to the accident. Among them: The Black Hawk aircraft had a high rate of un serviceability in the two years leading up to the accident. High pilot separation rates over a similar period had further eroded the bank of experience and skill at the 5th Aviation Regiment. These factors clearly affected the experience levels among Black Hawk crews and prevented them from gaining sufficient flying experience for special counter-terrorism operations. More immediate factors arose from the planning, preparation, rehearsal and conduct of the exercise. Among these: The planning for the air mission on the night of the accident was found by the board to be inadequate. There was inadequate information about the objective. There was a failure on the part of aircrew adequately to resolve conflicting understanding of the location of specific targets. The conduct of the night mission differed from that of the day mission and there was no rehearsal of those changes. The flight lead in Black 1 lacked experience in leading special recovery missions. On their own, none of these factors directly caused the accident. But the board found that as a train of events they, in addition to other causes, cumulatively contributed to a situation where the accident became inevitable. The function of the board was not merely to determine the cause of the crash but also to identify areas for remedial action to reduce the risk of further accidents. This aspect is of the very greatest importance. The board made 79 recommendations, many of which require the Australian Defence Force to implement and adhere to best practice procedures. These recommendations will help ensure a safer environment and assist in preventing a recurrence of the circumstances which led to this accident. At the time of the accident, I made clear our determination that all possible measures were to be taken to ameliorate risk without compromising capability. Accordingly, the Chief of Army has developed a plan to implement the board's recommendations. The plan addresses systemic and equipment issues and proposes measures to improve command, control and exercise planning as well as changes to training. To stem separation rates, the Army is reviewing the employment and conditions of service of its aircrew. Measures so far taken include the introduction of a pilot retention bonus, increasing return of service obligations and increasing the numbers of trainee army pilots. In addition, the Army is ensuring that qualified flying instructors can be better employed in operational units by contracting out some of the less demanding pilot instruction. Action has been taken to place all counterterrorism and special recovery elements within the same command structure, with all outcomes now being the responsibility of the Land Commander. The Army is reviewing the training requirements for counter-terrorism and special recovery operations. This will establish a training sequence to overcome the erosion of combined skills which had previously occurred between biennial special recovery exercises. New directives will be issued to ensure that the command and control, planning, intelligence gathering, orders and briefings, conduct of missions and training requirements which were recommended by the board are specified for future special forces operations. The acquisition of proximity warning devices, improved night vision goggles and redesigned fast roping and rappelling devices is being evaluated. Crash data recorders will be fitted to all Army aircraft as a matter of priority and to Black Hawk helicopters as a matter of urgency. I have directed the Chief of Army, as the responsible commander, to provide me with monthly reports on the progress of the implementation plan and on the status and safety of counter-terrorism training. In addition, I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, to establish an overarching Defence Force Flying Safety Authority, under the Chief of Air Force. This authority will be responsible for the supervision of all flying safety issues for the Defence Force, regardless of the service operating individual types of aircraft. I tum now to the issue of whether disciplinary action is to be taken against any individual. In accordance with its terms of reference, the board recommended that disciplinary action be considered against five members in relation to negligence, deficiencies in the exercise of command and errors of judgment. The Chief of Army has considered these recommendations and has taken advice from the Army's legal branch. As a result of advice to him, the Chief of Army has referred the board's report and the legal advice to the Land Commander Australia, whom he has appointed as a convening authority, to consider whether or not to prefer charges under the Defence Force Discipline Act against three persons. In addition, the Chief of Army has decided to take administrative action against two other personnel. Until the matters of military discipline are properly determined by the convening authority, it would be quite inappropriate to disclose the names or appointments of any persons facing administrative action or referred to the convening authority, or to disclose details of offences which might be pursued against individuals. For this reason, some of the findings and recommendations which could lead to possible disciplinary action have been expunged from the report, which I will table today. It is the responsibility of the convening authority to decide whether military charges are to be laid. I expect the Chief of Army to announce the decision of the convening authority within a month. I can inform the House, however, that, as a result of requests for advice by the department, separate advice has been received from the Queensland and Commonwealth Directors of Public Prosecutions that, based on the board's report, no criminal charges would arise from the accident. For some time, the government has been considering the issue of the adequacy of the compensation and rehabilitation benefits available to members of the ADF. Military service is distinctly different from civilian employment. It often involves considerably more dangerous activities which may result in severe injury or death. It, therefore, warrants distinct rehabilitation and compensation arrangements. The need for a review of military compensation was brought into sharper focus by the Black Hawk accident. In particular, it has become quite clear that parts of the existing peacetime compensation and rehabilitation scheme for ADF personnel are inappropriate. Consequently, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) ordered a review of existing rehabilitation and compensation arrangements for military personnel. The review was to investigate compensation arrangements for military personnel including the adequacy of the lump sum payments, ancillary benefits and supporting services for dependants of deceased personnel. It was to also examine the different entitlements that accrue to members of the ADF for death or severe injury suffered during peacetime service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act or the military compensation scheme as well as the administrative arrangements involved when members are covered by both schemes. This review is to report to Mrs Bishop very shortly and will be subject to consideration by cabinet. Nothing we can do will fully compensate for the loss of those 18 Australian servicemen. All of us have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, but I hope that some consolation can be found in the knowledge that those who perished did so in the service of their country. The Australian Defence Force has set in train sound, logical and decisive steps to el1sor.e, that. counter-terrorism and special 'r#o'yeti.aperations can be conducted for the '-bOO ofall'Australians. The training and Pl,'ep--tiOJl. of our, counter-terrorism forces willrContiniieto;be as demanding and realistic as,js,'safeiy possible. We must maintain our cuttingl edge capability'in ' counter-terrorism operations; Those lost in this terrible accident would have expected nothing less of us. I present the following papers: Outcome of the Board of Inquiry into the Black Hawk Training Accident-Ministerial Statement, 6 March 1997 and the Black Hawk Board of Inquiry: Documents for Public Release Motion (by Mr MCGauran) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",81
202,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I note the presence in the gallery this afternoon of General Baker and General Sanderson.,85
203,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The 12th of June 1996 was a day of tragedy and grief for many. It was certainly a day of tragedy and grief for the Army, for the 5th Aviation Regiment, for the SAS, fo;"" the country, who properly recognised in mourning the events of that day, but most particularly for the family and the comrades of the 18 who died and those who survived. It was a very difficult circumstance for all involved and, I must say, having been in Townsville the day prior to the accident visiting the Army base in Townsville and then remaining for the subsequent services, it was a traumatic experience for all involved. I again take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) and those in the Army who extended to me their courtesies on that occasion. It is properly a matter that is presented to the parliament for us to consider. It is, as the minister said, the most tragic circumstance in peacetime since the Melbourne and Voyager tragedy, and I am pleased that the Chief of Army and other senior officers are able to be here for this occasion. The report identifies what I think many of us suspected: there was no one incident that would have produced such a terrible tragedy. The report has been conducted in an open way, and I commend Army for the way in which they have addressed what has been a traumatic experience for them and those involved. The inquiry has been conducted largely in public view and it is appropriate that a report of this type be made available to the public. It identifies some 16 causal factors that directly impacted on the accident and another 26 factors that contributed to it. There is quite an extensive list of other failings that it identified but which it considered played no role in this particular incident, although I would hope and assume that those errors, having been identified, will be pursued with the same vigour as those other failings which, on this occasion, did contribute to the tragedy. The minister has mentioned that, quite properly, a number of recommendations have been implemented or set in train during the inquiry and prior to this time and that there is a time line for the implementation of all recommendations. I would seek from the minister at the earliest opportunity, at an appropriate time, the details of those recommendations which have already been implemented and the details of the time frame for the implementation of all recommendations. In the circumstances I do believe it is appropriate that the monthly report that the minister indicated he would be receiving from the Chief of Army is also made available to the opposition so that we can, on a bipartisan basis, be confident that the circumstances that led to this tragedy are put to rest. I note also the comments the minister made in relation to the review of compensation. That is an important issue. The review, I understood, was to have a completion date of 1 March. I appreciate that that may have altered, but we would seek some details from the government in relation to the time lines on that review. It is an important matter which has raised a good deal of concern by those involved and, I might add, by a number of people in the community who, whilst not directly involved, felt a great deal of compassion and concern for the victims of that tragedy. I would like to tum to a couple of the matters that are contained in the report, because I think it is important to address in the parliament some of the issues which led to the tragedy and hopefully get some advice in due course as to their remedy. Not surprisingly, the report identifies the high pilot separation rates as one of the factors that was at play in the circumstances leading up to the June accident, and the minister made mention of that. I would make the comment that, whilst the government has taken some initiatives in respect of retention bonuses, I do not think that retention bonuses are anything more than, at best, a bandaid-and that is probably the kindest interpretation. There is a need to address the underlying difficulties of the pilot separation. The report also notes that there was inadequate and untimely joint exercise planning between the SASR and 5 Aviation Regiment. I would think that that matter has been addressed very quickly in the short term and may be one of those issues to which the minister alluded, but again I would seek some advice on it. It came as something of a surprise in the course of the inquiry, given that it was conducted largely in an open manner, to read the evidence that referred to incomplete and uncoordinated reconnaissance of the exercise site. These are matters that you anticipate are put in place as routine and clearly on this occasion were not. Equally, the inaccurate diagrammatic presentation of the hill on which the assault was to occur is one of those errors that I find hard to understand could have occurred and changing the flight profile and the direction for the night mission from that which was used during the day practice seemed to me to be striking examples of failings that do require some closer examination. I notice also that the report identifies that the scope and complexity of the mission that was undertaken exceeded the standard operating procedures laid down for the 5th Aviation Regiment, and no doubt the minister would be pursuing that issue. It is an issue which I think both sides of the parliament have a legitimate interest in. It is a fairly significant point made in the report and should be the subject of some further communications with the opposition. I acknowledge the comment the minister made about the night vision goggles, which seemed to excite the passions of a lot of journalists. I note the comments in the review that there was no failing in respect of that equipment, although it did make some comments about the limitations that it may place on operational activities and some compensating measures that need to be put in place. Again I assume that is one of those areas in which action has already been taken, but I would seek the minister's response to that at an appropriate time. There is a range of matters contained in the actual report which do give rise to a whole series of questions that it is my intention to pursue, but I do not think today is the occasion on which those matters should be pursued. But I do seek from the minister the opportunity to raise them in possibly a more appropriate forum. It is incumbent on us, above all, to do two things arising from this. This is a matter that all of the parliament no doubt will adhere to. We have an obligation to ensure that the errors that led to this tragedy are corrected and that no other personnel in future are placed in the same circumstances with the same series of events that led to this tragedy. We have a second and at least equal responsibility to ensure that the victims of the accident-those who survived and the loved ones and comrades of those who are deceased-are properly cared for. I understand the difficulties that governments confront in addressing some of those issues. No doubt the review that Minister Bishop is receiving addresses those complexities. I can simply say that any effort that the government is inclined to look at in respect of that will be given very reasonable consideration by the opposition. The tragedy in June of last year is something that impacted significantly on those in Townsville as well as those in Perth. The fact that a good deal of support has been provided to them is supported by us and I know is expected by the community. In addressing those two overriding principles that I have mentioned, the government will have the opposition's clear and strong support. I finish my comments, though, by recognising the point that has been made by the minister, and I know by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me, that to defend Australia and to defend against the sorts of contingencies that we realistically have to confront in this world of ours it is necessary to have people in uniform who undertake training in the most realistic of circumstances that are, of necessity, dangerous. It is not an option for the defence of Australia to relinquish that responsibility and to move back from the need for that training. Equally, it is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that the equipment, the training and the support provided by the nation to those people who put their lives on the line is of the first order, and I trust that that is an ambition and a goal shared by us all. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA Sugar Industry",85
204,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The importance of the sugar industry to Australia's export performance. and to jobs security in Queensland and northern New South Wales. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",87
205,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Black Jack MCEwen would be rolling in his grave at the craven way in which the National Party and members from New South Wales and Queensland have gone belly up to the Melbourne and Sydney Liberal lawyers on the sugar industry. The decision we saw the government announce this week is bad policy-it is bad for jobs, it is bad for trade, it is bad for exports, it is bad for New South Wales, it is bad for Queensland. The minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), one of the culprits, and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) have gone belly up to the Sydney lawyer, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Melbourne lawyer, the Treasurer, Mr Costello. They have gone belly up to the Melbourne and Sydney economic rationalists. There is one member on the other side of the House who represents a sugar industry electorate who is prepared to stand up for the sugar industry and that is the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter. As for the rest of the members who represent sugar seats it is not the case of'S' stands for sugar, 'S' stands for surrender or'S' stands for silence. They deserve to be named. Let us go through them. They include: the member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, from the National Party; the member for Page, Mr Causley, from the National Party; the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, from the National Party; and the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, from the National Party. The member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, from the National Party is the only one to stand up for the sugar industry. The rest are silent or have surrendered. Their Liberal colleagues, their partners in crime, include: the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, and the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay. Let us have a look at what they have been and job saying individually. The member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, got up on the adjournment a couple of weeks ago and said, 'I am from New South Wales. We are not going to get steamrolled here. We want adequate compensation and we are going to go hell for leather to get it.' Now he is saying, 'This is a sensational result for New South Wales-$2 million compensation.' The cost to New South Wales is $8 million! The day after the decision, Mr Anthony was up saying, 'The decision was a good compromise.' Today he is saying, 'This is a great result. It is going to be a lot better for New South Wales and if it is anyone's fault then people should look to the Queensland industry.' He is wiping his hands and saying it is better for New South Wales. The member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, should understand a piece of history. When his family had an opportunity to support Black Jack MCEwen in his first bid to become Deputy Leader of the National Party, his grandfather voted against him in the National Party caucus. The first opportunity that the member for Richmond has to support the National Party members and supporters in New South Wales he does exactly the samehe turns his back on them. What does the member for Page, Mr Causley, do? All he does is ask the Prime Minister dorothy dix questions so that the Prime Minister can stand up and gut the sugar industry. What do we find from the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly? She talks tough, but she does nothing. She is no Ray Braithwaite. She is not like Ray. So far as those North Queensland members are concerned, this is a double whammy for North Queensland. What did we see them all do this morning? They voted for the reef tax. What did we see them do today? They gut the sugar industry in Queensland. This is a double whammy. What do we find so far as the member for Hinkler is concerned? We find him talking quietly to the Courier Mail about compromise, a bit of qualm and a bit of concern. What will we find him doing eventually? Exactly what he did on the reef tax-nothing. The member for Leichhardt has been so silent on this issue until today that I though he had his crocodile boots in his mouth. We hear a lot from the member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch, about crocodile boots, but he was silent on this issue until today. In the Cairns Post today he said that he supported the scrapping of the sugar tariff after initial misgivings because the move was backed by the sugar industry. This is the line that we get from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Prime Minister. We will dispose of that very shortly. The member for Herbert has been absolutely silent. I see the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) is in the chamber. He does not directly represent a sugar seat but we may as well ping him for the reef tax. The Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have rolled over to the views of the Prime Minister and Treasurer on this. I woke up yesterday morning to the dulcet tones of the Minister for Trade, before he jumped on the plane for another overseas mission, waxing lyrical about how much he enjoys coming to Canberra these days. He said that he did not when he first came but he does now. He said how much he enjoys sitting down with Kate Carnell and having a chat about the important policy decisions made in Canberra. No wonder Hendy Cowan says he is ratting on rural and regional Australia. No wonder Hendy Cowan came out last week saying that people like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade were not listening, that they had lost touch, that they were not supporting industries in rural and regional Australia, that they have lost direction and that they are doing nothing for industry. Let us have look at the facts on the sugar industry. Our Uruguay Round obligation is $70 per tonne by the year 2000. We comfortably meet that already with $55 per tonne, effective to 1 July, and $37 per tonne if it comes from a developing country. That comes in at about a 13 per cent tariff. The next WTO agricultural round starts in 1999. In the trade outcomes statement that the Minister for Trade tabled in February we find as a key priority, where trading partner tariff and nontariff barriers need to be broken down, sugar export barriers in China, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, which make up over 50 per cent of our sugar exports. In some of these countries and others, you find that the sugar tariff rate is 100 per cent as is the case in the United States, 104 per cent as in the case of Thailand or 170 to 193 per cent in the European Union, depending on how you do your calculation. We are at 13 per cent, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade say, 'Let's go to zero and get nothing in return.' One of the countries which is mentioned in the trade outlook statement as requiring a - peCial effortÂ· from us to break down a tariff or anon;.tariff barrier is Thailand, with a sugar tariff barrier of 104 per cent. The Thai ministers were here last week. They had cups of tea and biscuits with the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). We had the press releases, the communiques and the dorothy dixers in the House. Did We hear anything about the sugar barriers? No. Not a murmur. Not a word. But what does the Prime Minister do on Tuesday of this week? He stands up and says, 'We'll drop the sugar tariff to zero without any reference to what our trading partners are doing. We'll give you something for nothing. We'll put all our cards on the table and get nothing in return. We'll allow the cane growers from Clarence to Cairns to dance naked in the paddocks while we drop our sugar tariff to zero.' When the Prime Minister came into the House to answer the dorothy dixer from the member for Page (Mr Causley), he said: That decision and that attitude has been endorsed said: very strongly by the Queensland government. He talked about the single desk selling arrangements and said: That is a very, very important element of the government's decision ... He went on to say that the Queensland and New South Wales industries: . . . are not looking for unreasonable levels of protection. They are looking for understanding. He said the package is avery, very nice understanding measure and that the industry supports it. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in his press release, said: . . . industry strongly supports the full adoption and implementation of the integrated package ... And he said there was: . . . strong support of industry leaders . . . What do we find industry saying about this? We find the general manager of the Sugar Millers Council saying: It is fair to say large numbers of growers and millers will not agree with the government's decision. What do we find the general manager of the Cane Farmers Association, Mr Allison, saying? He said: Cane farmers from Mossman in north Queensland to Maclean in New South Wales have been scathing in their assessment of the recommendations by the Sugar Industry Review Working Party ... There is a grounds well of opinion and overwhelming opposition to the recommendations to remove the tariff. The article that came from continued: Mr Allison said cane growers had been handed an ultimatum of choosing between tariffs and single desk selling. And that is the question the Prime Minister refused to answer today from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). You have single desk selling arrangements and a tariff till 1 July now. Why can't you have it after? Why can't you have it after when there is no reason to drop our tariff measure in respect of the sugar industry in advance of the next WTO round of negotiations in 1999? In February this year, a Courier-Mail article Canegrowers chairman Harry Bonanno said canegrowers had reluctantly accepted the tariff s demise as part of a compromise to retain the industry's single desk selling arrangement. On PM the other night Mr Ballantyne said: If either side of government could have guaranteed our industry that the retention of the tariff would have also guaranteed retention of our other marketing and structural arrangements, then we would probably have had a different approach. But it took the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, to speak the plain truth. He told the truth on PM the other night when he said, 'The Cane Growers organisation most certainly isn't,' when asked whether they were happy. He said: They were forced at a gun at their head . . . They agreed with a gun at their head. So much for the great industry support! As reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and on the AAP, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, was urging the federal government to rethink its plans. He said: All I'm saying to the federal government is we need to be very careful in withdrawing support structures from Australian industries ahead of our major trading partners doing the same thing ... Mr Anderson, the minister, said, 'Oh, that wasn't about sugar; that was a generic comment.' Mr Anderson-It was.",87
206,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was, he says. If it applies in the general, it applies in the particular. It is general comment. It applies to sugar. Of course it applies to sugar. So not even the Queensland government are sticking with you. The Prime Minister also said in question time that the price has been good. Is the Prime Minister into price fixing now? He also said to the Leader of the Opposition and us on this side, 'You're being opportunistic about this. You come at this with dirty hands.' Let no-one in this House misunderstand the position and the history of this matter. The Labor Party comes to the sugar industry and the sugar tariff debate with very clean hands. It was our decision to halt tariff cuts. In February 1993 a newspaper headline said 'Labor halts tariff cuts on sugar'. The article stated: Labor's sugar plan leaves the $55 a tonne tariff for a minimum of three seasons beyond the coming season, with a review beginning in 1995-96. What did the then opposition, the now government, say? According to the article: The Opposition last night signalled that it would announce concessions for the industry, but reaffirmed its commitment to negligible protection by 2000. That is what they wanted then, and that is what they are going for now. And don't think we didn't get bagged for doing it. Don't think we didn't get bagged for saying to Queensland and New South Wales sugar farmers, 'We believe in a phased down tariff so far as your industry is concerned.' What about the friends of the economic rationalists on the other side-the friends of the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers who have rolled the minister for primary industries and the Minister for Trade? Another headline stated 'IC condemns sugar tariff freeze as a wrong signal'. So we were bagged for it. But at about the same time-April 1992an article appeared in the North Queensland Register. There was a photograph of the now Prime Minister with the caption 'John Howard thinks hard before answering a question put to him on the sugar tariff issue'. The article referred to the now Prime Minister as saying: He acknowledged cane farmers were suffering the effects of poor seasonal conditions and low world prices. The Prime Minister now stands at the dispatch box and says, 'The price has been good; ignore the tariff,' pretending to the sugar industry in New South Wales and Queensland and to members of this House that you can rely absolutely on commodity prices when three or four years ago, when he was speaking to them with a worried look on his face, he said, 'I accept there are seasonal and price variations. ' But the Prime Minister has been massively hypocritical on this point. Last year in the House, when making a statement on the APEC and WTO meetings, he said: Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. We saw in the Financial Review the headline 'PM to Asia: We won't got it alone on tariff cuts'. We won't go it alone. What do we find the Prime Minister is now doing on sugar? He is doing precisely that-going alone. The tariff is going from 13 per cent to zero when our trading partners have tariffs as high as 100 per cent in the case of the United States, 104 per cent in the case of Thailand and 170 per cent in the case of the European Union. We have put the tariff on the nothing in return. On our side, we believe in a viable ing sugar industry . We believe in making that our tariff is linked to the obligations other trading countries, and we bear their efforts in mind when we look at ours. Our plan was to freeze tariffs to 1 July this year and review it. We have done our review. Our review says: keep it where it is and look at the tariff in the context of what our trading partners do and in the context of the next WTO round. This decision is bad for the sugar industry. It is bad for jobs in New South Wales. It bad for northern Queensland. It is bad trade policy. It is bad for exports. The National Party stand condemned for the craven which they have rolled over to the Melbourne and Sydney lawyers and have been silenced on this matter. (Time expired)",90
207,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have just heard the most breathtaking hypocrihypocrisy sy from any member that I have ever heard in all the years that I have been in is one thing to have an argument about policy; it is one thing to have a disagreement across the chamber; but it is another thing to be confronted with the unbelievable hypocrisy and belly flopping from a man who was once an adviser to the man who claimed he had his hands on all the levers-the previous Prime Minister, who set in place the very policy prescriptions which resulted in the review which brought down the recommendations that are now being acted upon. And he wants to walk away from them. This is the man who only a little while ago wanted to condemn because he claimed that somehow I was not in favour of value adding Australian domestic industriesMr Stephen Smith-That is what you said.",91
208,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is not what I said. I made the perfectly obvious and defensible point that we should get into the business of value adding only when we have a comparathey tive advantage and that, when trying to further process Australian product in Australia results in value minusing, it was logical to look for table and got a better way to do it. Let us get to the nub of the issue that I exportwant to make here and make very clearly. sure The previous speaker, the member for Perth of (Mr Stephen Smith), reveals his true colours by walking away from competition policy. He was an adviser to the Prime Minister who said that the key to better value adding, the key to more economic activity and the key to more jobs in Australia is competition policy. It was under competition policy that we got this review that made these recommendations. You are not walking away from just tariffs; you are walking away from competition policy, which is what you said would give us is more value adding in this country and what you said would create more jobs in Australia. You are exposed for second-rate political way in opportunism of the first order.",91
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)absolutely Order! 'He' is exposed.,91
210,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, the speaker in this place is exposed for his absolute and cheap, almost breathtaking, on this matter. This is not just about tariffs. This is not just about the latest this place. It of their bellyflops. I have just had a look through the Hansards at all the hairy-chested things that some of their previous ministers have said about tariffs in recent times. The most recent example I could find was from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in November last year, just before the House rose at Christmas time. This was just before the Labor Party decided, 'We are going to desert all principle. We will not only walk away from the battlers'-which they did a long time ago, and it has been recognised'but we will walk away from principle as me well.' They decided that over Christmas. As late as November last year, the member for Hotham, who was one-time minister for primary industries and minister for industryall those sorts of things-was claiming to be concerned about jobs and was saying that it was only the Labor Party that had ever got on with the job of tariff reform in Australia. Now are walking away from that. What needs to be clearly understood is that, in this instance, the member for Perth-and I notice he will not confront me on it-is now plainly walking away from industry policy as well. I will talk about industry policy in a moment. Let me come to the next point. It is perfectly obvious that either the member for Perth is a total hypocrite or he does not actually understand that tariffs are of no use to export industries.",91
211,Mr ANTHONY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I think it is a bit of both.,92
212,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Probably a bit of both. Let me repeat: if you, the member for Perth, aspire to be a trade minister, you ought to understand that tariffs are of no use to export industries. That is why farm leaders in Australia have for decades sought to eliminate them. So there you go. Every farm leader in Australia recognises that tariffs cost farmers money. They cost the export sector. They hold the export sector back. In the early 1980s, it is estimated, the average farm in Australia saw its operating costs blown out by $11,000 or $12,000 a year because of high tariffs. For that reason, the Australian farm sector began to aggressively pursue lower tariffs so that they could reduce the inflated costs of operating an Australian farm. That is what has started to happen. We have got the average operating cost per farm down now to about $2,000 to $2,500. The sugar industry is one of the very few Australian industries that enjoys at times-not at the moment-a bit of marginal benefit from tariff protection. In this instance, it has to be acknowledged that, in the sugar industry, many growers would have preferred the tariff not to have gone. I will come back to that in moment. We come to the issue of leadershipsomething that those opposite plainly do not understand. Even though the member for Perth stood by the previous Prime Minister, the man who had his levers on every thinggoodness only knows what levers he gave to this bloke!-it is perfectly obvious that he learnt nothing about leadership, because he hasn't got the backbone to take a stand on anything. I am going to assume, given that he had a position of some responsibility in terms of providing advice, that he must have something going for him in the grey matter stakes. He must understand something of these issues. He must have some policy sense. But, plainly, he is prepared to sacrifice any willingness to show any backbone on these issues, unlike, I have to say, primary industry leadership of the sort that has resulted in this outcome. I am going to quote from today's Queensland Country Life, under the heading, 'Cane tariff cut fitting example': The belt tightening tariff cut brought down on the sugar industry by its own Sugar Industry Review must pose a challenge to many other Australian industries to follow suit and become more internationally competitive. It goes on: It stands to reason that an overhaul of competition policy applied to motor vehicles, fuel, transport charges, government charges and other cost inputs will greatly assist the international competitiveness of key export industries like sugar and grain. Here we have something recognised by the chief rural paper in the major sugar producing state that the so-called alternative trade minister in this country cannot see. The major rural newspaper in the state that grows the most sugar recognises the point that Australian rural industries stand to gain from pursuit of hard policy. It goes on to acknowledge the difficult side of it, but it also says, in part, and this is worth recording: Clearly the best way is to encourage protected industries to develop their own working parties, just as the sugar industry did, to combine the pain and the benefits that will equip them better to perform on the world trade stage. It goes on to give the government a pat on the back. It says that we need to be careful to make sure that there is no dumping on our markets, and then says: The Government already has shown a strong lead in this direction by blocking Hungarian agricultural and manufactured products. And so it goes on. It then says this about the industry: Thank goodness the industry had enough fire in its belly retain what has worked well, while at the same time baring its breast to the necessary surgery of tariff reduction. That is leadership from those most affected when you cannot get leadership from an alternative senior minister in this place. I think the case at that level rests. Coming to the question of sugar industry leadership, today the Bundaberg paper-and I commend the editor and the people on that paper for strong, straight down the line reporting of the facts and presentation of reality, when I guess it would be easy for them in the current circumstances to do otherwise-ran a story entitled 'Tariff move supported: sugar boss wants other industries to follow suit'. The article reads: Canegrowers chairman Harry Bonannoif llny member in this place knows anything about the sugar industry, and quite obviously Â«he, previous speaker does not, they would know that Harry Bonanno is a strong, effective and recognised leader of the sugar industryyesterday supported the Federal Government's announcement that it would endorse the removal of the $55-a-tonnesugar import tariff on July 1. ""Even' though the removal of the tariff and a .number of other outcomes from the (Sugar Industry Review) package will ... impact on the finances of individual growers. we accept that the package is the only way the sugar industry can satisfy National Competition Policy guidelines while enhancing global competitiveness,"" Mr Bonanno said. Here we go again on this issue: Harry Bonanno and the sugar industry recognise that national competition policy in net terms benefits rural industry; the editor of the Queensland Country Life can see it; and every major farm group in the country can see it. The previous government never stopped arguing that it was self-evidently the case when they were being advised by people like the member for Perth. But when they get into opposition and find that they might be better served by a bit of populism on thisregardless of the long-term impact on industries and the country-they resort to it like duck to a water because, in the end, they are a bunch of opportunists. Mr Fitzgibbon-That is hypocrisy.",92
213,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to the bait on that one and simply remind the member for Hunter that he is very fortunate that his side is not in the seat, because it was his minister that proved it. Had the Labor Party by some fluke been returned last year, it would have come in a long time ago. I want to come now to the sugar industry in particular and make a couple of comments. The coalition government recognises the enormous importance of the sugar industry to rural and regional economies in Queensland, New South Wales and-increasingly now-in Western Australia. There are over 6,500 growers in Queensland, some 550 in New South Wales and an emerging number now in Western Australia. We annually produce in excess of five million tonnes of raw sugar worth in excess of $2 billion. We are the largest exporter of raw sugar in the world, although not a significant exporter of refined sugar. It does seem that there is a considerable scope here for value adding. The member for Perth is studiously avoiding me at the moment because he knows how utterly exposed and superficial his position is. The fact is that you claim to be committed to value adding; so you ought to take careful note that, in this instance, the sugar industry has a real opportunity to participate in more value adding. Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",93
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Perth! You have had your go.,93
215,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The current system works against that goal and the package of reforms, supported by industry, aims to redress the situation. I want to return to the national competition policy, because it was agreed to by all governments in April 1995. I think it is time the opposition came clean and announced that this is the latest area on which they are going to do a major policy backflip. To all intents and purposes, that is what they have now announced. This was a. review that was set up under national competition policy guidelines-that is what it was there for. It was put there because the previous government led the charge for a national competition policy and got all the states to sign up to it. In broad terms, the objectives of the review were to ensure that government business enterprisesthe professions and industries in agriculture that were supported by statutory marketing arrangements-would be reviewed for their competitiveness. The sugar industry saw that it would be in their interests to get a competition review going early, and that is what they did. They set up a competition review team that looked exhaustively at the industry. They resolved that, in order to be advance value adding domestically-which this fellow over here keeps saying is important-and to open up further markets for Australian sugar on the domestic market, we needed to ensure that domestic manufacturers and consumers had access to sugar at world export prices. But at the same time they acknowledged that much more value was extracted out of the single desk export arrangements that are effectively underpinned by Queensland legislation pertaining to the Queensland Sugar Corporation. So the review team made their recommendations. The short-term way of meeting the competition policy objectives of ensuring that the domestic market was no higher than world export parity was to remove the tariff. The easiest way to ensure that we maximised our marketing clout on international markets, which the review team made quite plain is where the major financial benefit to the sugar industry and to the nation is, was to leave in place the acquisition powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation. That is what they recommended. The next point is that industry then asked the Queensland government to put this through cabinet in a prompt way. The Queensland government did just that; the Queensland coalition government fully supported the package. There is only one part of that package which in any way involves the Commonwealth, and that is the tariff. So the Queensland government, the task force and the industry asked us to progress that through in this place. We have done so. But we have done so-and I know the second speaker for the government will cover this widely-in a way which recognises that there is something of a disproportionate impact in potential terms on New South Wales. We are a government that is concerned with equity. I tell you this in closing. What ought to be carefully considered by those opposite, who now want to play hypocritical and opportunistic politics. is what they did-or rather what they did not do--for other Australian rural industries when they removed tariffs and protection in a way that really impacted on industries like citrus. They are exposed for their willingness to resort to the cheapest of political opportunism. I sincerely hope that that is recognised across the Australian community. They have nothing to stand on whatsoever. (Time expired)",93
216,Mr ADAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I want to deal with a couple of matters that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) dealt with. The minister was quoting a statement that we should become world competitive. I was looking at the figures from other countries that are our competitors and have tariffs. There are a limited number of countries in the world which are sugar exporters. To become more competitive we really do have to deal with the other countries. The US has a 100 per cent tariff. Thailand has 104 per cent. The European Union has 170 per cent. We will end up destroying our local markets by allowing the world to heap sugar on us. And the minister is quoting from something saying that we have to become more world competitive. How do we become world competitive against the figures of those other countries that are well above us at the moment? Just remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said-and he is very good at rhetoric, our Prime Minister, isn'the? He said, 'We will not go alone.' Well, we are going alone with sugar tariffs. Why are we not using this in the next round with the World Trade Organisation? If you know how to negotiate, you have a few aces to negotiate with. Why are we not going to use this to negotiate? We are not going to use this to negotiate; we are just going to give it away now, without any rhyme or reason. We should not be doing that; we should be using the present tariff position. And we are in front. The $55 a tonne puts us in front of the $70 tonne limit required for our commitment to the World Trade Organisation. Jobs and job security are the first thing that we should be worried about to ensure that we have industries and skills to develop our export industries. Without developing our export industries, getting our employment levels up and the ability to train and be smarter, Australia is going to lose its competitive edge-if it sticks to just digging it up, scything it down, burning it off and pushing it off the continent as fast as possible without any tariffs or intervention to encourage processing, value adding or allowing local growers to try for import substitution. We can be a lot smarter in achieving goals. The reason that is being quoted for the removal of the tariff in the middle of this year is the government saying that it wants to ensure that New South Wales growers gain access to export markets currently dominated by the Queensland growers. The requirement is single desk selling both for domestic and export sugar. It seems that the big sugar processors are nervous about losing control of their domestic market. They would see their export market very quickly undermined, and this is why the Queensland growers have said they have not reacted more strongly to loss of the tariff. It certainly is not their choice, as is being floated about by the minister and others. The opposition is concerned what the scrapping of the tariff might mean in terms of world trade, and that we should not be too hasty about dropping the tariff; we should be using it when we go to the next round of negotiations. We are really jumping the gun when we do this. As I quoted earlier, other countries are certainly miles behind us in the level of protection that they give their sugar industry. I am sure the cordial companies will not mind when they get imported sugar. When the cheaper sugar runs into Australia, I am sure the cordial companies will not be bringing down the price of the soft drinks on the shelves for the consumers of Australia. It will be interesting to see what happens in relation to that price from a consumer point of view. Of a number of National Party members, the one who has been most the vocal is the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who seems extraordinarily worried about this proposal. I must confess that it is great concern that he is not here in the House because he does take up issues that he feels very strongly about. I would expect him to be here and possibly vote to support this motion today. He believes that farmers would lose out considerably. He said that cane growers were forced to agree to the tariff removal or be abandoned to the mercies of the international processors and traders. He said, 'They are going to be thrown out if they do not agree. The traders are just going to be thrown to the mercy of the traders of the world and the big processing companies.' That is what the member for Kennedy said on the Wille see program on 5 March this year. Mr Katter has taken up this issue, so let us see if he stands by his convictions when the vote is taken. Queensland backbenchers from the government are big talkers back home but, when they get to Canberra, they are diverted and bend to the political masters and to the lawyers of Melbourne and Sydney who control the Liberal Party-the lawyers of Melbourne and Sydney who are stretching it out and destroying regional Australia, ripping the heart right out of it. They are king-hitting regional Australia, and this is another king hit for regional Australia. The minister, who claims to be the minister for regional Australia, has gutted his department. He has about five or six people in a unit who write his correspondence, quite apart from building any policies for regional Australia. I have seen Lame Duck Larry up the back cooeeing. He did not get a berth when it came to standing up to speak on this matter. I am sure we will hear more from him. The member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) is not even in the House, but this morning she voted to increase taxes for the tourist industry in her electorate. It does not seem that she will help too many sugar growers in Dawson. She should remember the time when Flo BjelkePetersen stood up for the farmers near Mackay. When crunch time came, her predecessor in the seat of Dawson, Ray Braithwaite, and Lady Flo as a Queensland senator voted against the party line. They had some backbone. Is there any backbone now o. have they gone to spaghetti? I reckon they have gone to spaghetti. It is like putting a piece of spaghetti in hot water-this is an analogy I picked up the other night from my colleague the member for Denison (Mr Kerr)-as soon as it hits the hot water it flitters away. Members of the National Party are operating just like a piece of spaghetti going into hot water-they flitter away. That is what their backbone is doing; they will stand up as they should be doing. The knob of sugar on the bitter pill is a couple of million dollars here and there to build a bridge which had already been promised by the last government-which is revisiting what we were doing anyway. Once again, the rural people, the country communities, the regional areas of our country will be the guys. They are the ones losing the jobs and stacking the odds against the survival of many small businesses in the regional sector. Pressure is always on small business. They have been king hit and scuttled. There will be more unemployment. It has been estimated that 2,300 jobs will go. I wish the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) were here to vote on this matter. I would ask that he come into the House to vote at that time. (Time expired)",94
217,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard quite incredible recitations from the Labor Party apparatchik from Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) who padded out 10 minutes. When you look at him you will see why it is easy for him to pad it out. There no doubt that they have no knowledge at all of the sugar industry. My family has been growing sugar since 1890 on the Clarence River. I am very proud to say that I represent the great Australian sugar industry. I have been a cane cutter, a farmer and I served as the president of the cane growers on the Clarence River. I was an inaugural director of a sugar milling cooperaabout tive. Mr Martin interjecting",96
218,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"People interject and say that I am a failed minister for agriculture in New South Wales. But it is amazing that I get phone calls saying, 'Why aren't you back here? We have a mess on our hands in New South Wales.' I have never seen such hypocrisy from a party in all my life. At least we have the honesty to stick by what we believe in. Noone really wanted to see the abolition of the tariff. When you look closely at the reason for it at present, take into consideration what the Industry Commission did and look very not carefully at the workings of the tariff, you would have to come to the same conclusion that they came to. At present the domestic price of sugar in Australia is below the world price. If you people over there can brainstorm and tell me how a tariff can help that, I would be very pleased to hear. It has absolutely no effect at fall all on the sugar industry at present. The minister did say that from time to time a tariff has been beneficial to the sugar industry, but at present it is of no value. When an industry says, 'It is going to cost X number of dollars,' and they are talking some millions of dollars-I notice all we had from the opposition were quotes from newspapers; if you read the newspapers all the time and selectively quote you will not get it too right-obviously they are putting the worse case scenario to try to argue their case. They looked at the $55 a tonne tariff and multiplied that by the crop and said, 'This is what we are going to lose.' I say to the parliament that they are not going to lose that. From my experience in the sugar industry, if I were a salesman and I was already selling is my product below the world price, am I likely to deduct another $30 off it? That would be ridiculous. It is absolutely ridiculous that those figures have been touted. If you look very carefully at that, you would understand it. I am pleased to see the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) back in the chamber. For two days we have been listening to him talking value adding. But when it really comes to the test on tariffs and to getting efficiency in the Australian refining industry, what does he do? He takes the convenient way out and says, 'Oh, if we were in government we would not do this at all.' That is absolute nonsense. If you look at the industryMr Crean-If we can do it, why can't you?",96
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Hotham.,97
220,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Throw him out where he belongs.,97
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Page will continue.,97
222,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you look at the industry and what it needs-and that is exactly what the government has done-then you have to see that, in New South Wales in particular, because the industry working party had recommended the abolition of the tariff they would have had to change from being a domestically oriented industry to some exporting. They do not have a deep sea port. The closest deep sea port is Brisbane. Obviously there is a need for some infrastructure in that area to make sure that the industry can compete with the Queensland industry. The Queensland industry is a big industry, there is no doubt about that. As the minister said, Australia has consistently been the biggest exporter of sugar in the world. The New South Wales industry needed to compete and the government looked closely at that and said yes. The New South Wales industry also said, quite rightly, that if it going to lose its share of the domestic market-the American quota of 160,000 tonnes, which is an Australian quota-they were entitled to five per cent of that quota because they grew five per cent of the cane in Australia. I think that is a perfectly reasonable assessment to make; they should get five per cent. That is worth $2 million. We heard an interjection earlier about the million dollars that the previous government promised. In fact, Harry Woods promised $2 million but then he backed away. Mr Crean-Because you didn't match it. You sold out.",97
223,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Motormouth, if you would shut up I would tell you. He said he would provide it but only if the New South Wales government matched it. It will be very interesting to see whether Bob Carr honours that commitment because it is a commitment and he has to honour it. Yes, that infrastructure was there but that was part of the package that you offered to the sugar industry in 1993. That million dollars was never seen. Mr Crean-It included a single desk.",97
224,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course Queensland wants single desks. That is one of the things that they wanted: the guarantee of a single desk. The other problem they had, and the Australian industry has, is an overcapacity in refining. There needs to be some rationalisation of that in the Australian market and the government has said that we will attempt to facilitate that because there is no doubt that that would be of great benefit to the whole industry. If you look at this argument and you look at the reasons that have been put forward by the industry to recommend the abolition of the tariff, I think you will find that they stand up. There is no doubt that the arguments are sound and solid, that the tariff is not necessary in the sugar industry at present and that the abolition of the tariff will not, I believe, affect cane growers in Australia for the simple reasonMr Crean-Oh, yeah! Ask De-Anne Kelly.",97
225,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I do not want to explain it again; I explained it earlier. I might have to was put it in three-letter words so that you can understand. There is no reason to sell sugar any cheaper in Australia because the Australian domestic price is already below the world price. Mr Crean-Are you going to guarantee it stays there?,97
226,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would not allow the member for Hotham to sell anything for me because, given his record in the ACTU, I know he would sell me out any time. I am sure that there are membersobviously members of the National Partyand individual growers who do not entirely agree with this decision. But I believe history will show that this decision was correct. I do not believe it will have any effect on the growers. On the contrary, what the government has done will make the Australian sugar industry a more efficient industry. It is one of the most efficient in the world now; that is why we capture these markets. We have the best quality sugar in the world. I am sure this decision will only make the industry more efficient. There is no doubt that, given the GATT and given the fact that the protections are going to be wound down over the next few yearsMr Adams interjecting",97
227,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Lyons is saying, 'Why don't you use this as a bargaining chip?' Where were you in the Uruguay Round when we were looking for some anti-dumping legislation? There is one thing that you can do if you are worried about tariffs in Thailand, the US and the EC. Where were you when we were looking for anti-dumping legislation? There is no effective anti-dumping legislation in the WTO. That is what you could have delivered and you did not. There is no use crying now about tariffs. I do not think I have seen such an acrobatic act in all my life. It is a bit hard to believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) could do a double backflip with pike-but he has. Quite frankly, I believe he will be proven wrong and opportunistic. Most growers in the industry understand this. It is only the Labor Party who are jumping on the bandwagon and attempting to be opportunistic. I repeat: this gives the industry an opportunity to improve its price. It will not cost the industry. The industry obviously put forward the worse case scenario to argue their case. They did it effectively and the government listened to them.",98

STANDING ORDERS: DIVISIONS",98
230,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That, unless otherwise ordered, the following amendments to the standing orders be adopted for the remainder of this period of sittings with effect from 18 March 1997: (1) Standing orders 195, 197 and 199 be amended to read: Members calling for division 195. Members calling for a division shall not leave the area within the seats allotted to Members, and shall vote with those who, in the opinion of the Speaker, were in the minority when the voices were taken. No Member to vote unless present when tellers appointed 197. No Member shall be entitled to vote in any division unless, when the tellers are appointed, the Member is within the seats allotted to Members. Except that when a successive division is taken pursuant to standing order 203A, this standing order does not apply. Division bells rung 199. Before a division is taken, the Clerk shall ring the division bells and the doors shall not be closed until after the lapse of four minutes. (2) Standing order 200A be suspended. (3) Standing orders 201, 202 and 203 be amended to read: Question stated; Members divided; Tellers appointed 201. When the doors have been locked, and all the Members are in their places, the Speaker shall state the question to the House, shall direct the ""Ayes"" to proceed to the right of the Chair, and the ""Noes"" to the left, and Members having accordingly taken seats, shall appoint tellers for each side. Members present when tellers appointed must vote 202. On the tellers being appointed, every Member within the seats allotted to Members shall vote and no Member may move from his or her place until the result of the division is announced. Except that when a successive division is taken pursuant to standing order 203A, this standing order does not apply. Members counted, names taken down 203. Every Member within the seats allotted to Members shall then be counted, and his or her name taken down by the tellers. When recording is complete the tellers shall calculate the total number of Members voting on that side. Tellers shall sign their list, and present it to the who will declare the result to the House. (4) New standing orders 203A and 203B be inserted: Successive divisions-bells rung. tellers appointed 203A. When successive divisions - re taken, and there is no intervening debate after the first division, the bells for the ensuing division shall be rung for one minute only. Notwithstanding the provisions of standing order 201, the Speaker shall appoint tellers immediately after the division is called. Successive divisions-vote same as in previous division 203B. When a successive division is taken pursuant to standing order 203A the tellers shall record each Member's vote as being the same as it was in the immediately preceding division. Provided that any Member who(i) wishes to vote differently to the way he or she voted in the previous division; or (ii) voted in the previous division and does not wish to vote in the current division; or (iii) did not vote in the previous division and wishes to vote in the current divisionshall report to the tellers as necessary to have his or her voting intention properly recorded. Members who wish to vote in the same way as they did in the immediately preceding division shall remain in their seats until the result of the division is announced. Provided further that, if it is apparent to the Speaker that most Members wish to vote differently to the previous division, or if there is any confusion or error in the numbers calculated by the tellers, the vote shall be counted as provided in standing order 203. (5) Standing order 204 be amended to read: If 4 or fewer Members on a side 204. If, at the time that the doors are locked, there are 4 or fewer Members on a side in a division, the Speaker shall, without completing the division, forthwith declare the decision of the House. In such event, the names of the Members who are in the minority shall be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. In November 1996 the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) tabled the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure on the topic of conduct of divisions. The report targeted the expedition of Speaker, vote counting. Whereas now the government has a large majority, the majority report recommended that for ordinary divisions members should file past tellers when they enter the chamber and, while the bells were still ringing, record their vote and that, for consecutive divisions, members would need only report to the tellers if they intended to change their votes, abstain or if they had not voted in the preceding division. The minority report favoured the introduction of electronic voting for the House. In my response to the report, I indicated that, while not disputing the advantages of electronic voting, it appeared the costs of implementation were likely to be very high. I have since sought advice on the cost issue from the Speaker. In any event, I see this as a longer term issue. Accordingly, I have entered into discussions with the Labor opposition and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), on behalf of the Independents, with a view to trialIing the non-electronic recommendations. From the outset, the opposition expressed reservations about practical aspects of the committee's proposed procedures for ordinary or single divisions. They were, however, prepared to look at the alternative of two sets of tellers to undertake the count on the government side. In practice, that would mean there would be no change to the current procedures for a single division, except for the extra set of counters on whatever side government members were voting-the assumption being that it would take about half the current time for the count or thereabouts. There was general support for the committee's proposals for consecutive divisions when the bells are rung for one minute, so we have adopted this point. In these cases it will be important that the chair acquaints members arriving for such a division of the full import of the question before the House before they are required to vote. Moreover, members changing sides will need to report to two sets of tellers to be removed from one list and added to another. Today's motion proposes the trial of these arrangements for sitting weeks five and six. It may then be appropriate to consider whether or not we would have an extension of this trial period, if the various interested members believe that such a further trial might be useful. If the trial is a success, the new arrangements would be made permanent. The motion also amends standing order 204, which provides that, if there is only one member on a side for a division, the Speaker shall call off the division and, if requested, record the member's dissent. While the committee recommended the call-off number be increased to eight, for the purposes of the trial the number is set at four. To assist members to acquaint themselves with the new procedures, I understand that the clerk proposes to conduct a run-through in the chamber at a quarter to one on Tuesday, 18 March. No doubt, he will formally advise members of this proposal. I thank the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the member of Grayndler (Mr Albanese), the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the member for Moncrieff, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and others for their assistance in putting this arrangement together. I also want to thank the clerk for the drafting. We are attempting to deal expeditiously with this motion, so I am deliberately keeping my remarks brief and to the point. Mr Crean-And not provocative.",98
231,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am rarely provocative-if ever. In essence, this is a means of simply making the procedures more efficient. It means that the first division is basically as it is now, but with a couple of extra tellers near where the Hansard reporters are seated. On a subsequent division-in other words, an immediately following division-there will be a reporting process to obviate the necessity for a second count. I think it is worth a trial. I appreciate the fact that the opposition and other members have entered into it in a cooperative spirit. We will give the trial a run for a couple of weeks or a bit longer if we feel it is necessary. With a bit of luck, we will be able to then see these arrangements come in on a permanent basis. They will need, of course, the ongoing cooperation of people just to sort through the initial changeover period. But I am sure we will have the full assistance of all members. I commend the motion to the House.",100
232,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The opposition agrees with the proposal before the House. As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has indicated, we were involved in some negotiations with them that have arrived at this point. I should make the point, however, that the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, from which this proposal has now emerged, involved majority and minority recommendations. The minority recommendation supported electronic voting as the procedure to be embraced by this House. It was rejected by the majorityessentially government members-on the basis of cost. It is pleasing to note that, as part of this agreement, there is a preparedness on the part of the government to seek further advice from the Speaker. A letter was written to the Speaker towards the end of last year seeking advice from him as to what, in the current circumstances, the new cost would be. There is a view that the technology has improved, the cost has been reduced and that we should not dismiss considering moving to the electronic voting system. But we do accept that, if cost is a prohibitive barrier, there is not much point proceeding with it. However, the Leader of the House has agreed to refer that matter again to the Speakthe er and we would obviously like a response to that as early as possible. I might say that, given the fact that we were prepared to spend half a million dollars moving a chair, it seems to meMr Reith-And you opposed it.",100
233,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We opposed it because of the cost, on the basis that if that money were available it could be better spent. If the argument is that we need expedition in the voting procedures, I would have thought it would be better to spend it doing that than to provide a seat for one person. The majority of members of the Procedure Committee rejected electronic voting for those reasons, but they proposed an alternative system of voting in this House which involved a physical filepast. This was a position not embraced by the opposition and, for that matter, the Independents. But they will speak for themselves. But, having rejected that, we did proceed to consider ways in which we could expedite procedures and the proposal that comes before us today does that. Essentially, what we will do is vote the same way as before on the first division and if a second division, a consequential one, results in the majority of one side changing sides then the second division will still be counted in the old way. If, however, the majority on one side does not look like they are going to be moving to the other side for the consequential amendment, the process involves the tellers being approached by those people wishing to change their vote, that being the method by which the tellers will ultimately record the vote. That does of course require a tally with the numbers that the clerks keep. Whether this system works will depend very much on the preparedness of those seeking to change votes in fact notifying accordingly. The other provision that is involved here is the agreement that if four or fewer members wish to have a division then that will be sufficient to effect that. That arose from consultations involving the member for Moore (Mr Filing) on behalf of other Independents in the House. We support that. As well, we support the change that will see introduction of three sets of tellers. This is the Stewart MCArthur amendment. This is the amendment that recognises the great difficulty that the government has with not only the numbers on their side-of which we are very envious-but also the member for Corangamite recognising who he has on his side of the House and actually recording that vote. So we have to have two lots of people counting on that side to make up for what we can do over here. For the member for Corangamite, this will go down as his amendment, and we look forward with interest to seeing how he functions in the new environment. In particular, we look forward to seeing if he is as quick as the other sets of tellers on his side of the House. This will be a very interesting competition. The opposition indicates its support for these changes. They are to be introduced on a trial basis. The trial will come into effect in the next sitting fortnight, after which we will judge its effectiveness. I thank the Leader of the House for what have been pretty civil negotiations. We have actually got on pretty well, so there has been a bit of a change this year. It is very pleasing to see. He needs to pull his hamstring more often, I think. It slows him down a bit. He does not come out with the vindictiveness and the sharp tongue. The Leader of the House recognises that, despite the fact that he has the weight of numbers in the place, he actually does need some cooperation from this side from time to time. To the extent to which he is prepared to involve us genuinely in discussions about improved procedures, we are also prepared to participate. We support the motion.",101
234,Mr CADMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I want to thank the House for the opportunity to debate this motion, which arises from a Standing Committee on Procedure report entitled Conduct of divisions. It has been an interesting process to work through with the opposition the way in which we could approach this. The report of the Standing Committee on Procedure indicates that divisions, at the time these surveys were undertaken, were taking about eight minutes to be counted. That is after the four minutes of the calling of a division and the ringing of the bells. In the previous parliament, to six minutes. I have gone a little bit deeper into the analysis process. Despite the compliment-I do not know whether it was a complimentor comments made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) about my colleague the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), I would like to go into a few more details. Whilst you attribute to him the reason we have all these extra numbers in the House, in fact that may not be the case. The fact of the matter is that, if we take a sample over the last couple of months of divisions, the time addition to the ringing of the bells-as best we can account from Hansard records-is 7.5 minutes for the counting of a division whereas in the previous parliament the average time was 6.15 minutes. But, if you go back to the parliament before that, the average time was 7.9 minutes--even longer than now. So there is no real pattern of conduct. We have 14 additional members. My colleague the member for Corangamite and the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) have done well to cope with those large numbers. It appears from the statistics that we have taken-ad hoc, sure-that the counting time has actually varied from parliament to parliament, no doubt based on the skills of the whips involved. The most time the new counting processes could expect to save, I think, would be a little over a minute. On behalf of the backbench, I have to say that while a division is going on is a very important time for members to mix. Provided the opposition does not insist on calling divisions all the time, it is an important time for members of the House to join together, for members to sit next to a minister to plead their cause and to bring their case to a minister's attention. I plead in regard to the counting process a little bit of consideration and a factual account on behalf of the member for Corangamite and the member for Fowler. It is a wonderful thing for the Labor Party to say 'Stuey, come on, open your eyes. Come on Stuey, find the members.'",102
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,'Member for it took five Corangamite' you mean.,102
236,Mr CADMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, but I am quoting what is said in divisions, Mr Deputy Speaker. The comments have been a little unfair. If one looks at the time taken for counting in the 36th, 37th and 38th parliaments, one will find that there is very little difference-actually, one minute is the most that I can determine is taken in addition to what has traditionally been the counting time. The real savings will come from the amendments to standing orders for the successive or the consequential divisions, where it will be in necessary for members to notify the tellers if as they intend to change their vote. We are going to have to be careful in the trial period of two weeks because if members change their vote from one side to another they will have to notify two groups of tellers-those counting for the ayes and those counting for the noes. It will not be sufficient to tell one group of tellers if they are changing their vote. That is a matter that particularly the Independent members will have to have regard for, but they will speak for themselves. If a member has been absent from a vote and comes into the chamber-the bells are ringing for one minute and the member needs to find their place in the chamber-in that process they will have to notify a teller of where they are actually going to be voting. Their presence cannot go unnoticed will no doubt be checked in an informal way by the clerks. I believe there could be some confusion the process as a result of the new standing orders. The changes will be beneficial to House. The real benefits will come from successive divisions rather than any change the number of tellers there are. Being a and identifying people in this House is not an easy task, and despite the chiacking and chairs. comments that are made, I think the whipsif I may speak for them-behave in an impeccable manner and conduct themselves with the highest professional ethic and etiquette that is required in a parliament of the type the Australian Parliament. With that warning about the need for members to be very careful about what they do in the successive divisions-to notify bottom of it. tellers if there is a change, if they are coming in late or if there is any other factor that causes them to abstain from a vote-members will need to be very careful if this process to work, otherwise there could be confusion. In fact, it could result in a longer period taken to conduct a count.",102
237,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (5.03 p.m.)As my colleague the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), said, the opposition supports this change to the standing orders and is willing to give it a trial. We recognise it for the stupendous parliamentary reform that that it is obviously going to change the way the House of Representatives, as we have known it, works. I am sure that the Leader of the House Reith), the member for Moncrieff (Mrs introduced Sullivan) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) will go down in the annals of this House as the people who really changed the system. We do not really believe it is the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) who is the main reason for this change, but we think he has contributed to it a little bit. defence of the member for Corangamite, the Chief Government Whip makes us why we are having this reform: if the government is not losing time in divisions now as sugar. they thought they were, then maybe there is and it not any reason for it. While there was some discussion about electronic voting by the committee, which in produced a majority and minority report, I do not know whether we ought to definitely the pursue the idea of it. We know we are going the to ask the Speaker to find out how much it in will cost, but I suspect that electronic voting whip might turn into Speaker's chair mark II. Mr Crean-You could have six Speaker's",103
238,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As my colleague said, it might be six Speaker's chairs mark II. You can just see it now-instead of the green of up there behind us, we will have the big board; next we will have Debbie Spillane in here to read the board for us, with names flashing up and down, and we might even have a little bit of sponsorship along the",103
239,Mr CADMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Oh, what a feeling! Mr LEO MCLEAYThe Chief Governis ment Whip might think that he can jump up and down and they will put him on film on being the board-I do not know. People ought to think long and hard about electronic voting and what it will do. There will be change in a couple of ways. One thing it will do is change the way this chamber looks. More importantly, members ought to think about electronic voting in respect of the way it will change some of the theatre of this place-and it is and I say this sincerely to all. There are some times in this House when genuinely dramatic things happen. One of the more dramatic times I recall here as a mem(Mr ber was some years ago when the government legislation that affected the National Party differently from the way it affected the Liberal Party. The National Party voted with the government on that legislation, which was a very unusual thing to have happen in this House. The members of the National Party were not able to just sit there on the In his same side with their colleagues from the coalition and rat. They had to get up and wonder move across the chamber. Mr Crean-We might see that again on Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As my friend the Manager of Opposition Business says, we may be in the process of seeing that again shortly if the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is sincere about what he says in the newspapers-that he is not going to vote with the government on the sugar industry. Mr Crean-And the member for Dawson. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-And the member for Dawson, but more importantly the member for Kennedy, who is going to have to cross the floor on this issue. People should be able to see those dramatic times rather than have someone quietly sitting in their chair and putting their card in and all of a sudden we see on the board that someone has kicked an own goal.  Mr LEO MCLEA Y-As the member for Chiefly says, maybe the big board might actually do us some good there because, if we did have a provision in the programming of the big board that when someone voted in a different way from their partyMr Crean-You'd see a golden rat. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-A big flash would come up on the board and the golden rat would appear and say, 'Katter's the golden ratter,' or something-that might be a reason to have the big board. So, if the government and the Speaker want to convince me that they will have that sort of programming in this so we will see 'Katter the ratter' - I was nearly going to say what my colleague in the Senate called Senator Colston, but I will not say that",103
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Watson might restrain himself. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-So, if we could have those sorts of theatrics, that might be nearly as good as seeing someone cross the floor. In all seriousness, I think that people ought to think very carefully about that theatre of what this place is about and the hard thing it is a person who is going to vote against their party to make that long walk from one side of the chamber to the other in front of all their colleagues.",104
241,Mr FILING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"You'd make it even more intimidating. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-That is longest walk most people make in their life and sometimes, like the member for Moore, it can be the last walk they make in their life. So I think we should think seriously about that, but the opposition is quite happy to try these changes out. We do not think they are a terrifically big change. We do not really blame the member for Corangamite for them but, if the government had put a different counter in before we did this, they might have showed that it was the member for Corangamite, but we are willing to take the long explanation from the Chief Government Whip that it is not really his fault. If after we bring in this reform and after five or six minutes the member for Corangamite is still counting a third of the House in the same way he used to count two-thirds, we will know whose amendment this really is.",104
242,Mrs SULLIVAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieff) (5.09 p.m.)There is an agreement that we will all speak briefly this afternoon and, after that contribution, I am not going to find that very difficult. That will not be because I am cowed into some sort of diffidence about speaking because of its profundity. However, there are a couple of things I would like to put on the record and to set straight. The fact is that the Procedure Committee did not consider electronic voting in any sort of detail and reject it. I would just like to quote the relevant sentence from the report. Having noted that, according to Mr Martin's report, as it says, there would be an installation cost of $3 million and ongoing support costs of $300,000 per annum, the committee made the comment: Consequently the committee has decided to defer consideration of this option, at least until it can make further detailed inquiries into the current costs. for So the matter was never considered in any detail. Certainly, the report of the former Speaker, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was in front of us to look at. We gave it that much consideration but, under the circumstances, it was just not a goer so we did not waste our time on it. In that context, as the new chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, I found it very disappointing that the issue was referred to the Labor Party caucus and a decision was taken which bound the Labor Party members on the committee. I have never known that to happen on the the Procedure Committee, and I think it was great pity. In my experience on the Procedure Committee, it has never happened that an issue that is before the committee and being considered by the committee has gone to a party meeting for decision to bind the memsuch bers of the committee. Certainly, members the coalition have never been bound in that way. Mr Crean-That didn't happy, Kathy. as That's wrong. You should correct",104
243,Mrs SULLIVAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, member for Hotham. I would like opposition members the committee to correct the record because that was stated more than once at the commita tee meetings. When we were looking at some of the recommendations of the report, there was an unwillingness to actually participate implemented. on the grounds that the opposition members were constrained by virtue of the factÂ· that their side had taken a decision and they were bound to support electronic voting. Mr Crean-No, that's not right. That is just not right.",105
244,Mrs SULLIVAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"That is exactly the way Australian the committee ran, exactly the way. The opposition members may have been mistaken, but they all said the same thing. There are a couple of things I would like put on the record. I have been a teller chamber, and there is a matter I raised in the deliberations of the committee that has not been mentioned yet. I was not actually laughgo ing when the comments were made about the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). The teller's form has not been a user friendly form at all. When you are trying to find your way around that form and mark names as they are being called ttl you by the other teller, you simply cannot do it quickly. I understand that the form has been reThe designed, and I am very pleased to hear that. But, again, in my experience, the hold up has not been the person calling the names; it has been the person ticking the names-and the member for Corangamite has been the caller. Mr Ted Grace-Fair go!",105
245,Mrs SULLIVAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am not reflecting on the member for Fowler because he is one of nicest chaps in this place. I think I actuala ly was a co-teller with him once. He would agree with me, I am sure, that that form has not been easy and it is certainly part of the reason why the count is as slow as it is. It is all very well to ridicule one of the tellers in a manner, but the simple fact is that the of people who did it do not come from a side that has ever had the luxury of 94 members. The fact that the government has nearly twice many members as the opposition is certainthe record. ly part of the problem. The member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) of made the comment that the change was 'not terrifically big'. Of course, it only implements part of the Procedure Committee recommendations. I have to admit to an amount of disappointment that the principle part was not Mr Crean-That was the only part that was workable.",105
246,Mrs SULLIVAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Hotham interjects that it was the only part that was workable. I just point out that it is precisely the system that is used in the Western parliament, and it has worked there for quite some time. It works there and you really cannot say it is not workable here. You really cannot say that it is not workable to unless you have tried it, and the opposition in this just did not want to even try it. The Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), decided to with the opposition's objections, because he is such an easygoing sort of a guy. I am not being critical of him, but I am being critical of the opposition for not being prepared to try it in a way that would have saved off us some time. We would have had available to us, as counting time, the four minutes that are presently used for the ringing of the bells. counting could have started as soon as the ringing of the bells had been announced and the tellers appointed. Nevertheless, I am glad that they are prepared to try something. I guess they could not think of any reason for opposing that part of it that is being implemented. I just hope that, when we find that we can work with this reform, people might consider the whole reform package.",105
247,Mr FILING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"In speaking to these changes to the standing orders, I want to make a couple of observations. I might say that I support the introduction of electronic voting as a means of determining the will of the chamber. The honourable member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, the former Speaker, is quite right to push for the introduction of the electronic registration of the voting of members, because in fact that would be a liberating thing for the House. The member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) made an interesting observation, which was probably a reflection of the way in which he approaches the political process in this place; that was, to refer to crossing the floor as being a long walk or as somehow being considerably intimidating. Of course, it is. That is one of the reasons why some of these changes are going to cement the influence of the party discipline on the voting performance or the voting behaviour of members of this chamber. It is my view that it is in the interests of better representation for the citizens Australia from their members of parliament that we introduce electronic voting as soon as possible. It is my considered opinion that the physical act of crossing over from one side of the chamber to the other-often after a considerable amount of pressure and sometimes intimidation from colleagues not to do so-is of such considerable note that very few people actually do it. From the perspective of former colleagues in the Liberal Party, that '0 ppens much more often from the coalition side of politics than it does from the Labor Party side, which insists on their members signing a pledge not to do so-a pledge which I think is totally contradictory to the proper representation of their constituents. In fact with the introduction of electronic voting what would be of great interest to constituents would be being able to examine the voting record of their individual member so that when they came to an election they could actually see what their member had done as far as their voting was concerned. That would probably give constituents a far better guide to the performance of their individual member-to the way in which their member exercises his or her conscience on behalf of their constituents-than does the present situation where everybody, with the exception of the Independent members, votes according to the party lines. I also wanted to point out, I suppose in furtherance of this, that the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)-who I must say is much more mellow at this time than he was the last time we were talking about changes to standing orders-has been talking on a number of occasions about 'opposition parties'. I want to emphasise that that is a totally incorrect term. There is only one opposition party, and that is the Labor Party. The Independent members are non-government members of this House and are not considered to be part of the opposition. I wish to make some observations about a couple of these changes which we have agreed to support. The most significant of of those as far as Independent members are concerned is the change to the process where there is a minority of members on one side of the chamber who have called for a division. Under the circumstances that were being proposed, there were in fact going to be eight or fewer members, and that of course meant that the Independent members would have been in a position where they could not possibly have requested a fully counted division, which in my view is totally antidemocratic. Mrs Sullivan-How do you know?",106
248,Mr FILING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Moncrieff is secretly very much more parliamentary democratic than she gives the impression of being right at this moment. I would say that, in private, she would agree with me. Mr Quick-Come out of the closet.",106
249,Mr FILING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I was going to say that she is not a closet Democrat. I would thank the Manager of Opposition Business and his colleagues from the Labor Party, as well as the Leader of the House and others for agreeing to the compromise which does in fact allow for Independent members to call for a division-a fully counted division-when there are five Independents who are here to vote in the division on the minority side. I think that is an enhancement to the democratic process in this place, and I am pleased to see that that has been agreed to. I conclude by saying that one of the problems that an Independent member encounters coming into the chamber-perhaps after the one-minute division bell has been rung for a subsequent division-is to quickly ascertain the nature of the question that is being divided upon and to make a decision on how to vote. I am hoping that not only will the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker or whoever is present in the chair announce the question in the traditional terms but also that there will be provision for there to be a brief explanation of exactly what is occurring. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would well know, at times many members in this chamber come in here and vote without knowing exactly what they are voting for.  to make a very brief contribution. The opposition is supporting this proposition about the counting of divisions. I wanted to remind the House that there were higher standards being promised by the new government. This really is not an issue of higher standards, but rather an issue of productivity; that is, a speedier count. Unfortunately, the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has put no notice of changes to the standing orders on the Notice Paper which would reflect higher standards. I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a notice of motion of mine-it has now lapsed; I propose to put it back on the Notice Paper-proposes to put time limits on the asking and answering of questions, hopefully leading to higher standards. Another notice of motion seeks to create a new form of private member's business, that is, constituency statements; 20 from each side per week in the main chamber. In view of all the controversy about a certain Queensland senator, I propose that there should be a staffing and appropriations committee of this House. There is not one at the moment. Last but not least-and this is a notice of motion that I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be greatly interested in-I propose that when one of the Independents or opposition members moves dissent from your ruling there should be no gagging of the debate. In other words, your ruling should not be left undefended by the government. I would have thought that as a Deputy Speaker the greatest humiliation would be to make a ruling, have a motion of dissent moved and then have the government ruthlessly use their numbers to gag the debate and not allow the ruling to be defended. I do not oppose this proposition nor do my colleagues on this side of the House. I must say that after 12 months I do look forward with keen anticipation to the Leader of the House bringing forward new standing orders that would reflect the promises made to the people of Australia for higher standards in this House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

251,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (5.25 p.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of the committee for 1997 entitled Extension to the main runway at Adelaide International Airport. Ordered that the report be printed.",108
252,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed extension of the main runway at Adelaide International Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation, on behalf of the state and federal governments, proposes to construct a runway extension at Adelaide International Airport. This extension has been identified by the South Australian government as a priority infrastructure project. The development is supported by the Commonwealth. The runway extension will provide the opportunity for direct flights to Asian destinations. Direct flights are considered necessary for facilitating tourism and the export of produce and products from South Australia and thus the economic growth of the state. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $48 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. In arriving at this recommendation the committee took into account a number of factors. The current runway length of Adelaide international airport imposes payload constraints on departing wide bodied international aircraft. Under the existing arrangements-and this is a surprising statistic-more than half of the airfreight from South Australia is exported through other Australian airports. This penalises the state's export potential by reducing competitiveness due to higher transport costs, uncertainties in the timely delivery of goods and the possible reduction in the quality of perishable goods. The committee therefore concluded that there is a need to lengthen the runway to make full use of airfreight capacity, especially to Asian airports on existing flights, provide greater opportunity for direct export of South Australian products and enhance the development of international tourism to the state. Expert advice to the committee indicated Report that a runway length of 3,100 metres would be sufficient to accommodate full volumetric payloads on all types of aircraft in passenger configurations to all north Asian destinations under the worse planning conditions. This length is also sufficient to accommodate Boeing 747 freighter aircraft with full payloads to South-East Asian hubs and Boeing 747-400 freighters to Hong Kong with a 90 per cent payload. Extending the runway to 3,100 metres will require the runway to be extended by 572 metres. Of several alternatives examined, the preferred one is to extend the main runway by 572 metres to the south west. This extension will require the diversion of Tapleys Hill Road either around the extension or underneath it. The committee has recommended that of the four configurations examined, the short deviation is preferred. The extended runway will also require the relocation of the air navigational facilities and community recreation facilities. These include: installing new lights along the runway and taxiway; relocating navigational aids, the wind direction indicator and anemometer; increasing the capacity of the airport's power generation equipment; constructing new storm water drains, access roads and boundary fences; and reducing the height of obstacles at the end of the runway. The committee concluded that each component in the scope of the proposed works is directly related to the runway extension and can therefore be justified. The proposal has been well publicised and an environmental impact statement and a response document were prepared at ministerial direction. As a result of community concerns about the possibility of increased levels of aircraft noise arising from the runway extensions, especially to residents in the Glenelg North area, an enhanced aircraft noise monitoring study will be undertaken at the state's expense. This should allow noise readings to be assessed with precision and predictions of noise events from aircraft to be accurately forecast. It is worth noting that the phasing out of category 2 aircraft will reduce the current noise levels. When the results of this noise monitoring are dovetailed with the Australian noise exposure concept data, the committee recommends that consideration be given to noise amelioration for houses in Glenelg North. I commend the report to the House and thank the deputy chairman of the committee for his support in this particular study. Publications Committee",108
253,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEES,"I present the eighth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report have been circula- to honourable members in the chamber. .... : Report-'4>y leave-adopted. ;-J;-J;-'i;! . ADJOURNMENT ')f-lPEAICER...;.()rder! It being 5.30 p.m., I--the question: ThJtt the House do now adjourn.",109
254,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"Franklin) (5.30 p.m.)Tonight I wish to raise the issue of microcredit. For those unfamiliar with this word and the concept behind it, hopefully after this brief adjournment debate their appetite might be whetted and an interest generated. I am part of a word-wide movement participating in a herculean endeavour which has set itself the goal of getting micro-credit to 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially the women of those families, by the year 2005-in effect, providing 500 million people with the opportunity to lift themselves from the cycle of poverty they have faced all their lives. I recently attended an international microcredit summit in Washington DC, at which close to 2,000 representatives from almost all the countries in the world came together with this common purpose and goal. The United States First Lady, Hillary Clinton, President Fujimori of Peru, Queen Sophia of Spain, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Uganda and Professor Yunus of the Grameen Bank were some of the keynote speakers at this conference. Each of them challenged us to help exert the necessary political will in our country to assist with the attainment of the goal we have set ourselves. I would like to quote briefly from President Fujimori: I believe our countries' greatest chance to create wealth and progress lies in the drive and courage of our smallest entrepreneurs, those self made men and women who tum adversity into hope. Report Millions of citizens in our countries, of which Peru is but one example, have made what I call 'antscale investments.' Their small, even diminutive savings and earnings, have been invested in microbusiness and self-construction. Unemployment is a heavy burden for many countries around the globe. Micro-finance clearly shows that people can start their own jobs with loans as small as $80, $100, or $200. Queen Sophia said: The work of Professor Yunus, the Grameen Bank, is now twenty years old and a confirmed reality. Micro-credit The spirit of solidarity present in that first loan to a young girl in the village of Jobra, of a few dollars to buy bamboo for making chairs, has reached our times intact in its essence and multiplied in quantity, thus turning, as time passes, the use of credit into an impressive leverage of economic and social progress which has enabled the recovery of seemingly forgotten rights. Women are the great beneficiaries of this innovative project, being the recipients of 94% of the loans. Through self-employment, millions of feminine hands generate a great number of tasks which support the foundations of a widespread economic activity, to the advantage of their families and their identification as persons, by allowing them to control their own lives and to avoid being objects of charity. Determined and responsible, they manage a 98% return of the loans they receive. About 1.3 billion people live on $US 1 a day and 60 per cent of the world's population on $US2 a day. Every year 25 million more people are added to the file of the world's poor. Micro-credit, I believe, is the answer. I urge those in both houses of this parliament to make themselves aware of this wonderful concept and to convince the decision makers to include it in our forthcoming aid budget. I ask: where is your political will? Nursing Homes",109
255,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"I rise today to address the deliberate, disgraceful scare campaign being waged by those opposite against elderly residents over the government's proposed improvements to nursing home accommodation. In particular, I wish to refute a newspaper article appearing in the Sun Weekly today, 6 March, headed 'Elderly must sell homes for a bed'. This article went on to say that, according to the member for Shortland, Peter Morris-who I see is not even in the chamber-most older Australians will now be faced with selling their homes to get a nursing home bed. Since this article went to press, my office has been contacted by distressed elderly constituents who have needlessly been upset by it. The member for Shortland should hang his head in shame for being responsible for creating unnecessary and unfounded concern amongst my elderly constituents. It would be far better if the member acquainted himself with the facts and spent time representing the needs of his own electorate. Currently most nursing home residents have to share bedrooms and bathrooms with other people. Nearly 40 per cent of residents share a room of four or more beds. In some homes, major upgrading is needed just to meet government fire and safety standards. This is totally unacceptable. Older people have a right to expect good quality accommodation which allows them comfort, dignity and privacy. The member for Shortland has said that elderly residents will be forced to sell their family home to get care. Nothing could be further from the truth. At present around half of those people who own a home when they go into a nursing home choose to sell it. As most residents will stay in a nursing home for two or three years, this can be a sensible choice. But it will not suit everyone. They will have a wide choice of options and only they can decide which suits them best. The options they can choose from will have quite different effects on their pension, tax and nursing home daily fees. The government's regulations for accommodation bonds in nursing homes and hostels provide specific protections for the family home. If a spouse is living there, the home will be protected. That means it will not be counted as an asset. A person can only be asked to pay an accommodation bond if both the person concerned and their spouse have other assets over $45,000. If they have a carer or close family member who has been living in their home for at least five years, and who would qualify for a government pension or benefit, their home will also be protected. They can only be asked to pay an accommodation bond if they have other assets of over $22,500 for a single person. This means that if they cannot afford to pay an accommodation bond, they will still be able to get a place in a nursing home. The government will ensure that nursing homes and hostels take a set number of people who cannot afford to pay, and will pay a higher subsidy for them. Accommodation bonds, as they will be named, better reflect what they really are-a bond from which the provider can draw down a maximum of $2,600 per annum for a period not exceeding five years to a maximum of $13,000, with the balance to be refunded to the resident or their estate on departure. The government provides a number of special protections for residents. Concessional residents will not have to pay the bond. Nursing homes and hostels must take people who cannot pay a bond. People will not have to pay before they get a place in a nursing home. Nobody-I repeat: nobody-will be forced to sell their home. There will be measures in place to protect the residents' rights and look after their interests. Mr Tony Smith-You might have to say it in French; they won't believe you.",110
256,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"Yes. They just want to scare people. An accommodation bond is a bond which is arranged between the resident and the facility. The government takes no part of the bond. When a resident leaves, the bond is refunded to the resident or their estate, less the amount of $2,600 per year up to a maximum of $13,000. For those who choose to pay a bond, there will be a number of flexible payment options to choose from. People will be able to pay a bond as a lump sum, or an equivalent regular fortnightly or weekly payment, or a combination of both. The member for Shortland and members opposite should acquaint themselves with the true facts, which are outlined in the Department of Health and Family Services fact sheets on this subject, before he or any other member opposite embarks on another one of these disgraceful scare campaigns. International Women's Day",110
257,Ms ELLIS,COMMITTEES,"It is good to see the member for Roberston (Mr Lloyd), who has just spoken in the House. I do. no- recall seeing him at any time when I -- )--a speech in the adjournment -,-,l; hope he can stay and listen to what ll\-y,- t0say .. ,,,voplp,. lik,e to talk about International Women- s D-y; which is coming up in two day-,titne, on Sat-day, 8 March. In doing so, I would very much like to recall the display that I witnessed in this place today from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He gave us an amazing claim to success in relation to women's affairs. He made a great play about the number of women on his side of the House, which I have gone on record in the past as welcoming in general. But he used that as evidence of his or his Liberal government's commitment to women in this country and somehow used their numbers as a measure of success. There is a very famous quote-unfortunately at the moment I cannot recall the source of that quote, but it is an oft used one-which goes something like, 'The day that we have so many women in this place that we do not comment on it is the day that we have, in fact, as women succeeded.' I will remind the Prime Minister, particularly, of that quote the next time. I see, a day or two after a federal election, a parade of women pass the media cameras. I think it would be much better if we saw a parade of men as well. I was disappointed today to see this display put on in answer to a dorothy dix question from his own side. If the Prime Minister thinks that women are so important and so vital-with International Women's Day upon us-that he has to make those sorts of comments, why did he not give the subject the status it deserves and make a ministerial statement? Why just play around with a dorothy dix question? Let us really have a look for a moment at what this government has done and at policy decisions which I believe have impacted so dramatically on women and their families since this government came to power. There are a number of them, and I am sure I will not have the time to go through them all. The changes to education, the Austudy fiasco, the decline in university places and the changes to HECS-some of those things specifically and particularly will impact on women in a direct fashion and, in a lot of cases, on members of families where women, as we know, are the linchpin. The policies on equal pay and conditions and the current IR legislation are not in the best interests of women at all. Mrs Gash-Rubbish! Absolute rubbish!",111
258,Ms ELLIS,COMMITTEES,"And it is a woman on the other side objecting. It is horrifying. The Prime Minister today made reference to permanent part-time work as a saviour for women. What about giving some of the men the permanent part-time jobs? Child-care: take away $500 million over four years, watch the charges go up and then say that this is a good thing for the women of this country. Cuts to legal aid, family law, women, children, domestic violence-they are all subheadings which I don't really believe members of this House are unintelligent enough to think that I have to elaborate on. They are dramatic changes and they are not to the benefit of women and families. The Family Court increased general fees and introduced a fee of $40 per hour for counselling services. That is a terrific thing to do for women of this country! Migrant women: workplace English language programs abolished and a reduction in the numbers of DSS migration liaison officers-another really good initiative! Older women: higher fees for older women receiving care at home through HACC, despite a distinct promise that the government would maintain the funding growth established under Labor. Terrific! The Office of the Status of Women, where so much coordination and work was done on women's programs nationally: budget cuts, reduction in staff and funding for national women's programs thrown into chaos. Community services: cuts in special purpose payments to states and an impact on disabilities services, including accommodation. On a more personal note, I have had evidence of this myself. A member of my family who unfortunately is mentally and physically disabled is living in an institution-not in Canberra but elsewhere-where the budget for staffing has been cut in half. Some 24 of 45 staff have had to be made redundant. This is supposed to be fair for disability services and for the women involved in those families. This government has absolutely no right to claim success or to crow about what it has done for women and their families. I sincerely question the motives of the women opposite, who unfortunately have been counted in the votes when all of these decisions have been made. It is they who have to answer to their constituency and it is they who have to answer to the women of Australia. I ask them to think about it very seriously. Nuclear Waste Reprocessing",111
259,Mrs VALE,COMMITTEES,"I refer to the front page of yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, in which it was dramatically reported that the government is looking at putting a nuclear reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights. I say to the people of my electorate that the government is looking at several options in their consideration the idea of a waste reprocessing plant is but one of those options. To our government I say, clearly, that while the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) is looking at all the options available to us, the option of a nuclear waste reprocessing plant, which will expand and change the very function of ANSTO at Lucas Heights, is one that can be taken off the list of options here and now. My constituents will not accept this as a solution, and neither should they be expected to do so. Having said that, I want my government and the minister to know that I am here to help find a responsible and safe solution to this very real problem. I have lived in Sutherland Shire all my life. I went to school there and raised my children there. My own sons are now old boys from St Patricks College at Sutherland. This area is my home, but it is much more than that it is my heartland. I have lived there all my life, along with the people of the shire who are my neighbours and who are now also my constituents. I know the history of Lucas Heights. I was in fifth class at Star of the Sea, Miranda when it was built. Sutherland Shire was then orchards and chicken farms, and where the Gymea TAFE now stands there was a dairy farm. There were also vast tracts of uninhabited bushland on the western side of the Woronora River where Lucas Heights is located. I know also that, for 40 years, the ANSTO establishmellt at Lucas Heights not only has acted as a responsible corporate citizen but also produces medical radioisotopes, which are vital in the delivery of health services to the whole of the Australian community, and makes a valuable contribution in the areas of education and scientific research. And it is of practical support to the universities of Australia and to the corporate sectors that play a significant part in the Australian economy. The upside of this establishment is a good upside, and all are proud to share in its success. However, the downside is a downside like no other. It presents a conundrum which has to date been too hot to handle by previous governments, and most particularly by the last of this issue and Labor government. For the last 13 years, spent fuel rods-the unwanted by-product of the activity at Lucas Heights-have been gathering dust and waiting for a government to make some firm decisions that will incorporate a responsible nuclear policy for Australia and that will not only address the conundrum of the spent fuel rods but also address the fate of the present reactor. With the year 2003 being the deadline, our government is at last prepared to show the leadership required to make those tough decisions. Yesterday, I stood up with those on the other side of the House on the MPI, and I do not want my stand to be misinterpreted by anyone on either side of this House. I stood because this matter is of vital importance to me and to the people of Hughes; and I am here to stand up for my constituents. But I did not stand up to be against the Minister for Science and Technology, because I do support his commitment and his courage in tackling this most difficult issue which was put in the 'just too hot to handle' bucket by the previous government. I do not want to speak ill of others, but those on the other side would do well to beware of the wrath of a gentle woman. I cannot continue to sit and listen, as I did yesterday, IlSthey,entenained themselves and the,JIlation .with their own rosy view of their commitment to this matter and to hear them J)te-mho be concerned aoout us, the people of Hughes. What a load of humbug, hypocrisy and wishful history was presented here yesterday! . I, heard the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) lecture the Minister for Science and Technology that he had some hard decisions to make. Well, I could hardly believe my ears. For the last 13 years, my family and my neighbours in Hughes have been waiting for the Labor government to do just that-some hard decisions, some hard planning, some hard leadership perhaps, some guts perhaps, some real commitment to the people perhaps. For the last 13 years, they have sat fat on the treasury bench, constipated by their own inactivity, indecision and ineptitude on this issue. For the last 13 years, they've dumped on me and my family and my neighbours while we waited for a decisive leadership that never came. I often look across at that side of the from the place here where I sit, and I look upon a front row of real Labor heavies whom you would think could take on the world. But they dumped any sense of responsibility that they should have had for me, my family and my community-and for the 260,000 residents of Sutherland Shire. I think that they are only men of straw. They are all puff and whistle. For 13 years, the Labor government allowed-in silence and in negligence of its duty of care to the residents of my electorate-the dangerous build-up of spent nuclear fuel rods at Lucas Heights and made my home a de facto dump for nuclear waste. I will never forget this and neither will my constituents. The Labor Party has put us in the 'too hot to handle' bucket and they now stand before you and mouth off like selfrighteous prima donnas about the rights of the people of Hughes and they seek to lecture the minister on hard decisions that they could not make. Such a disgraceful and dishonest performance! So much for the big, tough front-rowers. They have tiptoed around this issue like a row of hairy-chested belly dancers. (Time expired) Member for Hughes Constitution Centenary Foundation Schools Convention",112
260,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"I used to play at the back of the scrum, so perhaps I can say a few words in response to the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). She does not live in her electorate. All that pious talk about her and her neighbours-they live outside the electorate of Hughes. She does not share for one moment the anguish of her constituents about an international airport and about a nuclear reprocessing plant. What next for the people of Hughes? Mining in the national park or confiscation of all private property? This is a member who has failed hand over fist to give any shred of decent representation to her electorate. No part of the country is being punished more by this government than the seat of Hughes: first, an international airport; then it is a nuclear reprocessing plant; and then a walking, talking apology of a House member who can do nothing more than defend the indefensible-from someone who does not even live in her electorate. She is a gross failure. For the people in Hughes who want to do something about the problem, there is one easy answer: vote her out at the earliest possible opportunity. Haying dispensed with that matter, let me tum to my concern which is of genuine interest to people in my electorate. My constituents are very concerned about a nuclear reprocessing plant through the south-west of Sydney, which would take the nuclear material all through those suburban areas. It is bad enough to have the airport noise, but now of course there is the real threat of nuclear accidents in our backyard. But this government is failing in other areas. I express my concern about the representative features of the Constitutional Centenary Foundation schools convention which has started in Canberra today. This is a convention that has been organised at some taxpayer expense to look at the Australian constitution through the eyes of school students. There have been 30 students selected from New South Wales. How many of them are from western and south-western Sydney, the great triangle of population from Parramatta to Penrith to Campbelltown? Zero. How many students are in that region as a proportion in New South Wales? About a quarter of the school students in New South Wales come from the western and south-western Sydney regions. How much representation do they get from the government's Constitutional Centenary Foundation? Absolutely zero. There is not one student selected from western or south-western Sydney to be sitting here in Canberra at some taxpayer expense talking about the future of their Australian constitution. Doesn't that send a bad signal for the government's approach to constitutional change via conventions? Is this the sort of representative feature that we will have from this elitist government for its constitutional convention later in 1997? There is no representation whatsoever from all the young people in western and southwestern Sydney at this schools convention. I go to their schools and I listen to these active young citizens talk about their interest in the Australian constitution. Their views are mainly in favour of the republic and other aspects of constitutional change. But why won't the Howard government give them a voice? Why is it that there are four representatives from the North Shore of Sydney to this schools constitutional convention? But from all the students in the western and southwestern suburbs of Sydney there is absolutely none. The reason, of course, lies in the elitism of this government-the elitism of a government where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) confiscates the best bit of public housing in Sydney, the only bit of public housing they support, Kirribilli House, for his private residence. A Prime Minister who does not need to take holidays at a resort because he lives in one. Mr Miles-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I object to the idea that the Prime Minister has confiscated Kirribilli House. I do not believe that is acceptable. He has not. I ask the member for Werriwa to withdraw.",113
261,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I thank the parliamentary secretary. The member for Werriwa.,114
262,Mr LA THAM,COMMITTEES,"That is not a point of order. He has confiscated Kirribilli House. It used to be a house for the purpose of entertaining visiting dignitaries but it is now the private residence of the Prime Minister. The point needs to be made that it reflects perfectly his elitism. No wonder you are sensitive about it. The view from Kirribilli-that is the reason we do not have fair representation for people in western and south-western Sydney. That is why this government can only provide international airports and nuclear reprocessing plants for the people of that region-because the Prime Minister is out of touch. Look at his recreational interests. They are opera and, when he turns up, cricket-but in the gentleman's mode; not a player, a gentleman. So you have the Sydney Opera House and going back to the W.G. Grace style of cricket as a form of entertainment. So it is KirribiIIi, gentleman's cricket and the opera-all this from someone who claims to be a man of the people. The Prime Minister is elitist to his bootstraps. This is an elitist out of touch government that is not giving proper representation to the people in my region. (Time expired) Debate interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Veteran Community",114
263,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence I would like to clarify a point I made in response to a question during question time from the member for Dawson. In pointing out the commitment of the member for LeichhardtMr Leo MCLeay-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Private members in this place get little enough time as it is without ministers coming in here to take up private members' time on the adjournment. If the minister could not get around to getting his speech done before the adjournment began and if the Chief Government Whip will not get up and defend his members, I will certainly get up here and defend the right of private members to speak on the adjournment debate. If the minister is going to be the person who gets the call, then that just says so much for what the government thinks of members who wish to participate in the adjournment debate. Maybe, Mr Speaker, you might take the same approach as you took this afternoon with the Leader of the Opposition, because I am sure you thought the minister was getting up to take a point of order, and if he was going to take a point of order, he could. If he was getting up to get the call, we certainly would have had someone jump in for the call long before any lazy minister got up to take up private members' time.",115
264,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I thank the honourable member for Watson. It is unusual, and I always place very special emphasis on the adjournment debate. The minister seeks to clarify information that he gave in the House hitherto, and it is in government time because there are enough government members in th(, House to seek the call and so the government is being penalised. Mr Leo MCLeay-I take a further point of order, Mr Speaker. If indeed you wish to facilitate the minister, who has obviously been lazy and has not got in here before half past five, my point of order is that the person who can facilitate him-and we would not object to that-is the minister, who could have the debate extended. Or, the minister could ask for the debate to be extended and say a word or two about something that someone else said and then he could put his words in on top of it. It would be a little bit irregular but it would solve the problem.",115
265,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"It is not appropriate to extend the adjournment, because the minister is clarifying an issue from a previous debate in the House today and not the adjournment. I encourage the minister to be brief.",115
266,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I just point out that the Hansard came through 10 minutes before the adjournment. In pointing out the commitment of the member for Leichhardt to the welfare of the Torres Strait Islanders, I pointed out that he was the first federal member to establish an office on Thursday Island. It was my intent to point out that he was the first federal member to establish an office staffed by a full-time electorate officer. I thank my members on this side of the House for their indulgence. NA Debate resumed. Small Business: Panel Beating",115
267,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I wanted to bring to the House's attention the plight of a small businessman in my electorate. First, I might say generally about the plight of small businessmen: let us hope that it is alleviated after Saturday week when the Soorley administration is removed from office, particularly with the imposts that they have delivered to small businesses with their outrageous signage costs. That has been an awful impost on small businesses in my electorate. So those businesses will be very keen to see the removal of the Soorley administration. I want to bring to the House's attention in particular the plight of a panel beater in my electorate. A person whose car had been damaged came to see him to obtain a quote for repairs. He gave the quote to the client, who had already been to see another panel beater, and the particular quote was the lowest quote. The panel beater asked the client whether it was okay if he arranged for an assessor to come and assess the particular damage and to see if the quote was in order. The client said that that would be all right, so he contacted Suncorp, one of the biggest banks-in fact, I think it is now the biggest bank in Queensland or it will be soon-as well as being the largest insurer. He rang Suncorp and a claims officer took details. Later an assessor called out, looked at the car and told my constituent, who is the proprietor of Dukes Smash Repairs, Mr Dodt, that the client did not want him, Mr Dodt, to repair the vehicle. Mr Dodt was a little bit suspicious of this and spoke to the client about this. It transpires that the assessor had told the client that he would not get a warranty if Mr Dodt repaired the vehicle. This was a totally outrageous situation because Mr Dodt in fact supplies two warranties when he does repairs. So this was simply not true. It was quite clear that the assessor was trying to persuade the client to take the car from Mr Dodt and have it repaired somewhere else. In reality, as result of the representations of the assessor acting on Suncorp's behalf, the vehicle was towed some 40 kilometres away from Mr Dodt's premises to some premises at Capalaba. In the towing process, he would have passed hundreds of other panelbeating shops-in particular, many in Brendale in my electorate, and many others in the electorate of Lilley and in the electorate of my friend from Petrie. The car was taken all the way to Capalaba to a quote that was not lower than the quote of Mr Dodt. It is quite clear after the work had been done at Capalaba that there were some unsatisfactory elements to that work and the client returned the vehicle to Mr Dodt. It is outrageous in my view that a large and prominent insurer should be involved in this way with an assessor to bring about this particular result. And this is not the first occasion. Previously, there have been problems with Suncorp issuing cheques in the name of clients rather than in the name of the proprietor himself.",115
268,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 6 p.m. the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until Tuesday, 18 March 1997 at 2 p.m. in accordance with the resolution agreed to at this sitting. House adjourned at 6 p.m. NA The following notices were given:  That the standing orders be amended by inserting the following standing order after standing order 145: Questions without notice-Time limits 145A. During question time: (a) the asking of each question may not exceed 1 minute and the answering of each question may not exceed 4 minutes; (b) the asking of each supplementary question may not exceed 1 minute and the answering of each supplementary question may not exceed 1 minute; and (c) the time taken to make and determine points of order is not be regarded as part of the time for questions and answers. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 6 February 1997: Migration Act--Statements (24) under section 417. Radiocommunications Act-Radiocommunications (Labelling) Determination 1997. The following answers to questions were circulated: Small Business: Statistical Questionnaires (Question No. 850) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) Has the Australian Bureau of Statistics altered the number of (a) questions or (b) forms that small businesses need to complete for statistical purposes; if so, what are the details. (2) How are small businesses defined for this purpose. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ABS has instituted measures to reduce both the number of questions and the number of forms that small businesses need to complete for several of its statistical collections. These measures are in response to the announcement by the Prime Minister in May 1996, when establishing the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, that the ABS had "". . . guaranteed to reduce the cost to small business of completing statistical returns by 20 per cent. .. "". Specifically, in reference to (a), the number of questions has been significantly reduced for the following surveys: Agricultural Census-The number of data items for the 1996-97 Census has been reduced by approximately 25 per cent for all farm businesses. Some 150,000 farm businesses receive an annual Agricultural Census form. Of these, about 135,000 are small businesses. Survey of Tourist Accommodation-This survey covers around 10,000 businesses each quarter. Of these, approximately 90 per cent are small businesses. From the September quarter 1997, no employment data will be sought and hotels and motels will no longer be required to report guest arrivals. In reference to (b), the number of forms has been significantly reduced for the following surveys: Manufacturing Survey-The number of small businesses required to complete the detailed questionnaire has been reduced from around 3,000 in 1994-95 to about 1,300 for the 1995-96 survey. Additionally, questions asked in 1994-95 on details of materials used have been omitted from the 1995-96 survey for small businesses. NA Survey of Employee Earnings and Hours-In future, this survey, which covers around 9,000 businesses (of which about 3,200 are small businesses) will be conducted on a biennial rather than annual basis. Growth and Performance Survey-For the 1995-96 survey, being undertaken this year, the size of the survey will be reduced from 13,000 to 6,300 businesses. The sample of small businesses will be reduced from about 7,900 to about 3,400 businesses. Freight Movements Survey-This quarterly survey, which usually covers around 4,000 businesses, has been cancelled for 1996-97 pending a review of methodology. A large proportion of these businesses were small. Building Activity Survey-For this survey of building jobs, the actual sample varies over time, depending on the nature of building activity occurring. The sample size for jobs which are new houses, or alterations and additions to residential buildings, has been reduced by 7 per cent from the December quarter 1996 onwards. This reduction will reduce the reporting load on all residential building businesses, many of which are small. (2) Small businesses are defined as those employing less than 20 employees, except for Agriculture. Agricultural small businesses are defined as those with an Estimated Value of Agricultural Operations of less than $400,000. Interest Rates (Question No. 905)  on 5 November 1996: (1) Does his Department monitor interest rates paid to depositors by financial institutions. (2) Is he able to say which offer deposit interest rates of (a) 5% and (b) 7% per annum; if so, what types of accounts do those institutions offer persons subject to the deeming rules applied by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reports average deposit rates in its monthly Bulletin. (2)(a) and (b) The pension deeming arrangements encourage pensioners to maximise the retum on their savings/investments. In that regard pensioners have access to the full range of deposits and investments on offer from financial institutions and are advised to spread their investments to maximise their return within their personal acceptable levels of risk. A number of financial institutions currently offer, at call, 'Deeming Accounts' to recipients of age and veterans' pensions. While the exact details vary between institutions, generally rates of up to 5 per cent per annum have been offered on those accounts, where the balance is up to $30,000, and up to 7 per cent per annum where the balance in the account exceeds $30,000. The Government recently announced that, in line with recent falls in official interest rates, pension deeming rates would be reduced to 4 per cent on the first $30,000 of a single pensioner's financial investments ($50,000 for a pensioner couple) and 6 per cent on balances over those amounts with effect from 23 January 1997. It is likely that financial institutions will reduce the rates of interest on their at call 'Deeming Accounts' in line with the reduction in pension deeming rates. Second Sydney Airport: Environmental Impact Statement (Question No. 909)  and Regional Development, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) Did he announce the new environmental impact statement for Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek; if so, when. 8 October South West Sydney Community Alliance 9 October Sutherland Shire Environment Centre 14 October Fairfield Council (meeting with staff) 17 October Georges River Environmental Alliance 21 October B1axland and Environs 25 October Georges River Catchment Management Centre) 25 October Liverpool Council 26 October National Parks Association 7 November Macarthur Regional Organisation 8 November Western Sydney Regional Organisation staff) 8 November Sutherland Council (meeting with bers) 9 November Community Group Forum-Penrith groups in the Badgerys 9 November Community Group Forum-Sutherland groups in the Holsworthy (2) Was a commitment given for community consultation; if so, what consultation (a) has occurred and (b) will occur. (3) Have times and venues been proposed for consultations; if so, what are the details. (4) What will be the form of the consultation. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government decided in May 1996 that the environmental assessment process for the second major Sydney airport would be broadened to include Holsworthy as well as Badgerys Creek. While Badgerys Creek remains the Government's preferred site, subject to a favourable outcome of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the Holsworthy Military Area is being considered as a possible alternative. (2) The Government is committed to ensuring that the EIS responds to community concerns. This is to be achieved through an open and transparent consultation program. The EIS consultants, Rust PPK, are undertaking a widespread consultation program, which has so far included the distribution of some 300,000 newsletters, fact sheets and fliers to households in areas near the proposed sites at Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy, the establishment of a toll-free telephone information line (1800 818017), the establishment of a community access centre at 43 Moore Street, Liverpool, and an internet site. (a) Up to and including 31 January 1997, the following direct consultations have been conducted: Airport Resistance (Bankstown Library) Committee (Chipping Norton Neighbourhood (meeting with staff, Council Chambers) Macarthur Branch (Campbelltown City Art Gallery) of Councils (meeting with strategic planning staff) of Councils (meeting with strategic planning elected representatives and staff) (Council Cham(meeting with representatives of anti-airport Creek area) (Penrith Council Chambers) (meeting with representatives of anti-airport area) (Sutherland Returned Services Club) 14 November NSW Environment Protection Agency 18 November Wollondilly Council (meeting 20 November Holsworthy Precinct Committee 21 November South West Sydney Community (Reves by Workers Club) 22 November Helensburgh Community 23 November Information Day (Lucas 27 November Hurstville Council (meeting with elected 28 November Mobile Display (Roselands Shopping Centre) 28 November Coalition of Airport Action Groups, Annandale 30 November Mobile Display (Mt Druitt Market Town) 2,3,4 DecemHolsworthy Range Tours (guided three ber groups in the Holsworthy area) List of groups Wedderburn Community Association; Stanwell Park; Oatley flora and South West Sydney Community Blaxland and Environs Airport Resistance; land Shire; Sutherland Shire Residents Environmental Alliance; 3 December Campbelltown Council (meeting 4 December Fairfield Council (meeting with elected 4 December Fairfield Residents Against 5 December Community Group Forum-Penrith groups in the Badgerys 7 December Mobile Display (Penrith Plaza Shopping Centre) 7 December Information Day Kemps 9 December Environment Groups Briefing (NSW St) 9 December Lugamo Progress Association (St public meeting) 9 December Camden Council (meeting with elected Chambers) 10 December Blue Mountains Community 12 December Bankstown Council (meeting 12 December Fairfield Law Society 14 December Mobile Display (Parramatta 14 December Community Group Forum-Sutherland groups in the Holsworthy 16 December Information Day, plus Question 16 December Blacktown Council (meeting with bers) 17 December Badgerys Creek Progress 18 December Macarthur Anti-Airport 19 December Community Development Officers affected Councils) (Second 19 December Blue Mountains Council (Council Chambers) 19 December Mobile Display (Miranda 4 January Mobile Display (Fairfield Forum Centre Court) 9 January Mobile Display (Hurstville, 16 January Mobile Display 18 January Mobile Display (Menai with elected representatives and staff) (public meeting-Wattle Grove Community Centre) Alliance (public meeting-Bankstown division) Meeting (Helensburgh Community Centre) Heights Community School Hall) representatives and staff) (Council Chambers) hour tours for representatives of anti-airport participating in the Range Tours: Campbelltown Airport Protest Group; Friends of Fauna; Darkes Forest; Lugarno Progress Association; Alliance-Bankstown and Holsworthy Divisions; Combined Residents Precincts of SutherAgainst Holsworthy Airport; Georges River No Holsworthy Airport Action Group with elected representatives and staff) representatives and staff) (Council Chambers) Aircraft Noise (Council Chambers) (meeting with representatives of anti-airport Creek area) (Penrith Council Chambers) Creek (Kemps Creek Community School) Nature Conservation Council Offices, 39 George Stephens Church Hall, Old Forest Rd, Lugamo, representatives and staff) (Camden Council Forum (Springwood Neighbourhood Centre) with elected representatives and staff) (Sunnybrook Community Centre) Westfield Shopping Town) (meeting with representatives of anti-airport area) (Sandy Point Community Centre) and Answer session (Ingleburn Community Centre) elected representatives and staff) (Council ChamAssociation (Badgerys Creek Hall) Group (Art Gallery, Camden Civic Centre) Workshop (Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy Sydney Airport Community Access Centre) Fair Fresh Foods Market) Westfield Shopping Centre) (Bankstown Square Shopping Centre) Community Centre, Allison Crescent) 18 January Mobile Display (St Clair Shopping Centre) 18 January Mobile Display (Narellan Town Centre) 23 January Mobile Display (Stocklands 25 January Mobile Display (Menai 25 January Mobile Display (The 28 January Information, and Question and St Helens Park) (b) An intensive schedule of meetings, mobile displays and community access days is planned to continue throughout the EIS process.

(3) See response to question 2(b), above. (4) See response to question 2(b), above. Fels, Mr Alan (Question No. 929) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 November 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to media reports that the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Mr Alan Fels, will be a guest speaker at a fundraising event organised by the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party on 26 November 1996. (2) Does the Government apply guidelines to ensure the impartiality of public servants politics; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) has he drawn the guidelines to Mr Fels' attention. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Professor Allan Fels was one of 6 outside speakers at the seminar on Working with the Howard Government held on 26 November 1996. The seminar was supported by the Victorian Employer Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Institute of Management, the Property Council of Australia, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Australian Hotels Association, the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Insurance Council of Australia, the Private Hospitals Association of Victoria and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. As may be verified from the list of speeches made by Professor Fels since November 1995 and set out on pages 314 and 315 of the Commission's 1995-96 Annual Report, Professor Fels is an active speaker at conferences involving associations of the type listed above. Professor Fels' speech to the seminar was titled Competition Policy: Recent Developments. The speech addressed the nature and Merrylands, Mcfarlane St, Merrylands) Community Centre, Allison Crescent) Valley Plaza, Wilson Rd, Hinchinbrook) Answer Session (St Helens Park Hall, Kellerman Ave, implementation of the national competition policy package agreed at the April 1995 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments and then discussed a number of misconceptions which have developed about the Commission's activities. The Government does apply guidelines covering participation in political activities. The most recent guidelines were promulgated in 1995 by the then Public Service Commission and Professor Fels is aware of their existence. Australian Securities Commission: Interviews (Question No. 1000) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: . What powers do Australian Securities Commission interviewers have and how is evidence obtained from those interviewers used. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourfrom party able member's question is as follows: I am advised by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) that ASC investigators may at any time receive voluntary information or statements from any person who wishes to provide such information on any matter involving the management or affairs of a company, securities or futures contracts. In addition, Part 3 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (the ASC Act) sets out compulsory information-gathering powers that may be exercised as part of an examination of persons by the ASC in the course of an investigation. Those powers include the power to require a person to give all reasonable assistance in connection with an investigation and to appear before a member or staff member of the ASC for examination on oath and to answer questions. I am also advised by the ASC that evidence obtained by the ASC pursuant to an examination under Part 3 of the ASC Act may be used for a variety of purposes related to the enforcement of the law, includingas part of a report prepared by the ASC under section 17 of the ASC Act about an investigation, to set out the material on which the ASC's findings about the matters investigated are based; in the prosecution of criminal offences; and in civil proceedings (for example, the seeking of an injunction to stop a continuing breach of the Corporations Law). 'Hand up' Briefs (Question No. 1003) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon virologist. notice, on 3 December 1996. (1) Is it a requirement under the Corporations Law to provide a copy of the ""hand-up"" brief to the defence. (2) Under what circumstances does the defence have to request the ""hand-up"" brief, either orally in writing. (3) How soon after the summonses are served should a ""hand-up"" brief be made available. (4) Under what circumstances can a trial comstandards meJtU' bdore a magistrate or judge without ""hand-up"" brief being provided to the defence. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourbIrds able member's question is as follows: I am advised that the Corporations Law does make specific provision for prosecution procedures of the kind referred to in the question. Rather, prosecution procedure for an alleged offence against provisions of the Corporations Law is determined under the laws of the relevant State Territory in which the matter or offence is prosseas. ecuted; and the relevant Court procedures are deterconfirmatory mined with reference to the Rules of the various Courts in which the matters are prosecuted. The laws of the States and Territories may differ from each other in certain respects on these procedural matters. Importation of Cooked Chicken Meat (Question No. 1076) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 10 December 1996: (1) Does the importation of cooked chicken meat pose a threat for the spread of Newcastle disease to tourist institutions such as the Featherdale Wildlife Park in the electoral division of Greenway. (2) How are organisations protected from diseases which may be imported in cooked chicken meat. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) No, the quarantine assessment by the AustralIan Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, has carefully considered the risk of Newcastle disease - ecoming established in the Australian pOUltry mdustry and in the native bird population through the importation of cooked chicken meat. AQIS bases its quarantine decisions on thorough scientific assessment of the risk of introduction of pests and diseases. AQIS conclusions are supported by independent experts including most of the state veterinary authorities, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, the Bureau of Resource Sciences and Dr Dennis Alexander, a renowned international AQIS considers that a decision under the Quarantine Act to permit the importation of cooked chicken meat for human consumption, subject to proposed specified strict conditions, would present a negligible level of risk of introduction of exotic Newcastle disease virus to either commercial or wild birds in Australia and therefore to tourist or destinations such as the Featherdale Wildlife Park in the electoral division of Greenway. (2) AQIS is developing strict import protocols for cooked chicken meat. These include meeting set by AQIS for foreign poultry slaughter a and processing plants to obtain AQIS approval before commencing export to Australia. AQIS will - uire ante mortem and post mortem inspection of by veterinary authorities in exporting countries to ensure clinically healthy birds are used. not AQIS also will require plants to meet comparable standards of construction and hygiene to those the found at Australian poultry plants. The conditions proposed by AQIS are similar to but more conservative than conditions applied to the extensive or range of Australian food products exported overIn addition AQIS is also commissioning final tests to demonstrate that the proposed conditions will reliably inactivate Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus (the most heat resistant avian pathogen of concern) if present in chicken meat. The import requirements proposed by AQIS will reliably protect the environment avian industry and Australian consumers from risk of disease introduction with imported cooked chicken meat. St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne (Question No. 1102) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Will funding for the $lm pledged by the Prime Minister for the restoration of Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral come from the budget of the Minister's Department or from a special allocation. (2) From which program and in which financial year will the funds be sourced. (3) Was the Minister consulted on the decision; if so, when. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Funding responsibility is with the Department of Communications and the Arts. (2) The grant will be made from the Heritage Properties Restoration Program in 1996-97. (3) The Minister was consulted in October 1996. Telstra Employees: Electoral Division of (Question No. 1162) Mr Anthony asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: How many persons were (a) employed or (b) contracted by Telstra (i) in the electoral division of Richmond, (ii) in Lismore and the Gold Coast and (iii) on the NSW Far North Coast (A) on 1 January 1996, (B) in 1990 and (C) in 1983. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra has advised that its staff reporting systems are set up to service the company's internal reporting requirements. Telstra is therefore only able to provide estimates of full-time staffing numbers as at 1 January 1997. Additionally, Telstra's records of contract staff do not allow a break-up of numbers on a geographical basis. Having regard to the above, Telstra has provided the following full-time staff estimates as at 1 January 1997: (i) Electorate of Richmond-l66 (ii) Lismore-336 Gold Coast-902 (iii) NSW Far North Coast (Lismore & Electorate of Richmond)-502 Migration Regulation 211 (Question No. 1224) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: What provision will he make for those persons disadvantaged by the disallowance of parts of Migration Regulation 211, specifically, the requirement to lodge an Assurance of Support for subclass 100 visa (spouse). Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No special provision will be made as no-one has been disadvantaged by the disallowance of parts of Statutory Rule No 211 on 7 November 1996 by the Senate, specifically, the measures designed to widen application of the existing Assurance of Support scheme across most Preferential Family visa classes including Spouse (Migrant)(Subclass 100) visas. All decisions which had been made applying the disallowed regulations from 1 October 1996 to Richmond midnight 6 November 1996 are valid. Applications lodged prior to 7 November 1996, which were undecided on that date, must be decided on the basis of the regulations in effect on 30 September 1996 plus the regulations which were not disallowed by the Senate. Wella Weir Project Funding (Question No. 1225) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Which of the requirements laid down as a condition of Commonwealth Government funding for the Walla Weir project (a) had and (b) had not been met by the Queensland Government prior to the first sod being turned on 10 December 1996. (2) Are long term studies of both the lungfish and the Elseya tortoise under way; if not (a) when are they expected to begin and (b) who will undertake the studies. (3) Has the development process for the long term management plan to ensure the survival of the lungfish begun; if not, when will it begin; if so, when will it be completed. (4) Has a water allocation and management plan been completed; if not, when will it be completed. (5) Has an examination of the fish lock for Walla Weir been undertaken; if not, when will this occur. (6) What is the process and time line for the development of an environmental management implementation plan which will specify the environmental conditions for the operation of the weir. (7) Is it essential that the studies and plans are completed before the weir is completed and operating. (8) What mechanisms is the Minister able to use to ensure the conditions the Minister laid down are met properly by the Queensland Government. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I have been advised that, following receipt of advice from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 26 November 1996 that Commonwealth funding support had been approved, the Queensland Department of Natural Resources made a commitment to comply with all the recommendations laid down as approval coriditions by the Commonwealth, and set about making arrangements for the required baseline studies to be put in place. These studies will be completed prior to interference with natural river flows by the weir, expected in late 1997. (2)(a) The long term studies for the lungfish and Elseya tortoise are expected to be undertaken immediately following the baseline studies for the preconstruction and construction phases of Walla Weir. This is consistent with the outcomes of Dr Keith Boardman's independent review and my recommendations on the proposal. (b) The studies for the lungfish will been by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (Fisheries). The Elseya tortoise studies will be conducted by the Queensland Department of Environment (3) My Department has received advice from the Queensland Government indicating that the long term management plan for the lungfish in the Burnett River will be developed from the baseline studies, and from further studies to be conducted over at least the next three years. (4) The Water Allocation and Management Plan process for the Burnett River system has been given the highest priority in response to the Commonwealth recommendations laid down as approval conditions for Walla Weir. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources will be coordinating the development of the Plan during 1997/98. The study area will include the Burnett River, Kolan River and Isis River catchments. (5) The Queensland Department of Natural Resources has advised that detailed structural design has been completed for the proposed fishlock, and that the design will allow modifications to be made, if necessary, to the operational regime to ensure efficient operation of the fishlock system. Similar existing fishlocks are currently being monitored to help determine the best operating regime. (6) The environmental management implementation plan for the operation of the weir will be based upon the results of the studies recommended by myself and the Queensland Department of Environment. The plan will be continuously refined during the operational phase in response to feedback from monitoring programs. (7) Baseline data studies are required prior to flow regulation, expected in late 1997. I have also recommended long term studies on the lungfish and Elseya tortoise, to address cumulative effects of existing and future proposals on the Burnett River, and these will be ongoing. (8) Commonwealth funding support for the project has been approved subject to the requirement that the conditions recommended by myself be included as environmental and land management requirements in the Implementation Arrangement for the project. The Implementation Arrangement sets out all conditions under which the project will proceed and will be signed by the project proponents and the Queensland Government. Telstra Employees: Electoral Division of Greenway (Question No. 1267) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the undertak- Arts, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) Are Telstra staff numbers to be reduced by 11 000 positions nationally; if so, what will be the effect on Telstra staff within the electoral division of Greenway. (2) Will clients within the electoral division of Greenway be required by Telstra to use a recorded message inquiry system; if so, what assistance will be provided to elderly persons to enable them to use a system requiring them to choose numbers via touch phones for particular services. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Telstra plans to reduce employment numbers nationally by around 22,000 between June 1996 and June 1999. These staff reductions reflect the need to reduce costs to make Telstra more efficient as the telecommunications market becomes more competitive in line with the Government's reforms to the industry. I am advised by Telstra that its planning is undertaken on a functional rather than a geographical basis and it therefore cannot currently advise on the affect on Greenway of its national employment reductions. Any resultant reductions in Telstra's activities in the Greenway electorate would only be made to improve the overall efficiency and competitiveness of Telstra' s operations, consistent with its business planning objectives. (2) Whilst Telstra has conducted a trial of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to answer customer calls, no decision has yet been made to introduce such technology on a national basis. I am advised that in the design of its IVR System, Telstra would make provision for the special needs of the elderly or handicapped. For example, if a caller chooses not to follow the suggested prompts on an IVR system, the call will be automatically transferred to an operator. Public Telephone Sites (Question No. 1271) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) How many public telephones are located in the suburbs of Berala and Regents Park, NSW. (2) At how many sites are the telephones distributed. (3) What is the greatest distance between any two telephones. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Telstra has advised that it has 9 public payphones in the suburb of Berala and 7 public payphones in the suburb of Regents Park. (2) Telstra has advised that the payphones are located at 8 sites in the suburb of Berala and 6 sites in the suburb of Regents Park. (3) Telstra has advised that whilst its records not contain geographic references to permit calculation of distances between payphones, the following are the locations of Telstra's public payphones for Berala and Regents Park: BERALA Clarke Street, cnr Park Road Crawford Street, cnr Woodburn Road Woodburn Road, Railway Station Woodburn Road, outside the post office Woodburn Road, outside the post office Berala Shopping Centre Nottinghill Road, cnr Georges Avenue Shop 3, 28 Campbell Street Chadwick Street, cnr Kibo Road REGENTS PARK Park Road, outside Railway Station Park Road, Railway Station platform 2 Park Road, Railway Station platform 2 Stores Depot. RAAF No.2 Amy Street, cnr Yukka Street Amy Street, cnr Edwin Street Waller Road near Renee Rural Australia: Internet Access (Question No. 1290) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: What plans are in place to provide access to the Internet for rural Australians at a comparable quality and price to city areas. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Commonwealth Government recognises the importance of ensuring that areas outside capital cities participate in and benefit from the opportunities offered by access to new telecommunications services. The Commonwealth Government has put in place a number of initiatives that will enhance the development of, and access to, online infrastructure and services in non-metropolitan Australia. The Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (RTIF) will provide $250m funding over five years to community initiated communications projects, which demonstrate a benefit to people in regional and rural Australia. The program will address both equity and economic objectives. On equity grounds, the Government considers that people in rural and regional areas should have the do opportunity to access appropriate communications services at reasonable cost and on a similar basis toÂ· metropolitan users. On economic grounds, improved telecommunications infrastructure and services can stimulate economic activity, boost employment and assist in the provision of education, training, health and other government services. The Minister for Communications and the Arts will appoint a Board to oversee the operations of the fund. It is anticipated that the Board will be announced within the next month, call for applications in the first half of this year, and that the first round of grants will be made in the second half of the year. The Online Public Access Initiative (OPAl) has been established by the Commonwealth Government and $2 million was provided in the 1996-97 Budget for projects which enhance public access to online services. OPAl will provide grants to eligible non-profit organisations (such as public libraries or similar community groups, or local and state government bodies on behalf of such community groups) in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Projects which will enhance community access to online services in rural and remote communities are, however, a priority for the program. Approximately 20 projects across Australia, at an average of $100 000 per project, are expected to receive funding. The program was advertised nationally in January and early February and project proposals were due by 28 February 1997. There has been widespread interest, particularly from rural and regional areas. In addition to these new programs, the Information Policy Advisory Council (IP AC) has formed a special working group to investigate online infrastructure and services development in regional and rural Australia. The IPAC working group is considering the policy options available to the Government for promoting the development of infrastructure and information services in nonmetropolitan Australia, and will report to the Government in March 1997. As part of its investigation, the working group is conducting an assessment of the current level of regional and rural online development, which will include an overview of prices and affordability. The Government established the Standard Telephone Service Review to investigate the continuing appropriateness of service levels under the universal service arrangements. The review has recommended options for upgrading the actual services accessible under the universal service obligation, including a recommendation by the majority of the review that, by the year 2000 a digital data capability should be reasonably sible to all Australians on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. The Government will assess the recommendations, including gauging demand for services to be provided over lines with digital data capability in rural areas. While these are significant initiatives, they cannot provide solutions to all of rural Australia's communications needs. In the longer term funding for the majority of communications infrastructure and services to metropolitan and rural consumers can only come from the private sector. The post1997 telecommunications arrangements will assist this process and encourage the private sector to provide regional telecommunications services by opening rural markets to competitive pressures. The introduction of competition and the associated provision of new technology solutions in rural areas (eg. satellite services), offers the greatest potential to eliminate the distance based quality/cost differential between rural and metropolitan areas. Department of Administrative Services: ANAO report (Question No. 1300) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 12 February 1997: Did the Australian National Audit Office in its audit report of his Department's financial management systems recommend the adoption of uniform systems in his Department's programs; if so, what progress has been made. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable acces- member's question is as follows: The Australian national Audit Office Audit Report No. 19 1996-97, titled ""Results of the 199596 Financial Statements Audits of Commonwealth Entities"", at page 53 under 'Other Matters' states as one of the additional findings requiring management attention: ""the need for uniform financial management information systems and chart of account structures for all Budget-funded business units."" A new chart of accounts is being introduced with the implementation of a uniform financial management system (Finance 1) for all budget-funded business units. This system will be operational from 1 July 1997.",116
