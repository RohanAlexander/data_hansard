(2) What international bodies and other countries were represented at the meeting. (3) What is the timetable for adoption and ratification of the Convention. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the second meeting of governmental experts to consider the Draft Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (Paris, 19-24 April 1999), Australia was represented by: Mr Matthew Peek, Permanent Delegate to NA Mr Arthur Spyrou, Deputy Permanent Delegate to NA Dr Claus Dirnberger, First Secretary, Australian Embassy, Bonn Ms Kirsti Samuels, Adviser, Permanent Delegation to UNESCO Mr Graeme Henderson, Director, Western Australian Maritime Museum (2) The following Member States of UNESCO were in attendance: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Cametoon, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Republic of Korea, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Namibia, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, PhilipNA pines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent & The Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Heritage Syria, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Venezuela.

(3) There is, as yet, no timetable for adoption and ratification of the Convention given that states are still some way from achieving a final text. The April 1999 meeting agreed that negotiations would continue in 2000, but did not set a date when they would take place. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Airline Movements (Question No. 888) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 26 August 1999: Further to the answer to question No 448 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 5103), what percentage of over the water flights could be achieved by utilising a combination of mode 4 and mode 2 of the long term operating plan. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has advised that using a combination of Mode 2 and Mode 4 is unlikely to increase the percentage of over the water flights. This is because both modes have the same projected availability due to wind. Additionally Mode 2 involves landings over Kurnell Village and departures overflying residential areas of Sutherland. Avoidance of departures overflying Sutherland would require reduced lateral separation and the likely increased weather minima that would then apply would reduce the availability of the mode. National Health and Medical Research Council: Research Funding (Question No. 889) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 26 August 1999: What portion of the funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council is allocated to (a) hepatitis C and (b) HIV research.",156

Some hepatitis C research is included in the HIV/AIDS figure but it is not possible to identify specific amounts; and (b) a total of $5.194 million has been allocated to HIVIAIDS research in 1999, $4.64 million being provided by Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases (ANCARD).
