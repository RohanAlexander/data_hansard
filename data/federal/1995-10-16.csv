2,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"Â·On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled Procedures for the opening of parliament, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"The ceremonial for the opening of the Australian parliament adopted in 1901 followed closely the traditions and historic symbolism of the United Kingdom parliament. This was entirely natural at the time, and very appropriate. Since that time the procedures of both houses of the parliament have changed considerably. Perhaps because they happen so infrequently, the procedures for the opening of parliaments have not been updated. Members here have all had experience of what these procedures consist of. They involve three separate processions of members from the chamber of the House, twice to the Senate chamber and once to the Great Hall, and three processions of members back to this chamber. Central in my memory, certainly, is the toing and froing between this chamber and the Senate chamber. I do not think I am completely alone in thinking that the symbolism involved here has perhaps become lost to those participating and, no doubt, to a great many observers. On each occasion it is the members of the House who are requested, indeed summonsed, to go to the Senate chamber. This reflects the inferior position of the House of Commons hundreds of years ago in respect of the King and the nobility of England. This is also said to reflect the ancient tradition, symbolising the independence of the House from the Crown, that the King or Queen, or in our case the Governor General, should not enter the chamber of the lower house-the House of Commons, the house of the people. Of course, the last monarch to do this, King Charles I, later had his head cut off by the parliament. I am sure the Governor General would not be in similar dangers nowadaysalthough I am not sure, Mr Speaker, because immediately preceding that particular event, Report which I am sure Charles I regretted, Charles I had attempted to enter the House of Commons and arrest three of its members. He did not know who they were or what they looked like, so he asked the Speaker to identify them for him. The Speaker chose not to do so, as I am sure, Sir, you would emulate if the Governor General were to enter this chamber and seek to have you assist him in identifying people who should not be identified by the Speaker. The committee considers that the present arrangements for the opening of parliament are far too complex. In this report we have put forward a set of proposals aimed at simplifying the proceedings while retaining the dignity, the ceremony and the sense of occasion which the event warrants. Key elements of the traditional procedures have been retained. The recommended changes reflect the special nature of Australia's parliamentary structure. The first main proposal concerns the ceremony of the opening itself, traditionally carried out by a deputy of the Governor General in the Senate chamber. The committee recommends that the parliament be opened simultaneously by a deputy in each chamber. The committee's advice is that there is no legal or constitutional impediment to this happening. The second main proposal concerns the presentation of the newly elected Speaker to the Governor General. The committee considers that a separate ceremony is unnecessary and disruptive to the flow of proceedings and it recommends that it be discontinued. The committee's third major recommendation is that consultation take place between the houses and with the Governor General with a view to agreement on an alternative venue for the Governor General's opening speech. Our preference would be for the Great Hall of the parliament. The Great Hall is a place designed for ceremonial functionsindeed the place where the Queen herself formally opened this parliament. It is a neutral place exactly between the two houses. What more, Mr Speaker, could symbolise the independence and equality of the two houses? The committee's other proposals concern the elections of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. The committee proposes that the most senior backbench member, instead of the Clerk, take the chair of the House during the election of the Speaker. Finally, we propose that the election of the Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker take place immediately following the election of the Speaker rather than separately later in the day. Very few of the recommendations in this report are new. Indeed, some of them have been made by the committee on several occasions. What the committee has done here is to present a coherent program for the opening day of the next parliament. I draw members' attention in particular to page 4 of the report, which shows the committee's proposed program in diagrammatic form. There is only one procession of members to the Great Hall. This is balanced by an equivalent procession of senators. (Extension of time granted) Some of the changes will need fairly minor amendments to the standing orders. However, what will be mainly involved will be a process of consultation and agreement between the two houses and with the Governor General. Now is the time to begin these consultations if the changes are to take effect for the opening of the next parliament. The committee believes that its recommendations would simplify the opening day arrangements in a way that would enhance the dignity of the occasion. I commend the report to the House. Mr Speaker, I appreciate your reference of that question to the committee. I would like to express my appreciation for the assistance of the secretary of the committee, Ms Robyn Webber, and her colleague Alex Lyle.",11
4,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I was interested to note what the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said about the fact that there are not that many openings of parliament. So it does not happen all that often. This is the 37th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, so we have had only 37 openings in 94 years. So perhaps it is appropriate that we may consider-and, after all, these are only recommendationsmaking some changes. I know that there are some members of this place who do not agree with, for instance, the abolition of the procession from here to the Senate. The honourable member for Charlton will recall that during our deliberations in the Standing Committee on Procedure I was of that opinion, but his smooth tongue and sophistry convinced me that perhaps the way to go would be to have both houses assembled in the Great Hall so that we would be there together and both proceed. It is very important that the dignity of parliament is maintained. If you look at the people's appreciation of the dignity of parliament at present, I think their verdict would be very poor. It is important that we do anything we can to maintain the traditions and the dignity of this parliament. That does not mean that we cannot have changes. We are not seeking change just for the sake of change but change that we believe will accommodate a more representative way of the parliament functioning. The recommendations are not new. The Procedure Committee, of which the honourable member for Charlton is chairman, has had a chequered career. It has not always had a great deal of attention paid to its reports. In fact, it is my understanding that the report of this committee presented to the parliament in 1986 still has not been responded to. Of course, the honourable member for Charlton was not chairman then. Had he been, he would have insisted on getting some response before now. Perhaps the 1987 election intervened and stopped it coming. But that just indicates that the Procedure Committee, while a vital and important part of the organisation of this chamber, does not always get the result that it desires. The most outstanding thing happened with the Procedure Committee chaired by the Hon. Neal Blewett when we put forward the recommendations for changing the sitting hours. Eventually, they were accepted and we did away with the stupidity of sitting until 11 o'clock every night and now rise at the much more civilised time of 8 p.m. Mr Speaker, in the report there is a recommendation, which certainly affects you and subsequent Speakers, dealing with the election of the Speaker himself or herself, as the case may be. This recommendation, which was put forward in earlier reports, is that the Clerk of the House of Representatives should not take the chair during the election of the Speaker because, as we understand it, there is some constitutional query about the validity of doing that. The Clerk is responsible for the procedure of electing the Speaker. The proposal of the committee is that the senior member of the House-not being a leader or deputy leader, minister or assistant minister, nor a party whip, but the longest serving member apart from any of those-should be appointed to conduct the election of the Speaker. We believe this is significant because, by allowing a member to preside and by specifying the range of his or her powers, we avoid the problems that could arise by placing the Clerk in a difficult position and by putting the House in a potentially vulnerable situation where the Clerk is having to do two jobs. The Clerk is free to conduct any ballots required. We believe that elections of the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker should proceed immediately after the election of the Speaker. That would be entirely appropriate, for the reason that the standing orders require a single ballot to elect both the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. Although this procedure would add a little time, should other recommendations be adopted that time would be available. In conclusion, I just want to say that it is vitally important that the dignity of the parliament be maintained and that we all work together beyond the recommendations of this report. All members in this place should do their darnedest to make sure that we function in a more harmonious, dignified and civil way, thereby earning the people's respect, of which we are a bit short at the moment.",12
5,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has not quite expired but I do not think there are any other speakers. Does the chairman wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,13
6,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks, if necessary, later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Debate resumed from 25 September, on motion by Mr Richard Evans: That this house: (1) acknowledges that attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a medical condition rather than a behavioural disorder; (2) expresses concern at the limited resources with federal and State government funding dealing specifically with ADD; (3) notes that an unreasonably large percentage of the community is affected by the medical condition ADD; (4) expresses concern at the ongoing social ramifications of ADD and the inadequate response of policy makers to cope with the condition; (5) expresses concern at the lack of specific funding within special education expenditure for children suffering ADD; and (6) calls upon the Government to review education expenditure with the intention to improve resources available to adequately address the needs of children suffering ADD. (Quorum formed)  all for coming to hear my speech. I am pleased to support this motion by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on attention deficit disorder as it deserves much greater attention than this government has given it; and the community is very concerned about it. ADD has been known and linked to the nervous system since the early 1940s but, in the 50 years since that time, little progress has been made in its diagnosis and treatment or in tackling the associated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADD is now recognised as a medical grow condition rather than a behavioural disorder. It is an immaturity of parts of the brain combined with a lack of production of sec-ndary dopamine and can often be hereditary. The effects of this disorder are a combination many variables: concentration problems; short attention span; poor short-term memory; impulsive, silly and often dangerous iour; and, with ADHD, hyperactivity. The problems for attention deficit disorder sufferers do not stop there, for the effects result in many further problems that can affect the ADD sufferer long after they have grown out of the disorder. The ADD sufferers' problems are compounded by secondary effects such as learning disabilities in reading, writing, spelling and organisational skills; muscle coordination; underachievement; low self-esteem; social difficulties; and often general lack of ability to plan forward, resullooking ting in their life being controlled by momenHospitals tary circumstances. When discussing attention deficit disorder, it is important to note just how many people have been afflicted with the condition. It is tors. estimated that between five and 20 per cent of people in Australia suffer from ADD. The difficulties of diagnosis make an exact figure difficult to reach. The majority of those ledge identified are male, with a ratio of about to one. However, females with ADD tend to be less aggressive than males, making it even harder to detect. The problems of detection are not only with females but across the board. The variety of combinations in which ADD can manifest and the fact that its effects of-en vary in severity with the type of activity being undertaken and the amount of distractions present make detection extremely diffiexamined cult. About 50 per cent of children grow out of this disorder as they reach adulthood. For those who continue with ADD, life can be extremely challenging. To cope in a child's world with ADD is bad enough, but to cope in an adult's world with ADD and its effects can be devastating. There is strong evidence of chronic alcoholism and drug abuse amongst adult sufferers-and even some teenage sufferers. The lucky ones who do out of the disorder still must enter their adult life underprepared, living with the often legacy of ADD's secondary effects. The effects are often reinforced through habIt and are extremely difficult for individuof as to break. As we can see, ADD can have significant social ramifications that can affect sufferers and their friends and families behavthroughout their lives. So what can the government do to help ADD sufferers? Firstly, the government needs to recognise the problem of ADD over a range of portfolios, including health, children's services, employment, welfare and education. Sufferers need to be identified at an early stage to allow for treatment and counselling. There needs to be awareness that ADD is a problem that also affects adults. The financial status of families needs to be a examined to see that the additional costs of after a child with ADD are being met. and universities need to be supplied with funding to examine and conduct research so that Australians can learn more about ADD. There have to be stronger communication ties between parents, teachers and docCommunity awareness of the problem of ADD must be raised, along with the know that there is help available for sufferers. nine Teachers and parents need to be kept informed about the present treatments. Counselling must be made available for adults who still suffer, or have suffered, from ADD. Students' progress must be monitored to make sure that it is increasing at a steady rate, with programs made available for those students who do not respond to standard treatments. It is imperative that these considerations be for ADD sufferers so they can live full, productive and balanced lives. A positive course of action is the only way we can have an effect on the problems that this disorder is causing in our community. Today's motion spells out just some of the issues that we need to tackle to ease the burden of attention deficit disorder.",13
7,Ms DEAHM,ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion because I think it is an important one. Having read the Hansard of the last debate and having heard the honourable member for  siderable disagreement about some of the issues around this problem. There is no doubt whatsoever that all members in this placeand I think most people in the communityregard it as a serious issue and one that needs to be looked at. The extent of the problem of people suffering from ADD or ADHD, as it is sometimes also called, varies a great deal. The Department of Human Services and Health estimate that between one and 10 per cent of people are suffering. The honourable member for Sturt has quoted other figures. The great variation is principally due to the problems with diagnosis. Across the medical professions a method has not yet been agreed by which it can be adequately and precisely diagnosed. I think that is one of the problems. I wish to speak about a woman in my electorate, Ms Fay Cooper, who runs the local ADD support group. She told me that, of every 10 children she sees, she estimates that about three of them genuinely have ADD. She says that the other seven may have some other mental health problem or intellectual disability or be reacting to family stresses as she puts it, just need a kick in the backside. I think it is a tag we are now putting on a lot of problems and, inevitably, some of the people who genuinely suffer from this will be looked at inappropriately. I use as an example RSI, repetitive strain injury, which came up some years ago and, currently, CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome. They are problems that are not easy to diagnose. The consequence has been that genuine sufferers have often fered the ignominy of being called ers or having some other problem. The sooner we can get a precise diagnosis the better it will be, because we will then have an adequate idea of what the problem is and what is needed to counter it. Whether it is medical or behavioural is an issue that notice there is considerable disagreement about. However, as yet, no organic abnormalia ty in brain structure or function has been found in people with ADD and, therefore, is not possible to definitely establish that it is a medical condition at present. With that in mind, it is foolish to categorise it one way or the other. We know that in certain cases medication is useful and effective. It may be long term or short term. I know of cases of people in my electorate where short-term medication as well as other therapy has certainly improved the situation. However, we know that in other states no medication is recommended. Children there are given other therapies, counselling and other treatment, which is also successful. So it is one of the dilemmas we have, and we obviously need to address it. Irrespective of whether the government is making an adequate response-it is alleged in the motion that this is not so-we ought to know that the National Health and Medical Research Council recognises ADD or ADHD as a priority public health issue. In response to that, a working party has been set up to address some of the issues. These issues are appropriate methods of diagnosis and management, the efficacy of long-term safety of stimulant drugs and the efficacy of non-drug methods of management, particularly of preschool and school age children as well as of adolescents and adults. These also include or, the consideration of cost effectiveness. Because the members of the NHMRC have experience in both the education and clinical management of children, this is a strong way forward. The motion also criticises educational facilities for these children. We have to acknowledge that most of this responsibility lies with the states. But the federal governsufment does provide supplements for special malingereducation for these people. In closing, I pay tribute to some of the parents in my electorate who are working very closely with their own children in giving them extra tutoring and self-confidence and in spending time with them. It is very difficult. I It seems to me that one of the most effective treatments-it has been acknowledged-is on one-to-one basis, be it between a teacher and a child or a parent and a child. The it parents should have our support and sympathy. I pay tribute to the ones who are doing such a marvellous job with their children.",14
8,Mr CAMERON,ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,"Stirling) (12.57 p.m.)Attention deficit disorder is a syndrome affecting children, adolescents and adults alike, as other speakers on this matter have said. It is characterised by learning and behavioural disabilities. The symptoms of attention deficit disorder, or ADD, include impairment in perception, conceptualisation, language, memory and motor skills; decreased attention span; increased impulsivity and emotional lability; and usually, but not always, hyperactivity. ADD is apparently 10 times more prevalent in boys than in girls. It may result from genetic factors, biochemical irregularities or peri-natal or postnatal injury or disease. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for ADD. Symptoms often subside or disappear with time. Previous speakers on this motion have mentioned the fact that five per cent of children have been diagnosed with ADD. That is a significant number, which is certainly cause for very serious concern. This motion seeks to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem and instigate government action to do something about it-that goes without saying. The first part of the motion urges the House to acknowledge that ADD is a medical condition rather than a behavioural disorder. ADD is certainly a behavioural disorder. Whether it is also medical is by the bye. Irrespective of whether it is medical or behavioural, the fact is that ADD is a major problem. Parents of children and adolescents with ADD are faced with enormous challenges and often rue waking up each morning knowing the battle they are faced with day in and day out. ADD is treated with medication. I note that there has been an increase of 13,000 children taking amphetamines to treat ADD in the last four years. I understand one cause is that, because behaviour is not something that can be easily measured and the symptoms of ADD can vary so greatly, it is often diagnosed in children for the sake of determining the reasons a child has behavioural problems. On Four Corners in February this year, Professor Frank Oberklaid of the Royal Children's Hospital said of ADD: Many of us are concemed about the alacrity with which some parents have suddenly discovered the solution to all their children's problems and that is putting the child on medication. He went on: I think the medical profession and the psychology profession are confused. I think that's the nature of the area, that there are no firm conclusions, that the prevalence of ADD could be one per cent, five per cent, 10 per cent-it really depends on where you draw the line. While it is evident ADD exists and is a problem for many parents, it is obvious that more research needs to be done to look into this matter so that doctors and psychologists have the latest research available to assist them in diagnosing it in children. I would like to see this sort of research done and a look given to addressing the symptoms so that we are not overdosing our children on drugs they do not need to be taking. I also think the ramifications of ADD on our children's education needs to be considered. I heartily endorse the sentiments of the motion which express concern about the lack of funding for special education and the need for resources to address the needs of children with ADD. A report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare entitled Australia's health: 1994 would encapsulate ADD within the definition of 'disability'. The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines people with disabilities as those who have conditions lasting for six months or more and those include slowness at learning or understanding, long-term treatment for nerves or an emotional condition, or being on long-term treatment or medication. The report stated that 3.2 per cent of children aged nought to 14 suffered mental disorders and 3.3 per cent of people 15 to 29 suffered mental disorders. The report did not comment on or allude to attention deficit disorder per se; however, I imagine many children would fall within the definition of 'mental disabilities'. It does highlight, however, that more research needs to be undertaken into the condition of attention deficit disorder. The issue of children's health-I am not ignoring the fact that ADD affects adults-is important to us all. We must ensure everything is done to ensure our kids grow up and are educated under the best possible conditions. That can be done only if we fully and properly research these conditions so children and others with ADD are properly diagnosed and treated.",16
9,Mr HORNE,ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,"I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). ADD is a major health problem in the community which has been ignored or, even worse, compounded by all governments in Australia. Attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactive disorder are major problems. This disease results in children, teenagers and even adults suffering from, as its name states, a lack of concentration and disruptive/childish and aggressive tendencies, but most damaging are the antisocial effects that these disorders have on society and the sufferer. ADD and ADHD result in people suffering from hyperactivity, immaturity, silly behaviour and restlessness and poor social skills. There is also a possible genetic tendency to alcohol or substance abuse. These two factors combine to place extreme pressure on sufferers, their families and their environments. Attention deficit disorder is a learning disorder, while attention deficit hyperactive disorder is a behavioural problem. At present, neurometrix is the primary form of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Neurometrix is an effective treatment, but it is also expensive. Neurometrix has been taken off the Medicare benefits list following a report by the Australian College of Paediatrics claiming that the process 'does not have a place in the investigational management of attention deficit disorder and that at best a research tool'. This flies in the face of sufferers and their families who have seen the positive results. The decision to label neurometrix as a research tool and not as a useful method of treating ADD and ADHD may need to be reconsidered and more detailed studies may need to be carried out. Not only are sufferers disadvantaged in this matter but they are also denied pharmaceutical board status acceptance of ritalin. Ritalin is by far the most effective drug in treating both of these disorders but is not present on the PBDS list. Ritalin can be purchased at a cost of $35 per bottle. If several children and an adult from one family suffer from ADD-that is not uncommon-the cost to that family can be prohibitive. The alternative drug, dexamphetamine, has a larger number of side effects and a lower success rate. It may be the case that a federal acceptance of the PBDS status of ritalin is the only way to make this drug available to all sufferers at a reasonable cost. The next problem is the lack of respite care available for sufferers and their families. Children with other mental and/or physical disabilities have access to respite care in hospitals and specialist centres. No provision at all is given to assist ADD and ADHD sufferers in the form of aides or counselling centres. In the Maitland area, part of my electorate, there are no child psychiatry services and there is a five-month wait to see a paediatrician. In nearby Newcastle, there is an l8-month wait for child psychology services and a two-year wait for the one full time child psychiatrist. That is not acceptable to the families, to the parents, of these children. The problem is real, yet following the Fahey government's handling of the state affairs of New South Wales the health problems in this area have increased. It is time the federal government stepped in and put things right because at present the wait is far too long, the services too inefficient. The final problem is that of schools understanding and being equipped to deal with the special needs of these sufferers. Some teachers in some schools refuse to dispense medication to students, which means that ADD it is sufferers cannot be administered ritalin or dexamphetamine during the school day. The maximum time that ritalin is active is four hours, so obviously children need this medication during the day. When teachers do agree to administer the medication, the school as a whole benefits by the improved behavioural patterns of those students who suffer from this problem. The teachers also receive the obvious benefits. These are the sorts of problems that must be addressed by the working party that has been set up by the federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). I certainly look forward to constructive, positive results from that working committee.",17
10,Mr TUCKEY,ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,"I am entering this debate on attention deficit disorder in the hope of avoiding another quorum. I am quite pleased to do so as it is an issue that I have, firstly, had to deal with over a number of years in terms of constituent problems and, secondly, I have observed it at quite close hand within our extended family. It is a problem that is raising a large number of concerns in the community, and these are directed in many different ways. One of my constituents drew an example of this problem to my attention. Her husband suffered from attention deficit disorder and had gone through his youth as being just one of those naughty boys-the problem had not been properly diagnosed. The fact is that, genetically, his daughter is now affected. This woman contacted me because she could obtain ritalin to assist her daughter with her problem but it was not available to her husband. Western Australian law provides that ritalin cannot be prescribed to people over the age of 13. I met this fellow, a farmer, on one occasion when he attended a conference at which I was speaking and he said, 'I've had to pinch one of my daughter's pills to come here so that I could benefit from what was being said at this conference by just being able to concentrate.' Concentration is one of the fundamental issues. A lot of the so-called problems that arise from bad behaviour in children are associated with lack of concentration. When they are in a school environment, or things of that nature, they suddenly become quite naughty, but they have just lost concentration. In closing, we must look more closely to the remedial situation as compared with the pharmaceutical situation. I am not saying either is not appropriate but I do believe we are probably taking the easy solution of prescribing when we are going to have to fund remedial teaching and remedial support in these particular areas.",18
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA,18
12,Mr BRADFORD,EUTHANASIA,"I ask leave of the House to amend the notice of motion standing in my name by omitting from paragraph 2 the words 'in all circumstances'. I do so because the possibility exists for paragraph 2 of the motion, as it appears on the Notice Paper, to be interpreted as extending to the removal of life support systems by medical staff whereas the intent of my motion is directed at active medical intervention to effect euthanasia. The elimination of the words I have suggested will remove any ambiguity. Leave granted.",18
13,Mr BRADFORD,EUTHANASIA,"I move notice of motion No.1, as amended, as follows: That the House: (1) deplores recent moves within Australia and elsewhere to sanction medically assisted euthanasia; (2) affirms its commitment to recognition of the sanctity of human life and to the need for its preservation; and (3) calls on the Government to introduce legislation which will prevail over any State or Territory law condoning medically-assisted termination of human life. I have put this motion on the Notice Paper because I believe there needs to be a national response on this important issue. It is too important an issue to be proceeded with on a state by state basis. For me, philosophically, that is not something I would normally want to put forward as a proposition; but, as I say, on this particular issue I feel very strongly that there needs to be a national response. Already people are planning to relocate to the Northern Territory in order to die. This relocation would be occurring at a time when such people should not face dislocation from familiar surroundings, friends and family. It has even been suggested that we have-in fact, we are developing because of this-a new industry: euthanasia tourism. I do not think that should be allowed to occur. This is one of the important issues of our time. The direction our country takes on this issue will define the sort of country we are and the one that we will become. New South Wales Labor MP Paul O'Grady has said that voluntary euthanasia is 'a question of basic human rights'. I pose the question in the House today: is it? The question should be better phrased: do we have the right as individuals to be put to death? Of course, the answer depends on one's view of human life and that is why it is not only a complex issue but also, for us as a society, a defining issue. Are human beings morally autonomous, answerable only to themselves and thus free to do as they wish with their own lives or is this an illusion? Are we really as individuals in our society autonomous? I believe the answer to that question is no. As individuals in our society we are interdependent with each other. We all live in a web of relationships and our actions as individuals have consequences inevitably in all sorts of respects for other individuals. No-one is autonomous in our society. To condone the deliberate killing of the most vulnerable is potentially to risk the status of all human life in our society. Ultimately those who claim to be autonomousand there are some in our society who claim that status; the proud and the strong in particular-will, by insisting on having their way, further disadvantage the poor and weak who will have less than ideal treatment options open to them, as they already do in our system, and these people will be susceptible to emotional coercion. These people will feel that they have a duty to die in certain circumstances. Worse still, it may well become a matter of economic expediency which denies optimal palliative care to all people, regardless of their age or economic or social circumstances. I believe it is impossible to enact legal safeguards to protect the vulnerable. This has clearly been the case in Holland. The experience in Holland is no doubt the only example we have in the world today of euthanasia. The experience there is subject to different interpretations. I believe that the experience in Holland proves that it is impossible to enact legal safeguards. The fact that the Northern Territory legislation has so far not proceeded has given rise to real concerns about whether there are adequate safeguards within that legislation. To some extent the debate on euthanasia represents a clash between the secular and the Christian, or ludaeo-Christian, view of man: humans are not animals and that terminally ill patients should not be compassionately put down, as some people who espouse this cause would say. It may well be that, at this stage of the debate, public opinion actually favours euthanasia-some of the research I have seen shows that that may be the case-but I believe that this will change with time as more people are fully aware of the implications of what is being proposed. Hopefully this debate in the House of Representatives will serve to better inform people about what the implications of support for euthanasia are for us as a society now and in the future. I believe that all of the arguments in favour of euthanasia could be adequately countered. I do not intend, in the short time available to me, to go into all of them. No doubt others speaking in this debate will put forward arguments in favour of and against euthanasia. Having read quite a bit and talked to numerous doctors about this, I would like to say that, for example, the issue that painful death is an argument for euthanasia is clearly wrong. That is an argument for better palliative care, which is available in the vast majority of cases to people with terminal illness. An important factor at this stage of the debate is public education. It is vital. I think so far it has been, in many respects, the missing ingredient in this debate. With the greatest respect to the people who may be listening to this debate outside parliament and inside parliament today, I believe that when people are properly educated about the pros and cons of euthanasia they will change their minds, particularly those who are superficially enamoured of this particular cause. As I said at the outset, I believe that this is one of the important issues of our time because of the impact it has on our society. Those promoting the cause of euthanasia must answer certain questions. Do we want to empower our doctors to kill, bearing in mind that that would be a complete reversal of their current roles and the roles for which they have been trained? Are we going to become a society where it is harder to get permission to add a room to a house than it is to get permission to take someone's life? Are we to reverse one of society's most basic laws: we should not kill one another? If so-and that is in part what the argument is about-the impact will be immense and cannot and will not be limited to the individuals involved. Finally, the experience of Nazi Germany should not be overlooked-and I do not invoke this lightly. The consciences of a whole society were numbed when the practices of euthanasia became accepted and widely practised. Even those doctors involved were motivated initially by compassion. Voluntary euthanasia leads to involuntary euthanasia. As a nation we must say a resounding no to this practice. It should be the primary intent of the laws of this nation to sustain and enhance life, not to destroy it. Mr Abbott-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",18
14,Mr MARTYN EVANS,EUTHANASIA,"I am sure that the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has raised these matters before the House today with a deep sense of personal commitment. As someone who has had the opportunity to participate in debates on this matter for some time now, I understand that all those who participate in this kind of debate do so with a very real and conscious belief in the issues which they put before their respective parliaments or in the public debating arena. It is a matter on which this parliament, and I am sure the parliaments at state and territory level in this country, will need to spend a reasonable amount of time over the next few years in order to ensure that a very wide public debate is held. Euthanasia is a vital issue to the community at large which ultimately touches all of our lives. In my experience as a state minister for health in South Australia and prior to that as a member of a backbench select committee of the House of Assembly which related to the law and practice of death and dying, I have spent at least the last five years looking very closely at this topic. The select committee was established in the state parliament of South Australia back in 1990 on the motion at the time of the Hon. Jennifer Cashmore, who is a former Liberal health minister in the Tonkin government in South Australia. I supported the establishment of that committee on a bipartisan basis. It was established with seven members of the House of Assembly who reflected all shades of political opinion and, I might say, all shades of moral opinion. The committee spent several years investigating this topic and took a great deal of public evidence throughout the state of South Australia. That was a very valuable part of the process. The committee spent nearly two years gathering evidence and discussing the issue with a wide range of people. The committee went so far as to publish an interim report which canvassed many of the matters which had been brought before the committee and set out a number of draft recommendations on these issues. Another substantial period of public debate was allowed to follow based on the views which the committee had already been able to gather from the public and the tentative conclusions which members of the committee had been able to reach. One of the very important conclusions of that committee was that we did not support any move towards legalised euthanasia in the South Australian community. All members of the committee were unanimous in their view that this would not be an appropriate step to take and that it would not be a relevant recommendation for to us make. Although, as the honourable member for MCPherson says, opinion polls do reflect a majority in favour of euthanasia, it was the committee's view that the community had not moved to the point where it was actually ready to accept that in legislation. There is a significant difference, as the honourable member said, between merely canvassing the options and actually having a bill enacted into law where one then has to confront the many difficulties which that puts before us. He raised a number of those issues. Certainly, the committee's considered view was that we should not proceed down that track. The committee certainly did have a very strong view about palliative care, the autonomy of the patient and the need to ensure that a patient's autonomy is reflected in the kind of medical treatment which he or she receives. If I had any criticism of the honourable member's speech, it was in his failure to incorporate that element of the patient's wishes in this regard. That is by far the most paramount matter to be taken into account. While the committee did not support medically assisted euthanasia, it certainly understood that people wanted to be in a position to control their own destiny, that an individual's right to accept medical treatment or to refuse medical treatment where that was relevant is paramount in these considerations and that society should not set aside the individual's wishes. It is also true that society must strive to provide the best possible standards of medical and palliative care for all people. People a terminal illness have a right to lay claim our medical and technological resources to ensure that they die with appropriate dignity and free from pain and all other forms of discomfort in that regard in so far as medical technology can achieve that kind of outcome. I think people have every right to insist-if necessary, through a medical agent or a medical power of attorney-that their wishes are carried out. In most cases, people often slip into a coma or into some state of lapsed consciousness, and they are not able to express their own wishes as clearly as they might otherwise like to do. Therefore, the committee recommended-and the South Australian parliament has subsequently enacted a Medical Consent and Palliative Care Act-that people be able to appoint medical powers of attorney with expressed conditions set out in that power of attorney to ensure their wishes at the time of their death are taken into account. That attorney's power can also be more wide ranging. It can ensure that a person who has moved through life with the person about whom the power of attorney is operative is able to put forward wishes on behalf of that patient. Because of the way in which medical technology changes and because of the way in which our own attitudes to these things change as we move through life, it is vital that we are not locked into a bureaucratic document which we may have drawn up years before at a different time of our life and in different prevailing medical and community standards. Therefore, the power of attorney can also be left open to ensure that the person you entrust with this very serious task is able to make contemporary decisions on your behalf in the event that you are not able to make them for yourself. That includes the right to refuse all forms of treatment. Whilst we may not accept that there is a case for medically assisted death in the sense that the practitioner deliberately seeks to bring about an end to life, that is quite different from a patient who wishes to refuse heroic forms of treatment which may in fact degrade their own quality of life and which may be quite against their wishes. It is essential that with any legislation incorporates that paramount to right of a patient to refuse any form of treatment that they may wish, even though that treatment may sustain their life albeit temporarily. I think that is a critical aspect. I believe it was appropriate that the honourable member sought leave of the House to delete the words 'in all circumstances' from his motion. That would have given it a character which I would have found implicitly unacceptable. It would have prevented people from exercising the right to refuse treatment and heroic measures which they did not want. From my investigations as a member of that select committee-and those investigations were quite extensive-I believe that medical technology has now moved to a point where no patient need die in pain or discomfort. There are many other symptoms apart from absolute pain-be they sickness or other that forms of distressing medical symptomswhich cause enormous distress to patients and which are to be deplored as equally as pain. Medical technology must be employed to the maximum extent to ensure that people are free from those kinds of conditions-even where a trade-off is incurred. In my own electorate, for example, Fauldings is very prominent in producing slow release morphine, which is able to assist patients in this condition enormously by ensuring that they receive a very slow and steady release of morphine into their bloodstream, thereby mitigating pain but also potentially shortening their life. Drugs like that suppress respiration and can potentially shorten the life of a patient. Under the kind of motion introduced by the honourable member for MCPherson, it would have been very difficult to administer those kinds of pain killing drugs where the doctor knew that the double effect of the drug-the unintended consequence but a well-known consequence-would be to shorten the life the patient even though the desired effect to reduce pain and discomfort. The act which was introduced in South Australia as a result of the select committee's recommendations clearly acknowledges the principle of double effect. It says that a medical practitioner incurs no civil or criminal liability where acts in accordance with proper standards of sive. palliative care, which are determined from time to time by the profession and the community, and with the wish to enhance the quality of the patient's life and to ensure that the patient is free from pain and discomfort. That is the critical aspect: the intention of practitioner in administering that kind of medication even where it shortens life. Fundamentally, I support the right of the states to proceed in these matters of community standards, moral standards and mediourselves: cal standards. They are areas in which the states have the primary constitutional role. I think it is important that different shades of opinion be brought forward in the states and be properly examined and debated in the community. Then our society as a whole can move forward on the basis of the best recommendations which the various states in their patient dies? autonomous parliaments can put before the community. This is an area where we need some diversity of opinion and diversity of thought. We need the best will in the world from all parties of the political spectrum to ensure that patients are able to exercise their autonomy, are able to die with dignity and are able to die free from pain. (Time expired)",20
15,Mr ABBOTT,EUTHANASIA,"I would be distressed if this and other parliaments are to spend too much time debating this matter over the next few years. Surely we have better things to do with ourselves as a nation than to consider ways of making killing legal. We have to get this straight: euthanasia is not about the right to die; it is about the right to kill. Euthanasia is not about turning off life support systems-something which is perfectly legal at the present time. Euthanasia is about allowing doctors to inject patients in ways that will kill them. It is perfectly reasonable not to keep alive of people who would otherwise be dead. But it was is perfectly unreasonable to kill people who would otherwise be alive. It seems to me that this push for euthanasia could easily be characterised as the ultimate act of economic rationalism-an insensate desire to put a price on human life and to say that human lives can he be ended when treatment becomes too expenThe end of life is always tragic. Even those who die peacefully in their sleep leave behind grieving and desolate relatives. But those who die in pain in hospital die in a suffering the which is exceeded often only by the suffering of their families-and that suffering cannot be soothed by any drug. The proponents of euthanasia say that it offers a painless way out. But we have to ask whose pain are we really trying to ease? Is it the pain of the patient, who is already on pain relieving drugs? Is it the pain of the relatives, which no drug can reduce? Is it the pain of a patient, who is probably already on heavy doses of morphine and other pain killing drugs? Or is it the pain of the relatives, whose pain can only end when the Supporters of euthanasia usually cite some personal experience to justify their attitude. I can understand this because there is nothing more sapping, more miserable, more heart rending than watching a loved one die. There is nothing more likely to reduce someone to a rage of impotence than to watch someone who is close die. To see a strong man reduced to a dribbling, moaning husk is the most tragic thing that anyone can endure; it is a tragedy. And yet since when has killing people been a way out of human tragedy? I can understand their position because at this very moment my own grandfather is in a nursing home. He cannot speak. He will not eat. He is strapped into a chair. His days are a torment to him and an agony to his family. And yet I assert the principle that human beings are not dogs to be put down as soon as they begin to suffer. I refuse to genuflect to any public opinion which says that euthanasia is the easy way out. I refuse to genuflect to an uninformed public opinion that is sometimes only too ready to take the soft option. In the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory we have laws or proposed laws to validate euthanasia in some shape or form. What these laws are doing is saying that human life can be traded away. We have to understand what they are doing: they are saying that we can trade away human life. We cannot trade away-according to many people in this chamber-our sick leave or our family leave. But,according to these laws, we can trade away human life-and what a perverse moral universe we live in, if this is so. This legislation in the Northern Territory and the proposed legislation in the ACT are giving doctors the power to end human life. If we cannot trust bosses to be fair to their employees, if we cannot trust the police to do the right thing by the people they arrest, if we cannot trust politicians to tell the truth, how can we trust doctors to do the right thing in all circumstances and in every way in a matter like this? I have the greatest respect for the medical profession. But, if the medical profession cannot be entirely trusted in the small matter of money-not to overservice, not to rip off Medicare-how can we entirely trust them in the greatest matter of all: the right to end human life itself? My friend and colleague the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned the example of Germany in the 1930s. I believe that there is a vast moral gulf which separates modem Australia from Nazi Germany. But can we be so sure that, under pressure over time, we will not slide down the same slippery slope. We only have to look at the abortion situation in this country. When abortion was in effect made legal, it was supposed to happen only when the physical or mental health of the mother was threatened; yet we all know-let us not fool ourselvesthat there is now abortion on demand in this country. Something that was supposed to happen only in rare circumstances is now happening to the extent of 80,000 abortions a year in Australia. I would like to quote from a letter written by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society; I am not quoting from a prejudiced source. This letter cited an official survey of deaths involving medical decisions at the end of life in the Netherlands that was undertaken for that country's Remmelink Commission. The letter states: In brief, the study found that about 38% of all deaths, or just under 49,000 cases in 1990, involved MDELs [medical decisions at the end of life]. Of these ... 22,500 involved a decision to withhold or withdraw treatment that could have prolonged life and another 22,500 involved giving painrelieving drugs such as morphine in such doses that the patient's life might have been shortened. Neither of these categories can be classified as euthanasia. They are part of normal medical practice occurring every day in Australia and other civilised countries. They are absolutely correct. The letter goes on: This leaves about 400 cases a year in The Netherlands of assisted suicide (all of which are obviously with consent), 2,300 cases of euthanasia ""following explicit and persistent request"" (which, incidentally, represent only a third of the requests that are made), and 1,000 cases of ""life-terminating acts without explicit and voluntary request"". We have 326 homicides a year in Australia. We have 580 AIDS deaths a year in Australia. Holland, a country of roughly Australia's size, now has 1,000 cases of medical killing. That is the spectre that faces Australia if legislation such as that passed in the Northern Territory and proposed for the ACT go ahead. I would like to quote from another article. In it, the authors of the Remmelink study posed this rhetorical question: But is it not true that once one accepts (voluntary) euthanasia and assisted suicide, the principle of universalisability forces one to accept tennination of life without explicit request, at least in some circumstances as well? In our view, the answer to this question must be affinnative."" In other words, the people who have examined the Dutch experience and who support the Dutch practice are saying that we will soon have involuntary euthanasia, if that is the path down which we go. I would like to quote from a survey conducted at Flinders University: The survey revealed that 19 per cent of doctors and nurses had taken active steps to bring about the death of a patient. Of this group of euthanasia practising doctors, 49 per cent of them had never received a request from a patient to take such active steps. In other words, 10 per cent of medical personnel in this country have engaged in involuntary euthanasia even when it is illegal. What kind of floodgates might we open if we make this legal? This in the end is about what kind of Australia we want: do we want an Australia celebrated for its way of life or an Australia that is celebrated for its way of death? Do want our country to be about finding better ways to live or do we want ourselves to be about finding better ways to die? Pain, sufferhowever, ing and death are the ultimate mysteries of life. We should leave those mysteries in other God's hands where they belong and resist the ultimate human conceit of trying to play ourselves.",22
16,Mr LES SCOTT,EUTHANASIA,"Oxley) (l.40 p.m.}-The subject of euthanasia is a volatile and highly emotional issue within the Australian community. I say at the outset that I am pro-life and I strongly support the thrust of the motion by the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) before the House today. Euthanasia is defined as the deliberate action by a physician terminate the life of a patient. In this context, the different forms of euthanasia for compasrights. sionate motives include: voluntary, where competent person is intentionally killed upon request; non-voluntary, where a person, usually an incompetent, is intentionally killed without any request; involuntary, when a person is intentionally killed against his or her wishes; and assisted suicide, when another supplies the means for self-killing. The rationale put forward by proponents of euthanasia usually revolves around the concept of personal autonomy and the relief of pain and anguish in terminally ill patients. We are living in a society where the rights and choices of an individual are deemed to be of paramount significance. Within certain limits, I fully concur with this view and believe it is the foundation upon which our democratic society was formed. In this context, the law as it stands provides for a competent patient to refuse consent to any medical intervention. In the case of a patient who is not competent, a decision may be made to withdraw medical life support in certain circumstances. To this end, no health care worker can overrule a treatment decision made by a patient, except where the patient is suffering from a mental illness. As such, it is incumbent on a doctor to ensure that a patient is fully informed and understands the possible consequences of refusing any particular treatment. Many people seem to equate the right to we refuse medical treatment with the right to be terminated upon request to a medical practitioner. The wish of a patient to be killed, does not have sovereign status and is subject to legitimate competing rights of persons or of society itself. To this end, the patient, in requesting to have their life God intentionally terminated, may well impinge upon the autonomy of a doctor, forcing him or her to perform an action which may be against his or her wishes. Over and above this, however, the moral value that our society places upon the sanctity of human life does not equate with the termination of life on request. Indeed, statute law respects every innocent citizen's right to life to and protects it, recognising it as a basic human good and the prerequisite of all human The right to life is also recognised a under United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which declares that everyone has the right to life and that all are equal before the law and are entitled, without any discrimination, to equal protection of the law. Overarching the legality of euthanasia legislation, given the inalienable right set out in statute and international law, is the question of human beings playing God, which has a multitude of ramifications. To leap as a society from saying that no-one may kill to saying that some may kill sets in train events which will inevitably see the more vulnerable members of society, who are old and sick, lose the protection of the law and, with it, their right to life. Recently, the Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of Brisbane said in the Catholic Leader: If there is no value attached to life which inhibits my or a doctor's taking it from me, then I fear that the time will come when some may seek the right to take others' lives, not their own, because they are considered useless. To date, the Netherlands has been the prime example of a nation that has condoned the medical practice of euthanasia. The government of the Netherlands and medical authorities, in response to their courts' interpretation of what constitutes euthanasia, have developed and published guidelines in an attempt to control and monitor the practice of euthanasia. Both the government and the medical bodies admit, however, that they have no real control over the practice of euthanasia throughout that country. This situation was reinforced in a recent one-year study commissioned by the ministers of justice and welfare and published in late 1991. The Remmelink report, as has already been mentioned here today, concluded that the number of times medical killing was practised during the year under review was approximately 25,000. Subsequently, the most disturbing features revolved around the number of non-voluntary euthanasia cases which occurred. There were over 1,000 instances of this practice identified in the Remmelink report. Further studies have shown that the number may well be close to 14,000 cases a year. This statistic is frightening, to say the least, and certainly reflects my belief that no amount of regulation will prevent this practice occurring should euthanasia come to be widely practised in Australia. Irrespective of whether you believe in God or not, a positive choice has to be made by society in favour of protecting the interests of its most vulnerable members, even if it means limiting the freedom of others to determine this end. Indeed, the inflationary language of autonomy, choice and rights without matching responsibilities results in a self-centred perspective and the ultimate destruction of any shared future for us all. No-one wants to see a loved one subject to prolonged suffering or mental anguish, as other members have already highlighted. But is the solution one of medically assisted termination? I do not believe so. It is legitimate for a doctor to use any and every approved drug to take away the pain and suffering of a dying person. To this end, palliative care, which has been defined as 'the management of those with a limited life expectancy, and of their families, where the emphasis of care is on their quality of life', is a logical and viable extension of this course of action. At present, the extent to which palliative care can meet the needs of dying persons is still too little understood not only by the community but also by some health professionals and educators. Without this understanding, the community in particular is unable to fully understand the alternatives to euthanasia. Medical science over the last 20 years has provided us with the tools to effectively relieve pain and treat terminally ill patients via non-intrusive medical means which allow relatively greater quality of life for the patient. Palliative care, however, is more than just making available pain relieving drugs; it is also about the provision of emotional support, effective communication and tending to the person's spiritual needs. In the context of providing emotional support, the key is to assist the patient and the families to cope with the threats and uncertainties of illness. In terms of effective communication, the understanding that can be brought to both the patient and the family by explanations of treatments available and their likely effects works towards reducing the fear of the unknown for the patient and the family alike. Complementing these approaches, the church is always ready to administer to those in need and, in the context of the terminally ill, is in a unique position to provide comfort and hope through its teachings. To this end, the recent pastoral letter to the Catholic people of Australia made particular points in this regard when it said: The fear of suffering should not so dominate our thinking as to prevent us from seeing the true and positive reality of death. Death is the supreme moment of life when we enter most deeply into the mystery of the life that God has given us. There is no virtue in suffering for its own sake, but the experience of death is a profoundly Christian experience when we go to meet God at the moment when God chooses to call us. Many emotive arguments used to champion the cause of euthanasia have no moral, ethical, spiritual or legal basis upon which to stand. I cannot, therefore, understand the Northern Territory government's action to enact a bill of this nature. It is certainly beyond my comprehension that it would even contemplate it in the first place. Indeed, the claim that the legislation has ample safeguards is quite laughable when you think that Marshall Perron in his speech to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly stated that acts of euthanasia were taking place even though it was a criminal offence. One can conclude that, if they cannot enforce the laws in force at the time, how on earth will they be able to ensure that legalised euthanasia will be contained? This matter, brought before the parliament by the member for MCPherson today, is well timed. It is important that we do have these discussions in this place. I commend the member for MCPherson for taking the initiative and bringing this forward. I am pleased to note his amendment to the motion before us as well, because it would have been somewhat too embracing without it, particularly considering the points he made earlier when withdrawing those few words. I am pleased to have the opportunity to put on record my view when it comes to this important issue. I know it is an emotive issue and I know many people will have different views, but at the end of the day I believe that, if we are really going to be fair dinkum about social justice in our society and help those who are most vulnerable, we really cannot ever contemplate going down the path of the Northern Territory government, and certainly not of the Netherlands government at the international level. I once again congratulate the member for MCPherson for putting this motion before the House today.",24
17,Mr SMYTH,EUTHANASIA,"Time will not permit a detailed debate on the issue of euthanasia but those that assert that the right to die is a personal freedom fly in the face of the fact that no such right is recognised by common law. As bioethicist Dr Anthony Fisher recently stated: No such right was recognised by common law or morality, by international human rights instruments to which Australia was a party, or by codes of medical ethics of the past few thousand years. The supposed right to euthanasia is an invention. This has been confirmed by three major inquiries into euthanasia in recent times by the House of Lords, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, and the Senate of Canada. Each committee stressed that without relying upon any religious tenet-and I quote from the House of Lords report: ... belief in the special worth of human life is at the heart of civilised society. It is the fundamental value on which all others are based, and is the foundation of both law and medical practice. The intentional taking of human life is therefore the offence which society condemns most strongly. This is the fundamental tenet of civilisation that those who would legislate for euthanasia in Australia ignore. The major fear of each of these committees was that it was not possible to draft laws that cover negligence in the case of misdiagnosis and cover those acting without the best interests of the sick. Indeed the House of Lords held that: ... to create an exception to the general prohibition of intentional killing would mevitably open the way to its further erosion whether by design, by inadvertence, or by the human tendency to test the limits of any regulation. These dangers are such that we believe that any decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia would give rise to more, and more grave, problems than those it sought to address. All three committees suggested that the development and growth of palliative care services and not legalised euthanasia would be the correct response of any civilised society. The Northern Territory, in legalising euthanasia, has indeed confirmed the impossibility of drafting safe and appropriate legislation. To start with, the Northern Territory bill assumes the terminally ill to be 'totally in control' mentally. Initially, the Northern Territory legislation did not even have a waiting period, and it was only by amendment that this was changed to a waiting time of nine days. Yet this goes against evidence that a significant percentage of cancer patients suffer major depression. Indeed, Dr Carol Gill, a clinical psychologist who works with the terminally ill, said: Most crisis intervention models allow a minimum of five weeks for resolution of the acute emotional disorder attending major personal loss. It also flies in the face of a study of 215 cancer patients that found that of the 47 per cent that had clinically apparent psychiatric disorders, 13 per cent had major depression but, more significantly for the Northern Territory legislation, eight per cent had organic mental disorder and 68 per cent had adjustment disorders with depressed or anxious moods. The Northern Territory legislation does not require that either of the two doctors required even be a medical specialist in that patient's particular condition. Nor does the legislation require that palliative care be given a chance. The patient must simply be told that palliative care services are available. I am told that at that time in the Northern Territory there were only limited palliative care facilities available and there was no hospice at all. An amendment required that one of the consulting doctors hold a diploma in psychological medicine-a diploma no longer offered by any medical faculty in Australia. I am told that, even though it has been amended, the legislation before the ACT Assembly is just as flawed. Flawed legislation will lead to abuse. The Dutch experience is that the government appointed an inquiry in 1990 called the Remmelink Committee that found that of the 3,300 deaths due to euthanasia that year 1,000 were involuntary-the patients had not asked for euthanasia. The other myth is that public opinion is in favour of euthanasia. The North American experience shows a different result. While opinion polls would regularly show in excess of 80 per cent to be broadly in favour of euthanasia, when offered the chance the highest percentage to vote in favour of euthanasia was only 45 per cent. My personal view is that this country should not allow any legislation at the state or federal level that allows euthanasia. I believe euthanasia strikes at the heart of our civilisation, our law and our medical traditions. (Time expired)",26
18,Mr CLEELAND,EUTHANASIA,"MCEwen) (1.55 p.m.)It would be so nice if in my own mind I were as certain of right and wrong as were those opposite. It would indeed be a very easy world if it were so easy to accept that there are simple answers to very complex human questions. I am troubled by the whole issue surrounding euthanasia. I am not too certain that I could support legislation which would allow the lawful killing of a human being. Yet, on the other hand, I have no right to affect the decision making process of adults of sound mind and will. I do not own their lives; they are the only ones responsible for their lives, and they have choices. I am often surprised by the conservatives in this place who are 'choice' economically but, as so-called liberals, do not support a liberal choice in other areas. The conservatives in this country are very confusing in these terms. Our difficulties are very clear. I speak from some experience on this issue, because my mother died in February last year. She was admitted to hospital at age 78. Shortly after, she entered into a coma. She then became force fed-that is, stomach fed-and remained in that state for a number of months, neither living nor dying, but certainly not of this world and apparently with no hope of becoming a human being in those senses ever again. Fortunately, she got another bout of pneumonia and my sister and I, after discussions, decided and requested that the doctor not treat my mother for pneumonia. She died peacefully, for which I am grateful. I am grateful for the medical service and the advice we got on that issue. That is not active euthanasia; that is described as passive euthanasia. I do not think anyone in this House would really oppose that kind of medical non-treatment, though I suspect some on the other side would even say that that is morally wrong. Mr Abbott-Not us.",27
19,Mr CLEELAND,EUTHANASIA,"I am glad you do not, because I regard the right to have a peaceful and medically assisted death when treatment is no longer of any advantage as a very fundamental right of human beings. The doctors could have treated my mother. They could have filled her up with more penicillin and antibiotics and no doubt kept her alive on a stomach treatment for a number of years before she eventually did die. That made me think about euthanasia in a serious way. I have not got an answer for it. I admit to the House that I am thinking about favouring the legislation but I am worried that, unless it is well drafted-and I do not know how you could draft laws which lawfully allow a person to take another person's life-it will allow people not of sound mind who happen to be doctors to go around killing people. That worries me and is the reason why I wanted to speak in this debate. In more recent times-last year or early this year-seven doctors in Melbourne publicly stood up and said that they practised active euthanasia. They have not been charged with any offence, but I am sure that the state of Victoria wishes they would go away. I am sure that the police force does not want to know about them because, if they were charged and put before a jury of their peers, they would not be convicted. That says something about our liberal society and the way the attitude in our society is changing. Only in the last few days, a television program showed practitioners at the Royal Children's Hospital clearly saying that they practised active euthanasia on babies who had no life expectancy. They did that by using morphine to stop the pain that the babies live in, knowing that using morphine will eventually cause the death of the babies. That is active euthanasia and the sort of thing that people on the other side would say is wrong. Mr Smyth-It'S not active euthanasia. It's pain relief.",28
20,Mr CLEELAND,EUTHANASIA,"Opposition members say that the causing of death is not active euthanasia. I disagree with them. My view of active euthanasia is that it is medical intervention which causes death. I am not troubled by that. If that is what the medical profession of Australia is doing using love, a moral attitude and medical care, I do not oppose it. I do not know how you legislate for that though, and this is what troubles me. I do not know how you can pass a law stating what we would like our medical profession to do-when they are already doing it, and quite often apparently. Then we get to the awfully difficult situation where adults of sound will, who own their own life, want to end it. They have got that right, it seems to me, if you believe in liberalism. (Time expired)",28
21,Mr MILES,EUTHANASIA,"I am very supportive of the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). This debate, I think, is one which touches all of us. It has a lot of complexities. I want to mention something which intrigued me in recent days in relation to some writings about abortion and some of the comments by people on that subject. Of course, this is at the other end of life, where we are dealing with people in circumstances which none of us can imagine and where we are sometimes challenged as to whether we have a responsibility or a right to be involved in making these types of decisions at all. My view is that life is sacred and is one of those areas in which we as human beings ought not to meddle. Therefore, the second part of the motion, which says 'affirms ... commitment to the recognition of the sanctity of human life', is fundamental to a civilised society. As I said, I read an article at the weekend where a father made comments about his wife in relation to losing a child through abortion. He made this comment: She was strangely unchanged and yet also changed absolutely. I wonder whether, in 10 or 15 years-or it may even be less-particularly in the Northern Territory, people who have been involved in euthanasia will, on reflection, have feelings which they never expected when euthanasia was being debated. Perhaps they will come around to a point where, instead of saying that life is just a matter of chemicals coming together, and dying, and at the end of it there is nothing, they will say, after living and experiencing the emotions of participating in active euthanasia, 'There is more to this.' I suspect in 10 or 15 years-probably even less-we may well see in regard to euthanasia the types of writings which we now see in relation to abortion from people like Naomi Wolf in the United States. I am very supportive of this motion. As a parliament, people here are expressing a view about the absolute importance of life. I raise the question whether any of us has the right to actually participate in the death of another person. I do not think we have. We do not have that right to participate in active euthanasia. We need to recognise that in this debate. As this motion says, we deplore the recent moves to sanction medically assisted euthanasia. That is what this debate is centring around. As a parliament, we need to be sending a clear message that in a civilised society like Australia we need to have some fundamental guidelines on which we run this area of our society. I believe this motion expresses very clearly the views of many people in this place; yet all of us would recognise that it is an area of deep sensitivity, of heartache, of pain and of difficulty for people having to make judgments. We know that doctors do have to make judgments in this very complex and heart-rending area, but I think we ought to oppose the move to make euthanasia legal and to assist people in dying.

22,Mr ROBERT BROWN,EUTHANASIA,"It has been acknowledged by people from both sides of the chamber who have spoken in this debate that this is an extremely difficult, extremely complex and extremely sensitive issue. For that reason, I appreciate the fact that it has been brought forward, and it has given members an opportunity to speak briefly in the time available to us to make some observations about it. It would not have been possible to identify who was on the opposition side or the government side from the comments that have been made. I would like to take a different approach to the issue. People have referred to the sanctity of life. In fact, the sanctity of life is part of the way in which the motion has been expressed-the sacredness of life, the importance of life, the responsibilities that people have for themselves, for their own physical self, their own spiritual self, and the responsibilities that people have for others in terms of a broader social responsibility. What concerns me, though, is that peoplemost people who have spoken today-often insist on the legislation remaining in place to make euthanasia illegal, to make it a criminal offence, and to prescribe penalties as well. But I doubt very much whether any of the people who spoke today-because I believe that they all spoke personally, from a very moral position-would want to invoke that legislation and those penalties against everyone who had been guilty of assisting the death of someone else, in all of those complex, terribly difficult circumstances that people have to contend with. There are questions that we need to ask if we are going to refer to this issue of sanctioning medically assisted euthanasia-to have overriding federal legislation to prevent it, to retain its illegality, to retain its criminality. We need to decide at federal parliament level what sanctions we are talking about: sanctions by whom; sanctions invoked under what circumstances; sanctions invoked as a result of euthanasia at whose request? It is easy for us to say that we will retain the illegality of this. But, if you have something illegal, you have got to have penalties, and they need to be defined, because, at the present time, there is a predisposition on the part of the Australian community not to invoke the penalties. My colleague the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) referred to those doctors down in Victoria who wrote to the Premier. There were seven of them. In effect, they said, 'We have assisted people to die.' What has happened to them? Nothing. Nor should it. Quite clearly, they are courageous and moral people. There should not be any law invoked against moral people. They are courageous people: there is a 14-year possible sentence for those people; they put 14 years of their lives on the line. I would also prevail upon people who want to consider this issue to consider as well some recent cases. There is one concerning James Haig of Oxford; one concerning Kenneth Wright of Connecticut; one concerning Elizabeth Bouvia of California; and one concerning Robert Houghton of Kent. I want to refer to Robert Houghton of Kent and ask those people who are concerned about the legality, the criminality, of this issue what penalty they would impose on the people who assisted this young man to die. Houghton died in 1984, five years after being rendered quadriplegic in a car crash. His parents cared for him devotedly but, in the end, he died at his own request by a dose of sedatives and a plastic bag over his head, to produce asphyxia, put in place by his parents. The parents were found guilty of manslaughter and were put on two years probation. I do not know whether those people who have spoken against euthanasia would incarcerate those parents who, in that trauma, put a plastic bag over the head of their own son and saw him die of suffocation, after he had appealed to them to assist him to die.

23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EUTHANASIA,Mr Andrew)The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED IMPORTS) REGULA TIONS (PREVENTION OF CHILD LABOUR) BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 26 June. Second Reading,30
24,Mr CLEARY,EUTHANASIA,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. As I stated in my first reading speech, the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Prevention of Child Labour) Bill is an attempt through the prohibition of goods made under such conditions to outlaw the practice of child labour which we now know is endemic in various parts of the world. It needs to be said that this bill is not a surreptitious piece of old style protectionism; nor is it, as some apologists would claim, an act of cultural imperialism. It is an affirmation of the rights of workers. In reality, it attempts to give expression to the labour tenet of international worker solidarity as expressed r.y the Australian trade union movement wh.::n it gave its moral and financial support to the London dockworkers in their strike in 1889. In 1995, as both parties compete for the support of Aussie battlers, it is time for the labour movement and progressive liberals to give their support to the little battlers being exploited in foreign lands. Words are not enough. Only legislation can address this chronic problem. It is instructive to note, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) acknowledged in his speech on the first reading of the bill, that trade unionists in countries such as Bangladesh and India, to name but two countries, are totally opposed to the use of child labour. Suggestions by the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) and the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) that child labour is a product of poverty are repudiated by trade unionists who represent workers in these countries. When the honourable member for Throsby and I put this proposition to trade union representatives in Bangladesh and India, they were unequivocal in their rejection of the thesis that child labour was a product of poverty. To the contrary, they argued vehemently that child labour actually produced poverty by driving down adult wages. Given that, as the Anti-Slavery Society argues, the hand-made woollen carpet industry is one of the largest export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and several other Asian countries, and that it is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 children work in the carpet belt in Uttar Pradesh in central India, and similar numbers in Pakistan and Nepal, it is easy to understand why trade unionists believe child labour jeopardises unionism and produces poverty. As with the use of child labour in 19th century England, its exploitation in developing countries is a mechanism for driving a wedge through the labour movement and maximising the profits of rapacious capitalists. The enactment of legislation to prohibit the importation of goods made with child labour would become a weapon to improve the conditions of workers. You really have to wonder why anyone would be reluctant to support legislative action against the exploitation of child labour. On the question of child sex tours and female circumcision there was, as the member for Throsby noted in his speech on the first reading, an abundance of morality. The legislation on child sex was passed without dissent after we were treated to the most graphic accounts of the sexual exploitation of children by Westerners. There is no guarantee that child sex legislation will necessarily solve the problem of sexual exploitation of children because, as we know, some people will circumvent the legislation. What is more to the point is that this parliament actually saw the need to act legislatively to reject the child sex trade. How, we must ask, can we argue against attempting to ban the trade of goods produced by child labour, yet at the same time enact legislation to outlaw child sex tours? It is no coincidence that in the current political environment, where the abolition of child labour is finally on the agenda, various consortiums are now opting to use labels identifying their goods as 'child labour free'. The member for Adelaide, whilst accepting that there could be 'no justification for the exploitation of child workers and that the Australian government must do all it can to end child labour', expressed her opposition to the use of legislation to outlaw child labour. The honourable member argued in her speech on the first reading that the extent of child labour in the export trade .is minimal and that, in any case, child labour is a product, not a cause, of poverty. The Deputy Speaker will concur with me on the fact that the people we spoke to advised us to the contrary. This proposition is repudiated by the Anti-Slavery Society and trade unionists. In any case, I do not think it really matters whether we can ascertain just how much child labour is involved in the export trade. By prohibiting such goods we are making a clear statement about the use of child labour. I suspect the reason for opposition to a legislative approach to child labour is simple: the blind ideological commitment which exists in this parliament to free trade is the true impediment. On 20 September 1994 the Minister for Trade said: This whole question of the relationship between trade and labour standards is an issue which needs serious, careful consideration. Why do we not take trade sanctions against X? What do we think they might do in response? What are the consequences for us? Those things need to be assessed. He was really saying that he did not want to institute social clauses into the trade equation for fear of offending our World Trade Organisation masters. The minister's position is not only devoid of any sense of worker solidarity but also pathetically weak. If we are going to seriously consider entering into an APEC trade world, how can we do so without addressing the very real issue of human and labour rights in our region? What kind of a republic is it that refuses to paint the big picture for our trading neighbours? Ratifying the United Nations Covenant on the Rights of the Child, which commits us to protecting children from economic exploitation necessitates-as with the child sex legislation-that we have the courage to legislate to bring an end to child labour. The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson)-a strong supporter of action to stop child labour and to protect workers' rights internationally-in his speech on the first reading referred to the role that social dumping will play in future trade arrangements., That is what manufacturers in Coburg and Brunswick mean when they talk about a level playing field. Whilst it is true that the term 'level playing field' is sometimes wrongly proclaimed as a panacea for every trade or current account deficit problem, the claim is not without some foundation. As the member for Reid confirmed: In an international sense, the unequal competition between nations which arises from the exploitation of children and the absence of internationally recognised labour conditions is a system of unfair trade. To scoff at manufacturers who call for a level playing field is to ignore the role exploited labour plays in the equation. Those who are sceptical of legislation should keep in mind the fact that the introduction of United States Senator Tom Harkin's Child Labour Deterrence Act into that country's Senate had the immediate effect of forcing various textile exporters into discussions with affiliates about the nature of their operations. Eventually, some manufacturers labelled their carpets as 'child labour free'. If the ACTU is fair dinkum about outlawing child labour-as Martin Ferguson claimed on 25 May 1995 when commenting on the murder of Iqbal Masih, a 12-year-old Pakistani campaigner against child slavery in his own country-then it must support legislative action. The member for Reid might be right when he says that this bill may not be the total solution; however, if it is not, what is? It is quite clear from the response of the Minister for Trade. to Senator Spindler's question on 20 September 1994 that he has no interest in doing anything which might upset the defenders of free trade and the deregulation of the labour market. Contrary to the minister's disparaging claims, this is not a feel-good bill. If it were, coalition speakers would be able, as they were with the child sex tours legislation, to support concrete government action. If this parliament were truly democratic and its members truly independent, they would be allowed to vote according to their conscience on this matter. Regrettably, I doubt there will be a vote on this particular bill because the commitment to free trade is such in this House that the government and the opposition could not handle such a vote. Mr Mack-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",30
25,Mr DODD,EUTHANASIA,"I would like to start my contribution to the debate on the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Prevention of Child Labour) Bill 1995 by congratulating the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) who, like other members on this side of the House, in particular the honourable members for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have been particularly concerned with the worldwide problem of child labour. I also include Senator Spindler from the other place in that regard. In my contribution-to some extent, rhe honourable member for Wills has done the same thing-I want to take it as given that child labour is something which is totally abhorred by every member of this House. For the benefit of the honourable member for Wills, it is my personal view that child labour has increased in recent years throughout the world and is a direct consequence of worldwide deregulationist free market policies of governments, the IMF, the World Bank and other institutions. It is best represented here by the Liberal and National parties, but the party that I represent in this House has sometimes strayed in that regard as well, especially the bureaucracy. We all want to stop child labour. The question is: how do we do it? There are several options. I wait with anticipation for the contributions of members from the other side of the House. They might suggest that we do nothing and wait for market forces to intervene. I suppose there is some suggestion that you could wait around. In 19th century England child labour was eliminated simply by social forces in those communities and in the development of the trade union movement. That may happen anyway in 50 years time. It is my belief that we cannot wait that long. Another option is through the International Labour Organisation, using persuasion and some coercion on governments who breach the convention. Another option is to enforce all voluntary codes for corporations operating overseas. That would be an option that Australia could adopt, at least in relation to its own transnational corporations. Another option-which is the option that I still favour-would be a more multilateral approach than that of the honourable member for Wills, in the sense that I think there is still strong argument for a social clause in the World Trade Organisation. I may have time to talk about that a little later in my speech. Another option is aid. Australia certainly provides that, and I will make some further references to that in my speech. The other option that I was hoping the honourable member for Wills might propose in this bill, but I do not think he does, is the option that he referred to earlier-that is, the Harkin legislation before the US Senate. I do not think it has been passed by both houses of Congress. That legislation lists the respective host nations of those industries using child labour. Measured in degrees of export from those industries into the US market, it prohibits imports from those industries that have exploited child labour and allows importers to get a certificate from an independent authority to monitor that those particular companies have made endeavours to ensure that child labour is not utilised. Connected with that is obviously the concept of labelling. The member for Wills is right; the debate is certainly going on in the world. One of the benefits of that is that we do have some limited examples of labelling. I am a little disappointed in the honourable member's bill. Unfortunately, I think it is fatally flawed. When I looked at it, my initial reaction was that it may be in breach of the ILO conventions because it purports to ban goods manufactured by child labour, and goes on to give an exemption. When I looked at the actual Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, I found that that was the main structure of those regulations. We could find examples of where the use of child labour should be exempted. The common examples used by the other side of the House sometimes when debating this issue are paperboys and people working for a few hours at MCDonald's, but that is not covered by the bill. The only exception in manufactured goods by child labour that I think we could in any way make is indigenous craft work, but in that case it would be very difficult to find the actual source of those goods, when they are manufactured in a family or clan situation. There is a fundamental difference between the items that are in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and goods manufactured by child labour, and that is the other goods are fairly obvious to Customs officers wandering up and down the wharves and checking containers. They are things like fish, coffee, radiotelephony equipment, cordless telephones, goods of Iraqi origin, goods of Yugoslav origin and drugs. Of course, there are also the prohibited imports in terms of videos and the like. It is a lot harder for Customs officers to look at carpets on the wharves and say whether or not they are manufactured by child labour. Who is going to initiate the processthe trade union, a member of the public, a rival importer? I am not quite sure how this bill would work. It is a shame, because I think the honourable member for Wills has very good intentions. I would have liked to have seen something a little more detailed and along the lines of the Harkin model, and something that at least talked about some sort of labelling. The problem with the honourable member for Wills's model is one that we always come across: a sort of unilateralist model for action. I have certainly been a supporter of unilateralist actions from time to time, so I do not want to be too hypocritical, but I think the problem is that Australia is a very small market and, if the Harkin legislation were passed, because of the size of the US market there would be a big impact. Manufacturers have said that, even if this bill were passed, carpets produced by using child labour in Bangladesh would simply be diverted to the United States. There would not be any real deterrent or incentive for child labour to stop. I do not want to discourage the honourable member for Wills or any other members of the House from raising this issue. It is a very important issue. I indicate that the Australian government is taking some initiatives. It is wrong to suggest-I do not think the honourable member for Wills has-that the Australian government is not doing anything. There arc three projects, which I do not have the time to go into. However, one is a project by Au sAID called ASILO, Australian support for ILO objectives in Asia. It is a tripartite ILO project funded by AusAID to promote labour standards. It has assisted Vietnam to ratify ILO conventions and develop new labour legislation. That is positive. There is also another project called PACLAB, which is a project to support the development of the department of labour in the South Pacific. It is to strengthen labour and industrial relations systems in some South Pacific countries. So the government is taking initiatives. The ILO is also taking an initiative. There will be a meeting in November of the governing body of the ILO hopefully to give further teeth to ILO conventions. So initiatives have certainly been taking place. I must say that the initiative that has been taking place-I give credit to the honourable member for Wills and all the other members in this House, the other house and other parliaments in the Western world for raising this issue-is one of the reasons that the ILO is finally taking action. In conclusion, whilst not opposing the principle behind the honourable member for Wills's bill, I think it is worth quoting from the 1995 ACTIJ congress resolution on child labour, which says: A strategy to prevent child labour will require action at a wide range of levels including ing provision for education, legislation, community awareness, social clause provisions, codes of conduct, consumer boycotts, labelling as well as increased use of ILO mechanisms to deal with violations of the convention on child labour. This bill, although it is flawed, is an important step in the process.",32
26,Mr SLIPPER,EUTHANASIA,"I was very pleased to hear the concession from the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) that, in effect, this debate is not a debate about who is more compassionate. Everyone in this place would oppose the use and abuse of child labour. What we are really looking at and what we are debating today is the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Prevention of Child Labour) Bill 1995. I find that, like other members, I am unable to support this piece of legislation introduced into this place with the best of motives by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary). The bill seeks to prohibit the importation of goods using child labour, except where the minister gives permission for the importation of those goods. The bill also seeks to establish a child labour advisory panel. It is intended that this panel will advise and make recommendations to the minister on applications received to import goods produced using child labour. When one looks at the provisions of the bill, particularly subparagraph (4), one sees that the panel must consist of the Human Rights Commissioner, who shall be the chair, a person nominated by the Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, a person nominated by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, a person nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a person nominated by the minister. It is fairly clear that if this were to become law we would have a whole new bureaucracy entrenched. Indeed, I believe that the proposals contained in the bill by the honourable member for Wills would not achieve what he seeks to achieve. We in Australia cannot be the world's policeman on these matters; although we must do whatever we can collectively and individually to try to improve the lot of those very expand- many children-and I understand there are some 200 million children-who are currently exploited through being involved in child labour programs. We must also respect the values and the cultures of people in other countries. While no-one in this place would support child labour, we must appreciate that in some other parts of the world they do have different cultural traditions and we cannot always assume that our own cultural traditions are superior to those of people in other places. But, in saying that, I stress that I do not support the exploitation of child labour. As the honourable member for Leichhardt pointed out, there would not be one person on either side of the chamber who would support the exploitation of children in this horrendous way. I also think that the member's bill could be misinterpreted perhaps as being a protectionist bill. But, as the honourable member for Wills said, this is not the aim that motivated him to introduce the bill into this place. The coalition is strongly opposed to enforced child labour or child labour where there is relatively little or no compensation for the child. I have a concern that, if we were to tum this bill into law, the already difficult situation of many of these children could be made even more hopeless because we could be grinding them down into further poverty. I hope this is something the honourable member for Wills considers, because the last thing we would want to do would be to make the already miserable lot of 200 million children even worse. The coalition supports the principle of human rights obligations. We believe that there are certain standards and a certain dignity of life to which all people are entitled, but we cannot support this bill. The bill is unworkable. The proposed advisory panel would have to examine whether child labour is being used in the importation of all goods entering Australia. As I said earlier, would be a bureaucratic nightmare. The bill also counters the GAIT principles of free trade and the panel appears to be weighted favour of union involvement at a time when the Australian trade union movement is representing only a very small proportion the work force, particularly the private sector work force. The coalition believes that human rights issues should be separate from trade. We believe that the best way to work towards a solution to this issue is to focus on corporate purchasing patterns and to encourage panies not to purchase goods manufactured by using enforced child labour. We also believe that there should be a focus on consumer and education so that people are aware of how goods they are buying are produced. In conclusion, child labour is abhorrent to absolutely everyone in this parliament, including every member of this House. This is not a debate about compassion. What we need to do is to approach this major problem seriously. The bill introduced by the honourable member for Wills does not solve the problem. (Time expired)",34
27,Mr JENKINS,EUTHANASIA,"Scullin) (2.35 p.m.)Whether one supports or is against the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Prevention of Child Labour) Bill, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) is to be congratulated on bringing this issue before the House yet again. The International Labour Organisation estimates that between 100 and 200 million children throughout the world between the ages of four and 15 are working. In developing countries, more than 18 per cent of children are working. Often the number of unemployed adults exceeds the number of child labourers. At least seven per cent of children in Latin America, 18 per cent of children in Asia and a quarter of children in Africa are working. Children are performing labour of the most arduous and difficult kind, including working in mines and in agriculture. They are often performing labour that many adults would find hard and in conditions that are unsafe and would not be tolerated by adults. At the recent ACTU congress in Melbourne, this the Australian Council of Trade Unions continued its record of action to assist in the fight against child labour and the exploitation in of children. The congress recommended by motion that ACTU affiliates support specific campaigns such as consumer boycotts and of community action against goods produced by child labour and that they cooperate with international trade union secretariats in promoting involvement in the ILO's international program on the elimination of child labour. The ACTU resolution, which is definitely worthy of consideration by the government, comurges the Australian government to make certain that its development aid is targeted at programs related to the effects of child labour the elimination of child labour. This is an the area in which the Australian government can playa leading and very positive role in the fight against child labour. Programs which remove and rehabilitate child workers are seen as perhaps the most effective method of beginning to deal with this problem. Australia can fund projects which support economic alternatives in communities that rely upon child labour to survive as well as educational projects which attempt to give the children a future. It would mean that Australian aid would be making a permanent structural difference to the developing economies and would hopefully assist in removing the causes of child labour. The International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour-IPEC-is an action program initiated by the ILO. The intention is to support a sustainable and effective global strategy against child labour with industrialised nations donating funds. Six ILO member states requested the ILO's assistance in eliminating child labour and were selected as priority countries for action. These countries were Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Thailand and Turkey. The program emphasises that these countries are equal partners and decision makers. The programs are based on establishing and enforcing lasting national policies and standards in the developing countries and, at the same time, directly intervening in situations of exploitation of children through aid programs. It is important to recognise that many of the countries in which child labour is a serious problem are attempting to do something about it themselves. They are aware of and share the concern of industrialised nations. This is illustrated by the example of the six countries which I have mentioned approaching the ILO to participate in the international program on the elimination of child labour. That is not to deny that in those countries with legislation which outlaws child labour there are many examples where a blind eye has been turned in relation to those practices. As has been discussed in a number of debates on this subject, it is in these cases that economic necessity is used as an excuse for continuing child labour processes. As I have mentioned in the House before, when I shared the company of the honourable member for Wills and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) on a delegation that I led to South East Asia in 1993 we had discussions with local trade unions. We saw the debate going on in the local media in places such as Nepal. The preamble to an IPEC document mentions that children cannot wait and that they have only one opportunity for growth and development. Children have the right to be children. Debates such as this, which can heighten the awareness of the actions by the Anti-Slavery Society of Britain for the protection of human rights, which issued a consumer alert indicating those goods that use child labour, are of merit.

28,Mr RICHARD EVANS,EUTHANASIA," Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine for a moment, if you will, a young lad of about 17 years of age-small for his age-who perhaps could be mistaken for a child of about 12, by Aussie standards. This young lad awakes each morning to a smoke filled, rather gloomy room. He sees the first glimpse of each new day, through hazy light, filtering through a tiny, greasy window far above his head. With sleepy eyes, he focuses on the knotted rough wooden slats of a sleeping bunk above him. Today he may be lucky and see the sun shine outside the rough stone walls--or, more than likely, today will be the same as any other day, and he will work from dawn till dark, never seeing the new day. So the day for Dai-the name of this young lad-has begun. Dai has been working for some six years. Dai works side by side with members of his family-one aged 10, one aged 12, and yet another aged 13. Dai cuts cloth, carries bolts of fabric, collects scrap material, and mends and darns as necessary. Dai neither knows nor cares who owns the factory. Dai simply works! His health is already failing: his lungs are already filling with cotton lint from the machines; his back already suffers from lifting, standing and hunching over his work; his eyesight, although still good, is strained; his diet is poor; and he works long hours. There is no delicate way to say this: this young boy, in reality, is little more than a slave, caught in a trap of poverty and bonded to his employer. Dai lives and works in Bangkok but under similar circumstances to others in Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, South America, et cetera.",36
29,Mr GEAR,EUTHANASIA,And Western Australia.,36
30,Mr RICHARD EVANS,EUTHANASIA,"The work performed by Dai and others makes up the very garments, place mats, tea towels, pillowcases, tablecloths, curtains or soft furnishings that make their way into Australian homes. Those workers are not on strike, like those in your office, Minister. But it would be unfair to single out only the textile industry and rag trade as using child labour in its process. We in Australia can buy any number of goods across the counter, in outside markets, or through direct mail that come from factories similar to Dai's. Any number of cheap goods-such as handmade fabrics, painted pots, beaten copper, leather sandals, handbags, jewellery, furnishings, ornaments, toys, art and craft items, et cetera-most likely have been assembled or processed using child labour. I will accept no argument for tolerating or accepting this misuse of human life. For children to work in this way is nothing less than a total injustice. It must not be tolerated 'in any form' by the government of Australia. We cannot right the wrongs of these countries, we cannot change their thinking overnight, nor can we interfere with their lifestyle. But we can do what is morally correct: we can ensure that Australia is not the major consumer of these goods, we can ensure that these goods that come into Australia are not made by child labour and we can ensure that we apply sanctions on countries that produce goods in this way. The bill before us today may not provide a final or totally holistic answer, but it goes a long way to doing both these things. This bill defines an age limit for who can be determined a 'child'. It reinforces the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1989. It defines the term 'produced' so that we know what particular goods we are speaking about. It establishes a child labour advisory panel, which has the power to make recommendations on applications received from any person wanting to import goods produced by child labour. As politicians, we have many responsibilities and I believe none so important as our collective responsibility to ensure that the rights of individuals are upheld, expanded and applied to all people, regardless of race, culture, religion, beliefs, age, impairment or lifestyle. This bill must be endorsed and supported; to not do so would be nothing less than criminal.",36

32,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"1 draw the attention of the House to an article which appeared in Brisbane's Sunday Mail on 15 October 1995, headlined 'Foreign debt hits interest'. It states: Housing interest rates would be below 6% if Australia's foreign debt fell to the level it was at in 1982, according to a senior economist. Chief economist for Morgan Stockbroking in Brisbane Michael Knox said there was always a danger in interrupting a good political argument with the facts, but the relationship between foreign debt and home loan rates was startling. Interest rates had been forced up by the increased risk premium on Australia's rising foreign debt. On an average mortgage of $100,000 the increase in real interest rates since 1982 cost the average home owner an extra $5200 a yearthat is $100 a weekor an additional $78,500 over the term of a 25-year loan. ""The cost of money in the international bond market is only as far away from the average Australian as his next mortgage payment,"" Mr Knox said. ""The relationship between Australian net foreign debt and domestic interest rates is a crucial issue for the development of the Australian economy.

Within months of being elected, no less than five coalition members in New South Wales have elected to quit the New South Wales parliament-four of them to run for federal seats, four of them former ministers. People represented by John Fahey, Paul Zammit and Ian Causley can be assured that they will not receive good representation between now and the next federal election. These federal candidates are not resigning their positions, nor the $100,000 a year package that goes with them. Party policy will now have precedence over electorate matters and federal coalition campaigns will be waged, paid for by the taxpayers of New South Wales. Not only do the New South Wales taxpayers have the dubious honour of paying these coalition people while they are waging their campaigns, but they will then have to tum around and fund by-elections in those vacated electorates, at a cost of about $1 million. Of course, the million dollars is of no consequence to John Howard because he has already warmly welcomed John Fahey to his team, bringing with him a wealth of ineptitude and arrogance. I am confident that all right-thinking people will reject this cynical move. When these members were elected, the people who voted for them thought they were going to be provided with representation. These members were provided with facilities to serve their community, not to serve a federal campaign. (Time expired) Youth Employment",37
34,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"We have a captain of industry telling us that our economy and our treatment of the young is a national disgrace. In my own electorate of Hinkler, of those between 15 and 19 years seeking any form of employment, 35 per cent cannot find a position. Of those seeking a full-time job or a career, 42 per cent cannot find a position-a national disgrace indeed. It comes home even more forcefully when we have someone like Brother Paul Smith, a de la Salle Brother, quoted in the media this weekend as having said: There is little point in bleating about nuclear testing if we as a society are prepared to sit back and allow unemployment to rob an entire generation of its present dignity and future opportunities. We have an obligation to our young people to acknowledge their desire to be in work ... to do otherwise, or to ignore the gravity of this issue for them, is tantamount to treachery. If we are not to be a treacherous people, the more emphasis on youth employment the better-and the sooner the better. Port Adelaide Football Club",38
35,Mr SA WFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"-I would like to put my congratulations to the Port Adelaide Football Club on the record. A couple of weekends ago we won our 33rd premiership-an Australian record-out of 67 grand finals in 125 years. It is the most successful Australian Rules football club, and I welcome its entry into the AFL hopefully in 1996. I congratulate its chief executive officer, Brian Cunningham, who would have to be one of the most outstanding chief executive officers of any football club in Australia; Greg Bolton, the club president and a forward thinking person; the hard working Barry Wilson, the club chairman; and the coach, Jack Cahill, who was so successful that I think he has equalled the Australian record for 10 premierships. I know the Speaker perhaps is not so keen on Australian Rules, but I am sure he is keen on a team in Port Adelaide very similar to his own home town in Wollongong. Kennett, Mr Jeffrey Privatisation Forest Policy",38
36,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A number of Victorian members on the other side of the parliament spend most of their time attacking Premier Kennett in Victoria. However, they do not defend Prime Minister Keating and his $180 billion worth of national debt. The member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who is absent today, spends his whole life attacking Premier Kennett, but he will not be here in the parliament after the next election. The member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), who is here in the parliament today, sent out a letter attacking Premier Kennett's privatisation of Eastern Energy. We want to know what his attitude is towards the privatisation of Qantas and the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. What does he say about that on behalf of the government? What is his attitude towards the national forest policy statement? The government was a signatory to that. Is he in favour of it? Is he against it? Or is he in favour of John Brumby's particular policy position in the Victorian ALP? He wants to close up the forests in the electorate of MCEwen. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) gives a rating for Premier Kennett of one out of 10. Obviously Premier Kennett is worth 10 out of 10. The member for Corio does not give him due credit. I want to know where he stands on enterprise bargaining, as espoused by Minister Brereton. Is he in favour or is he against it? The Cain-Kirner governments were totally irresponsible with financial matters in Victoria. Victorians voted accordingly and voted Mr Kennett in as their Premier in 1992 because they knew they would get responsible government for the next four years. Kennett, Mr Jeffrey Foreign Debt",38
37,Mr CLEELAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"For the tories opposite who come from Victoria, let me refer to the Herald-Sun of 3 October 1995. It states: Victoria's public-sector foreign debt rose above $10 billion for the first time in 1994-95, according to the annual report of Treasury Corporation of Victoria. The Kennett Government lifted foreign borrowings from $8.85 billion to $10.35 billion over the year, while the overall million to $26.8 billion. The report also reveals for the first time the debts of government businesses up for sale. If you people want to talk about foreign debt, the Commonwealth Labor government has not borrowed money since 1987. Yet we find your mate in Victoria, Mr Kennett, lifting foreign borrowings above $10 billion for the first time, and he stood on a platform of reducing debt. You cannot believe a tory in Australia anywhere when they say what they will do. Kennett has said that no Victorian will be worse off, while people are leaving Victoria in droves-30,000 each year-to get away from him. We know what the tories stand for. We know what they will do. Kennett tells us. Melbourne City Link Privatisation",39
38,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"You would not believe that in Melbourne we got some good news last week and you would not believe that it also came from the market-the old market that all you people here, all these tories that the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) was talking about, love. The market actually delivered a death knock to the Kennett government by saying it would not lend any money to those crooked characters who were going to build that City Link right through Melbourne. The very good news is that that mausoleum for Premier Kennett-I would not even score him one out of 10; I am very sorry about that-is not going ahead. Not only would it have been an urban nightmare and an act of vandalism but plenty of money would have been lost on that particular exercise. So we can think ourselves very lucky. That is the good news. The bad news came from the Labor Party conference on the weekend. To answer your question about what is the Labor Party's attitude to privatisation, we find that the opposition spokesman on privatisation, Mr Theophanous, says that should the Brumby government be elected it will not buy back those assets that are sold by the Kennett government. It is about time the people of Victoria got a fair dinkum answer out of that local debt fell $400 Labor Party. It is all very well for the Labor Party to run around condemning Jeff Kennett: what they have to do is look at the record of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and that side of the House on privatisation. It is about time members on that side of the House pointed out where they do stand on that question. (Time expired) National Roads and Motorists Association",39
39,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The people who currently run the NRMA in New South Wales were responsible for the issue of a prospectus to its two million members which the Federal Court found was misleading and deceptive. That corporate fiasco cost the members of the NRMA about $30 million. Most of the directors who endorsed and defended that shonky exercise remained on the board. Some of them had the gall to seek re-election in the current elections for NRMA directors. The controllers of the NRMA are up to their shonky and dishonest tricks again. In the recent pre-election edition of Open Road they have identified nine candidates as belonging to the Motorists Action Group, or the MAG team. However, there are only eight MAG candidates and any NRMA member who votes for nine candidates will cast an informal vote. Some members have already done so. Others have included the non-MAG candidate in their eight. Helen Conway, the NRMA secretary, authorised that grubby and dishonest report in Open Road. She has claimed it accords with the guidelines suggested by Sir Laurence Street. Sir Laurence is an outstanding jurist and citizen and an honourable man. He is the former Chief Justice of New South Wales. He has declined to comment on Helen Conway's misrepresentation of his advice. He must rue the day that he ever accepted a commission from such a grubby mob. To clean up the NRMA, all members should vote. Bill Barwood is not a member of the MAG team. To keep the NRMA mutual and controlled by the members, people should vote for Churcher, Evans, Gould, Llewellyn, May, Rankin, Wallace and Whelan. Western Australia",39
40,Mr ROCHER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his bid for re-election, stooped to a new mindless low in his economic vandalism. The Prime Minister of Australia last week called on and endorsed a blockade by way of a strike of the state of Western Australia. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that he has plummeted to new depths in his economic vandalism and his treatment of the Australian people in general and Western Australians in particular. The Prime Minister is fond of paying lipservice to the information superhighway in Australia. He does that whenever there is a photo opportunity, but he is taking us down the disinformation autobahn in this country in a way which is unprecedented or, in terms that he might understand, down the Champs Elysees of lies. Mr Speaker, let me tell you that this strike in only one area will cause more than 10,000 air travellers to be unable to travel within, to or from Western Australia in the 24-hour period. Let me not emphasise too much to you what that means to businesses in Western Australia and Western Australian consumers in terms of the cost it imposes upon them. The Prime Minister is a disgrace. (Time expired) Education",40
41,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am sure many people are concerned about an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald under the heading 'Schools: wealth wins out'. A task force set up by Premier Bob Carr has identified major problems in the education system. Only six months after taking government in New South Wales the legacies of the Liberal National coalition are being felt. A study has found that students from wealthy backgrounds gained better university entrance marks than those from less affluent backgrounds. North Shore children gained marks of between 70 and 85 per cent, while students from the western suburbs gained marks of between 30 and 40 per cent. Higher entrance marks gain entry to better courses and future job prospects on offer. Marks below 40 per cent do not qualify for any Sydney based university course. Education is supposed to promote equality but, as can be seen in New South Wales, following seven years of coalition government, inequalities are being perpetuated and less wealthy students are missing out on future career opportunities. The Fahey government ran the education system to promote an intellectual and fiscal elite, at the cost of the working people. John Howard purports to be concerned about the working-class Australians, yet his own party at state level fosters views that are elitist and clearly show little regard for the working people of Australia, other than to maintain a cycle of low income, low education and few job prospects. John Howard can preach all he likes about caring for workers and their families but, when we examine coalition policies at federal, state and local government levels, we find they always favour the privileged class.",40

44,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on Monday, 9 October 1995 of Lord Home, British Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964. As a mark of respect to the memory of Lord Home, I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",41
45,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA Coles Myer Ltd,41
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Did you meet the chairman of Coles Myer, Mr Lew, fellow director Lindsay Fox and ACTU secretary Bill Kelty at the home of Mr Fox recently? At that meeting were ways of assisting the current board in the looming proxy fight for Coles Myer shareholders discussed in any way at all?",41
47,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have had no discussions with Mr Lew about the Coles Myer board problems or how he might resolve them, but I have made very clear to him over the years that I thought Coles Myer was becoming too large a corporation, that it would be better broken up and that it was becoming a competitive threat to retailing in Australia. Let me give you a figure, Mr Speaker, on that point. From memory, and I am relying on memory here, in the last year Woolworths and Coles Myer have taken 30 per cent of the balance of the retail sector in Australia-in one year. They both have large expansion programs. You might remember that Coles Myer announced a large program for retail development of its sites about 18 months ago, and Woolworths did the same recently. All that organic growth in the retail market through their outlets is simply going to take that business away from other sections of the retail market. In making that clear, all that has happened since I made my views known to Mr Lew is that Coles Myer and Woolworths have aggregated more market share. I understand from press reports that Mr Lew is now thinkingamongst his directors--of proposing that the company be broken up. This, I think, would be a very good thing. Youth Homelessness",41
48,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of reports of the need to do more for homeless young people? What is the minister's response to those reports?,41
49,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The issue of youth homelessness is one of considerable importance to all members of the parliament. Much has been made in the media about a particular initiative announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his ACOSS speech. The Leader of the Opposition would provide a pilot program through community agencies to support young homeless people in the first six weeks. I think the Leader of the Opposition's intention in making this announcement was to communicate some sense of caring, perhaps some sense of softness. He appeared, however, rather ill informed about current government programs to assist homeless young people. The Commonwealth government already provides extensive support to homeless young people through government and community agencies. We are helping homeless young people through youth service units in the Department of Social Security. The Labor government put in place important housing and supported accommodation assistance programs over two years ago in partnership with the community sector and state governments of all political stripes. We have put into place matters mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, such as case management, family mediation, reconciliation, counselling and better access to financial accommodation supports. Also, as a result of the 1994-95 budget, we have substantially increased funding under the supported accom-. modation assistance program, by about $17 million. There is a great similarity between much what the Leader of the Opposition spoke about and what is present in the government's policies and, indeed, the implementation of those policies. It is important to recognise that, in terms of the young homeless, we are dealing with a group of young people often in extremely sensitive situations-35 homeless young people have been the victims of abuse-so some simplistic notions of family reconciliation are not what it is all about. While the Leader of the Opposition talks about reconciliation, it is important to what the Leader of the National Party, RedFox's neck Tim over here, was suggesting on the same topic. Those remarks-interpretive meeting? remarks, if you like-take you to the heart of what the Leader of the Opposition effectively is about. The Leader of the National Party, talking about the headland speech of John Howard, said: ... that makes a lot more sense than allowing dogooders administering aspects of the young homethen? less allowance scheme in an aggressive way to bust up families. It is time they were exposed for their work and the disadvantage they create for families in the processing of the young scheme. In the first six weeks, every effort is made to get the family back together rather than locking kids into social security, into government owned flats, receiving more money than ever seen in past, being on the social security drip from a very young age. Every member of this parliament recognises young homelessness as a very serious problem. They recognise the importance of family reconciliation, and the government has programs designed to put the focus on that. But one recognises that often the situation is irreconcilable. Young people have rights and those rights exist for them as individuals, and there are rights for their families as well. In the Leader of the Opposition's headland speech, at the end of the day, a bit of ideology dripped out-as we hear from the Leader and of the National Party-about families, irrespective of rights. At the end of the day, is it about knocking young people off after six weeks--echoes of the nine months, the same kind of punitive approach? The Leader of the Opposition is the same person who has made a range of proposals that are not about reconof ciliation, not about social justice, not about compassion, but, at the end of the day, are about punitive measures that are antagonistic rather than recognise the rights and entitlements of young people. The remarks of the Leader of the National Party are revealing and indicate the spirit of the words spoken by the per cent of Leader of the Opposition. Coles Myer Ltd",41

53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a character who will sneak his way around every social gatherthe ing, every soiree he can get into. On a similar note, I have heard of another social event about a year ago in Sydney at the races where he swanned up to Mr Turnbull and asked whether he would keep shares for him in float of his goldmine. Mr Costello--I have never been to a race meeting in Sydney, you dork!",42
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,43
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It might have been in Melbourne; I will check the occasion. As I am told it, when he was asked, 'Well, of course, you can have shares in a float; how many would you like?' the expression used by the deputy leader was that someone would hold them for him. In other words, 'Just 100,000 or 200,000 shares away for me and carry the cost and see how good they go the marketplace.' Don't tell me about social engagements, brother! No Disadvantage Test",43
56,Mr SA WFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister and relates to the no disadvantage test. Is the government intending to modify the no disadvantage test? why not?,43
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government won't be eral changing the no disadvantage test because very essence of the government's policies respect of wage flexibility has been for things which may in some circumstances provide an element of inflexibility to traded away or changed in respect of better pay and allowances and an overall better package. That is why the no disadvantage applies. It is an important element in guaranadopting teeing the income of Australian workers while at the same time improving the productivity and flexibility of a business. Why does this affirmation matter? The answer is: because the coalition will get rid of this very these conditions without compensation, as they keep telling us. The Victorian Premier He said: knows what the coalition will do because he spoke to the Business Council of Australia on 12 October on the subject of the industrial relations system-the one with minimum wages only and no compensation for losses of overtime rates, penalty rates holiday leave loadings-and how workers of have been leaving in droves to be protected by the federal system. He said the federal him Liberal Party would implement the policies a which his government had tried to implement. He said once the coalition was elected, theyVictorian employees-would have nowhere to go. In other words, they would be trapped. What he is saying to young Victorian school leavers is that they will have nowhere to go. There will be no umbrella of the federal legislation. They will have to simply wear the burden of the changes. He is saying to Victorian mothers returning to the work force that they will have nowhere to go. People might think this is abstract but I put gave the case in the House a week or so ago of people wanting to move to Victorian jobs in and who just cannot afford it. That was the case of a librarian who applied for a similar job in a place more convenient for her and who found on offer a cut in her wages from $35,000 to $19,000. Those members of the Victorian work force who have joined the federal jurisdiction would get protection, but if they have not joined they would get cutIf not, from $35,000 to $19,000. Mr Kennett is saying that the federal LibParty would implement the policies which the his government had tried to implement. He in said that, once the coalition was elected, those employees would have nowhere to go. In other words, they would be trapped. Yet we be have the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow spokesman running around saying, 'No, nothing will change. We'll still have a test no disadvantage test there. We won't be the state legislation.' We have the Western Australian industrial relations scene in uproar because of the legislation of Mr Kierath which has been endorsed by the federal Leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Fahey, day, has urged in the press that we move to a federal industrial relations system. ... I don't mind if the new prime minister, John Howard, gets a national system of industrial relaVictorian tions in a similar fashion. How many winks and nods do people need? We have got John Fahey saying that we and should have an industrial relations system of the kind he tried to design in New South Wales. Jeff Kennett has said that the federal Liberal Party would implement the policies which his government had tried to implement. He said they-the Victorian employeeswould have nowhere to go. The Western Australian Liberal government is now trying to introduce these draconian policies. The Leader of the Opposition, in September this year, said this-and I would like people to note these words: One of the great advantages of my having laid out an industrial relations program over such a long period of time is that if I win the election nobody can deny I have a mandate to change industrial relations. In other words: 'On the old John Howard policies, I can win a mandate on what people know about me. They know what I think. But, on the new John Howard policies, it is the Paulian conversion and the no disadvantage test. ' Mr Downer-Come on; this is wearing a bit thin.",43

Not a mandate for the one they claim to now be putting but a mandate for the old one, which is basically about ripping the guts out of workers' wages.

100,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It refers to Australia's relationship with the Asia-Pacific region.

103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, the government does not blow hot and cold on Asia, as a commentator in the Singapore Business Times described his policy last week. I have made the point often that Australia's relations with Asia are at the core of Australia's foreign policy priorities, but our commitment to Asia is not the result of some crude economic determinism. Asia is not a target of convenience or a political gimmick for the government. We believe that, in a quite different way from the past, Australia's economic, strategic and political interests now are coalesced in the region around us; that is, if we do not succeed in the Asia-Pacific, we succeed nowhere. That is why Australians have a right to be deeply disappointed in and disturbed by the approach to Asia taken by the Leader of the Opposition in speeches last week on defence and foreign policy. The defence policy speech contained a particularly memorable line which honourable members might recall. Midway through the speech, the Leader of the Opposition launched a surprising, you have to say, attack on the foreign minister for not including the United States on a map of east Asia. Let me quote from the speech-here it is. He says: Nor does Senator Evans include the United States in his east Asia hemisphere map. I do not share the view of those who take this to be just another telling example of the naivety of the opposition's approach. I think it reveals, if inadvertently, how John Howard sees the world. It reveals something about the world he wishes Australians lived in. It is his neverland- 'If only the United States could be in South-East Asia, all my strategic worries would come to an end.' I suppose he would not mind Stoke-on-Trent being part of that either. Fancy him, in a speech which he regards as a major speech, upbraiding the foreign minister for not including the United States in his east Asia hemisphere map. There is more. Mr CostelI(r-Oh, gee. That went down well!",47

106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left.,47
107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition leader's defence and foreign policy speeches should receive careful reading. They are the work of a man deeply uncomfortable with Australia's geography and with its contemporary economic, strategic and social realities. This should not be surprising. This is the same person, after all, who warned Australians in December 1987 not to be fooled by Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika. 'Don't be fooled by it,' he said, 'It is just commies up to a bit more chicanery.' This is the same person who argued consistently and vociferously in the late 1980s against economic sanctions against South Africa and condemned the government's anti-apartheid policy as mistaken and short sighted. You can see how the history books have treated that little operation. This is the same person who opposed the government's initiative for the South Pacific nuclear-free zone and supported the Reagan Star Wars plan. It is almost all in one speech. I have a Hansard extract of it-30 April 1986. Let me go to some of these points. Mr Howard said: We remain of the view that to impose economic sanctions on South Africa would damage the black community in that country more than anyone else. We remain of the view that it would be a short sighted, negative policy to impose economic sanctions. That is what he had to say on that occasion. Then, on the nuclear-free zone in the Pacific, he said in the same speech-this is on the same page: ... if we put a circle around part of the world and we declare it as a nuclear-free zone, in some way we abolish the capacity of any country to intrude nuclear weapons or nuclear activity into that area. It is a complete fantasy concept and in those terms we are not attracted to it. So that is South Africa and the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. Then I get moved to Star Wars-all in the one speech. He states: ... the Opposition regrets and continues to regret the approach taken by the Australian Government towards President Reagan's strategic defence initiative. It is a great pity that the Australian Government has taken such a negative attitude to the President's strategic defence initiative. The Opposition again states that it is its very firm view that the research initiative-the SDIshould be supported by the Australian Government. This was at a time when the Berlin Wall was three years from falling. This was at a time when, with Gorbachev and others, there were big changes in the Soviet Union. Big changes were underfoot within that bloc when the Americans were moving towards agreements to wind back nuclear weapons. And Mr Howard is in there barracking for the Star Wars initiative. Then he goes on to talk about Indonesia. In his speech he upbraids the government for doing too much in South--ast Asia. He said, 'We should be concentratmg on north Asia.' In 1986 he had this to say: But what has to be said and what the Government has to answer is its total failure priority to Australia's relationship with Indonesia over the last three years. In other words, in 1986 we were not doing enough for Indonesia; in 1995 we are doing too much. This is the sort of stuff that he has been into. The Leader of the Opposition knows that the relationship with Asia is important to Australia economically, but he would rather that it was not so. He just cannot commit himself to the fact that Australia's future is with the Asia-Pacific, particularly with east Asia; that no-one is going to tow the Australian continent away; that we are here; that we have to get along here and make our lives here; and that our future is here. He just cannot accept it. In every statement he makes in support of engagement with Asia he makes an opposite statement about what he calls the old, traditional loyalties. In his Asia speech he says: Enhancing Australia's relations with Asia will receive the highest foreign policy priority from a Coalition Government. In the next sentence he states: However, in saying this, the Coalition wi-1 not neglect our strong ties with our traditional fnends, allies and important trading partners ... He could not make the commitment and say, 'We will deal with Asia as our highest foreign policy priority.' He has to put the rejoinder in. Then he says: . .. the Coalition is committed to enhancing Australia's security links with South East Asia and North Asia ... The very next phrase in the same speech is: ... as well as with our traditional allies. There is something more than proper caution at work here. I readily acknowledge the work that some members of the Liberal Party and some parts of the Liberal Party have done on the development of Australia's relations with Asia; but the tradition of John Howard comes not from the tradition of Lord Casey or Andrew Peacock-he is not from that part of the Liberal Party. His views are as clear as day in his defence speech. I think th- most telling of all the things he had to say m that particular week was when he said: There are unresolved tensions between the government's focus on d-fence partners.hips with the region versus the regIOn as a potential source to give an adequate of threats. Mr Speaker, you do not need to be a lawyer to decipher that: 'There are unresolved tensions between the government's focus on defence partnerships with the region versus the region as a potential source of threat.' In other words, 'Here's this silly government encouraging the Singaporeans to do their flying training in Australia and to do the-r tank training at Shoalwater Bay. Here's thiS silly government encouraging the Indonesians into Kangaroo 95. But don't they realise they're also a source of threat? Don't they realise they could be the threat?' These are the countries to our immediate north. This is Indonesia-which has no designs on this country-Singapore and Malaysia. He is saying that our focus on a defence partnership with our friends in the region is a source of threat. In other words, they are the threat. This is pathetic stuff. When the paramount leader of Vietnam came here, Mr Howard would not see him. He sent him home to see the US Secretary of State, but he would not see him. He would rather get a bigger gun than have a conversation with the man. Instead of helping that poor little country, which has had the guts kicked out of it, you would rather get a bigger gun in your hand. In other words, you are still fighting the Vietnam War. And you want the stewardship of the Asian relationship with Australia. When asked, the Leader of the Opposition said that the biggest issue in the coming election will be that another group of people will take over the leadership of Australia. There is some sort of policy by rotation. You say, 'It's been their tum for five terms; it's now our tum. I should have the stewardship of Australia's fortunes in Asia.' The first duty of an Australian government is to look after the security of its people, and that means in its foreign policy and in its defence policy. That is our first duty. To be recreant of that duty, to be capriciously flying in the face of the relationships we have developed in the Asia-Pacific, to be talking to those countries, to be described by Singapore newspapers as blowing hot and cold and to be saying that they are a source of threats is to let this country down and make clear that he could not take the stewardship of Australia's relationship with Asia. Where the government is looking for strategic relationships which give us security in Asia-I emphasise 'in Asia' - John Howard wants security from Asia. He does not want security in Asia; he wants security from Asia. Does he think the United States will now look to Australia to manage a large economic and political debate in the ASEAN regional forum or in APEC? Do you think the United States wants a pathetic mendicant to walk through the door to the White House saying, 'Here I am. We're so hopeless that we can't defend or protect ourselves. Will you please put the big arm around us?' I know what Bill Clinton would say: 'Oh, God, not another one.' The US wants an ally that can actually stand on its feet, that can think and do things and that can run a debate in a part of the world about economic policy and security policy in which they can see common interests for themselves. We on this side of the House often say that John Howard is a man from the 1950s. If ever you needed proof positive of that, it was in those two speeches over the last week on defence and on Asia. He talks about Andrew Peacock and Richard Casey and extols their virtues, but they never had anything in common with your tradition in the Liberal Party and they never will. Let me make this clear: it is always a Labor government that makes the breaks, that makes the new changes, that strikes out with a different direction. The directions we have struck out here recognise that our place is in Asia, that we live here, that we are always going to live here, that we must deal with the region and that we have to develop structures in the region in which we can take part. Australians must know that that stewardship can never tum to an opposition led by somebody such as the Leader of the Opposition who is simply rooted in the Cold War thinking of the 1950s and 1960s. Western Australia: Blockade",47
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given that in his own words 'the first responsibility of a government is to look after the security of its people', will the Prime Minister explicitly repudiate tomorrow's 24-hour blockade of Western Australia? Will the Prime Minister tell the ACTU and other unions involved to stop his planned strike which will inflict great economic harm and personal disruption on over 1.3 million Australians who live in Western Australia? Will the Prime Minister take steps in the national interest to call off this strike that you have inspired?",49
109,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think he has lost it. I do believe he has lost it. By Jove, he has lost it! Let me just get this right: Richard Court proposes a set of draconian industrial reforms of the kind you endorse.",49
110,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What's draconian?,49
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor!,49
112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Western. Australian community react to it and now it is my responsibility. Is that right? It is a foretaste of how Australia would be under John Howard as Prime Minister and under the industrial relations policies of Mr Reith. We have now the lowest level of industrial dispute since 1940. We are down to 70 working days lost per 1,000 employees. When Mr Howard was last in office, when there was a Liberal government, when the conflict model was in full swing, that number, from memory, was 740 days lost in 1,000. From 740 to 70-that is the change. And yet, talk about being an economic Bourbon: learning nothing and forgetting nothing, there they are back with the same miserable policies; there they are back with the same draconian policies. There is a genuine community revolt in Western Australia about Mr Kierath; there is a genuine community concern about Mr Kierath and his policies. What Mr Kierath does with the industrial relations of Western Australia and how the trade unions and employees in that state react to him is their business; it is their business. I made that quite clear in Western Australia last week. I know the Premier is out there today trying to hide his responsibility by saying that I am the instigator of this blockade. That is a complete lie-a complete and total lie. There is only one instigator of the blockade, and that is the vicious Premier of Western Australia who wants to go after working people and give them a belting. That is what is on here. It is not our dispute; it is the dispute of Western Australia. But it is the same industrial relations system as the Leader of the Opposition got up and endorsed at the Western Australian Liberal Party conference-the same industrial relations system which produced this. You have members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and members of the business establishment saying, 'Kierath's gone over the top; Kierath's gone too far.' And yet these are the sorts of policies they want to endorse here. But when it starts to tum sour on them, what does he do? He gets up and asks me what I will do about it, trying to suggest that it is my responsibilitysuggesting directly that it is my responsibility. I have said this before: why do they want to chase working people? We are down to the lowest level of industrial dispute since 1940. The consensus model in Australia actually works. We have a 2Y2 to three per cent inflation rate. We have productivity running at about 21f2 per cent-that is about twice as much as New Zealand's, the model they endorse. We have profits at a very high level. We have real wages growth. Why on earth with real wages growth, reasonable profits-high profits, in fact-a low level of industrial dispute, strong productivity and low inflation would you junk the model? Why would you junk it for this kind of nonsense that Mr Fahey is telling us about on the weekend; that Jeff Kennett says he will round the Victorian workers up, like people in a cage where they have nowhere to go, like mice in a cage, trapped-'trapped' he says at a Business Council lunch-with industrial relations legislation of a coalition government; and from Mr Court and Mr Kierath. This would be the shape of Australia under a coalition government; we are already seeing it. But just imagine how workers would be treated if there were no federal jurisdiction like this, if there were nowhere to go, if there were no federal umbrella. What sort of a place would it be? Just three days ago at an ACOSS conference they were saying that there are examples of where flexibility in the labour market-that is, lower rates at the bottom end-produces more employment. But we have had the US Labour Secretary, no less a person than the US Labour Secretary, Robert Reich, telling us that America has an army of working poor, that they have had falling real wages for 16 years; and Mr Murdoch making a very important point about the rate of growth of Western countries. Dr Kemp-He made a very good point!",49
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,50
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here is the United States growing at a speed limit of 21f2 per cent, despite the fact that it has this army of working poor. It has not changed the flexibility of the US economy. But what is our average growth rate in the 1980s and through this period? Around four to five per cent. Mr Speaker, you show me any country that grows at four to five per cent over 20 years and show me a country growing at 21f2 per cent over 20 years and I will show you a lot of extra wealth created in that country. You take Australia; we are growing at four per cent. Australian GDP is $500 billion. Four per cent is $20 billion of wealth a year-$20,000 million. That is about a half to a third of the total GDP of, say, Malaysia-in one year. Lower wages and a vicious wages policy have done nothing for Australia. When we had those policies under Mr Howard as Treasurer, we had growth rates of about 1.9 per cent or two per cent. That is all we had. We doubled the rates under Labor with accord model. Under a consensus model have doubled the economic growth rate of Australia. That is the key point. Why should Australia go back to a Western Australian model? We will not have a bar of it. The security of Australians means two things, and this is where the Leader of the Opposition began. It means having a policy which makes sure this country is integrated with the Asia-Pacific region and it also their security at home, having policies that whole community can identify with. The open employment. Leader of the Opposition would have neither. Sheltered Workshops",50
115,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Is the minister aware of reports that the government is withdrawing support for tered workshops? What is the government's response to these reports?,51
116,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These alarming and of totally false claims were made by tion leader in his speech to ACOSS on Friday. He is acting at the moment in this area like the wolf trying to woo Little Red Riding Hood. I must say that the members of ACOSS are very sceptical because they are also seeing what is going on in state governments run by conservative Liberal and Country Party members; that is, ripping funds out of this sector. The accommodation policies for conservative governments around the country for people with disabilities are cause for complaint, yet I have not heard the Leader the Opposition say anything about that. Finding fact among the assertions in the sohas said: called headland speech of the Leader of the Opposition was pretty difficult-there was a disagree lot of waffle and not much that was specific-but he did make one specific claim. He new said, 'The government has seen fit to withdraw support for section 13 services, commonly known as sheltered workshops.' People in the area will know that that proposition is totally false. It is so out of touch with the reality of what is going on that I wonder who is advising the Leader of the Opposition. I presume it is the shadow spokesman, who got it wrong again. The fact is that the governan ment, far from having withdrawn support we from this area, is increasing funding. I am very clearly on the record as saying that there must be a continuing role for these so-called sheltered workshops because they can provide employment for people who have little prospect of working in open employment. For that reason alone they must remain. Other people may remain after a history of working there as a matter of personal choice means and, of course, it may be preliminary to the developing new skills so that they can go into We have provided an additional $26.4 million to these workshops. Funds have been removed only when there have been difficulties with organisations. We have had a review in this area, too, from a former Liberal health minister, who has done an excellent job of shelproviding advice to government. We are looking forward. We are not simply peddling untruths in this area-something the Leader the Opposition has clearly done on this the opposioccasion, and on many others. Western Australia: Blockade",51

You are living with your own chicanery. You are squirming with your own chicanery, so squirm away there.",52
121,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister seen reports that the social wage does little for Australian families? What is the government's response to these reports? What has been achieved for Australian families through the government's social policy agenda over recent years?,52
122,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen any authoritative or credible reports that suggest the social wage does nothing for Australian families. I have, however, seen some grotesque distortions of some recent work, particularly from the Leader of the Opposition, suggesting that the social wage does not matter very much. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition quoted a recent paper by Professor Anne Harding from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. He made the assertion based on that that somehow this paper confirms his view that the social wage does not matter. In this House when we were last sitting, he said: Professor Harding cast very serious doubt on the government's repeated claim about the positive impact of so-called social wage benefits upon poverty levels in Australia That is very interesting and very surprising given that Professor Harding has been responsible for some work in which she tries to quantify the cash value of some of the government services that are provided. Of the four social wage elements of housing, health, education and child care, if people were paying market rates for these things in the marketplace, the value to a family with two children would be around $200 per week. It would be rather surprising if Professor Harding had taken the view that the social wage does not matter, as the Leader of the Opposition asserts. Indeed the very paper that the Leader of the Opposition makes reference to directly contradicts that proposition. I quote Professor Harding from the paper to which the opposition leader referred: In summary, the provision or subsidisation by Government of non-cash benefits-such as health, education, housing and community services-has an important impact upon material well-beingFamilies 'important impact on material well-being'Excluding them from poverty measures may give a misleading picture of trends over time, if the magnitude or type of such non-cash benefits is changing. Similarly, it may also give a misleading picture of the economic well-being of different types of families at any particular point of time. Such issues have assumed greater prominence in Australia during the past decade. The federal government and the ACTU have traded-off increases in market wages for improvements in the 'social wage' on several occasions since the early 1980s. That is precisely the point. Under the Accord framework, we have had an explicit trade-off of social wage for money wage increases. Professor Harding explicitly endorses the significance of those social wage elements. In fact, in this paper she makes an attempt to quantify the impact on poverty rates, if you add in the social wage to the conventional cash incomes that people receive. There is an estimate here of the fall of those below the Henderson poverty line for all families from 10.9 per cent to 6.4 per cent and for all families with children from 11.7 per cent to four per cent. In other words, the impact is dramatic. Professor Harding did say that the methodologies underlying those sorts of estimates have a long way to go. They need a great deal of refinement and you cannot regard those estimates as definitive. That is what she said. The opposition leader tried to take that as an indication that Professor Harding said that the social wage does not matter. That is an absurdity and it is the diametrical opposite of what she said. We have seen a number of attempted forays by the Leader of the Opposition into the social policy area over recent weeks. We saw the latest of his series of wasteland speeches on social policy delivered to the ACOSS congress the other week. A rather slowly formulated set of commitments was provided. He said he would not do anything to dismantle the safety net. He said he would maintain the real value of the safety net. What does that mean? Does that mean he will retain a commitment not just to indexation of pensions, for example, but to retain this government's commitment to keeping pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, which requires significantly more than indexation? The benchmarks for family assistance this government has set likewise are set in relation to the pension rate, which we have improved in real terms in excess of the CPI. Does he maintain a comparable commitment to that? The answer is no. He says he has no secret agenda to slash $10 billion off the social safety net. That again is a rather slowly formulated commitment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition at budget time stated that the government should have brought down a budget this year which was in surplus on the adjusted ABS measure. That implies a reduction in the budget deficit through either increased revenue or cuts in spending in the order of almost $10 billion. That figure of $10 billion has credibility in relation to statements that opposition members have made. The Leader of the Opposition says that he will not cut $10 billion off the social safety net. What we would like to know is, if he is going to cut $10 billion in total off outlays, what proportion of that burden is going to have to be borne by social security-which accounts for 30 per cent of outlays-health, housing or other elements of the social wage? The reality is that he may not take $10 billion off the social safety net, but to achieve the sorts of fiscal objectives he has been talking about he will have to take a very large axe to the social safety net. It might not be $10 billion worth, but it will be a very large magnitude. People on low incomes, whom the Leader of the Opposition has lately professed concern about, have a great deal to fear from the opposition and the opposition's situation. They are a policy vacuum, with an absence of detailed policies, with commitments to cut spending-but we do not know from whereand slowly and misleadingly formulated commitments on all fronts.

In your speech at the VP Day commemoration, you referred to the graves of Australia's war dead, claiming: All of us should know Australians are buried there ...

How does the Prime Minister respond to those who say that your government's failure to properly commemorate Australians of the Z Special Unit-amongst them Jeffrey Willersdorf-who lie in unmarked graves in Dili, East Timor, is an act of hypocrisy? Will the Prime Minister begin proceedings to have these graves properly memorialised? Will he visit Dili, as he has visited other grave sites around the globe, and there acknowledge publicly the sacrifices made by the Timorese people on Australia's behalf during the war and Australia's subsequent failure to publicly defend the rights of the people of East Timor against Indonesian imperialism?

142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister was asked a question in respect of East Timor. The Prime Minister was responding. I am uncertain whether the Prime Minister's answer will then go to the issue which the honourable member has raised. The Prime Minister has the call; he is relevant.,54
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr Downer-You are back to the safety of your prepared answer.,55
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,55
145,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the questioner is seeking from me support for his statement that East Timorese supported Australians in the Second World War, of course, I would give that unambiguously. I would endorse that and recognise that unambiguously. But another linkage-an implied linkage-that, because we in this country are apparently incognisant of this or unappreciative of it, we then turn open Australia and turn over the refugee conventions which we have signed-does not follow. Nor does it follow that for one to feelMr Tim Fischer-You have missed the point.",55
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,55
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It does not follow that for one to feel appreciative and to recognise the sacrifices that Australians have made in the Second World War one has to visit every grave site in every theatre of war. That does not follow either. The questioner starts with a point which has no substance in relation to the question. His question really is: why is Australia unresponsive to the Mr MCGauran-What are you talking about?,55
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,55
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why is Australia unresponsive to the desires of East Timorese people when they were supportive of us during the Second World War? That is the question. It is in relation to this refugee point, and I hope I have given the answer. Landmines  representing the Minister for Defence. Can the minister inform the House of the outcome of the recent inhumane weapons convention which addressed the need to lessen the use of antipersonnellandmines? What is the government's response to the convention?  question and acknowledge his long standing interest in this matter. It saddens me to inform the House that the inhumane weapons convention review failed to reach an agreement on any limitations on the use of antipersonnel landmines. As much as that may come as a shock to Australians, I am afraid it illustrates that, in terms of changing world opinion, there is a long way to go. Needless to say, the government is bitterly disappointed at this failure. We share the frustration and anger of hundreds of thousands of Australians and others around the world who want to see some agreement and some progress on this issue. On behalf of the government, I very clearly put to the conference that we are committed to the eventual elimination of all antipersonnel landmines as an ultimate goal. In the absence of a widespread level of international agreement for such a total ban, we put to the conference Australia's very bold and practical proposal directed at getting rid of large numbers of long-lived landmines and replacing them with short-lived mines, except in a number of exemptions categories. It is sad to say that officials of our delegation have told me since leaving the conference that, in the actual working groups that went on for some weeks after the opening days, no country actually worked for a total ban as a practical proposition in those working groups because of the very insignificant level of support for it. Instead, the real battle was to achieve the adoption of Australia's position, which was supported almost completely by the Mandela government of South Africa, the Canadians and the New Zealanders, as well as a number of other countries, whose first preference was for a total ban. Although Australia's position did receive widespread support, even it was considered too radical by a number of countries. Unfortunately, because the conference could reach agreement only on a consensus basis rather than a voting basis, the conference stalled on the hard realities of international negotiations. Much of this lack of interest in movement by a number of countries has, I am now convinced, less to do with military doctrine and security considerations and more to do with the costs of replacing existing stockpiles. In conclusion, this setback does not mean we will give up. In the coming reconvening of the conference in January through to April and May, Australia will continue to fight for a better, improved and strengthened convention, in so far as it applies to the protection of civilians from antipersonnel landmines and their misuse. Our government's approach to the reconvened conference will continue to be guided by our commitment to the goal of the ultimate elimination of antipersonnel landmines. Western Australia: Blockade",55
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that a few days ago the Minister for Industrial Relations, commenting on the projected strike in Western Australia, had this to say: ""Before we were apprised of what the union movement had in mind for the blockade at a national level, I had some reservations,"" Mr Brereton said. ""But can I say that I have none today."" I also remind the Prime Minister that the Deputy Prime Minister, when addressing a meeting of Western Australian unionists after he launched an employment program in Perth, gave strong support to the blockade and he said that the blockade had national support. In view of the new position of the government today-that it neither endorses nor disendorses the strike-can I take it that you have repudiated the statements of both your deputy and Minister for Industrial Relations?",56
151,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to read to the House what I said, and the only things I have said about this matter, in Western Australia during my visitMr Downer-And what about what Laurie said?",56
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,56
153,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and from which no honest editor could have run the front-page headline in the West Australian. I said this person in Australia!,56
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Prime Minister has the call.,56
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And do you include the ABC?,56
156,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me read it. This is the only thing I have said about it. This is the only evidence for Mr Court's claims. I said: Now, you know, you have got Richard Court today complaining about what he says is a blockade of Western Australia. But this year we had the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940, as I said earlier. The lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940. There is no problem in Australia with industrial relations-only the ones that are generated by snaky, spiteful Governments. And they shouldn't be at all surprised that working men and women say we have been part of a cooperative process for ten years, we have got a competitive economy and a competitive State and we shouldn't be treated like this and we are protesting about it. Now that is why they are blockading and he knows that. But he is not prepared to lead for everybody. He is still leading for Peppermint Grove and down the wharf. From that, a reporter in the ABC ran a line saying that I was supporting the blockade. My press secretary rang the ABC and said that on what I had said there was no basis upon which that claim could be made. But, once the ABC had given the West Australian the chance to run its headline, that low rent rag then put on the front page that I am supporting the blockade. Mr Speaker, they were my sole remarks. I just add to an answer I gave earlier, when I had some confusion about the social meanderings of the shadow Treasurer. It was not the Sydney races; it was the AFL grand final breakfast. Police Corruption",56
157,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. I refer the minister to reports that the New South Wales royal commission has revealed corruption in. the Australian Federal Police. Would the minister inform the House as to the federal government's response to those reports.,56
158,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, the first reaction is one of disappointment. We are extremely disappointed but we are also realistic. I make that the first starting point: no police minister should ever claim that there could be no corruption within his or her police force. There are a few starting points I would make about this issue. The Australian Federal Police officers who admitted to corruption at the royal commission have left the force, resigned since admitting their corruption or have been stood aside. The federal government and the Australian Federal Police are committed to providing complete assistance to the royal commission. Most of the royal commission's investigators, including its chief investigator, are in fact Australian Federal Police officers. I have complete confidence in the integrity and ability of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Palmer, who I appointed in 1994. I have asked the commissioner for regular briefings on issues arising from the royal commission so that I can be satisfied that every appropriate action is being taken. As I said, it would be naive to pretend that corruption does not exist in police forces. Police officers confront the possibility of corruption, the opportunity to make more money in a moment than they earn in a year or a decade. The challenge for government and police management is to make the police environment as difficult and as hostile as possible to corruption. Consistent with that, the Australian government, with AFP management, has been moving in that direction for some time. Before my time, the government in the 1990s set up an internal security and audit division and also moved from long-term permanent appointments to contract based appointments, so that there could be review of contracts. In my period, in 1993 the federal government initiated the review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements. The Federal Police have begun their own restructuring processes to meet the challenges identified in that review. As members would know, the royal commission is finding that the greatest risk of corruption was in static units where police officers remain for long periods-units and squads which develop their own corrupt  Australian Federal Police is creating a more streamlined organisation with less focus on squads and greater rotation through different areas. I should nail speCUlation here that this AFP restructuring, which includes a redundancy program, is in some way a response to the royal commission. The restructure predated the royal commission. It necessarily involves offers of packages to middle management and is designed to do so, so that an organisation that has been somewhat heavy in the upper and middle management sectors can bring in a new blend of youth and experience. It does not arise in any way at all from the royal commission. This week we will be introducing legislation entrenching the Australian Federal Police Commissioner's power to dismiss police officers who are under serious suspicion of corruption or whose behaviour seriously deviates from accepted standards. The AFPA, the Australian Federal Police Association, has supported this move, in contrast to the attitude and approach of police unions in some other jurisdictions. This year, we have also given the Ombudsman power on her own initiative to start investigations of any matter involving the Australian Federal Police. Coming back to the important question that the honourable member asked, I simply do not know whether we have heard the last of instances of corruption within the Australian Federal Police coming out of that royal commission. I certainly hope so but I am not naive and I am not complacent on this issue. I do take some good encouragement from the sentiments expressed by the royal commissioner himself, Mr Wood, who recently praised Australian Federal Police management, the Australian Federal Police Association, Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and the Commonwealth government. Commissioner Wood said on the record: All I can say is that kind of commitment by the associationthat is, the Australian Federal Police Associationand its members is the kind of culture which one would hope to aim for down the track. He said: I would similarly wish to express my appreciation to the Australian Federal Police management for its support of this royal commission to date. That can be more properly and fully acknowledged at a later time. Commissioner Wood concluded: But it can be said that the Australian Federal Police, the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and, indeed, the Commonwealth government has provided this royal commission with its full support. I table the appropriate page of the transcript.",57
159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Johnson, Mr Leonard Keith",58
160,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 24 September 1995 of Leonard Keith Johnson, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Burke from 1969 to 1980, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Keith Johnson, as he was known to us, was born in Melbourne on 28 March 1929. He came from a working-class background. His first job was at the age of 15 when he worked for his father who was then an ice vendor. He then turned his hand to a variety of bluecollar and clerical jobs. His working-class background and his strong commitment to help fellow workers saw him join the Miscellaneous Workers Union as an organiser in 1965. Keith was active in local government before entering federal politics. He was a councillor on the Broadmeadows Municipal Council from 1961 to 1973 and was instrumental in the region's planning and development. He was reported as being the driving force behind the building of the Broadmeadows Club as a much needed social venue for workers and their families. Keith entered parliament in the same year I did-1969. He came to the House as the member for the Victorian seat of Burke. In his maiden speech to parliament, he drew on his experience as a city councillor, highlighting the importance of the provision of adequate services ranging from sewerage and public transport to schools and hospitals. He also expressed concern for equal pay for women and spoke about the danger of the exploitation of women in the work force. He saw the need to legislate for equal pay for women. Keith was a member of the Labor shadow ministry in 1977 and was spokesman on construction and assisting in industrial matters. He was Deputy Chairman of Committees in 1975 and became Deputy Opposition Whip in 1978. He also served on the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works, and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Standing Orders. Keith made many contributions during his parliamentary career. But the single act that he will be most remembered for would be the introduction of his private member's bill in 1974 which became the Parliament Act 1974. That act established Capital Hill as the site for the new and permanent Parliament House. The act also prescribed that the area bounded by Commonwealth Avenue, the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, Kings A venue and Capital Circle be designated the parliamentary zone, and that any proposal for the erection of buildings or other work within the zone must be approved by a resolution of both houses of the parliament. After retiring from the parliament in 1980 Keith continued to maintain his interest in local government. He served for a time on the Bellarine Shire Council, including one term as president. He was a particularly good fellow and he was very well liked in the Labor Party. He was one of those people who had enormous talent for most things he wanted to tum his hand to. He did not become a minister at any time during his tenure here but he was someone of great account. He was one of those people who pass through the parliament without achieving ministerial office but could have been of ministerial rank and really stood for things. That is one of the reasons I thought the House should take note of his passing. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Doris, his son Gary, his daughter Sharon, and his four grandchildren our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",58
161,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I second the motion and would like to associate the opposition with the sentiments that have been expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I served in the parliament with Keith Johnson for five years between 1974 and 1979. I think it is fair to say that from the Liberal Party perspective he was certainly straight out of that segment of the Labor Party that draws its nourishment and members from the trade union movement. He had a very strong knowledge of trade union affairs. He was a blunt, direct speaker. He participated in many of the MPls that were run on industrial relations during the early years of the Fraser government and the 18 months of the Whitlam government that covered the period that we were in parliament together. I found Keith Johnson on a personal basis to be a very amiable man. He never apologised for or in any way compromised the values that he held dear, and good luck to him for having had that sort of view. He helieved in certain fundamental verities, as he saw them, of what he saw as a class struggle that perhaps some would have seen in different terms. He was a very uncompromising, direct, authentic member of a category which is not quite as apparently represented in the federal parliament today as it was just on 20 years ago. Those of us who worked with him respected him and liked him. I join the Prime Minister in expressing condolences to his family.",59
162,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in this condolence motion. I point out that it was of more than passing significance that Keith Johnson was the mover of that private member's bill which ultimately decided the bitter debate which had raged over decades as to whether this parliamentary building should be on this location at Capital Hill or on a location close to the lake in front of the old Parliament House. There are few-perhaps, sadly, few too many-private members' bills that ultimately pass through the parliament and even less which have such great significance. Keith Johnson was the mover of that legislation and went on against some editorial and other opposition when it was suggested that this was just another attempt and it would never get anywhere. It fact, it did and full credit to the late member for Burke that it succeeded against the odds as a private member's bill. It was a vote along non-party lines and it resolved and it is one of the reasons why we are here at this location today. In saluting Keith Johnson's work, I mention one other thing. He had quite an unlikely interest in the Australian wool industry. As the wool industry works through yet another very critical, difficult and tough time, it is of more than passing interest that he pursued quite a strong attack at the time on wool industry policy and made the point that wool growers should be given a fairer hearing then-and, I might say, now-and I commend his work in that regard. I join in conveying sympathy to members of the Johnson family and I salute from the other side of politics his service as the then federal member for Burke.",59
163,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health)-I replaced Keith Johnson for a short period as the member for Burke before the redistribution and the area went into the electorate of Calwell. I want to put on the record my belief in his significant and very large contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to working people in the Broadmeadows area. At that time Broadmeadows was one of the most deprived areas in Australia. It was essential that actions be taken to improve the lot of people who were mostly living in Housing Commission homes, many from migrant backgrounds. Keith Johnson was instrumental in establishing the Broadmeadows Club, which served as a focus not only for the Labor Party but also for working people in general in that region. It provided probably the first venue for social meetings of that kind in what was a very deprived area. That is a lasting contribution. The club was opened by Gough Whitlam in 1977. Keith Johnson had great interest in the importance of local government and its relation to federal issues and worked very assiduously with local government both when he was a councillor and later when he was a federal member. I want to express my sympathies for his passing to his family-his wife, Dot, his children Sharon and Gary, and their grandchildren.",59
164,Mr OKEEFE,CONDOLENCES,"I, as the sitting member for Burke, would like to very briefly add to the remarks that other members have made and to commend the time that Keith Johnson spent representing the people of my region, particularly Broadmeadows. I grew up there and, like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, Andrew Theophanous, knew of his contribution. In looking through Keith Johnson's maiden speech, I was amazed at how little things change. In 1970 Keith talked about things like multiculturalism, urban and regional challenges, housing standards for our people; commented on the need for planning in the sprawl on the east, north and west of Melbourne; and ca]led for educational opportunity. I am sure he would and did take great pride in the establishment of the Broadmeadows College of TAPE, now called Kangan College, of which he also was a strong advocate. I had the fortune of meeting Keith Johnson in some quite strange circumstances just after Cyclone Tracy. I was helping my father lay some carpets in a house for a fellow named Johnson in Jacana. The phone was ringing hot in the loungeroom. Dad and I finally worked out that this was 'the Mr Johnson', the federal member for Burke. People from all over Australia were ringing up to try to find out what had happened to their relatives in Darwin, and he was harassing ministers in the government to get information. This was all happening from his loungeroom. I found that quite an enlightening experience. I last met Keith a couple of years ago at a road opening with the now member for Corio, Mr O'Connor. We were doing a road opening and Keith, who had since retired with his family down near St Leonards, came along just to make sure that we were still on the ball. So he did carry his interest in politics all his life. I, as the sitting member for Burkl-, would like to convey to his family the same thoughts as other members on both sides of the House. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Drury, Mr Arnold Joseph, OAM",60
165,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deepest regret at the death on 10 October 1995 of Arnold Joseph Drury, OAM, a Senator for the state of South Australia from 1959 to 1975, places on record its appreciation for his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Arnold Drury was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 23 July 1912. He had a military background. He enlisted in the Australian Military Force in 1942, was later transferred to the Australian Imperial Force and served in the south-west Pacific area. He was discharged in 1945. Arnold Drury was first elected to the Senate in 1959. In his maiden speech, Arnold showed a special concern for social justice and made reference to the importance of a just wage, family support and basic education. He made many contributions over his 16 years of parliamentary service. Of particular note was his work as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence from 1973 to 1974 and as Chairman of the Subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs on the South Pacific Region from 1967 to 1972. He also served on the Senate committees on disputed returns and qualifications, publications, road safety, and metric system of weights and measures. He retired from federal parliament in 1975. Arnold went on to continue making a contribution to the community. He was active in the welfare of veterans and in community hospital and charity work in his home state of South Australia. He was a valued member and office bearer of the Lockleys RSL sub-branch and the Knights of the Southern Cross. He was also deputy chairman of the RSL Hospital Visiting Committee; trustee of the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Distress Fund; and a deputy chairman of the Thebarton Community Hospital board. He was awarded in 1986 the Medal of the Order of Australia in the general division for service to the community. He retired from the parliament in 1975. There would not be too many members here who would have known Arnold Drury. I got to know him over that period. He would have been here for six years during my tenure here. He was a quiet, unassuming man but a very decent and likeable fellow. In those days in the Old Parliament House there were places where members would meet and places where you would go for tea, coffee and those sorts of things. There was more fraternisation then than now and you got to know members of the opposition or the government, as the case may be, better than now. During that time. I got to know him not reasonably well but well enough, and I liked him. He will be fondly remembered and missed by those who knew him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Mona, his son Peter, his daughterin-law Kay and his four grandchildren our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",60
166,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I second the motion and would like to join in the remarks of sympathy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) concerning the death of former Senator Arnold Drury. I did not know him quite as well as the Prime Minister-Arnold Drury being in both a different house and a different party-but my recollection of him is of an immensely decent and courteous man. He did take a very strong interest in matters relating to foreign affairs and defence and he also had a strong philosophical commitment to policies that could benefit the structure of Australian families. He was a person who represented-I think it would be fair to say-a slightly different kidney of the Labor Party than the late Keith Johnson. Both of them, in their own ways representing those different traditions of the party, impressed people they met. I know that some of my Liberal colleagues in the Senate spoke very warmly of Arnold Drury. They found in him a person who could cross the political boundaries and speak quietly and intelligently about matters that he regarded as important to the future of Australia. My recollection of him is, as I say, of a very courteous, decent Australian. I support the Prime Minister's condolence motion.",61
167,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"As the Australia Remembers year of 1995 draws to an end, it is food for thought that the late Senator Drury was a member of that select band who served this country in World War II and then went on to serve in parliament. He joins people such as Tom Uren, the former Labor member for Reid and prisoner of war at Changi and later at the Burma death railway; former Liberal Senator John Carrick from New South Wales-both of whom are very much alive, let me hasten to add-who is also an exprisoner of war from Changi and the Burma death railway; and Charles Anderson VC, the former member for Hume and now deceased, who was a Country Party member and of course won his Victoria Cross in very valiant service on the Malaysian peninsular. There are of course now no Second World War veterans serving in the Australian parliament. Former Senator Drury was a member of that select band. As I understand it, as a consequence of his service in World War II, he pursued foreign affairs, defence and repatriation issues-as it was at the time with the minister for repatriation as opposed to the more modem title of Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in paying tribute to and saluting that service given by former Senator Drury from South Australia between 1959 and 1975 and extending sympathy to his family.

Secondly, I was not scurrying off overseas; I was overseas at the inhumane weapons convention trying to do something by talking to delegations, such as the Russians and the Chinese, to move them on a gross human tragedy that extends across the globe.

Nuclear Testing To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread community outrage throughout our Nation at the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to note and endorse the concerns expressed in this petition and convey to the French Parliament in the strongest terms Australia's opposition to this decision. We ask further that the House call upon the Government of France to reverse its position and abandon completely any further nuclear tests in the South Pacific. by Mrs Silvia Smith (from 417 citizens).

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned shows: the unjust and inequitable nature of the Government's policy to restrict Childcare Assistance to 12 hours per week where a parent is outside the workforce. This policy will cause hardship to lower income families, to the children of those families, and child care workers. The Government should be condemned for breaking its promise to ensure access and afford ability in child care. Under the Government's policy parents will have to pay full cost fees after 12 hours of child care per week if one parent is outside the workforce. This will widen the gap between rich and ponr, an.j many child care workers may lose their jobs Your petitioners therefore ask that the House should oppose the passage of this Bill into law. by Mr Vaile (from 16 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Home and Community Care",63
194,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Last week I accepted the invitation of the Australian Council of Social Service to speak at its annual congress. I was one of a number of parliamentarians who spoke at the ACOSS congress, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Since I spoke at that congress last week, both my office and I have getting quite a bit of feedback. This feedback has not been about what I said or what the Leader of the Opposition said. It has been about the Prime Minister and his ministers, and I have to tell the House that it has not been all that good. You would think the Prime Minister would be amongst friends at the ACOSS conference, but it was not as friendly as he would like to think. The one consistent message I received was: 'We're surprised that the Prime Minister of this country can't seem to address any substantial issues. Instead, he has to nitpick and try to bring down John Howard the whole time.' That is the same message as I am Child Care getting in my electorate. I will not embarrass the Prime Minister by giving any further detail of some of the comments I got because they were made in confidence. But I will say that the community services and the welfare sectors cannot be taken for granted by the Labor Party. They have certainly realised that after 12 years the government is bereft of ideas and is unable to meet new challenges. They are happy to direct, but they refuse to consult with the people who know the most about delivering services or the people who have the most to offer by way of knowledge and expertise; that is, the providers of community services whom the government funds. The Labor Party calls their approach to addressing the service delivery crises 'making considered responses'. I have to call it 'studied inactivity'. The community services sector is vital in anyone's mind to the maintenance of a safety net for those on low incomes and those disadvantaged through their health or through a disability. Even a cursory look at community service programs such as the home and community care program shows how important both the Commonwealth and the state government see the non-government sector as being. Many programs, such as Meals on Wheels, which may be operated by a government provider, still rely on superhuman volunteer efforts to make them work. But this does not seem to matter. As far as this government are concerned, they know best. They will not listen when they do not want to; they will not act when they do not want to. Last year the government received a report on home and community care from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It was an all party report which had a comprehensive look at the problems in home and community care. Some 80 recommendations were made by thisÂ· all party committee which would improve the program and ensure that its resources reach the clients most in need. It took the government one year to respond to those recommendations. To many of those recommendations it smugly asserted, 'Well, we're doing it anyway.' First of all, if that had been the case, there would not have been any need for the report. Secondly, it is hardly the response of a government with any drive or any fire in its belly. It is more a response of a government that is serving out its time until the election. It is tired, cynical and inactive. It believes that it needs to do little more than the minimum it thinks necessary to survive politically. Labor got a similar report card from the Commonwealth-state review of home and community care earlier this year, which for all intents and purposes is gathering dust on a shelf in the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health. Another example of the government's contempt for the community services sector is what is happening with the emergency relief scheme. This is something that has certainly affected me in my own area. The Box Hill Citizens Advice Bureau is suffering a 25 per cent cut in resources. This is the one organisation that can provide assistance at a local level on an ad hoc basis to people in dire economic straits. Looking back at my own talk to the ACOSS conference, I can say that there was one issue that really did strike a chord with the audience, and that was the lack of consultation particularly in relation to care coordination. This is relevant because two weeks ago we received a well-sourced leak not from this parliament but from the Labor Party. Michael Gordon wrote in the Australian: A major revamp of Medicare will be a centrepiece of Labor's strategy to win back disaffected traditional supporters at the federal election. Senior sources have confirmed that a review aimed at upgrading and modernising Medicare is ""near completion"", giving the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, flexibility to announce the results either before or during the election campaign. This is fascinating because I actually heard the Prime Minister that same day on Radio 3AW. You can imagine that Radio 3AW would be interested in this. They asked the Prime Minister, 'Well, what's all this about?' He clearly did not have a clue. He fumbled through the answer. He muttered something about changes in technology and having to update Medicare. He obviously was not briefed on what had been in the paper that day which was central to the government's re-election strategy. The article further reads: The Health Minister, Dr Lawrence, told a strategy meeting ... at the ALP headquarters last week that it was too early to brief them on the likely result of the review but that it was well advanced. This is the same Dr Lawrence who a year ago in this House in answer to a question from the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) about hospital waiting lists stated, 'This is a very important point. I want you to understand it. It's fit young people dropping out of private health insurance and they don't use hospital services.' If you look at the department's own figures, which were released at the Australian Health Ministers Forum at Melbourne in June, you will see that those same fit young people dropping out of private health insurance in a 15-month period will use 322,000 public hospital bed days this year or about 1Y2 to two pretty big state hospitals brimmed full for 365 days a year. This minister who says she cannot brief the ALP on this issue yet is the same minister who does not have a clue about why Medicare is failing, why the community is concerned about health and why health is now becoming the No. 1 issue. It is public hospitals that are driving it; it is waiting lists are driving it; it is the extra demand that is driving it. This extra demand was admitted by her own department to be to the tune of 1V2 to two additional public hospitals needed every year. It is very nice to know that the Labor Party think health is a problem and that they are going to have this major revamp of Medicare. But it is not going to wash. After 13 years we have heard it all before. Over the last 10 years we have heard about great immunisation strategies, and yet Australia ranks third worse in the Western world. In the 1991 budget we heard about general practice reform-six initiatives, five of which have never been seen since. At the last federal election, we heard about waiting lists, with Senator Graham Richardson at the time being the health minister-$100 million for waiting lists. The only trouble was that they had never wor-ed out how they were going to spend it. The $100 million was never spent, and it was clawed back in the last budget. Of course, that was going to be paid for by getting money from all these nasty doctors who had been involved in fraud and overservicing. The trouble was that they had not worked that out either, and the $100 million that they claimed was there was never found. We were to have a medical indemnity report, called the Tito report; that was first announced in 1991. It was supposed to be handed to the government after a brief four years. That also is sitting on Dr Lawrence's shelf gathering dust, obviously too hot to handle before the election. We had a birthing issues working party that never saw the light of day. We had great mental health initiatives in the last budget-all very noble, but the government only spent half the money, rolled it over into this year and pretended there were new announcements. After 12 years of hearing it time and time again, I think there is now a real reason why it is happening. That was told in another leak-and you can always tell when things are going badly for a government: there are leaks all over the place-to Michelle Grattan, on 4 October: Left urges PM to act on policy that The Federal Government needs to secure the support of leading interest groups and offer initiatives in health policy as part of its re-election bid, according to Dr Andrew TheophanousDr Lawrence's own parliamentary secretary... the Opposition has been ""clever"" on health compared with the past, managing to keep on the agenda waiting lists and private insurance, while accepting the main features of Medicare. The Government ""requires a concrete and workable policy to address the waiting-list issue"" ... Try all you like, we have heard the promises before; we have heard them for a decade. It is too late. You have had your chance. Ah Kit, Mr John",66
195,Mr SNOWDON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.52 p.m.)-This nation now prides itself on its multiculturalism-the diversity of the peoples that it represents. It prides itself on heading towards the centenary of our federation on a path of reconciliation with our indigenous Australians whose country we share. The Northern Territory, in particular, perceives itself as being in a very prominent position in advancing the cause of multiculturalism with its acceptance of diversity and tolerance. From my own point of view, they are standards which I think we ought to be aspiring to. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you would be aware that recently there was a by-election in the Northern Territory for the seat of Amhem. The outgoing member was Wesley Lanhupuy, a Yolngu man from north-east Arnhem Land who retired as a result of illness; he was a member of the Labor Party. On this occasion the Labor Party preselected Mr John Ah Kit who, by the way, comfortably won the seat with a two-party preferred vote of around 64 per cent-quite a strong victory, by any measure. Mr Ah Kit, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a very prominent Aboriginal person-an Aboriginal person of mixed Aboriginal and Chinese decent. Mr Ah Kit was preselected by the Labor Party because of the many fine attributes he has. He was Chief Executive Officer of Kalano, the major Aboriginal organisation in Katherine. He was then Chief Executive Officer of the Northern Land Council, one of the most powerful Aboriginal bodies in Australia. He was then Chief Executive Officer of the Jawoyn Association, the most successful regional Aboriginal development organisation, which secured the ground-breaking agreements to start the Mount Todd gold mine and jointly manage the Nitmiluk National Park; and established a nationally recognised, highquality tourism project and innovative training programs for Aboriginal people in the Katherine region. He has been an adviser to various government agencies and a participant in many national and international conferences. For over a decade he has had a major influence, I would say, on the path of government policy at a national level in terms of indigenous affairs. Mr Ah Kit ran his campaign based on the issues, the differences between the ALP and the CLP-which, incidentally, had two candidates running: one from northern Arnhem Land and one from south-east Arnhem Land, two Aboriginal Yolngu people. However, what we were hoping would not happen in this particular election campaign did happen. Despite the advocacy of multiculturalism, diversity and tolerance, the Northern Territory CLP government and its ministers ran a very racist campaign against Mr Ah Kit. They did this on the basis of identifying him as a 'yeller feller' - that is, a person of mixed Aboriginal blood. Mr Ah Kit is accepted as an Aboriginal person; he strongly identifies as an Aboriginal person. But he is also proud of his Chinese ancestry. In this particular campaign, the Northern Territory CLP, its ministers and its Chief Minister sought to pejoratively use the term 'yeller feller' in the way in which in America we hear the word 'nigger', or the way in which in Australia we sometimes hear the term 'black bastard' or 'white bastard'. The Northern Territory government chose to identify him as a 'yeller feller' and then, therefore, to try to alienate him from his Aboriginal brothers and sisters. They said that what the electorate should do was to vote for 'ceremony' men-these Yolngu men who hold ceremony for certain areas of Arnhem Land. At the polling booth I observed voters who were being spoken to by Aboriginal people, scrutineers and people who were handing out how-to-vote cards-some who I understand were being paid by the CLP something like $300 a day to do this-and having pointed out to them, 'Don't vote for that fellow; vote for the one with the same skin colour as me' - that is, identifying their skin colour as being different from his skin colour. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not and should not have to tell you about the sorry history of this nation using very racist and divisive tactics against Aboriginal interests on a constant basis-and, unfortunately, the CLP of the Northern Territory are past masters at it. They have run successive election campaigns based on the idea of dividing the community along racial lines, mostly on the basis of black versus white. The last two by-elections in the Northern Territory were for the seat of Arnhem and, prior to that, the seat of Arafura for which another Aboriginal person of mixed descent, Maurice Rioli-a champion footballer, as you will recall, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - stood. He was also identified pejoratively as a 'yeller feller' to try to alienate him from the other Aboriginal people within his electorate. I see this as a matter of grave concern. While we now have the sort of reclothed Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) advocating change in the way in which we should deal with one another in this country, we have his soul brothers and sisters in the CLP in the Northern Territory waltzing around the electorate, using quite racist and divisive tactics against people in the community. I would like to know if the Leader of the Opposition supports this view: that it is good politics to use race as a point of division between people. I would like to know whether or not he advocates this appeal towards the basest instincts of people; whether or not he would advocate people voting for someone because they were Catholic or non-Catholic. I would like to know whether in a nonAboriginal community, in a white electorate in Australia, he would say, 'Don't vote for that person because they are Chinese; don't vote for that person because they have different coloured hair' - or use any point of discrimination. But this is what has been advocated by the CLP in the Northern Territory, and I wonder whether or not it is something which the coalition supports. I wonder whether or not it is something which the Leader of the Opposition would be pleased to identify with. The truth, as I pointed out, is that the purpose of this exercise is to denigrate and demean the individual, in this case John Ah Kit, in terms of his community. These are the legacies of old prejudices compounded by movements such as social Darwinism and its cousin, fascism. In the course of recent history, indigenous families in this country have been immensely damaged by the social Darwinism practised by previous administrations, by policies of assimilation, by missIons and others, where mixed race children were forcibly removed from their families and brought up in social institutions which worked very hard to brainwash them and identify them as half-castes or coloureds. I do not know what this says, by the way, about mixed race people who actually hold ceremony, how they feel about this demeaning description being used against another Aboriginal person by the CLP in the Northern Territory, or what it means for those many thousands of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory who are of mixed descent but are being told by the Northern Territory CLP government, 'Don't identify as an Aboriginal person because you are not a proper black fella. You are a yellow fella.' They are the sorts of antics we are seeing now portrayed by the Northern Territory government and played out in Northern Territory politics. Why worry about the fact that it seems the NMthern Territory government has not changed? I quote from John Ah Kit's inaugural speech in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. In respect of these tactics he said: Does this mean that if a particular electorate was saying ""we don't want Catholic"", you would run an anti-Catholic campaign? Or if the electorate was saying ""we don't want a Vietnamese, or Chinese, or Greek or Cypriot"" candidate, that you would mount campaigns against these ethnic groups? We are talking about acceptance of multiculturalism and diversity in this country and the CLP says that it is proud of it. Yet at the same time it advocates a very racist campaign designed to divide the community. I conclude my remarks by quoting again from John Ah Kit's speech. He said: ... if we are to reach the new millennium with any hope at all of having a cohesive, stable society that re-pects and celebrates difference, race must stop being used as a way of promoting the kinds of fears that we have-all of us-suffered for so long. (Time expired) East Timor",68
196,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for the people of East Timor. Today is actually the 20th anniversary of the deliberate Indonesian killing of five Australian based journalists in East Timor. That, of course, was a prelude to the full-scale invasion of East Timor which subsequently took place. The treatment of the East Timorese by successive Australian governments has been nothing short of disgraceful. The recent treatment of East Timorese refugees by the current government has really plumbed to new depths of hypocrisy. Throughout the past 20 years, the policy of appeasing Indonesia at all costs, rather than exposing the wrongs which have occurred in East Timor, must make people wonder whether we as Australians have any credibility on human rights at all. There are many ironies in the Australian attitude to East Timor. We have this year commemorated the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. During that war, the Timorese were our allies. The loss of life in Timor during the war was as great as 60,000-up to 15 per cent of the population. The people of Timor suffered grievously for their support of Australian and Dutch commandoes who had landed there. I notice that the question asked today of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) alluded to this particular situation. The member for Wills referred to the Prime Minister's speech on the VP Day commemoration. He went on in his question to implicitly point out the inconsistency between the Prime Minister's position and the situation that exists with the current treatment of East Timor. The question that was asked, of course, was relevant and does coincide, as I said, with events which happened 20 years ago. The Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 was marked, then and subsequently, by extreme brutality. As many as 200,000 East Timorese may have died between 1975 and 1980. Today, many Timorese feel marginalised and oppressed in their own homeland. Few Timorese have benefited from Indonesian investment in East Timor. Of course, whenever there is a murmur of protest raised we are made aware of the amount of activity there has been by the Indonesians in East Timor. Yet East Timor remains underdeveloped and poverty stricken, with the lowest per capita GDP in Indonesia. It has a 50 per cent illiteracy rate and an infant mortality rate of 106 per 1,000. Housing conditions are appalling, with less than one-third of houses being built of modem, durable building materials. Indonesian development has occurred in a way which has heightened social problems and tensions in East Timor. Unemployment is severe and young Timorese in particular perceive that the few jobs that are available are taken by people from outside the territory. In rural areas in particular, there is evidence that Timorese have been dispossessed of their land by migrants, by Indonesian army officers or by Timorese who are working for army officers. The situation in East Timor has been tense for a number of years, particularly so since the Dili massacre, which occurred on 12 November 1991. A number of other events have occurred since then. For example, 29 Timorese students occupied a comer of the grounds of the United States embassy in Jakarta on 12 November 1994. That coincided with the APEC summit occurring at the time. On 12 January of this year, six Timorese were killed by Indonesian soldiers outside Dili. To briefly recount some of the history leading up to the present situation, in meetings with then Prime Minister Whitlam during 1974 and 1975 the Indonesian government gained the impression that the Australian government was not opposed to East Timorese integration with Indonesia. The Fraser government gave de facto recognition in January 1978 and de jure recognition in December of that year. In 1985, the Hawke government reaffirmed Australia's recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. Today in this House the Prime Minister, in his answer to the question by the member for Wills, restated that the Australian government's position on East Timor is the status quo; that is, that East Timor is a part of Indonesia. In all of this, leading up to events this very day in this House, a lie has been perpetrated and maintained. Australia's relations with Indonesia are important. There is no denying that. They are extremely important. Trade between our two nations is vital to both of us. But East Timor will not go away. The capacity of East Timor to be an irritant in Australia-Indonesia relations was graphically underscored by the proposed appointment of Lieutenant General Mantiri as Indonesian ambassador. It is not entirely clear why this occurred or whether it was a deliberate act of Indonesian government, but certainly it displayed a certain amount of ineptness in that it occurred and went so far without the Australian government and our foreign minister making the Indonesian government aware that we were not going to be happy about the appointment of General Mantiri as ambassador. In the event, the embassy has remained vacant, for the time being. The latest episode, the arrival of 18 hoat people in May of this year, is a further embarrassment. The government's solution to this particular problem has been described by the president of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, as a cowardly way out. It is a cowardly way out. This was reinforced, as I said, by the Prime Minister's answer to the question of the member for Wills here today, which hides behind a narrow, legal interpretation of the status of these people from East Timor. The cause of boat people is not a very popular one in Australia. Most people probably take the view that boat people should be sent back where they came from. But I think there is a particular sentiment for the East Timorese people, especially because of their support as our allies during the Second World War and the fact that they paid so dearly for that support of Australian soldiers who were stationed there. Twenty years after Portugal abandoned East Timor it is convenient for Australia to argue that the East Timorese are Portuguese. That is a totally hypocritical situation. It is made even worse by the fact that previously a number of East Timorese have been granted refugee status. I believe it is now time for Indonesia to recognise that it has lost the battle in East Timor. Its current policy is untenable. The situation in the area has changed dramatically since 1975 when it may have had some justifiable concerns about the rise of communism. The fall of Saigon had occurred not long before that. There was considerable communist activity within Indonesia itself. But the situation today is very different. Australia could play a constructive role in bringing about a solution. I believe a referensold dum should be held to allow the East Timorese to determine their own future. The Australian government should in the meantime change its position and pressure the Indonesian government to allow this to happen. Banking Manufacturing Industry",70
197,Mr CAMPBELL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The grievance debate gives members of parliament an opportunity to raise matters of concern to the whole community. I have mentioned in this House before the performance of the banks in Australia during the 1980s. I want to touch briefly on a couple of issues. In Kalgoorlie there was a company called Boulder Brick and Tile. It had a loan with the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think the Commonwealth Development Bank-and I said at the time-foreclosed under very unnecessary circumstances. It appointed a receiver manager who promptly sent what was a very viable business broke, as is often the way of receiver managers. Lloyd Hirst, who was the principal of Boulder Brick and Tile, a man well advanced in years, was made virtually destitute by the actions of the bank. Yet he has fought on valiantly and has now won the right to take the Commonwealth Development Bank to court for its behaviour, which I think was totally unprincipled, wrong and certainly economically damaging to itself, apart from the havoc it wreaked on the people whose assets, in my view, it wrongly confiscated. There are other cases. I note with some amusement that Citibank has just been recognised as the premier foreign bank operating in Australia. I well recall that Citibank was the secured creditor for the Kalgoorlie Hotel. The bank foreclosed in a situation where the debt was well and truly covered. A receiver manager was appointed who upped the costs of running the hotel enormously. The hotel, too, went broke but not before the bank had refused an offer of $400,000 for it, which would have cleared all the debts and left some small amount for the then owner. There was a downturn and subsequently the hotel was for considerably less than $400,000. I believe the bank had a fiduciary duty to ensure that it did not sell the bank at any time for any less than the offer it had rejected. Unfortunately, banks have enormous recourse to financial resources and can afford lawyers till the cows come home. There is another case involving the Commonwealth Bank. Its harassment of a Mr Mullaly in Perth I think is well beyond the pale. I believe Mr Mullaly has a very good action against the bank for the way it behaved in matters pertaining to his particular case. I also want to touch today on industrial relations and a situation that pertains to Western Australia. It is a sad reflection that we have in Western Australia people like Graham Keirath who believe that the way to handle workers is by every draconian measure possible. On the other hand I think it is true that, while we have high levels of unemployment, unions are going to find it very, very hard to maintain a position against onslaughts from people like Keirath. I say, and say emphatically, that the only future for Australia is as a high wage, high cost country. There is no future for us in low wages. We cannot compete with Asia. I certainly do not want my kids to be working for Asian wages. I think we have to recognise this. We have a situation in Australia today where both political parties are adopting what is called a level playing field. We are stripping away all sorts of protection. I am not advocating a return to the old high protection levels and the cosy relationship that existed with the metal trades employers and the metal trades unions in years gone by. It is quite clear-I think it is as clear as day-that unless Australia returns to import replacement manufacturing there is no future and no assured employment for our kids in the future. This is very important for states such as South Australia and Victoria, less so for my own state. It will affect my own electorate least of all, but I believe you do have to look at the national interest because in the final analysis if someone is out of in Sydney or Melbourne or Adelaide or Perth they are likely to come to my electorate looking for jobs-it will simply move the problem around. There has to be a recognition that unless we return to that manufacturing there is going to be simply no long-term employment. We are told that the elaborately transformed manufacturing sector is a great success and has become more important in many sectors of the rural industry. I simply do not believe this. If you look at the figures, you will find they are what I call fudged figures. It is true that there has been a tremendous increase in elaborately transformed exported manufactured goods, but it has been off a small base. It has been going for some time and it is certainly a credit to this government, but the figures quoted are always the gross figures, not the net figures. There is always a very large import component in that figure which is simply re-exported. When I look at the progress of policies where the government enters into arrangements with people who are transferring into the country technological advancement I see a similar thing. IBM has been lauded for its success in exporting from Australia $550 million worth of computers. The reality is somewhat different. What IBM has been allowed to do has been import components at prices over which we have no control and all we really get out of it is the assemblyprobably somewhere between $50 million and $75 million. The sad thing about this is that, apart from grossly exaggerating the figures in terms of export value, the opportunity is denied to Australia to develop an indigenous hardware capacity. To develop indigenous hardware you need a prime customer-a big customer. The Department of Social Security is just such a customer and had the Department of Social Security been instructed that it had to use Australian hardware I am sure in a very short time it would have had a hardware system as good as anywhere in the world. You cannot do that without that guaranteed customer. Similarly, in the mining industry the CSIRO says that Australia imports every year $1.2 work billion worth of mining equipment which we could make better or cheaper in Australia. Remember, in the mining industry 'better' is the same as 'cheaper'. We have had some small success in this area. If you want to establish a mining sector manufacturing industry on a large scale, you need three things. First, you need a state-of-the-art customer. Australia is without a doubt the most advanced country in the world in terms of mining, particularly hard rock mining and open pit mining. Secondly, you need a large customer. Australian mining companies are large by world standards. Thirdly, you need government will. I believe it is government will that has been lacking both in this my own government and in previous governments. We are told that we must value add into Asia. The truth is that Asia does not want value added mining products. It wants the raw materials because it knows, quite correctly and quite sensibly, that that is where the big advantage and the jobs are. What we have to do is value add the front end by manufacturing equipment in this country. This would allow us to develop a significant export industry based on the mining industry which would be enduring long past the time when what we have to show for our efforts will be large holes in the ground. I could go on at length about this. As I am about to run out of time, I will leave it there. This matter is of the utmost importance to Australia. I stress again-it cannot be stressed strongly enough-that without a return to import replacement manufacturing and a viable manufacturing sector generally, there will be no jobs for the future. The call for tertiary sector is a furphy. The tertiary sector is largely in the tourist industry which offers part-time and low paid jobs-jobs for women and kids. It is not a replacement for bluecollar jobs. (Time expired) Drought Current Account Deficit Unemployment",72
198,Mr KATTER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to speak about the scourge of drought throughout our country, the current account deficit and unemployment. The cost of drought in 1965-66, in that one year, to the Australian economy was $8.2 billion in today's terms. In the 1982-83 financial year the cost of losses to the Australian economy was $7.5 billion. The projected loss to the Australian economy for 1994-95 is $11.2 billion. How a country as small as Australia can keep sustaining those losses is beyond comprehension. The simple fact of the matter is that we are not. Our cattle herd has fallen by 30 per cent and our sheep shearing-<mr wool production-this year will be down 40 per cent on what it was some years ago. That is only part of the story because this is for a single year. Clearly the drought did not start in one year and finish in the same year. A string of drought years surround a bell curve, if you like, with the maximum years being those that I have defined. The figures for those three droughts would show losses well in excess of $60,000 million to the Australian economy. However, the figures do not take into account the loss of the calf factory-the cow. In India they have a sanction not upon the killing of the ox but of the cow, which is the calf factory, and a lot of logic attaches to that sanction. In one small drought in North Queensland in 1986, 158,000 female cattle were slaughtered. In 1987, the figure was nearly 159,000; and in 1988, a drought year, 192,000 cows and heifers were slaughtered. That means that 343,000 calf factories were slaughtered that year that should not have been slaughtered. At 60 per cent calving rates, that is a loss of 200,000 head a year at $1,500 per head to the the Australian economy. That is $300 million per year just in North Queensland alone. That was one drought. Unfortunately, we have had a series of years which were similar to 1988whether we call them dry years or drought years. If we extrapolate those figures across Australia-North Queensland has only one-fifth of Australia's cattle herd-we come 'Jp with a figure of $1.5 billion every single year because of the loss of all those female cattle during the drought years. It is not quite so easy to come up with estimates for sheep. But if we pick a similar figure for wool production we are talking about another $1.5 billion. I think that would be a very conservative estimate. I think anyone who knows the industry would agree that it is a conservative figure. Here we have a situation of not only disastrous losses over the drought years surrounding those three peak years but also the continuing losses every single year because of the loss of our female stock and our herds. In Australia we have five major assets that produce almost two-thirds of this nation's entire export earnings: our sheep herdtraditionally it has always been our greatest export earner---our coal reserves, our gold reserves, our aluminium reserves and our beef herd. In two of those five areas we have lost a third of our cattle herd and over a third of our sheep herd. I cannot talk about drought proofing Australia without paying some tribute to Ernie Bridge for the great work that he has been doing. I am very proud to be serving beside him on his Watering Australia Foundation. If I focus in on one of the four or five major schemes, I must say that we are not talking just about major schemes: we are talking about on-farm development as well in terms of the Watering Australia Foundation. Let me refer to the Bradfield scheme. Hard statistical and engineering reports have been done again and again. So there is no doubt about the figures. They have been assessed and reassessed. The annual income for a third stage completion of the Bradfield proposals would be $2.6 billion a year to the Australian economy, for an outlay of $3.2 billion. That works out at $200 million a year for 16 years which, I venture to submit, is not a large amount of money for a government spending $120,000 million a year. But it is not $200 million, because 60 per cent of that money will go on wages. For every person we employ there will be a reduction of one person on the unemployed list. So in actual fact, even though we are paying $644 a week-the average weekly earnings-to someone to get up on a dozer and start work on this massive project, we are taking somebody somewhere off the dole if we create this extra job. So there is a diminution in the unemployment benefit. To quantify that, $120 million of that $200 million goes in wages and $60 million of that is a reduction in unemployment-the difference between average weekly earnings and the unemployment benefit. I think it is reasonable to say that it is 50 per cent-that is what the economists say-and there will be another $125 million because these people are now earning money and are paying taxes. So the difference between paying them to sit on their hacksides and do nothing and paying them to get up on a dozer and start building these magnificent schemes is very small. In actual fact, that figure of $200 million a year shrinks down to a $115 million net outlay. I will come back to the figures in a moment. If we proceed with the Daly River diversion, which is one of the proposals-I am pleased to see the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) is here today, and Sue Bradley is also on this body-and if we talk about the diversion of Fitzroy and the Ord in Western Australia and about the diversion of part of the Clarence River in New South Wales-heaven only knows that is a scheme that is crying out for attention at present because of the condition of the Murray-Darling system-we are talking about an increase in income to the Australian nation of $5,000 million a year for a net outlay of about $250 million a year. I am very pleased to see the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on the other side because in his book he says a lot about the things that I am talking about here this evening. What if we combine with that $5,000 million? I think that this absolutely has to be done now in the sheep industry. Are we going to continue to sell the nation's greatest product at below cost of production. We are now into our sixth year of selling below cost of production. It is an act of insanity and national harikari. If we move into the same regime as the sugar industry sells under now-which is our single best seller-combined with a set of minimum price schedules, we will be restored to the situation which was thrust upon us by the towering incompetence and irresponsibility of the now Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) and the then minister for primary industries, Mr Kerin, which destroyed the minimum pricing scheme for Australia. Those on the other side of the House should know about minimum pricing. It is exactly the same as the industrial award. But, whereas those opposite condemn us for questioning the industrial award, they went in with axes raised and completely destroyed our industrial award in the Australian wool industry. These outlays are revenue neutral. The Snowy cost $4,000 million and it is bringing in $2,300 million a year. That is $800,000 in taxes per year. It pays for itself every five years. Emerald-$60 million. It has got an annual income of $66 million in export earnings. It is paying for itself every three years just in taxation-the same as the Snowy. Even the great white elephant the Ord, which in terms of today's money cost $300 million for construction, is projected to bring in $75 million to the Australian economy this year, which is $25 million in taxes. It is paying for itself every 12 years. For a government not to proceed down this pathway is to betray the 30 per cent of our youth who are unemployed at the present moment and the state of our nation. (Time expired) International Financial Markets",74
199,Mr LANGMORE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to address a significantly different though another important one, from that of the previous speaker, the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). This is the issue of international financial markets. There has been considerable growth in dissatisfaction with the functioning of international financial markets over the last decade. They have become much more unstable, there is a cost to business through having to hedge against the consequences of currency instability, monetary authorities have greater difficulty in managing monetary policy because of the level of inflows and outflows, and, as well as that, there are all kinds of issues relating to debt and lack of resources for very important global issues. Last week I had the privilege of attending the first conference that has ever been held on a proposal by James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics, for a small levy on international financial transactions which he recommends as a means of addressing several of these problems. He made this proposal first in 1976. It was first published in 1978 and there has been a lot of interest in it again during the last couple of years when there has been so much instability in international financial markets. Tobin originally proposed the idea because he thought that it would contribute to reducing the instability of exchange rates by penalising very short-term financial speculation and that introducing a small fee for currency transactions would have the effect of reducing short-term speculation, lengthening the time horizon of the speculators and contributing a little to greater independence for national monetary policy. Since then, there has been a lot more thought given to the issue. The conference I was at had been called by the United Nations-and was the result of about 10 commissioned papers from leading scholars in the area in the United States, Britain and several other countries-to debate whether this proposal was feasible. Whenever the idea has been brought up, people have said the tax would be too easy to avoid. They have asked how you could enforce it in such complex markets as the international currency markets issue, have now become. People have asked what rate would be charged and whether it would discourage longer term investment or trade. Those kinds of issues have been raised. This conference was aimed at discussing the technical issues surrounding this proposal. It was not about the political feasibility. That is another issue which has to be addressed at a later conference. These issues of technical feasibility were all addressed. The conclusion of the scholars and financial market dealers was that the proposal was technically feasible. There was also some revision of the purposes for which the tax might be collected. I think it was generally concluded that the greatest value of the tax is that it would be a major generator of revenue in the most electorally attractive way. All Western countries now have budget deficits. Australia is going to move into surplus next year, but every other Western country is running a deficit and is therefore anxious to find electorally attractive ways of reducing that deficit or eliminating it. It is hard to imagine a more electorally attractive tax, or revenue measure, than a tax on speculators. Who likes the speculators except themselves? It would be like having a tax on bank profits, which a lot of people would find attractive too, but it is even more attractive than that. Why should speculators be the only group in the community who do not pay a tax of this kind? The value of the revenue would be both to national governments and also, it is hoped, to the international community, because, if a small portion of the revenue was used for the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international organisations, it could be used in ways which would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of international financial markets, reduce risk and also fund more broadly international development c'Joperation. One of the outcomes of the crisis in Mexico and the disaster in the Barings Bank has been a recognition of the need for greater surveillance-prudential supervision, if you like-of international currency markets. There has been recognition that there should be more information collected, that it should be more readily available-in other words, that these transactions should be more transparent-and that there should be reserves available for coping with crises. After the Mexican crisis, immediate action had to be taken by the US administration, the IMF and the European Community in a quite unprecedented way in order to get over what could have become a real disaster not only for developing countries but for financial markets generally. In order to prevent that, unprecedented action was taken. The outcome of recognition of the seriousness of that disaster was that there need to be increased funds readily available for coping with such a disaster in the future. Such an increase in funds was debated at the IMF annual meetings last week in Washington and a proposal was put for doubling funds available through the general arrangements to borrow. Australia has been asked to contribute to that, and will do so provided it gets a share of the responsibility for deciding how those funds will be used. Those are some of the kinds of activities which would be of direct value to financial markets and which could be funded through revenue from a levy of this kind if it were introduced. More generally, the funds from the levy could be used for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of capital markets within emerging countries where there is a lack of sophistication, a lack of technology, recognition of technique, where standards are not as strong and where training is very important. Those are some of the more indirect activities for which the funds could be used in effective ways. Even more generally, there are many aspects of international activity now where funding is quite inadequate, and everyone recognises that. That is because, in a sense, we have a situation of market failure in the global community where, in an increasingly globalised world, we do not yet have funding arrangements which guarantee",76

201,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the Fifty-eighth general report of the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",78
202,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's Fifty-eighth general report covers the period January to December 1994. As in previous years, 1994 was extremely busy for the committee. The committee tabled 13 reports regarding projects which cost more than $320 million. This outcome followed the committee meeting on 77 occasions during the year. Nineteen public hearings and 29 inspections were held in centres as far afield as Port Wakefield, South Australia; HMAS Stirling on Garden Island, Western Australia; Northern Territory; and Queensland. The projects examined were equally diverse, ranging from the upgrading of a transonic wind tunnel for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to overseas works in Hanoi and Port Moresby to a new housing development for Defence personnel and their families in Sydney. Recommendations made in the reports similarly were wide ranging, and the vast majority of them were accepted by the government and will be implemented. A number of common themes are canvassed in many reports. These include the need for project designers and constructors to provide measures designed to conserve energy and water; measures designed to facilitate ease of access to people with disabilities; measures to protect the environment and heritage; fire safety measures; the involvement of local construction industry in projects, especially outside major capital cities; and the need for more rigorous analysis of sites selected for construction projects to ensure that they are not contaminated. During the year the committee was briefed by officials from a variety of departments and agencies. These briefings covered such matters as private funding on a proposed car park at Melbourne airport; the future of the army's base at Puckapunyal and RAAF base Williams; the Christmas Island rebuilding program; concurrent documentation; value manReport agement; new directions for Australian Estate Management, which is responsible for managing the Commonwealth estate, estimated to be worth $2.5 billion; and the activities of the Construction Industry Development Agency. The committee also spent time inspecting projects previously examined during their construction or upon completion. A number of inspections were undertaken during the year in Perth, Sydney, Singleton, Myambat and northern Australia. In previous years I have canvassed the inability of the committee to travel overseas to inspect overseas projects. I do not intend to canvass that this time except to say that, in my view, the government is being extremely short-sighted. We deal with embassy and chancellery constructions worth millions and millions of dollars. Even in this last year we have been dealing with projects worth almost $100 million. Many of us on our own trips overseas have inspected these projects. I inspected the Washington building refurbishment this year. It seems to me that there is no question about sending bureaucrats all the time overseas to inspect these. In a case dealing with a housing project in Port Moresby, we proved that, by the time they brought all the officials down and airfreighted all the projects and all the scales, we could have gone there and inspected that project for half the cost, if the government had agreed to send the committee over to have a look at these projects. There has recently been some debate about housing development in Indonesia. We asked to go and inspect that. We would have saved the government many thousands of dollars, as we have in other projects. In fact, we have saved the government millions of dollars. I think it is frightened that, if it were to send the Public Works Committee overseas, everyone would rush to join it. Already there is a great waiting queue of members to join the Public Works Committee. I am not quite sure why because it is a very hard working committee, but I believe that the government is being extremely short-sighted in its penny-pinching activities. It seems to me that there is never any problem when it comes to bureaucratsbureaucrats are sent around the world all the time-but when it comes to a member of parliament it is a question of, 'The media might get onto this' or 'It will look bad.' I said that I was not going to canvass it this year, but a very good argument exists and it ""Nould show that the government would save many millions of dollars. In October last year, committee members attended the Third Conference of Commonwealth and State Public Works Committees in Hobart, and next month we will be attending this year's conference in Adelaide. Representatives of the ACT, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania public works committees attended. The committee believes the conferences provide an excellent forum for legislators to discuss issues and themes materially relevant to the examination of public works proposals. As the committee's work for the year concluded, and as the year of commemorations about the end of the Second World War was about to begin, it was coincidental that the last report tabled involved the redevelopment of a defence establishment-HMAS Watson, an establishment of exceptional historical significance in the defence of Australia. All over Australia, the work of enhancing, redeveloping or reshaping the infrastructure necessary for the defence of Australia continues. The committee can also reflect on the deeds of past committees, which reported on defence facilities used in the conduct of the Second World War. The committee has, in the past, played a major role in attending to the needs of returned servicemen and servicewomen. The report that I have just tabled lists the many repatriation hospitals that were examined and reported on. I wish to thank the members of the committee who made my job as chair much less demanding. I can honestly say that the committee does operate in a bipartisan way. Indeed, it is of value to the Australian taxpayer. The value the Australian taxpayer is getting for their dollar is the overriding concern of committee members. Finally, I wish to thank the staff-Peter Roberts, the secretary; Michael Fetter and Denise Denahy, the assistant secretaries; and Sue Whalan and Mahesh Wijeratne for secretarial support. I am sure all committee members would join with me in saying that the staff gave support and assistance far beyond the call of duty. I commend the report to the House.",78
203,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Fifty-eighth general report of the Joint Committee on Public Works will be the last that I will be privileged to speak to before I retire. I congratulate the chairman, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). To those people who are interested in the great work of the committee, there will be at least four vacancies on the committee in the next parliament. I commend the chairman and the other members. I have worked with. I do not believe that I have had as much satisfaction in any committee work within this parliament in 20-odd years as I have had with this committee. It is interesting work. It is work where you feel you are achieving a purpose, as illustrated by the many completed projects that the chairman mentioned. For example, to be able to get onto Maralinga, see that country and be at ground zero where the detonation occurred and then be called on to make a decision which, in the least, is going to be 24,000 years in its implication gives a measure of the interest and the degree of accuracy you have to have when sitting on this committee. I also wish to reiterate the complaint about overseas investigations with regard to some of our projects. The chairman is quite right. The sending of even a limited subcommittee overseas to actually see some of these sites and be able to make decisions having seen the sites would be far superior to the system of having all the specialists come here. In fact, I think two or three of those projects have been altered after the event. That might have been prevented if we had visited the site. I wish to comment on the manner in which the committee is still pioneering work regarding various departmental contracts. I mention contaminated sites. I believe the committee now has a degree of expertise in this area. It has highlighted this fact by asking to conduct a hearing and investigation on one of the sites. It is now one of the major complaints that we receive, but the departments are now prepared for the questions that we will ask. I refer also to solar heating. If it were for the committee's work on solar heating, Defence Housing may not have gone as far as they have, even though they could still go lot further. I would like to think that in next 12 months Defence Housing will take initiative and provide the type of housing required, irrespective of whether it is in tropics or in the bottom portion of Australia. I refer to tropical designs in particular; believe there has been a problem with airconcommittees ditioning and those types of things. One impediment which we as a committee are facing is heritage listing. When we hold inspections the first thing that is asked about is heritage listing. Some of these places might reflect an age of heritage but the buildings themselves reflect no heritage whatsoever. It is an embarrassment to contemplate construction around these heritage buildings which involves a greater cost or an effort to conform with the buildings when, over time, these will not be heritage buildings at all. This may be the case colder climates, but in the tropics wooden buildings have a terminal life span, and span could end with the next cyclone or the next infestation of white ants. I think it is absolute nonsense to suggest these places have heritage value. It just goes to show degree to which political correctness has crept into the work of the committee if such aspects hinder our work and cost the Commonwealth money when we are not prepared to recognise the reality of those situations. I would like to be here in 12 months time because I believe the committee, this year, has made progress regarding the insistence that contracts be drawn up so that subcontractors on Commonwealth programs are recognised and paid in full. We have putting this aspect in our reports. To the credit of the departments, every time we have asked the question, they say they have observed that in spirit, if not to the letter. To our knowledge, no contractor has failed to pay their subcontractors on any departmental project within the Commonwealth, whether it is above or below the $6 million limit. From this point on we must make sure that the states and territories do the same thing in not their public works. I receive a tremendous number of complaints regarding projects being built in my state for the state authorities a where the contractor has failed, and failed the miserably, and the subbies are the ones who the go broke. I believe we have struck a chord here. I pay credit to the Minister for Administhe trative Services (Mr Walker) for being alert to the problem. He is trying to operate in his I own way, but we must get the public works in the states to do the same as we are doing in order to protect the subcontractors and the people who provide services and also materials for the jobs that the state controls. It should be an easy job because the state is the master of the funds, as we are in the buildings in the Commonwealth. The other quantum leap that I will be investigating privately before I leave is to see whether we can give some protection through the securities act, in the case of liquidations, and through the Bankruptcy Act, in the case of bankruptcies. When contractors fail, there in should be preferential payment fer those people who have a subcontractual or service that commitment or who have supplied goods. As this is the last opportunity I will have, an I thank the chairman, the staff, those people who have been our clients and my fellow the members on the committee for the great experience I have had in the last three years. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 September, on particularly motion by Mr Bevis: That the bill be now read a second time.",79
204,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The been Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 includes amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which were foreshadowed in the budget. Some of the amendments relate to increases for funding amounts for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and are not controversial. The majority of amendments relate to HECS and are contentious, particularly the exclusion of permanent residents from HECS exemption and the introduction of new levels of HECS repayment. Part I of the bill sets out the revised ing levels of grants for operating purposes, superannuation expenses, open learning organisations, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. The bill varies the maximum grant amounts for operating purposes for higher education institutions for the funding years 1994, 1995 and 1996 and to provide a maximum grant amount for each of the funding years 1997 and 1998. The bill provides maximum total amounts of financial assistance payable to higher education institutions for superannuation and grants to open learning organisations for each of the years 1997 and 1998. It also varies the limits on total funds available for certain grants under the act in respect of the funding years 1994, 1995 and 1996 and provides a limit on the total funds available for such grants for the years 1997 and 1998. In addition, it provides a maximum total amount of financial assistance payable as grants in respect of teaching hospitals and a maximum total amount of approved expenditure for grants for approved special capital projects for each of the years 1997 and 1998. A voluntary payment of $500 or more in discharge of certain HECS or open learning debts will attract a 15 per cent discount under part 2 of the bill. Part 3 of the bill redefines taxable income for HECS assessment purposes. Part 4 of the bill introduces a new voluntary HECS repayment threshold$20,000-below the existing minimum threshold and allows a 10 per cent discount in respect of a person's accumulated HECS debt, where the person opts to make repayment of his or her debt when their income is between the voluntary repayment threshold and the first compulsory repayment threshold. New repayment thresholds are set down in part 5 of the bill. At present, HECS repayment thresholds are two, three and four per cent of taxable income, depending on the level of income. This part will see the insertion of four new levels-3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent, and six per cent. This is yet another change to the HECS system since its introduction in 1989, at which time the thresholds were one, two and three per cent. This was increased by the fund- Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No.2) 1990 to two, three and four per cent. Then, in 1993, the government decided that it would shift the goalposts on HECS again. The repayment thresholds were increased to three, four and five per cent in the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Act 1993. The government then made changes to repayment mechanisms to allow HECS to be repaid through the PAYE system rather then in one lump sum. Then, in a long-running saga from August to November 1994, the government sought to introduce a pro rata repayment system for HECS in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The coalition defeated this proposal which would have adversely affected those least able to afford it-part-time or casual workers and others on lower or erratic incomes. And still this government claims it is concerned about access and equity in higher education. As this history of the HECS experience shows, what the government has really been concerned about has been extracting more and more money through what are essentially fees from students. It claims that it does not support up-front fees, yet it is possible to make these payments up front and, of course, they are also fees, paid up front or not. They are increasingly substantial fees under the government. The government is seeking to speed up the repayment rate as much as it politically dares. In making these changes, the government is really concerned about how best to extract the maximum amount of money from students. Shortly prior to the budget the government floated the idea of increasing the value of HECS by 30 per cent of the total cost of a place rather than the current 23 per cent. The minister saw that the expenditure savings he had promised to the Prime Minister to help pay for the government's financial mismanagement were under threat. It seems that heads will roll unless the minister and his department are successful in achieving the change proposed in the bill. The coalition has taken the view that, if HECS is to be changed yet again, the change should apply only to future students. There is a basic inequity in this. Existing students have undertaken their studies with a very clear message from the government about their rate of repayment and the level of HECS and the government has mounted no reasoned argument in favour of the change that it is putting forward. The government has failed to justify why this change is necessary or why the change should not apply only to those students who commence their studies in 1996. It will be the intention of the coalition to move amendments to this piece of legislation in the Senate in accordance with the views that I have just outlined. The government has claimed that the coalition's proposed amendments to this section of the bill will cost $20 million and will result in the loss of 2,000 university places in Victoria and South Australia. The minister has given no justification at all for those claims. There is no reason whatsoever why the changes to the HECS proposals in this piece of legislation should be linked in any way to places in Victoria and South Australia. The decision to make that linkage is entirely the government's. If the government follows through amendments to this legislation by cutting back on places in those states, it will simply show the very low priority which the government gives to ensuring additional places for tens of thousands of qualified students who are still clamouring at the doors of the universities and who are unable to gain entry because of the government's refusal to fund those places. In this case it appears that the minister has effectively promised new places-he has promised them publicly-but does not have the money to pay for them. The government and the Expenditure Review Committee have refused to give him the money to pay for them. The solution is very simple: he said that he would ask the students to pay for them. He is now going around the country, telling students that if they fail to cough up the money they will be depriving other students of university places. That kind of blackmail against existing students is intolerable and it certainly shows the way in which the government goes about its business. On the one hand, it tells students that it is against fees; on the other hand, it is now asking students to fund additional places within the university system because the government itself is not prepared to find the money. The coalition is not proposing to allow the government to change the terms under which students have already undertaken their studies, the financial commitments that they have made and the plans they have made in doing so. The government can jump up and down and shout for all it's worth about the coalition's attitude on this matter but the fact is that the government has been utterly hypocritical in suggesting that it is the coalition's priority that will affect these places. It is noone's priority but the government's. The government will have to decide what it will do if the students do not cough up the money for these additional places. Will it keep its promise to provide the places or will it break that promise? That is a matter the government will have to face. It is not a matter that falls to the coalition. The coalition will insist on a policy which is equitable and fair to existing students. If the government does not like that, it will have to make up its mind what it will do about it. The government's position is also very unfair to universities which, over the years, have been requested to provide teaching and research opportunities to an increasing number of students at a diminishing rate of payment. Let's make no mistake about it: the government that has shifted a very substantial funding burden for higher education onto students is the Labor government. Nothing that it says can allow it to escape its responsibility for those decisions. The coalition is not about to be blamed for the government's failure to get its policy right. We are not about to be blamed for the government's failure to fund the universities properly. It is worth noting that the minister has absolutely no trouble at all in finding the money to pay student union mates-whose funding has been restricted by the introduction of voluntary student unionism in several of the states. The government is willing to see tens of millions of dollars flow to its mates in the student unions, doubtless in the expectation that these unions will campaign for it at the next election. But it is very noteworthy that the officials of these student unions-particularly those in the National Union of Students-are beginning to see with increasing clarity just what this government is about. They are increasingly unwilling to be used as pawns to further this government's narrow political objectives at the expense of the interests of the students whom they claim to represent. I think the government has some very hard decisions to take in thinking about this piece of legislation and it will have to announce those decisions when it confronts the amendments to this legislation that we will be making in the Senate. Let me make it quite clear that the coalition will maintain at least the number of places offered by the Labor Party. If they want to cut places, let me say again, that shows their priorities. From our point of view, it certainly demonstrates distorted priorities. Let not the government go around the country saying that the coalition will cut student places. It is not going to cut student places. Indeed, our whole view has been, for a very long time, that there is a great need for more places. For all the hypocritical rhetoric about the 'clever country', we have something approaching 25,000 students this year knocking at the doors of the universities and being told by this government that they will be refused access. At the same time we have well over 40,000 students from other countries coming into Australia and taking up places in our universities while Australian students find the doors barred against them. I do not think any Australian would see that as a satisfactory situation. The fact is that the government has stopped thinking about higher education. It has simply put up the barricades. It has squeezed as much money as possible out of existing students and is doing nothing to remedy the problems that have grown over the last 12 years. Let me make it clear also that the coalition is not about reducing places in Victoria and South Australia, where higher education is, as it is in every state, a very important ingredient in rebuilding the economies which have been destroyed in those two states in particular by incredibly incompetent Labor governments. I do not think that point needs to be stressed or underlined greatly because every citizen of South Australia and Victoria is only too well aware of the disastrous legacy of the Bannon and the Carr-Kirner governments and the tremendous damage done to those states, including the loss of the state banks. I will move on and briefly comment on the other parts of this legislation. Part 6 of the bill provides that HECS contributions which must be paid up front will not receive any discount. Part 7 of the bill provides for projects concerned with maintaining and enhancing innovation to be funded by way of the national priority (reserve) fund. Part 9 of the bill requires permanent residents, including New Zealand citizens, who have met the residency requirements for citizenship for one year or more before enrolment, to pay upfront fees. The government maintains that the intention of this amendment is to prevent persons from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving the country without ever paying their HECS debt. According to the Department of Employment, Education and Training, there are currently 26,800 permanent residents studying at Australian universities. Of these, it is estimated that approximately half would not have been permanent residents for three years and therefore would have the right to defer their HECS debt. It is further estimated that, of the remaining half, 85 per cent would take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year and that the remaining 2,200 students would be liable for up-front fees. The measure is expected to save $1.8 million in 1995-96 and $3.8 million in 1996-97 and 1997-98-a total of $9.4 million over the three years. This particular amendment has received a great deal of publicity. The coalition will be moving an amendment in the Senate which will ensure that the goalposts are not shifted on those already in the system. The amendment which we will be proposing will not result in some students suddenly being faced with the prospect of having to pay up-front fees when they commence their studies next year. The amendment we will move proposes that this section apply only to persons taking out permanent residency from 1996 onwards. At least then, students who are in the system at present will not be faced with the choice of paying up-front fees which they may not be able to afford or dropping out of the course which they have started. Of course, these are the very likely consequences of the measure which the government is proposing. It underlines, once again, the utter hypocrisy of this government in saying that it is not in favour of up-front fees. Of course, it is in favour of fees and this particugetting lar measure shows that it is directly attempting to introduce up-front fees. Not only that, but it never address the fact that there are many Australian undergraduates really paying up-front fees for their undergraduate courses because they are entering courses not for credit initially, for which they do pay fees. Having completed those courses and gained results in those courses, they are then given credit for those courses towards a degree. The government knows that, the students know that and the universities know that. That amounts to the fact that there are a number of Australian undergraduate students already paying up-front fees for their courses and their degrees. Let us have none of the constant cant from this government about its opposition to fees and up-front fees. They are there, they are fully in place, the government increases them wherever possible and this legislation is designed to introduce more of them. The coalition's amendment will be moved when the debate on this bill is resumed in the Senate. Let me conclude by making the point that the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum estimates that the changes to HECS will provide savings of $32.41 million in 1996, $56.77 million in 1997 and $37.29 million in 1998. Changes to funding levels will provide increases of $6.156 million in 1994, $84.403 million in 1995, $321.006 million in 1996 and then two overall amounts for 1997 and 1998. Once again, this piece of legislation and the arguments accompanying it in the public arena highlight the real priorities of the government in relation to higher education. Right at the bottom of those priorities is the opportunity for students to plan their higher education with a degree of certainty, knowing the level of fees and the repayments which the government will be expecting. Right at the very bottom of their priorities are the interests of students. The student organisations know that and that is why they are campaigning against these measures in the bill. It is no point government spokespersons up and telling us that this is not right. This is right. The existing students are disadvantaged by this legislation. They know that, the government knows that and it is the sheerest blackmail for the government to suggest that, if action is taken to protect these students, the government will lash out by cutting university places. I do not believe for a moment that the government would have the nerve or the guts or the hypocrisy to actually do that. I think its bluff is going to be called on this. If it does do it, once again students around Australia will see very clearly where this government's priorities really lie.",80
205,Mr SAWFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 implements measures announced in the budget. It provides for the growth in student places and research funding, confirms and strengthens the government's opposition to undergraduate fees for Australian students and builds on the essential features of the higher education contribution scheme. The government's commitment of support to our large, high quality, diverse and publicly funded higher education sector is proven. During the last 12 years funding for higher education has increased by over 65 per cent and the number of students has increased by over 70 per cent. In addition, funding to vocational education and training will increase by 70 per cent by the year 2000, creating an additional 40,000 TAFE places each year. This funding increase has been achieved without the introduction of up-front fees for undergraduate students. This bill builds on that record and maintains the principle of that commitment. Since HECS was introduced in 1988 it has played an important part in forging equity of opportunity in the education system. HECS does not require that students pay for their courses; simply that they make a contribution to the cost of their education once they are earning and have the capacity to pay. Those payments can then be put back into the education system to create more places for students in higher education, thereby spreading the benefits of education. It is a policy that I strongly support. However, the government is totally opposed to charging up-front fees for undergraduate Australian students, and the bill strengthens and reaffirms that commitment. The government believes that to introduce up-front frees for undergraduates would restrict access to those with the capacity to pay and run counter to the principle of equity and access based on merit. That is the principle to which this policy is built. This bill seeks to ensure that Australians, not foreign nationals, are the beneficiaries of this commitment of no up-front fees for undergraduates. In this way, the relevant provisions in this bill reinforce the principle of the commitment. We should contrast this with the opposition's position. Last election they had a policy of fees and vouchers, arguing that if we allow overseas students to pay for places, we should let Australian students pay for places. This time around, however, they claim that they will not charge up-front fees to undergraduate students. But are they against fees on equity and access grounds? No, they are not. Their case is simply that fees cannot be justified at the moment because of the stabilisation in the number of students. How electorally convenient. However, an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald in the last week of September accurately summed up the opposition on higher education policy by saying: When the Green senators, the Democrats and the Federal Opposition stand together, the public can expect an attack on the responsible use of taxpayers' funds. The public can expect an irresponsible use of taxpayers' funds. The article continues: The Federal Opposition is (cynically?) wooing the student unions with its stance on this matter. This opportunism means that it dismisses the real issue-which is the equitable and responsible distribution of funds for tertiary education. It goes on: Requiring Australian citizens to pay a slightly higher level of repayment in the initial year of their HECS repayments is hardly unfair. The repayments are not being increased and the amount required goes nowhere near meeting the actual costs of a university education. I quote the last paragraph: The second leg of the proposed HECS changes is not unfair, either. There is a rort going on which it is intended to stop. Non-citizen residents have been able to get their university education in Australia and then leave the country without making any direct contribution to the cost of that education by way of a HECS fee. The change, which gives these residents the option of taking up citizenship by the end of their third year or paying their HECS fees up-front, should help to reduce this abuse. I think it also proves that the opposition will say anything in the lead-up to the next election. That is exactly what the Liberals did in South Australia in the lead-up to the last state poll. They, for example, promised to increase spending on education. It has proved to be a cruel hoax. They have in fact savagely cut education in South Australia to the tune of $100 million. A similar about-face in up-front fees can be expected of the federal opposition should they win the next poll. This bill will require foreign nationals in Australia to pay their HECS contributions upfront at enrolment and deny access to the open learning deferred scheme to such students. Those affected by this provision are New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents of three years standing or more; that is, the new requirements contained in this bill will affect only those people who are eligible to become Australian citizens but have chosen not to do so. I strongly support this provision, as do people in my electorate-particularly the youth in my electorate. I believe the government's capacity to provide access to publicly funded higher education should meet the needs, first and foremost, of Australian citizens. I certainly do not have any trouble in stating that proposition. I am certain that most Australians would agree with that. Providing higher education places is very expensive. Australian citizens should be beneficiaries of this expenditure, rather than foreign nationals who have chosen not to contribution. become citizens. But this provision does not mean that foreign nationals will be denied access to education. In fact, they will retain exactly the same access to education as Australian citizens. The changes mean only that foreign nationals will not have access to financial support from the Australian government while they are undertaking non-compulsory study. The compulsory years of schooling still remain free of charge. It does not mean that foreign nationals undertaking university studies pay the full cost of their courses. They will still have access to HECS. This means they pay on average just 20 per cent of the cost their courses. What the bill does is prevent foreign nationals residing in Australia from deferring payment of HECS. This means they will be required to pay the HECS fees upHECS front, at the time of enrolment. The point is that government assistance students undertaking non-compulsory educapeople tion is designed to enable them to maximise requirement. their personal potential and to develop skills to enable them to make a contribution in their working lives to the development of this country. It is not a welfare measure, and it not to support the education in Australia temporary residents who plan to take the skills acquired here back to their home counincome try. What this provision does is make it clear that the purpose of assistance to higher education students and of the costly subsidies to their education is confined to support Australian citizens for personal and national benefit. The provision is important because it reinforces that purpose. It remains the case that anybody is welcome to study in this country, but the government is focusing the available resources so that as many Australian citizens as possible are able to participate in higher education. The bill also ceases the offering of discounts on up-front contributions to that defined group of students. Under HECS, students who pay their contribution up front at enrolment receive a 25 per cent discountthe an incentive which is not appropriate for those who are precluded from deferring their As a result of these provisions, additional higher education student places will be able to be funded-that is, more Australian students will have the opportunity of studying in Australian higher education institutions. That is an important outcome. The principle underlying HECS is that students in publicly funded higher education places should be expected to make a contribution towards the cost of their tuition if, and only if, they have the financial capacity to do so and only to the will extent they have the capacity to do so. There are four provisions in this bill which enhance and reinforce this principle. The first of is the provision for a 15 per cent discount on voluntary payments of $500 or more as an incentive for the early repayment of HECS debts. Second is the provision of a lower repayment threshold with a 10 per cent discount if this particular option is taken up. to This is of course an option which some may choose to take and is not a Third is the provision of additional repayment thresholds which more accurately reflect the capacity of HECS debtors to repay debt. is Fourth is the provision that those with the of financial capacity to repay their HECS debt but who are in a position to minimise their by claiming, for example, a net rental loss-negative gearing-will no longer be able to avoid repayment. This will be achieved by creating a HECS accessible income, which will be the sum of the taxable income and the net rental loss claimed. All four of the above provisions reinforce the principle of HECS, they increase equity in the system and they prevent evasion of HECS debts. The result of such measures will be greater efficiency in the system, leading to the opening up of more higher education places. I therefore strongly support these provisions. The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) made mention of places in Victoria and South Australia. I think it is also important to note that other states are grossly affected by this legislation. The bill provides for the funding of nearly 6,000-in fact, 5,850-new higher education places, plus pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998 to states with strong population growth and current low participation rates. Queensland will be the main beneficiary of these additional places, with New South Wales and Western Australia benefiting. I think Labor candidates in seats like Hinkler, Kennedy, Cowan and Maranoa will be fascinated with the views of their current members of parliament in terms of this particular legislation. I look forward to their participation in the debate. Provision has also been made for growth in other states in 1999. Victoria has the highest participation and access rates of any state. That will remain so until the year 2003. There will be no reduction in the existing number of places to any university and no reduction in any operating grants. The shadow minister, the member for Goldstein, conveniently had nothing of consequence to say about that particular matter. From a South Australian point of view, I will be interested to hear the views of the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), two of whom will participate in this debate. Their views will be very carefully noted in terms of the risk they place to South Australian students of the future. This bill makes provision for improved research infrastructure to enable universities to maintain their research effort and their research training capacity at an internationally competitive level. Additional research funding will also be provided to assist the nation to maintain and strengthen its research capabilities and to enhance the contribution made by research and scientific development to national economic and social goals. There are other things of great benefit which are also at risk. There will be an additional 100 Australian postgraduate awards on top of the 1,600 already available and five new post-doctoral fellowships, for a total of 55 from 1996. This will provide extra opportunities to outstanding research students. It seems that the opposition, by placing amendments in the Senate, will put this at risk. The bill creates a higher education innovations program to provide incentives to improve quality as well as funding for specific innovative projects. Everyone in this House and everyone in this nation knows that Labor has created a decade of expansion of opportunity in education. Across the country retention rates have risen from three in 10 in 1983 to eight in 10 today. The probability of a student completing year 12 and going on to higher education has been doubled. The government has made a substantial investment in the higher education sector because it recognises the central role universities play in the intellectual, economic and social development of the nation. There is clear evidence of the government's commitment to equity in the education system. By stark contrast, the opposition has demonstrated no such commitment to education. When the opposition left government in 1983, seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. It was neglect-criminal neglect, national neglect-which left too many people vulnerable to the changing needs of the economy as it modernised. We are still paying for that neglect. Now their colleagues in the state governments are turning the clock back. They are quashing opportunity rather than enhancing it. I am glad the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is here because he knows, as well as I do, that in South Australia under Premier Brown the assault on resources allocated to education has continued on and on and unabated. Sixteen hundred teachers and school service officers have been lost. Our once excellent studentteacher ratio has been attacked. Retention rates have fallen from the pride of Australia to the bottom in 12 months-93 per cent in 1993; 76 per cent in 1994: a very dramatic and a very damaging decline. This year a further 4,000 students have left the education system. It is not only the schools which have suffered. South Australians are now subject to the worse unemployment and the worse economic growth figures in the nation. We have hit the worse. We are the worse. Since 1993 the rate of job growth was one-third of that achieved nationally. In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared with a rise of 52,000 nationally. South Australia, sadly, has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, yet despite this miserable record the Brown Liberal government has abandoned the youth strategy project. Youth programs delivered by TAFE have been savaged. South Australia once had the best education system in the nation-internationally recognised. Today, after just two years of the Brown government, we have one of the worse. The teaching force, school service force and principals have absolutely had their morale knocked out of them. Their education minister, Mr Lucas, who in the campaign promised them all increased funding for schools and training, will by 1996 have chopped $100 million out of the education budget. The TAFE system is being similarly gutted, despite the desperate need for education and training opportunities in the most depressed state in the country. This opposition promises nothing to the future of students in this country. It does not support equitable access to education and it does not support growth in the higher education sector. Judging by the record of the Liberal governments in the states, it still to grasp the link between education and the nation's economic performance. It does not support student organisations either. The Sydney Morning Herald states: The Federal Opposition is (cynically?) wooing the student unions with its stance on this matter. This opportunism means that it dismisses the real issue-which is the equitable and responsible distribution of funds for tertiary education. That is a fact about the student organisations that it recently demonstrated when the Liberal state government sought to interfere with the ability of institutions to receive financial assistance for student organisations. Should the opposition win government at the next federal poll, students in the higher education sector can generally expect a dismantling of educational values. The opposition would make the same savage cuts to the education and training sectors as have been made by their counterparts in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. They would contract opportunity rather than expand it. They would tum students out of the education system rather than fund the future. I believe Australians deserve better. I believe South Australians deserve better. I believe the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide deserve better. That is why this bill is so important. It is important because it reinforces HECS as an equity measure in higher education. It enables those who benefit from receiving a heavily subsidised education to put something back to assist others to also enjoy the benefits they have enjoyed. I would have thought that was the Australian way. It furthers the government's aim of providing a large, accessible, diverse and innovative system of publicly funded higher education. I remind the House of the first sentence in the Sydney Morning Herald editorial: When the Green senators, the Democrats and the Federal Opposition stand together, the public can expect an attack on the responsible use of taxpayers' funds. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",84
206,Mr WAKELIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We are here this evening to discuss the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 and its nine measures: the adjustment of fails funding levels, discount on voluntary payments, HEC repayment income, voluntary repayments of accumulated HEC debt, accumulated HEC debt, students who are required to pay full amount of contribution, grants under the higher education innovation program, certain holders of scholarships and certain persons not entitled to deferred contributions, which I think is the New Zealand part the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), described earlier. Tonight I want to talk about inequity and to challenge that notion. In my contribution I will endeavour to rebut the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). He is not a bad sort of a fellow, but on this one we totally disagree. I bring to the attention of the House long standing concern that has been well documented about the state of tertiary studies in rural and regional Australia. The statistics are there for all to see. There has been discussion about racial vilification in this country over the years. Perhaps many people from regional Australia have been vilified with the rather contemptuous attitude some within the urban areas that rural are not as bright. When we have a look at the scheme. opportunities available to them, then we can really have a look at what equity means. the outcome you will find that rural and regional people are at least half as successful in having access to university and completing university degrees. The government never wants to talk about the disadvantages facing rural and regional people. There is plenty of rhetoric and nice warm and fuzzy words, but the reality is there; it has been there for a long time. I must say in defence of the regions in my electorate and throughout the country that I regard the attitude of the urban dominant culture of country as a form of vilification. The member for Port Adelaide can talk for as long as he business. likes about the fair and responsible use of taxpayers' money, but the government's We record in respect of the access of regional people to Austudy and the gradual emasculato tion of services in rural and regional Australia suggests otherwise. It is not just a matter of access to tertiary studies; it is a matter of preparation for those studies. If you cannot get reasonable to the basics in order to prepare yourself for tertiary studies, you can never hope to quite as successful as your urban colleagues. That is not to say that there are not very many successful people from rural and regional Australia who make it through, but most fair-minded Australians would acknowledge that they have to jump a higher set of hurdles. Nowhere in this bill will you find an acknowledgment of the reality of the situation. My parliamentary colleague the member for Goldstein referred to the changing of the rules and promises by the government which we have come to accept as the norm in Australian political life. As he very well stated, a proma ise was made but the ERC said, 'No, students will pay.' Then they go around the country saying, 'But you're paying for the other stude;tts.' This is my complaint about the some Labor Party and the Labor government. During Whitlam's period in office, we were told that there would not be any fees at all and that university would be free. But then from we went through this convoluted process people under Neville Wran to bring in the HEC Gradual changes are made in order to meet In the political needs of the day. One example of these constant changes comes to mind. A physiotherapy student contacted my office in an absolute dilemma. This student was told halfway through the year that Austudy was no longer available. The government keeps imposing these constant changes upon people in order to meet their promises and their economic targets. While we are on the subject of the economy, my friend from Port Adelaide did make some mention of the state of South Australia this and the Brown government and the normal political point scoring that goes on in this",88
207,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Mr HolIis)will not have any political point scoring. We will keep our comments directly related the bill that we are debating, which has nothing to do with the economy of South Australia as I understand it. So, if we can keep our comments to the bill that we are discussing, we will be able to proceed with access the utmost speed.",89
208,Mr WAKELIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I was addressing the be comments of my colleague the member for Port Adelaide to the cuts to education made by the Brown government. Therefore, I would regard that as being in the normal context of political point scoring. But I will be very careful in my comments not to incur your wrath, Mr Deputy Speaker. The reality was that the Brown government did face significant economic pressure in respect of the State Bank. As much as we try to avoid that issue, it does have an impact. When you are spending $3 million a day and you have only $2 million a day coming in, you have to do something about it. The state government has endeavoured to do that. The overriding situation on education in South Australia is that it is very well placed compared with all other states. But that is a secondary issue to the issue I wish to raise tonight, which relates to equity for regional people. On 27 March 1995 I made an adjournment speech in this House. It was three or four days after I had addressed a very well organised rally of students in Why alia. What were those students objecting to? They were objecting to the increase in the HECS fees. I promised those students that I would make their views known to the parliament. Therefore, tonight I continue my campaign to give them support and stand up against this government, which will say a whole range of things to convince the students that they are on their team. There is no doubt about the government's record. As the shadow minister has said, Labor has progressively increased the rate of payments of HECS since 1988. When I addressed this rally in the streets, Labor was attempting to ask graduates to pay double HECS for a second degree and to financially penalise them for taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree. The coalition is proud that it stood up against that measure. In the same week, the Prime Minister made a comment to a young unemployed person in Adelaide who was endeavouring to participate in the clever country. We will all remember that comment. The Prime Minister said, 'Get a job.' Let us come back to regional Australia. In the May budget, the government in its wisdom decided to cut expenditure to education centres. These centres have been very much a part of the education scene in my electorate, particularly in Whyalla. Again, we see the Labor government endeavouring to shy away from its responsibility. I put on the public record-I have discussed this issue with the university students in Whyalla-that the matter of compulsory unionism in the universities is a matter of great concern to me. I believe that it is important that we have freedom of choice and that it is contrary to democratic principles for young people in this country to be forced to be members of the student union. We can argue that surely the student union, considering the good work that it does, could stand on its own merit without membership being compulsory . I want to come back to the issue of regional education. The member for Port Adelaide made the point that it was for 'young Australians to maximise their potential in their noncompulsory education years'. The reality is that there is a much more stringent access to Austudy than there is to unemployment benefits. That is the constant complaint I get from university students. This whole business of the clever country is but a forlorn hope to many students. The number of students that I have through my office are quite desperate. They are having their idealism crushed before their eyes. They cannot understand why they cannot go out there and study and try to improve themselves, yet they can go out there and be unemployed; they cannot understand that. It is really debilitating as a member of parliament to have to tell them that that is the policy of the Australian Labor government. In terms of this argument about maximising the potential of young people, it is quite remarkable that we can stand in this place and wax lyrical when we have the young people of rural and regional Australia not gaining access in an equitable way to tertiary studies. When we consider the great structural adjustment that has occurred in regional Australiawhether it was in the shipyards, in the steel industry, in the grain industry or the wool industry, or any other industry in this country, in regional Australia particularly-that we make it more difficult to be educated than to obtain unemployment benefits is just quite remarkable. The point I really would like to leave the House with tonight is that if we are to make genuine progress-and I am sure we all want that-we must recognise that there are some basic practical realities in this business of regional education. One of those realities is not only the disincentive, if you like, to be studying rather than to be unemployed but that some people have to go to the metropolitan areas to get their further education. We have a very good university at Why alIa, but obviously it has a limited number of subjects and courses. Some people have to go to Adelaide, and some people have to go there for their secondary education to prepare for that tertiary study. There is no recognition of the extra costs. There is some recognition in the living away from home allowance: about $40 a week. But consider the cost of an 18-year-old leaving their home and becoming independent-not just the cost, but the personal pressure on them-as they live away from their family and trying at the same time to ml'ke a go of it in education. That is not talking about Aboriginal people and the added disadvantage they suffer. But predominantly Aboriginal people live in regional Australia-or very many of them do. So I leave this House tonight with my concerns about our tertiary sector. We cannot delude ourselves that all is well. There is an important principle of equity at stake, particuing larly equity for rural and regional students. The time has come, I believe, for that to be addressed in a much more fundamental way. I genuinely believe that there is a formal vilification against these people. We would do our country a far greater service if we put more energy into addressing that form of discrimination than we do into addressing some of these other alleged forms of discrimination.",89
209,Mr GIBSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate today and fully support the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2). This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to implement a number of budget decisions, which will lead to an increase in student places and research funding. I am particularly interested in this question as it relates to the increase in student places because I had the opportunity, on behalf of a number of my colleagues from Queensland, Western Australia and western parts of New South Wales, to convene a group in this parliament called the fair share task force. That task force was working with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to increase the number of tertiary places to those areas which were significantly disadvantaged. The result of the campaign run by the fair share task force is this legislation, which results in an increase in the number of tertiary places of 5,850 of which Queensland will receive 4,200. I am very pleased to be here in the House supporting this legislation. I indicate my great support for the minister and offer him my congratulations for the way in which he has achieved this important new measure which will bring much greater fairness and equity to the distribution of tertiary places throughout this country. I feel some of the things that have been said today, particularly by the opposition, in regard to this piece of legislation need to be countered, and countered quite strongly. There has been an attempt particularly by the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), to try to squirm off the hook concernhis personal responsibility and the responsibility of the opposition if we lose any of these tertiary places as a result of their actions. That needs to be made very clear. From what the Liberal Party has said, we have understood that it is their intention to block the two amendments contained in this bill which will enable the funding to go forward that will pay for the extra 4,200 university places in Queensland. No attempt by the member for Goldstein to try to avoid responsibility will be convincing for the people of Queensland, because it will be my task and the task of other Queensland members to make sure that young Queensland students and their families well and truly understand that, if we do not get the number of places we are seeking to get with this bill, it will be as a direct result of the actions of the Liberal Party, the coalition parties, both in this House and in the Senate, blocking measures in this bill which would enable the funding to go forward. I think it is an absolute disgrace that particularly Queensland members of the coalition would be prepared to support such an action, when they know that this legislation will right a long standing wrong and ensure that thousands of extra Queensland students are able to get to university. The Liberal Party and the National Party in concert are working to stop thousands of Queensland students from getting to university and being able to achieve their full potential. That is something that we have to make sure the people of Australia, but particularly the people of Queensland, understand. The actions of the coalition in opposing sections of this bill could possibly lead to just that action-that is, the loss of some of the 4,200 places for Queensland. I also have a particular interest in this bill because one of the most outstanding tertiary institutions in Australia is located in my electorate: Griffith University. I am very proud to represent Griffith University in this place. Ever since my election in 1990, I have had a very close working relationship with the administration of Griffith University. Professor Roy Webb, the vice-chancellor, does a wonderful job at that university. Griffith has always had the reputation of being an innovative, exciting and dynamic institution, and it continues to lead the way in qualifications, quality of education outcomes and in innovation in some of the programs and research projects it undertakes. Another reason why I support this legislation is that, as a result, Griffith University will get additional funding to provide a number of additional places which will enable students in the southern suburbs to attend that university. There has been a considerable historical bias towards Victoria in the allocation of university places as against the interests of the other states. If one looks in an objective sense at the way in which the numbers of tertiary places have been allocated over a long period of time, one sees that Victorian universities have received a far greater share than their actual proportion of the population entitles them to. The strength of this bill is that we are not seeking to make any dramatic cuts in the allocation to Victorian universities or to any other universities. We have made some small amendments to the way in which the HECS system operates, which will recoup sufficient funds to enable us to supply a significantly increased number of student places. Over time, we will gradually reduce the number of places Victoria is allocated, but we are I:ut doing it in a dramatic way which will have any adverse impact on the institutions in Victoria. It is a very fair piece of legislation all round and I think it deserves the support of both sides of this House and of both chambers. I also mention how supportive the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has been throughout this process. When Queensland and Western Australian members and members representing western Sydney electorates went to see him to outline their concerns, he was very open and supportive. He indicated right from the outset that it was his desire to rectify these problems and to try to provide a greater allocation of places for Queensland students and for the students coming from those other areas. I congratulate the minister for the very strong way he has supported his parliamentary colleagues in their endeavour to provide fairness and justice to their electorates in the allocation of tertiary places. I think the minister has provided a package which does continue to emphasise the principles of access and equity. He has significantly increased the opportunities for students from those states to qualify for tertiary education to achieve their full potential as Australian citizens. The 1995-96 federal budget decisions clearly demonstrate that this government is maintaining its commitment to the development of a high quality and accessible higher education system for all Australians. The amendments discussed here today provide funding, as I said, for 5,850 new higher education places in the years 1996 to 1998. The costs of these initiatives are to be offset by reallocation of existing discretionary funds, reduction of pipeline places for Victoria and refinements to the higher education contribution scheme. Among the amendments being discussed are an adjustment of funding levels as a result of the allocation of new places, additional research funding and carry-forward of quality funds and the inclusion of funding for 1997 and 1998. Although spokespersons for the Victorian government expressed fears that as many as 10,000 higher education places would be taken from Victoria to be redistributed to other states, this has not happened. The provision of the extra places for Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia has been achieved without any reductions in the existing funding levels or number of places at any university. There will be some minor reallocations of the growth allocations to Victoria, but participation and access rates in Victoria will remain significantly higher than in any other state until at least 2003. An additional series of amendments to the act increases funds available for research infrastructure to about $293 million over the 1996-98 triennium. This is an important series of amendments because it reflects the government's consistent view that an adequate research infrastructure is crucial for universities to maintain their research and research training capacity at internationally competitive levels. Additional research funding will also be provided to assist the nation to maintain and strengthen its research capabilities and to enhance the contribution made by research and scientific development to national economic and social goals. An additional $40 million for competitive research grants will be available through the Australian Research Council on top of the $350 million already committed for the 1996-98 triennium. Further, from 1996 there will be an additional 100 Australian postgraduate awards, on top of the 1,600 already available. There will be also five new postdoctoral fellowships, leading to a total of 55 from 1996. This increase will provide a welcome boost to opportunities available to outstanding research students. Another vital element in this package is a set of refinements to the HEC scheme which will bring forward revenue but which does not increase the size of an individual HECS debt. These changes bring substantial improvements in the higher education sector because the changes provide the additional funding for those additional tertiary places and for the research capability. The government will still be providing a 15 per cent discount on voluntary payments of $500 or more under HECS as an incentive for early repayments of HECS debts. Also, the Â° department will provide an option of a lower HECS repayment threshold with a 1 per cent discount for the person repaying the debt. This change will provide a voluntary option to HECS debtors. If they elect to take up the option, they will make a commitment to repay their accumulated HECS debt at two per cent of assessable income when they are above a voluntary threshold of $20,000 in 1995-96 but below the first compulsory threshold, which is $27,674. Their outstanding HECS debt will be reduced by 10 per cent if this option is taken up. This is a means of providing more flexibility for the student. It also means that the government gets a speeding up of the income returned from the HECS payment. It is not a mandatory system. It is a flexible, voluntary system for the individual students. There has been some controversy about the other amendment, which is the provision that New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents of three years standing or more who have not become Australian citizens pay their HECS contributions up front at enrolment. They will also have no further access to the open learning deferred payments system. The government believes that its policies for access to publicly funded higher education should first and foremost meet the needs of Australian citizens and those who have demonstrated their long-term commitment to Australia. I believe this is a fundamental principle which we should fully support. Our tertiary education system and the billions of dollars we provide in funding should be first and foremost targeted to Australian citizens. We are not denying places to other students or permanent residents, but we are requesting that they pay their contribution up front so that if they choose at the end of their studies to leave our country and commence work or continue with further studies we have not lost that HECS contribution which we are entitled to to help us fund the additional tertiary places we are providing. I do not think it is an unfair scheme. It is not discriminating. It still allows all those people to attend university, but it requires that they pay their moneys up front. As with the other changes to HECS that I have indicated, the revenue brought forward as a result of this change is an important component of the funding required to provide an expansion in the number of higher education student places. If the opposition takes the position of blocking these two measures in the Senate, then it is it and it alone that is endangering the number of additional tertiary places we are seeking to provide. Without any shadow of a doubt, I can assure you that I will be making sure the people of my electorate and the people throughout Queensland-I am sure that the minister at the table, the Attorney-General and member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch), will also be making sure that the constituents in his electorate who may be denied a university place as a result of this opposition action-well and truly know who is responsible for the fact that those students are not able to get into a university. The discount on mandatory up-front HECS payments for people who are not Australian citizens will be removed as a result of the amendments we are discussing. Under HECS, students who pay their contribution up front at enrolment receive a discount of 25 per cent on their payment. This provides an incentive to pay up front. This is not appropriate for those students who are going to be precluded from deferring their contribution, so they will not be getting that 25 per cent discount. Those students who have had their application for citizenship approved by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may continue to defer their HECS contributions. This will ensure that students who have had a citizenship application approved but may have to wait some months to attend a citizenship conferral ceremony will not be financially disadvantaged. Overall, this bill presents a very tightly integrated package of measures. It provides for growth in student places where they are needed, enhances research funds and postgraduate scholarships, does not alter the fundamental elements of HECS or require reallocation of any existing student places, and nor does it increase overall governmeflt outlays. Importantly, this package was developed following extensive consultation with the higher education sector. Unlike the opposition, which has acted without proper consultation, the government has worked fully with the higher education sector in developing this package and it has received positive responses from the higher education sector as a result of the package. I can assure you that the people of Queensland also have responded very positively to this package because they understand that gaining an additional 4,200 places is going to cost a considerable amount of funds and that the money has to come from somewhere. They also support the general direction of the government in the budget in trying to ensure that it did not increase its budget deficit, that it had sought to get rid of the budget deficit and bring the budget into surplus. So they support these small amendments which do not increase in any way the debts that students face but does ensure that we can have many more additional students attending our tertiary institutions and gaining the opportunities to further their career as a result. I would like to record the comments of one of the leading people in the higher education sector, Professor Alan Gilbert. He says: I am sure that when the history is written accurately one of the main things said about the government that has been in power since 1983 is that it has done more for education and for higher education I think than any government in Australia's history. I could not agree more with that. This package of amendments we are debating today will continue that process of improvement, reform and accessibility that are the hallmarks of this government's achievement. It is an accurate statement. That can be seen not only from what is outlined in this bill but from what we have achieved and will continue to achieve over the years ahead. I believe this bill deserves support. I understand that up to 2,000 additional tertiary places could be endangered by the opposition's tactics in trying to block some of the measures in this bill. It is absolutely important that we do not have that occur. It is not in the best interests of the students, it is not in the best interests of the higher education sector and it is not in the best interests of our nation if we lose those tertiary places. The people of Queensland call upon the opposition to support this bill, not to use any of its clever political tactics to try to block the bill or block sections of the bill in the Senate but to make sure the bill goes forward so that students of Queensland are not denied their opportunity to attend university.",91
210,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is now seven years since John Dawkins demolished and then refashioned Australia's higher education system. The forced amalgamation of institutions and the abolition of the university/college divide all in the context of a dramatic, but inadequately funded, system expansion was cowboy politics at its worse. Sadly, it foreshadowed the disdain for consultation and community consensus that would become characteristic of policy under the Labor government. The shock waves caused by the Dawkins revolution have now all but subsided. In their aftermath, the incoherencies and shortcomings of the original vision have become manifest. The rationale for the revolution Dawkins imposed on Australia's higher education system has two aspects. On the one hand, it was recognised that, if Australia was to survive in the volatile global market to which it was opening its economy, then it had to have a highly skilled and flexible work force. The task of creating such a work force was to fall to universities, and the logic of this argument pointed towards an expansion of the university system. On the other hand, the expansion of the higher education system was hailed as the means by which universities would be opened to all Australians. Access to universities would be based on ability rather than wealth, and higher education would no longer operate to entrench inequity. In many ways, I regard the second justification for expansion as the more fundamental and it is in terms of access and equity that I believe Labor's higher education system should be judged. The members opposite often fall into the trap of invoking the increase in university places that has occurred since 1988 and believing that this is enough. They tell us that between 1988 and 1993 they have increased total student numbers by 37 per cent. Having recited these figures, they expect to be congratulated for a job well done. But while this increase in university places has been necessary, the failure to achieve one of the ends to which expansion was a means-that of making universities more accessible-must be owned by the government and addressed. As the passage of time has proven, it was simplistic in the extreme to believe that system expansion, of itself, would increase access. Recent research by Professor Bob Gregory investigated the growing gap between the rich and the poor in Australia and showed that the existing higher education system continues to entrench inequity. Gregory found that in the 15 years to 1991 the number of Australians with degrees increased from 3.7 per cent of the population to 14 per cent. However, he also found that for every three new degree holders in the poorer suburbs identified in his research there were an extra 10 graduates in the richer suburbs. According to Gregory, differences in educational qualifications between neighbourhoods are becoming more marked than ever. In relation to access and equity and what has been achieved since 1988, a telling article appeared in Campus Review in August of last year. The article conceded that university places had increased by one-third since 1988 but went on to inquire how this increased participation rate related to questions of access. The article says of the increase in university places since 1988: . . . this increase in participation can be largely accounted for by a lengthening of the period that students spend in universities through enrolling in longer courses, double degrees or post-graduate courses. In addition full fee paying overseas students contributed their numbers; by 1993 these amounted to 35,000 enrolments ... to sum up, the unified national system has increased participation in higher education but has not raised access as a whole. Access and equity in our universities was an issue dealt with in a discussion paper released in August of last year by a joint Higher Education Council and DEET working party. The paper titled Resource allocation in higher education was prepared at the request of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and its purpose was to canvass options relating to both sources of funding and allocation of funding. It is noteworthy that the working party chose to define the context of the debate in terms of access. This is clear from the executive summary of the report which states: Under current (resource allocation) arrangements ... resources cannot easily flow between institutions ... The consequence of this may be both the development of increasing inequities in access across Australia and a reduction in the capacity of the system to respond to labour market, social and educational change. In particular, the combination of changes to the age structure of the population and trends in international migration will mean that there will be increasing imbalances in access to higher education under current funding arrangements in the absence of significant growth. Given the failure of the existing system to fulfil the access objectives which were set out by the government, there is an urgent need to deal with the issues raised in this paper. So what of the government's response to the Resource allocation in higher education paper? In November of last year a nervous minister secured himself breathing space by announcing that the issue of resource allocation for the universities would be dealt with in the 1995-96 budget. In the supplementary report for the 1994-95 triennium, the minister said: The Government's decision ... to ... announce funding decisions for 1997 and 1998 in the May 1995 Budget, will allow the Government to develop a considered approach to the issues raised in the working party's discussion paper ... So what of the government's 'considered approach' to the issue of resource allocation? The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) implements the government's plans for higher education funding as announced in the 1995 budget. By any measure, it is an entirely inadequate response to the problems defined by the Higher Education Council-DEET working party. It is a response governed by political expediency-the reo sponse of a government which is unwillint- tu jeopardise its chances in a fast approaching election. The government's answer to the challenges posed by the Higher Education Council-DEET report is to again tinker with the higher education contribution scheme. The changes to HECS implemented by this bill are the most recent in a long line of such changes stretching back to the last election. Since the 1993 election, Labor has either introduced or attempted to introduce the following: double HECS for second undergraduate fees; 1Y2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; pro rata repayment, which was a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; lower repayment thresholds; increased rates of repayment; and altered methods of repayment. The coalition considered several of these changes-including double HECS, 1Y2 times HECS and pro rata repayments-to be regressive. The changes fell most heavily on those who could not afford it and effectively increased the height of the barrier those from lower income groups must already clear if they are to have access to higher education. The coalition blocked these changes. The bill before us again seeks changes to the HECS system--changes which the coalition cannot support in their entirety. I think Labor's commitment to education in this country is nicely illustrated by that part of the bill which removes the HECS exemption for holders of scholarships for the professional development of teachers. In the May budget, it was announced that these 4,000 scholarships would no longer be funded, so the removal of the HECS exemption for these scholarships can do no more damage than has already been done. Such is the commitment of this government to primary and secondary education. In this bill, the government is seeking to introduce a series of higher repayment rates for HECS debtors and, in doing so, accelerate the pace at which these debts are being repaid to the government. The new repayment rates are to come into operation in 1996 and are to apply to all those with HECS debts. No doubt many students and graduates are experiencing a sense of deja vu in relation to this particular part of the government's bill. In fact, this is the second time in the life of the present parliament that Labor has sought to accelerate the rate at which a HECS debt is repaid. In total, it will be the third accelerated rate of repayment introduced by the government since the introduction of HECS in 1988. This government has to realise that the rate at which HECS is repaid cannot be increased indefinitely without severely undermining the foundation of the HECS system. As I have said in this House before, I support the principle of undergraduates being required to contribute towards the cost of their tuition as long as these students have the option to defer payment of their fees to a time when they are in a sufficiently secure financial position to repay their debt and to repay their debt at a rate which is manageable. Without this option, the charging of fees for government funded university places would effectively close these places to those from less affluent backgrounds. It is this very option that Labor is progressively undermining. In the context of a discussion about the progressive acceleration of HECS repayments, it is perhaps important to note part 4 of this bill, which makes provision for a discount to be offered to persons who voluntarily commence to repay their HECS debt at the annual income level of $20,000. While the coalition will not oppose part 4 of the bill, I think it is legitimate to be concerned that the government may in the future be tempted to use the take-up rate of this provision as a justification for a mandatory lowering of the income level at which the repayment of HECS debt now begins. The coalition has foreshadowed amendments to part 5 of this bill. Our amendments will ensure that the new repayment thresholds apply only to students who commence their studies from 1996 onwards. The coalition believes that when students undertake their course they should be certain of their HECS repayment requirements. At the very least, the government must stop moving the goalposts as they relate to the repayment of a HECS debt. The coalition is concerned about that part of this bill which requires permanent residents who do not take out Australian citizenship to pay HECS fees up front. The aim of this measure is to prevent students who are permanent residents from deferring their tuition fees and subsequently returning to their country of citizenship without paying their HECS debt through our taxation system. I concede that this is a problem which has to be addressed. However, I am concerned that this measure will fall unfairly on permanent residents who fully intend to make Australia their home after graduation. I am also concerned that this provision continues Labor's record of broken promises on fees. Since abandoning its commitment to no fees in 1988 and introducing partial, deferred payment of tuition fees in the form of the higher education contribution scheme, Labor has remodelled itself as the no up-front fees party. Yet Labor's professed commitment to no up-front fees has proven to be little more than political rhetoric. Since 1994, Labor has virtually forced universities to raise revenue by charging upfront fees for postgraduate courses, and the level of these fees has not been regulated. With the decision to apply up-front fees for students with permanent residency, Labor has introduced up-front fees for one group of undergraduate students. The obvious question to be asked is 'Which group is next?' As I have said, the coalition believes that when students undertake their course they should be certain of their HECS repayment requirements. For this reason, the coalition has foreshadowed amendments to lhat part of this bill which obliges permanent residents who do not take out Australian citizenship to pay HECS up front. Under the coalition amendment, this new requirement will apply only to those people who become permanent residents after the start of 1996 and then commence studies. I was particularly angered by the minister's threat to cut student places in South Australia in response to the opposition's foreshadowed amendments to this bill. South Australian universities-two of which are in my electorate-are major contributors to the development of the manufacturing and high technology industries whose success is vital to our state. By removing resources from our universities, Mr Crean will effectively be pulling the carpet out from under their feet. The shortfall of university places in Queensland must not be ignored, but South Australia should not be the casualty of this problem being addressed. It is time for the minister to accept that not all his funding problems can be dealt with by tinkering with HECS or clawing back funding. Part 1 of the bill sets out funding levels for universities over 1997 and 1998 and varies that for 1996. In the context of a 15 per cent reduction in funding per full-time university student over the last five years, the funding provisions of this bill are cold comfort. Funding to universities will increase only marginally. Outlays on higher education for 1995-96, for example, represent a real increase of only 1.6 per cent compared with 1994-95. Thanks to a looming election, universities have been spared dramatic cutbacks but, at the same time, there will be little change to the current situation in which cash-strapped universities are pushing to the limit both postgraduate fees and backdoor undergraduate fees. Given the modesty of the funding increases that will flow to universities as a result of this legislation, it is perhaps appropriate to again note the warning given in the Resource allocation in higher education paper. It says: In a situation of zero (or modest) increases in resources, the publicly funded component of Australia's higher education system will remain largely fixed in its current configuration without introduction of some mechanism to provide for flows of resources between institutions. The consequence of this may be both the development of increasing inequities in access across Australia and a reduction in the capacity of the system to respond to labour market, social and educational change. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) has failed to implement either of the options implicit in this warning. There have been no significant increases in the resources that will flow to universities. Othf'r than the heavy hand of the government. tl1cfe is still no mechanism to provide for flows of resources between institutions. The rigidity of the existing system is a direct consequence of the degree of centralised control Labor exercises over the higher education system. I would argue that the existing system is already suffering the inflexibility that the Higher Education Council-DEET working party warned of in its paper. As I have stated previously, one aspect of the rationale for the expansion of the higher education system was to foster the skills and knowledge needed by Australians if we were to remain on the cutting edge of change in the globalised market. Yet our current centralised system is not responding quickly enough to new opportunity. One young man, who is very well known to me, is interested in studying multimedia techniques in 1996. In the whole of Australia, he has the option of one university degree course dedicated to this area. NA",95

214,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is not for the Prime Minister or his deputy to use the ploy of political grandstanding when it comes to the lives and incomes of any Australian. This is just what they are. It is the double tag team. Come tomorrow, Western Australia will be brought to its knees-virtually paralysed economically for 24 hours. If you reside in Western Australia, tomorrow you will have great difficulty-if you do not find it impossible-in calling the office of the member for Canning and Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), getting to work on a bus, getting to work on a train, using the peak or fast lane of the freeway, getting your power fixed if there is a technical problem, buying a loaf of fresh bread, buying an extra carton of fresh milk, receiving a letter from interstate, getting your local mail delivered or hopping on a plane to go interstate. You would have great difficulty even visiting the west from interstate. But wait; there is more. If you happen to live outside Perth, come tomorrow you would not even get a copy of your only state-wide newspaper, the West Australian. Tomorrow I recommend not having to go to a country hospital: they may not have a cook, cleaner or orderly on duty. The port of Fremantle will be closed and $8 billion worth of construction projects will be put into real jeopardy. Even the Indian Pacific has had to be rescheduled. Only the working people of Western Australia will suffer. Only small businesses in Western Australia will suffer. Some 80,000 people will be directly and adversely affected by this action--endorsed, supported, encouraged and even fuelled by the Prime Minister and his deputy. Without doubt, Western Australia is the linchpin of the Australian economy. The Assistant Treasurer, who is at the table, would agree with that notion. Western Australia is a state which is experiencing massive urban growth and development, even in his seat. It is a state of enormous mineral wealth, with high tourism and heritage value. It is a state already disadvantaged by distance and time zones. Therefore, I ask why. The only conclusion I can make is that the Labor government does not care about the west or its nearly 1Y2 million people. It is using the west as a blatant political football. The Labor government is using the west as a misleading example of Liberal Party views on industrial relations-a total and utter red herring. The Labor government is ruthlessly using honest taxpayers, employers, business people and anyone else it can in a calculated strategy designed to show its commitment to unionism at the expense of its members. This is not just morally wrong and wrong for the families and workers in Western Australia; it is downright unconstitutional. The Prime Mini'iter, in his grab for power, his power hungry megalomania, as he has been trying to do for so many years, really got it wrong this time. Even though he blames the ABC and the West Australian for misquoting, he said it all. You see, Mr Speaker, section 92 of our constitution states clearly: On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of intemal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free. In other words, trade within the Commonwealth is to be free. How, understanding this, can the Prime Minister and his deputy possibly support this action? They are not the unions. They do not represent the unions. They are not paid directly to perform in this way by the unions. The Prime Minister is unconstitutional and his only course of action is to apologise to the people of Western Australia-and it is probably very unusual for him to do that. When he goes to Western Australia he only goes to one electorate, the electorate of Perth, and opens up things. He should admit he is wrong, and he should butt out of Western Australia, because he is not welcome in Western Australia. His ideas about the Liberal Party in Western Australia are not welcome and they are certainly not welcome in the seat of Cowan. I look forward to those voters reinforcing that at the next election, hopefully this year. Bournedrill",99
215,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to advise the House of a very positive story, and that is the success of a small company in my electorate that is doing wonderful work. I had the great opportunity a few days ago to take the Minister for Trade, Senator Bob MCMullan, to visit the company, Bournedrill, which operates at 133 Beatty Road, Archerfield. The reason I wanted to inform the House tonight about the success of Bournedrill is that this is a story of a company that has followed the principles of expanding and looking overseas and of quality best practice throughout its operations, which has resulted in major export markets being developed by the company, which has not only boosted this company's employment opportunities and income but also assisted Australia in its overseas trade and exports. Bournedrill was founded some 30 years ago, in 1965, when two brothers, Graham and George Bourne, began providing engineering services to the growing geophysical, water well, mineral exploration and oil drilling industry in Australia. It was operating then under the name of Bourne Exploration Tool and Machining. They were initially occupied only with repair and modification of imported drilling equipment but they could see the potential for developing their own range of equipment and tools to meet the demands of the harsh Australian conditions. In a little over five years they had begun manufacturing their own designs. The R series of mechanical rotary table rigs introduced in the early 1970s quickly became the accepted standard for geophysical, coal exploration and water well drilling throughout Australia. In the mid-1970s development began of the THD series of hydraulic top head drive rigs specifically for the mining water well industries. In 1975 the company took a major step with its first export, a 1000R rig to a Singapore based company. Today overseas clients take the bulk of this company's products and services. From its original humble premises, Bournedrill is now operating major new workshops housing major design and manufacturing operations, utilising computer controlled machinery to meet exacting standards. They are employing at times up to 150 skilled workers. The excellence of Bournedrill products has been recognised by the Australian federal government, which has chosen the company to supply drilling equipment for delivery to a number of countries as part of Australia's overseas aid program. This included the delivery of complete turnkey packages encompassing drilling rigs and all the associated equipment, operational and maintenance training and even caravans for site personnel. Most Australian state governments and a large number of local governments have also chosen Bournedrill to supply their drilling equipment. Over the last 19 years, since they have been exporting, Boumedrill has developed an export market in some 22 countries, in Asia and Africa and throughout the South Pacific. All of those countries have found the products of Bournedrill to be of excellent quality and standard. The company has been chosen by both Australian aid agencies and international aid and development agencies to provide water well drilling equipment to many countries throughout the region. It is no surprise that this company continues to grow well. In 1993, 59 per cent of its turnover was export sales. In 1994 that fell slightly to 48 per cent but the company continues to be a major exporter. I wish to congratulate Graham and George Bourne for the outstanding work they have done over their 30-year history. They have a proud record of achievement. We are particuand larly pleased at the hard work that they have put in in developing major export markets. They recognise the support that the federal government has given them through the programs that we supply to ensure that they . are able to operate a major export program. They are an example to other companies. I hope many more companies in my electorate and throughout Australia will learn from the experience of Bournedrill and take the initiative of developing overseas markets for their excellent products. Industrial Relations in Western Australia",99
216,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to be here, because today I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) telling us about the draconian second wave industrial relations legislation in Western Australia. I invited him to tell us what it was and he did not, so I thought I might start by bringing along a document given to me by a trade unionist the other day as a matter of protest. It tells you what is in the legislation. For instance, under the heading 'Federal Award Coverage' it says: Where a union is seeking a federal Award, the Government is to legislate to allow them to cancel a union's award, hand over the union's membership to another union ... What he is really saying, of course, and what the legislation provides, is that, if a union in Western Australia currently under state award coverage decides to move to federal award coverage, the government of Western Australia, subject to an appeal provision in the Industrial Commission, will nominate another union. So those Western Australians who do not want to be",101
217,Mr GEAR,ADJOURNMENT,That would be good.,101
218,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"We know that you do not like it, George, because it is going to mean that people can actually choose. Union members can actually decide they do not want to be dragged across",101
219,Mr GEAR,ADJOURNMENT,The minister chooses.,101
220,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"No, the minister can nominate another union, but he has created an appeal provision.",101
221,Mr GEAR,ADJOURNMENT,That is no choice.,101
222,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I think I should have some protection from the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Speaker.",101
223,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I think you should, too. The Assistant Treasurer will remain-quiet.",101
224,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"The simple fact is that that provision provides a choice for union members. If they do not want to go to Canberra, they can go to another union in Western Australia to be covered. Then there is the secret ballots provision. This is a dreadful provision! Secret ballots are a thing that we practise when we get elected. Secret ballots give you two protections when you are contemplating a strike: protection from the boss and protection from the union. Secret ballots have got to be a good thing for workers. Then there is a requirement in this legislation that unions conduct their accounting properly. That is a dreadful thing! You will close down $60 million worth of exports for Australia tomorrow because we have got a piece of legislation coming into the Western Australian parliament that says that books should be kept in a proper fashion. That is dreadful! Then there is the provision about inspection of time and wages records. That has been a provision for unions, and it can be highlighted as something that would be a bit of a problem. Of course, what has been going on is that unions have gone to perfectly honest employers and said, 'We want to inspect your time and wages records.' They do not raise any issue of award breaches. They just go out with all the names of all the employees and then go and harass them to join the union. If you are a non-union member, a worker, why can't you have protection from that? That is what the legislation provides, because any worker, through the operation of the union or otherwise, within 48 hours of a request must have an inspection of their pay records by a WA government industrial department inspector. This legislation provides that an industrial inspector can come in at any time and see that you are being paid according to the award or your industrial agreement. But the unions can go in and look only at affairs related to their own members. What is draconian about that? Then, of course, there is this thing about unions donating to political parties. The fact of life is that, in the future in Western Australia, employees-those so-called workerswill have the right to say whether they want some of their union membership money to go to a political party or not. That is dreadful! Exports worth $65 million are to be banned and blocked tomorrow-as though you do not have a current account deficit-because workers are going to have the right to say whether they want to donate to a political party or not. I have your little blue piece of paper here put out by Dave Robinson, Branch Secretary of the CPSU, telling everybody to close the country down. There is nothing else on it but those matters that I have just addressed. It is all there. The minister made a second reading speech but the media, typically, has not bothered to read that. (Time expired) China: Nuclear Technology",101
225,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (7.45 p.m.)Having listened to two tories tonight, I can understand why Senator Crichton-Browne wanted to get rid of the first one. And as for the second, I can understand why the unions are on strike. They really don't change, do they? This is the member who thinks a $3 wage for youth is perfectly acceptable and desirable. I suppose he would not disagree with what Mr Kierath is doing in Western Australia. It is entirely appropriate for the tories of this country to attack working people-that is what they are about; that is what they have always been about, and that does not surprise us. However, my concern tonight is not with the tories in this House, because they are really irrelevant, quite frankly, in Australian politics today. Rather, I am interested in what China is doing in the world today in terms of selling its nuclear technology. I was quite worried to read in today's Australian newspaper that China has agreed, in a multimillion dollar venture, to supply Iran with uranium processing technology which can be used to make nuclear weapons. This is quite frightening, coming from a country which to this day is still having nuclear tests, albeit, unlike the French, they do it on their own territory. Nevertheless, are still developing and improving their nuclear technology for weapons of destruction. It is a particular worry when the Chinese are prepared to sell that technology to countries such as Iran--or maybe Iraq, for that matter-because there is no reason why a country like Iran would want to go into nuclear technology. Indeed, Mr Leonard Spector, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, points out that the reason you want the technology-a uranium hexafluoride plant-is to do uranium enrichment. It would suggest that this is a step towards that nuclear arms acquisition. I think most of us in this House-and, I suspect, many on the other side--would agree that the world has enough nuclear weapons today. We certainly do not want the technology to be transferred to other countries. Indeed, I think I speak for all members when I say we certainly wish those with nuclear weapons would stop testing. Unfortunately, China appears determined to become a bad neighbour in the world today. China seems to be determined to transfer technology to countries which will enable them to produce nuclear weapons. Sadly, the world seems to be not loud enough in its condemnation of this Chinese attitude. I have great difficulty, frankly, in understanding why countries even want nuclear weapons. I suppose if one looks at the history of the French, certainly in the Cold War period, with its record in the First World War and the Second World War, the French nation understandably saw a need to be strong enough in defence mechanisms to ward off any future aggressor. But those days have gone. The French have a sufficient armoury of nuclear weapons without going down the track of having further testing in Mururoaand, of course, we know that it is not to improve their computer technology but really to create new styles of nuclear weapons for their submarine missile launching capacity. We can be very angry at that. Just as we are angry with the French, this House should also be angry with China. I would hope down the track-and I am lookthey ing at moving a private member's motion on this-I will get support from the House to condemn China just as much as we condemned France, and rightly so, in this House. China has a lot to answer for in the world today. Its actions in Tibet are appalling. Its actions in gaoling the Australian businessman  judicial system, its legal system, and find it is non-existent. I think China should start looking at the rest of the world and find out how the rest of the world expects countries like China to behave if they are to be regarded as part of the world order, as part of the world economic growth and as part of the world's desire to rid itself of nuclear weapons and look forward to an era of peace rather than of nuclear technology transfer.",102
226,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.50 p.m.)Tonight I want to raise the issue of native title and look at it through different people's eyes, almost two years since the legislation came into operation. I begin by referring to comments by a Western Australian pastoralist, Mrs Robyn Richardson, in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 19 September 1995 by Cathy Bolt. In the article Mrs Richardson makes this point: It's causing division everywhere. I don't think doing any reconciliation whatsoever. There is a claim on the Richardsons' station at Mount Florence, 190 kilometres from Roebourne in the Pilbara. It is one of the odd claims that have been made to the tribuNovember nal. To this point, almost two years on, there has been no determination. It is expected, course, that in the early years all of these claims will end up back in the High Court, anyway. The article continues: The core question still to be resolved is to what extent a pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title. Despite the deal brokered by former National Farmers Federation executive director, Mr Farley, in the final intense negotiations over Act, which were supposed to have put that beyond doubt, it was not spelt out in the legislation. The chairman of the NFF Aboriginal Affairs Committee, Mr John Mackenzie, said its current advice to station owners who are subject to a claim, is to oppose it and indicate they do not want have it mediated before the Native Title Tribunal, so that it goes straight to court. ""At the same time we are trying to get some cases that are government funded and hopefully will get some that will set some precedents."" That is the pastoral lease situation. I turn Rick Farley, whom I mentioned previously. As many people would know, he has left the NFF in recent months. He is quoted as saying: Uncertainty in industry and the Aboriginal community concerning Mabo is a recipe for conflict. Parliament and the courts so far have failed to define native title precisely. No one yet knows exactly where the native title exists, or even who the claimants might be. Because uncertainty is likely to continue for some years, those who want quicker outcomes are Native Title looking for alternatives to the lawyers and politicians. That is where Rick Farley is coming from, some two years down the track. The mining industry makes this point: ... a 32 per cent jump in overseas mineral exploration in 1993-94 as a clear response to the uncertainties of native title. ""The real difficulty and the frustration arises from the fact that we have had 18 months of activity and still have no clear idea ... it's So it is creating quite significant concern for the mining industry. In my electorate there is a test case by a particular individual-and that is quite openly admitted by the Aboriginal legal rights movement. He was hoping to 70have the first hearing before the tribunal in but because of law business that has had to be put off until February . You can of imagine the frustration and concern. I remind the House that in my part of South Australia there are native title claims along with world heritage listing. This puts pressure on individuals. The fact that their legal costs are not being supported to the full extent Rick makes a fallacy of many of the claims made the two years ago. I refer to a letter from a pastoralist which shows the degree of concern that has been created and the conflict that is starting to build in these areas. This particular pastoralist mentions to me a specific amount that he would like to see in the bank to cover all taxes and costs paid to cover three generato tions of work, stress and devaluation of property. He wants all costs for relocating, costs involved in finding a new home and test costs for removing all improvements. He goes we through a whole list of issues-immunity from land claims in the future, a guaranteed to price for all livestock, the cost of removing the telephone, and there is to be no improvement left on the property; what cannot be removed and relocated at claimant's cost must be destroyed. I conclude by again quoting Rick Farley: That is a recipe for conflict which I think has underestimated by the politicians and lawyers, probably would prefer to do nothing. Industrial Relations in Western Australia",103
227,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to talk about industrial relations Western Australian Court Liberal style, which of course is indusinto trial relations John Howard style, because know that the Leader of the Opposition at last Western Australian Liberal state conferthe ence said enthusiastically that Western Ausservices. tralia was his model. So Australians need to understand that when they think of John Howard they think of Richard Court and Graham Kierath. What is the Western Australian Liberal Court-Howard model? It is quite simple: lower wages; worse conditions; a rise in tion industrial disputation; abolition of safety nets; and the abolition or pushing down of as minimum standards. So if you are a worker what will you lose, or have doubts about? Your overtime rate will go or be optional; your penalty rates will go; your holiday will go; and your meal breaks will go. lt is no surprise then that the working people and working families of Australia tomorrow are jacking up about such pernicious policies and pernicious legislation. Why wouldn't you jack up about that sort of and othersharsh legislation? It is no surprise to see in today's West Australian that the worry about cism. this legislation has now spread to employers. Under the heading, 'Employers fear impact of continues: IR laws', we are told Employers are worried by the State Government's ... second wave of industrial laws ... according to Deputy Premier Hendy Cowan. There is a quote from the TLC secretary, Tony Cooke, saying that he hoped industry leaders: had finally convinced the State Government that they did not want the new industrial law and the industrial chaos it brought. In Western Australia we have a Court Liberal government caused recipe for industrial chaos and industrial disaster. But this should be no surprise to Western Australians because Western Australian Court Liberal style indusbeen trial relations have a long history. They might who not be secured by grandfather clauses but they are fathered. In the case of Richard Court, it is very much a case of like father like son. This month, October, is the 21st anniversary of a state-wide stoppage in October 1974 against pernicious and harsh anti-working people and anti-union legislation introduced the Western Australian parliament by the we then Premier, Sir Charles Court. That was an the attack on working people and trade unions in guise of legislation to protect emergency I am grateful to one of my constituents who lives in Bayswater for providing me with a copy of a social studies assignment that his daughter did in 1974. His daughter was then a second year high school student at Cyril Jackson High School, which is a fine instituin Ashfield in my electorate. It is interesting to see that nothing much changes so far the Liberal Party's industrial relations policies are concerned. In the assignment provided by my constituent we find an advertisement placed in the West Australian in leave October 1974 headed, 'State wide 24 hour work stoppage Midnight 30 September 1974 to Midnight 1 October 1974'. Some of the Western commentary goes as follows: Despite strong opposition from the WA. Law Society, Civil Liberties associationthe WA. Government appears oblivious to critiNothing much has changed. The commentary the Bill, pushed hard by Sir Charles Court, ... is a blatant attack on the Trade Union movementIn a further march down memory lane, we find an advertisement placed in the West Australian by the then acting secretary of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union, the late R.E. Archer, Ted Archer, on the results of a general meeting of members of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union, calling upon the state government to drop the proposed legislation in the interests of industrial harmony-just as unions and the Trades and Labour Council in Western Australia are doing today-and referring to the need to alert the public to the pernicious provisions of the bill. Under the heading, 'No back-down on fuel Bill, says Court' we find Sir Charles Court quoted in the West Australian in October 1974: He said that there was every reason to regard Tuesday's stoppages as part of the declared ""spring offensive"" of the Communist PartyThat was Sir Charles Court's rationale, that everything was Communist Party inspired. But for those people in Western Australia and Australia who are interested in their working conditions, who are interested in the sorts of wages and conditions that working people can expect, they need to remember a simple formula: Richard Court equals Charles Court equals John Howard. The industrial relations policies pursued by the Western Australian state government in 1974 are the same as those philosophically pursued by the Western Australian Court Liberal government in 1995. They will be the same as those pursued by John Howard if he ever becomes Prime Minister of this country. House adjourned at 8.00 p.m. NA NA",104

The following answers to questions were circulated: Qantas Flight QF20: Aborted Take Off (Question No. 2316) Mr Atkinson asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) Did Qantas flight QF20 from Manila to Sydney abort its take-off on 22 April 1995; if so, what was the (a) cause of the incident, (b) value of the equipment which failed and (c) cost to Qantas of the resulting delay. (2) How frequently are Qantas aircrafts' fuel filters inspected by (a) ground engineers, (b) Qantas captains or flight engineers or (c) other staff. (3) Have similar incidents occurred involving domestic or international flights to or from Australia since April 1994; if so, in each case, what was the (a) date, (b) location, (c) airline and flight number, (d) cause, (e) delay to affected passengers and (f) cost to the airline.",106
234,Mr BRERETON,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Qantas, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) have provided the following information: On 22 April 1995 Qantas Hight QF20, a Boeing 767-300 enroute from Manila to Sydney, was involved in an aborted take-off. (1)(a) The cause of this incident was a minor shortfall in the take-off power setting of the right hand engine. The flight crew aborted the take-off before any limiting conditions were reached. This type of problem can be caused by leakage or restriction of the air pressure signal tubes associated with the 'Main Engine Control' (MEC) which schedules the fuel flow to the engine. These tubes were cleaned and checked for security. As an added precaution, the engine fuel filter was replaced. Although the removed filter contained several small pieces of rubber sealant, this filter was not considered to have been a contributor to the power shortfall. A subsequent engine ground run confirmed that full take-off power was available. (b) The Main Engine Control is valued at approximately A$270,000. (c) The aircraft departed Manila approximately 2.5 hours late. As the delay to QF20 did not result NA in an overnight stay or significant rescheduling, the cost to Qantas was minimal. (2) In order to gain access to the fuel filter elements for inspection or replacement, the engine fuel system must be opened. When the system is sealed again, the maintenance crew must run the engine to ensure that the disturbed components will not leak with the fuel system pressurised. This task can only be performed by Aircraft Ground Engineers. (a) Ground engineers perform fuel filter maintenance for Qantas aircraft at the following intervals: NA Inspection following aircraft delivery and prior to entering Qantas service. Inspection after the first 250 flying hours of service. (Replacement of filter and reinspection if contamination found. Repeat until filter remains clear). Inspection after approximately 250 flying hours following a major aircraft maintenance visit where the fuel tanks may have been disturbed. Replacement of filters whenever fuel system contamination is suspected. BOEING 737-300 and 737-400 Replace filter every 3,600 flying hours BOEING 767-200 Replace filter every 5,000 flying hours BOEING 767-300 Replace filter every 3,500 flying hours BOEING 747-200 and 747-300 Replace filter every 3,400 flying hours BOEING 747-400 Replace filter every 4,000 flying hours AIRBUS A300 Replace filter every 1,600 flying hours. (b) Qantas captains and flight engineers do not inspect fuel filters. (c) Other staff do not inspect fuel filters. As a result of the precautions taken during aircraft refuelling and maintenance, fuel filter blockages are extremely rare. In addition, the engine fuel system incorporates a number of safeguards to prevent engine malfunction or damage if a significant amount of contamination enters a filter. An electrical pressure switch monitors the operation of the filter. This device will activate a cockpit warning to alert the flight crew when the filter becomes partially blocked. If the blockage becomes significant, a valve will open which will allow the engine fuel supply to bypass the contaminated filter. (3)(a)-(t) Following are Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) occurrence summaries of aborted takeoffs by airline aircraft where possible fuel system problems were identified. The summaries have been extracted from BASI records since April 1994. Date: 25 April 1994 Location : Perth Aircraft Model: BAE 146-200A Aircraft Registration: VH-JJP The aircraft aborted take off due to number 3 engine not reaching the required power for take off. Engine failed to reach required power due to Fuel Control Unit (FCU) defect which left the bleed band open after start. Date: 12 May 1994 Location : Sydney Aircraft Model : F27 MK 50 Aircraft Registration: VH-FNH During take off roll the left engine failed to reach take off power on torque indicator. Takeoff was rejected at approximately 80 knots. The engine handling bleed valve failed ground tests and was changed. The Mechanical Fuel Control(MFC) unit was defective on the ground run and this unit was also changed. All subsequent operation was normal. Date: 15 August 1994 Location : Sydney Aircraft Model : F28 MK 3000 Aircraft Registration: VH-EWF The take off was rejected at 60 knots when number 2 engine only attained 90% thrust. It was later determined the FCU had malfunctioned. Date: 21 March 1995 Location : Perth Aircraft Model : F28 MK 1000 Aircraft Registration: VH-FKC The pilot reported that on take off roll at Perth, the number 2 engine failed to achieve the required take off thrust. The pilot rejected the take off and aircraft was taxied off the active runway without further incident. The fuel flow regulator was replaced. Date : 22 August 1995 Location : Ballina, NSW Aircraft Model : F27 MK 50 Aircraft Registration: VH-FNB The take off was rejected at 60 knots when the right engine failed to achieve the required torque indication. The problem was identified as a faulty fuel control unit. The delay to passengers and costs to the airlines is information that is held by the airlines concerned and is not normally made available to the Government. Telecommunication Carriers: Telephone Towers (Question No. 2426) Ms Worth asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 19 June 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to community concern surrounding the immunity of telecommunications carriers to State and Territory planning laws. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a proposal by Vodafone to build mobile telephone towers in Prospect and Croydon Park, SA, despite the opposition of local councils and communities. (3) What steps is the Government taking to ensure that carriers behave responsibly under the Telecommunications Act. (4) Is a review of the operation of the Telecommunications National Code to start on 1 July 1995; if so, (a) what preparations have been made for the review, (b) how will the review be structured, (c) who will conduct it, (d) what opportunities will there be for community input, (e) will the findings be made public and (t) when will it be completed. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. I have received representations from local councils and residents expressing their concerns about telecommunications carriers immunity from State and Territory planning laws. However I have also received representations from members of Parliament, communities and councils expressing a desire for the extension of mobile and enhanced telecommunications services to their areas. Parliament decided to exempt all three carriers, Telstra (formerly Telecom), Optus and Vodafone, from certain State and Territory laws for the the construction of telecommunications facilities to foster competition by ensuring rapid roll-out of the carriers' networks. The competitIOn amongst Telecom, Optus and Vodafone has already lowered prices and ensured better quality of service, two major objectives of the Government's telecommunications policy. (2) Yes. The Mayor of Prospect has written to me outlining the concerns of the Council and the local community about the environmental impact of establishing a telecommunications network in their city and the Vodafone proposal in particular. I have forwarded the Mayor's letter to AUSTEL for information and future reference should the Council seek to refer future proposals under the National Code. I have received one representation in relation to the Vodafone proposal at Croydon Park. (3) As a counterbalance to the powers and immunities granted to the telecommunications carriers by the Parliament under the Telecommunications Act 1991, the Act requires that the carriers abide by a code of conduct (the Telecommunications National Code) when constructing specified facilities such as mobile telecommunications towers. The Code ensures that environmental, heritage, planning and development issues are adequately considered when carrying out construction of specified facilities, including mobile phone towers. The Code includes provisions governing environmental and heritage matters and establishes a consultation process that carriers must undertake with relevant Government authorities and local Councils. A draft Telecommunications National Code was prepared during 1991 following extensive consultations with the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT), the carriers, potential second carriers and the States. In December 1991 the draft Telecommunications National Code was published and AUSTEL requested to hold a public inquiry into the draft Code. In March 1992 AUSTEL released a discussion paper on the draft Code and invited public comment through submissions. The Commonwealth Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, the Australian National Parks Councils, the NSW Environment Protection Authority, and the Local Government Association of NSW and Shires Association of NSW were among those bodies that provided submissions. All submitters were offered the opportunity to expand on their submissions in face to face meetings with AUSTEL. AUSTEL reported its findings to the Minister for Transport and Communications in September 1992. The draft Code was subsequently amended to incorporate the comments contained in the AUSTEL report. Further consultations with the carriers, AUSTEL, and the Environment Protection Agency were then conducted. Following this exhaustive consultation process, I gazetted the Telecommunications National Code on 30 June 1994. It represents a significant improvement over the previous draft Code. It reduces the carriers' powers to unilaterally decide on the environmental significance of proposals; tightens consultation procedures between carriers and local government authorities; and requires that carriers co-locate tower facilities if certain conditions are met. As you are aware, the Code's operation was put in jeopardy by a Notice of Motion from Senator Richard Alston to disallow the Code, which he later withdrew on 30 November 1994. If the Code was disallowed the carriers would have been required to comply with the previous draft Code. The draft Code contains less stringent environmental and consultation requirements than the current Code, and Senator Alston's approach of disallowing the Code would have therefore meant a much less stringent regulatory environment governing the carriers' activities. Specifically, the current Code spells out circumstances where carriers are automatically required to notify the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST) of their intention to engage in a particular activity. Objections raised by DEST must be resolved before the carrier can proceed. Those provisions effectively operate as a veto power. The Code is also more responsive to community concerns about mobile facilities. It specifically provides a role for local councils to receive full details of the carriers' proposed activities to enable affected communities to be consulted. Jf, after consultation, there is still disagreement between a carrier and a local government authority about the environmental significance of a mobile facility site (including any visual impact), that proposal must be referred to DEST if the council so requests. Again, the carrier cannot proceed until any objections by DEST are resolved. If it is felt that a carrier was not fulfilling its obligations under the Code, the matter can be referred to AUSTEL, which has power under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enforce compliance with the Code. The carriers have all agreed to guidelines complementary to the Telecommunications National Code for local community notification and consultation. These guidelines were developed in association with the Municipal Association of Victoria. It is the Government's expectation that the carriers will apply these guidelines nationwide. (4) Yes. (a) On 6 June 1995 I issued a direction to AUSTEL under paragraph 327(b) of the Telecommunications Act 1991 to hold a public inquiry into the operation of the Telecommunications National Code. AUSTEL has issued a Discussion Paper and placed advertisements in the national press on the weekend of 8-9 July 1995 calling for submissions to the Review and has held public meetings in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra. (b) I have asked AUSTEL to examine the operations of the Code since its introduction on 30 June 1994, induding the notification and consultation requirements of the Code and any other issue that is important to the operation of the Code. In order to comply with Section 117(5) of the Act, I am required to publish a new draft Code prior to the determination of a new National Code. Therefore, after receipt and consideration of AUSTEL's report on the current Code, I will, if necessary, determine a new draft National Code and issue a direction for AUSTEL to conduct an inquiry into this Code in accordance with paragraph 117(5) of the Act. (c) The review is being conducted by AUSTEL. (d) Submissions were invited from all interested parties, and public meetings have been held. (e) AUSTEL will report to me on it's findings. Any new draft Code will also be issued for public comment. (t) I have asked that AUSTEL expedite the inquiry process. In addition, I announced on 1 August 1995 the policy, legislative and regulatory changes to telecommunications to apply from 1 July 1997. As part of this package I announced that AUSTEL, in consultation with the Environment Protection Agency, will undertake a review of existing carrier powers and immunities with a view to tightening the obligations now placed on carriers. The review will report on the adequacy of relying on State planning laws. Private Security Services: Department of Primary Industries and Energy (Question No. 2462) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: $508,157.00 Waterfront Reform: Audit System (Question No. 2525) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 30 June 1995: (1) What audit system is used to manage the payment of levies through the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to discharge the Waterfront Industry Reform Agency and Australian Industry Development Corporation loan raised to finance redundancy payments associated with waterfront reforms. (2) Have Form Is relating to the payment of the levies referred to in part (1) been submitted by all agents at all Australian ports for vessels employing Waterside Workers Federation/Maritime Union of Australia labour. (3) What audit system is used to verify that stevedores pay the levies according to the legal requirements. (4) Who (a) conducts and (b) reviews the audits referred to in parts (1) and (3). (5) How many audits have been conducted during the life of the loan referred to in part (1). (6) Are the results of the audits referred to in parts (1) and (3) available; if so, from whom. (7) How many (a) major and (b) secondary ports have (i) been audited and (ii) made the results available. (8) Did the audits referred to in part (7) address (a) individual or (b) aggregate port performance and compliance. (9) When will the loan referred to in part (1) be discharged. (10) Has cash on hand been accounted for in determining the probable discharge date.",108
235,Mr BRERETON,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A loan facility was negotiated between the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (the Committee) and AIDC Ltd, with effect from November 1991, to finance redundancy and early retirement payments under the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) In-Principle Agreement. The Committee makes loan repayments. Stevedoring employers are responsible for paying the statutory levies and for submitting returns to the Department of Industrial Relations. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) audits the accounts and financial statements of the Department and the Committee annually. I am advised that this audit activity has been supplemented by sample audits, commissioned in 1993 and 1994 by the Committee in liaison with the Department and conducted by Coopers & Lybrand, and a survey, subject to audit confirmation, covering all main ports and other ports on a rotation basis, reconciling vessel movements to cargo declarations submitted by individual agents. Further audit work will be undertaken as part of the wind-up of the levy collection arrangements. (2) I am advised that a survey covering all main ports and other ports on a rotation ing vessel movements to cargo declarations submitted by individual agents, has been undertaken. The survey, which is subject to audit confirmation, is now being finalised. (3) Stevedores' returns are based on declarations made by ship's agents. The amounts of levy paid to the Commonwealth are reconciled to the tonnage declared in returns submitted by stevedores. The annual accounts and financial statements of the Department are audited by the ANAO. (4) See (1) and (3) above. (5) See (1) above. (6) I am advised that the Coopers & Lybrand audit reports, the survey specification and the ANAO audits of its financial statements are available from the Committee; the ANAO audits of its financial statements are available from the Department of Industrial Relations. (7) I am advised that the Coopers & Lybrand sample audits covered Sydney (1992 audit) and Sydney and Melbourne (1994 audit). These audit reports are available from the Committee. (8) I am advised that the ments entail obligations on individual ship's agents and stevedoring employers and audit activity was structured accordingly. (9) The timing and basis of the discharge of the loan are matters for the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to determine. I am advised that the loan was discharged on 18 September 1995. (10) I am advised that cash on hand was taken into account in determining the discharge date. Extending Medicare Benefits (Question No. 2551) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) What estimates has her Department prepared on the cost of extending Medicare's coverage to (a) dental and (b) optometry services.",111
236,Dr LAWRENCE,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) My Department has not prepared any recent estimates for the possible cost of Medicare coverage for dental services. Prior to my time as Minister I understand that a preliminary estimate was made that this cost would be in the order of about $2 billion annually. In accordance with its election promise, the Government is providing $278 million over the four years to 1996-97 to improve access to basic dental services for Health Card holders, their adult dependants, and for holders of Commonwealth basis, reconcil- Seniors Health Cards. (b) Optometry is already covered by Medicare benefits. In 1994-95 there were 3.29 million services at a cost of $129.9 million. 92.9% were bulk billed. UNIDROIT Convention (Question No. 2558) Mr Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1995: (1) After the answer to question No. 2114 (Hansard, 9 May 1995, page 108), was the Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (a) adopted by Diplomatic Conference in Rome on 23 June 1995 and (b) opened for signature at the closing session of the conference on 24 June 1995. (2) Which states have signed the convention. (3) On what date did each sign. (4) What declarations did each make when levy collection arrangesigning. (5) What is Australia's timetable for (a) signing and (b) ratifying the convention. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a) The Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects was adopted by the Diplomatic Conference in Rome on 23 June 1995 with the following vote. 37 delegations in favour, 5 against and 17 abstentions. (b) Yes, the convention was opened for signature on 24 June 1995 at the concluding meeting of the Conference. (2) and (3) the following states signed the Convention: Burkina Faso-24. V1.1995; Cambodia24.VI.1995; Cote d'Ivoire-24.VI.1995; Croatia24.VI.1995; France (ad referendum)-24.VI.l995; Guinea-24. V1.1995; Hungary-24. V1.1995; ltaly-24.VI.1995; Lithuania-24.VI.1995; Zambia-24.VI.l995; Georgia-27.VI.l995; (4) At the time of signature, the states concerned made no declarations. (5) The Unidroit Convention is open for signature until the 30 June 1996 and is open for accession by all states which are not signatory states as from the date on which it is open for signature. (a) and (b) Australia has no timetable for signing or ratifying the convention at this stage. Social Security Computer System: (Question No. 2589) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: What are the introduction of changes to the social security system from 1 July 1995 and the problems associated with new computer programs to implement the changes costing the Commonwealth. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Funding specifically appropriated to the Department of Social Security (DSS) for the introduction of changes to the social security system from 1 July 1995, announced as part of the 1993-94 and 199495 Budgets, is: Running Costs $12.6M Capital $12.7M Changes to the social security system for ongoing legislative requirements such as CPI adjustments, end of financial year processing and deeming rate adjustments were also made. These costs are not separately identified but they constituted approximately 15 per cent of the content of the June systems release. Processing difficulties experienced in the fortnight after the June release highlighted capacity problems with the computing infrastructure. To relieve these problems, the Department brought forward some initiatives from its capacity management plan. The June changes were one of, if not the, largest systems release DSS has managed. Special arrangements were made to minimise impact on social security recipients. In particular the daily 'positive stimulus' processing of JobsearchlNewstart allowances required special processing arrangements to be made, similar to normal holiday processing. These give rise to some overpayments, not all of which are recoverable. Staff costs associated with managing problems that arose as a result of the release have been approximately $2 million. Mr Tony Blair (Question No. 2590)",112
237,Mr COSTELLO,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 August 1995: (1) Did Mr Tony Blair, Leader of the Opposition in the UK House of Commons, travel on a GovernChanges ment VIP aircraft to Townsville; if so, (a) will the Minister provide full details of how the Government arranged the travel and (b) what was the cost of the aircraft trip on which Mr Blair travelled.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. I assume you are referring to a VIP flight from Sydney to Cairns. (a) On 16 July 1995, a Falcon 900 was tasked to travel to Cairns to pick up the Prime Minister and carry him and his party to Hamilton Island. Mr Blair and some of the Prime Minister's staff travelled on the positioning leg from Sydney to Cairns. Mr Blair subsequently travelled with the Prime Minister to Hamilton Island. (b) $7750. 1994-95 1995-96 Alcohol and Tobacco: Health Expenditure Costs $1.7M (Question No. 2594) $1.6M",113
238,Mr CAMERON,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 29 August 1995: (1) What is the estimated cost in terms of health expenditure resulting from (a) alcohol consumption and (b) smoking tobacco. (2) How many Australians died in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994 where the primary cause of death was (i) alcohol consumption and (ii) smoking tobacco. (3) Is excessive consumption of alcohol sufficiently dangerous to warrant warnings on alcohol packaging similar to those on cigarette packaging; if not, why not; if so, will the Government introduce laws to compel alcohol companies to put warnings on alcohol packaging.",113
239,Dr LAWRENCE,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Based on a survey commissioned by the Commonwealth using 1988 data, the estimated aggregate health outlays (Commonwealth, Statefferritory and local government) relating to drug abuse was $1,167.6 million (in 1994 dollars), of which the Commonwealth contributed $626.2 million (1994 dollars). Commonwealth health outlays (medical, hospital and nursing homes expenditure) relating to alcohol use amounted to $269.3 million (1994 dollars), while Commonwealth health outlays relating to tobacco use totalled $338.1 million (1994 dollars). (2) Total drug caused deaths are estimated by applying a set of aetiological or causal fractions, developed by the Commonwealth, to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) national deaths data. Data is not yet available for 1994, however, total deaths attributable to alcohol and tobacco use for 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 are as follows: (a) 1990 (i) Alcohol-6,605; (ii) Tobacco-I8,111 (b) 1991 (i) Alcohol-6,507; (ii) Tobacco--I7,963. (c) 1992 (i) Alcohol-3,660; (ii) Tobacco-l8,920 (d) 1993 (i) Alcohol-3,333; (ii) Tobacco-18,607 The significant decrease in alcohol related deaths in 1992 and 1993 are attributable to the recognition that moderate and responsible drinking, as defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), may not necessarily be harmful. Estimates for both years have taken this into consideration for the first time, while, earlier estimates were derived from comparisons between the health of total abstainers and all drinkers. (3) In 1992, the National Food Authority (NFA) called for submissions from interested parties about the proposed change to food standards which would require manufacturers to label alcoholic beverages with the number of standard drinks they contain. In its submission to the NFA in December 1992, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (MCDS) stated that a standard drink statement supported by a broad education campaign, would be more effective as an initial strategy in addressing harmful and hazardous consumption of alcohol than would the introduction of health warning labels on beverage containers. All alcoholic beverages will be required by law to have standard drink information on their labels as of December 1995. A standard drinks education campaign is presently being developed by the Commonwealth in collaboration with Statesrrerritories, the non-government sector and the alcohol industry. Non-Government Organisations Forum: Workshops (Question No. 2614)",113
240,Mr CAMERON,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, upon notice, on 19 September 1995: Is she able to say what benefits were gained for Australian women at the recent workshops in Huairou, People's Republic of China, in particular the workshops entitled 'The role of inflatable lifesize plastic dolls and dildos in improving health' and 'Lesbian flirtation techniques'.",114
241,Dr LAWRENCE,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The workshops held in Huairou 30 August-8 September were part of the activities of the NonGovernment Organisations (NGO) Forum on Women which was held in conjunction with the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. I understand that the NGO Forum ran workshops on a range of issues, including human rights, education, media, health, representation and economic security. In keeping with the trend of growing NGO input to official UN conferences, representatives at the NGO Forum in Huairou made a positive contribution to the proceedings of the official Conference in Beijing, including in the development of the Platform for Action. However, as the Forum was a NGO event, the Government holds no responsibility for its proceedings or outcomes. I am therefore unable to comment on the benefits which may have been gained by Australian women who attended workshops at the Forum. Disability Discrimination Act: Action Plan (Question No. 2630) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 20 September 1995: (1) Does his Department maintain a Disability Discrimination Act action plan; if so, (a) will he provide a copy of the plan, (b) when was it completed, (c) when did implementation of the plan commence and (d) is implementation complete. (2) If the Department does not maintain an action plan, (a) what action has been taken to develop a plan, (b) when will it be completed and (c) what is the timetable for implementation. (3) How does his Department define ""disability"". Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Under the Commonwealth Disability Strategy there is a requirement for all Commonwealth Departments and Agencies to develop an action plan which incorporates equal opportunity objectives into corporate planning and all program and service delivery planning and lodge it with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission by 1997. My Department is in the process of developing a plan and will do so well inside the deadline. My Department has incorporated equal opportunity objectives for my Department's staff into its corporate planning for a number of years. Within my Department's programs, access by people with a disability is monitored in many instances and where necessary specialised programs to increase participation by people with a disability are implemented. Further, the Commonwealth Disability Strategy, introduced in November 1994, provides a plan to enhance, over time, opportunities for people with a disability to access all Commonwealth programs, services and facilities. The Strategy, which established a ten year framework for this purpose, was developed by the Government to provide a framework to meet the Commonwealth's obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the United Nations Standard Rules for the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in late 1993. In October 1995 (and every two years thereafter) the Minister for Human Services and Health will table a report in Parliament on the overall progress in implementing the Strategy. (3) My Department does not have a universal definition of disability. Rather disability is preted in the context of a particular program or service being provided. The Commonwealth Employment Service, for example, defines a jobseeker with a disability as a person who has an impairment that results in loss or reduction in functional capacity to the extent that he/she has difficulty finding or keeping work. In the higher education context, the definition involves whether a student has an impairment or long term medical condition which may affect studies. In general terms, disability is defined as constituting a barrier to employment, education or training. National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Question No. 2644)",114
242,Mr EVANS,ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES,"the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 25 September 1995: (1) What action is the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Cherni cals (NRA) taking in relation to (a) glyphosate and (b) Roundup 360. (2) Has the NRA sent letters about the chemicals referred to in part (1); if so, (a) to whom, (b) what is the content of the letters, (c) why were they sent, (d) how will responses be monitored, (e) what steps will be taken in relation to each response, (f) how will responses be assessed and (g) what is the time frame for assessment.
