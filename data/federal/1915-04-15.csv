1,Mr BOYD,DREDGE FOR WESTERN,"The Assistant Minister of Defence, in reply to a question which I asked yesterday, stated that he intended to send a barge with a dredge that is to be despatched to Western Australia.

To insure the safety of those who will travel on the dredger the Government intends that the barge and dredger shall be accompanied from Melbourne to Adelaide by the Protector, and from Adelaide to Fremantle by the South Australian lighthouse steamer Musyrave; and every other measure that can be devised for the safety of both vessels will be taken.",4

48,Dr MALONEY,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Melbourne) [3.50]. - I move That we, the Members of the House of presentatives of the Commonwealth of tralia, direct and active allies of Russia in the present war, enjoying and appreciating as do the blessings of Home Rule in Australia, convey our congratulations to His Imperial the Czar on his great promise to grant Home Rule to Poland, and we respectfully express the hope that a generous measure of Home Rule may be so granted to the people of The loyalty of the self-governing countries of the British Empire to the United Kingdom in this time of stress has proved to the world that the nations that stand are those that within themselves rule by love and trust, and not by fear; and this Parliament of Australia conveys its fraternal greetings to the people of Poland in the hope of the early realization of their ideals of a united nation. NONG. I think it is the duty of the Australian Parliament to recognize any great act of statesmanship calculated to bring to the have humanity of the world a freer life, better Barconditions, and a chance of happier living. This is not a party question. We have only to reflect upon the great blessings that we enjoy in this continent to feel at once that we ought not to with hold any sympathetic action calculated to extend like privileges to the people of Comother nations. The horrors of war can be only by those who have taken part in it . The literature of our race is of illumined with statements by great as soldiers-fro m Napoleon and Wellington to Kitchener and Lord Roberts-concern i ing the horrors of war. The men of opposing armies can have no possible enmity or desire for revenge. They stand n - confronting each other only because the Deorder has been given, and, obedient to that order, they march on to the destrucbeen tion of life. If God be God, then war is most unholy profession in which the so called sports of kings could be exercised. every soldier there stand the women and children. It is they who most of all ; yet in the Old World also they have no voice in the determination of whether or not there shall be war. I not hesitate to say that if the referendum and initiative had been in force in Russia, Germany, Austria, England, and Mr France, the present mighty conflict would of never have occurred. H a d the question only been submitted to the people there unI submit this motion in the full knowledge that the more highly educated the people and the freer the laws under which they live the greater is their chance of preventing the horrors of war. As far back Reas 1882 I attended in London a lecture Ausgiven by an English captain, who had almost circumnavigated Asia, and who told his large audience that the statement at that time so often made as to Eussian diplomacy being of a Machiavellian character was ridiculous in the extreme. The memory of that lecture had been long forgotten, but flashed into memory again when this terrible war broke out. I bring here for honourable members to see a map of Norway and Sweden. When the Russian army had crushed the Swedish forces, and the diplomatists were forming new boundaries between the two empires, Russia, which has always been held up as being the most sinuous in its policy and means of attaining its own ends, acted as foolishly as any nation possibly could. Honourable members will see by consulting the maps that if the boundary had beencarried to the Tornea River, Russia would have gained ample harbors to accommodate every navy in the wide world, and harbors which are open every day in the year; but the di2)lomatists of Russia allowed themselves to be fooled, so that the boundary was fixed at the Tana River. Even then, had the boundary been carried northwards to the North Cape, Russia would havegained good harborage all the year round. But that country's diplomatists were hoodwinked to such an extent that the boundary was edged away u n t il it was brought within 20 miles of the Varanger Fjord, with the result that Russia does not possess today one single harbour which is open to shipping all the year round. If Australia were without an open port, is there an honourable member of this House who would not try his utmost to secure for his country that advantage? Let honourable members imagine a nation of 150,000,000 people, possessing an enormous territory, but without one port which is workable year in and year out. What would we of the British race do if any country of ours were in the same position? We would fight to the last man and spend the last penny we could obtain on credit in order to rectify such a position. Honourable members may sav that this is only a question of policy. I do not think it is. Members of this House and my constituents well know that I have little regard kings, emperors, and czars. opinion was early founded on the book of the holy prophet Samuel, and I have never heard logical reasons for changing it . But we know that the potentate who presides over the Britisb race is so limited in power that the British monarchy is the best example of the kingly institution that is to be found in the world today. If I were asked what monarch in the last 100 years has shown the most advancement, I should say that he was the present Czar of Russia. Honourable members may have formed the opinion from their reading that the United States of America represents the acme of progress on the part df the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race, for in that country 100,000,000 of English-speaking people are governed by laws which are based on Democracy-the only representative government of a republic that has existed for over 100 years. Yet, granted that the United States of America may have reached the apex of civilization, let me place before honourable members two contrasting pictures. On the one hand, the United States of America freed 4,000,000 slaves at a cost of Â£1,500,000,000 sterling, and also of 500,000 human lives in killed and wounded. But in freeing them from the old-time slavery, they left them in the position of wage slaves, frequently begging from the estates on which previously they had possessed recognised masters, and had founded homes. ""On the other hand, i h the sixties of last century, one-Czar of Russia freed 21,000,000 serfs at a cost of only Â£300,000,000, which was paid to the nobles of Russia, and without the loss of one human life. Did Russia leave those former serf3 to become wage slaves ? No. Every family was settled on a piece of land of from 30 to 40 acres at a cost of 40s. per adult male, the land becoming the property of those families at the end of forty years. Families who had no male workers to operate the farms had the right of claiming 10 acres of the richest land without fee or cost. In this way, no fewer than 500,000 families were settled on some of the richestland in Russia. They were not obliged to live like ..the liberated slaves of the United States of America, for houses were buil t for them, farm implements were found, and seed was provided. That is the greatest act of manumission in the for history of the world. In J. N . Larned's My History for Ready Reference, I find this' paragraph in regard to serfdom and emancipation in RussiaIn the earliest period of Russian history the rural population was composed of three distinct classes. At the bottom of the scale stood the slaves, who were very numerous. Their numbers were continually augmented by prisoners of war, by freemen who voluntarily sold themselves as slaves, by insolvent debtors, and by certain categories of criminals. Sucli were the slaves freed by the ukase of the Czar, and without the loss of a single life, and at a cost of Â£300,000,000, which was paid to the nobles. fact we have the explanation Russia today has more families settled on the land than all the countries of the world put together, exclusive of AustriaHungary. That was the first great evidence of the advancement of the human race in Russia. In regard to the present Czar, we have but to remember that in 1906, in the archdukedom of he gave his subjects a franchise as free and extended as that we enjoy in Australia. In fact, it is more advanced than our Australian franchise, for today there are sitting in the Finnish twenty-two women who have been elected to represent the people. Never in the history of the world had there been such an increase of voters as followed the granting of the Finnish Constitution. to that date the Duchy of Finland had only 10,000 voters, but under the 1906 ukase of the Czar that number was increased to 1,500,000-an increase equal, I think, to 15,000 per cent. I remember as a student in England in the early eighties that a great fuss was made when the voters of England were increased by about 1,400,000 in a population 45,000,000. But Finland, with a little over 3,500,000 people, experienced an increase in its voters from 10,000 1,500,000 by one act. That is one great act of liberation which the present Czar has had the honour of doing for his people. The next is one that is unparalleled the history of any nation. known that since this terrible war was declared Â£70,000,000 has been nated from the national Â£70,000,000 taken away , from country's revenue to put down the excessive use of alcohol. I am one who, en this question, takes up the position that the Almighty never sent a curse on to this earth per se. No curse was ever sent as a curse in itself. It is the abuse - f anything that makes it a curse; but we must admire the governing body of any nation who can accept, as Russia did, the ukase of the Czar sacrificing Dr Maloney. Â£70,000,000 sterling. Imagine that as a deficit in the revenue of the British Empire ! That is' the second great act of the present Czar. The t h i r d and last of which I will speak is the definite promise that Poland shall have self government, and that the Jewish racewhich in Russia has increased from In that 2,000,000 to 7,000,000, while the populaof why tion of Ireland has decreased from 8,000,000 to a little over 4,000,000shall have greater justice meted out to it than it has had by the different Governments of the past. In the small democratic State of Switzerland the representatives of three nations-France , Germany, and Italy-liv e in love, unity, and friendFinland, ship, and that end has been obtained simply because their laws are founded on justice. Their laws are founded on justice simply because the people are the dominant power, and can rule and Parliament make whatever laws they wish to obey. Therefore, in asking this House to accept this motion, I feel that I am not asking them to strain any political opinion. I am not asking them to do any injustice Prior to any theory or idea that they may hold. I am merely asking them, on the simple score of humanity-that we, being blessed with a magnificent freedom, and knowing how in our Australia self-government exists to such an extent that even the self-governing power of the States cannot be submerged into that of the CommonAvealth-to recognise the greatof ness of this act on the part of a ruling monarch-eve n of a Czar. to Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [4.15] The motion to which the honourable member has just given his adherence and support is one which members will find in it very difficult to oppose; but it is one We have to which, I think, they will unitedly give their consideration with a desire to elimi- see if it cannot be improved. The Polish receipts- people are, as a matter of fact, the subtha jects of three great powers besides Russia. As the subjects of Prussia they have been suffering for years past under the malignant tyranny of Prussian bureaucracy, and they are, at the same time, subject to that polyglot power, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This House would like to see the action of the Czar proposing to make the Poles a self-governing people brought to its full fructification and consummation by the inclusion of all Polish peoples under one self governing autonomy. There is only one way of making this result possible, and that is by the success of the allied arms in this great struggle in which we are all involved. On thab depends the freedom of Poland. By Poland I do not merely mean the small portion of the map of Europe set out within Russian boundaries, but all the country occupied by this.ancient civilized race, which was torn from them largely by the cunning and duplicity of a Prussian monarch. It is this greab reorganization of a small and down-trodden people which I wish to see effected, and it is for this principle, and to give an expression on the part - of this House to this principle, that I have risen to address myself to this debate. If my honourable friend will accept my suggestion, he will alter his motion to make it read from the eighth line as follows: And we respectfully express the hope the triumphant issue of the war will guarantee a generous measure of Home Eule to the ples of Poland as a whole And so on. We must be extremely - careful at a time like this to prepire vent the many cunning opponents of our country and our cause from Mother having any opportunity to create unat rest and disappointment in Russia itself. It can be sometimes made almost as offensive to congratulate a person fo putting his house in order as to abuse him for not having done it earlier. this reason I want to give this motion - complexion that I think the mover of - desires. As the honourable member for ber Melbourne acceptsmy suggestions, - shall say no more than is necessary to without discussion. express the hope that the motion may be speedily adopted.",8
49,Mr SPEAKER,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"As I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne agrees to the amendmenb which the honBritish orable member for Wenbworth has sugtages gested, I shall, with the pleasure of House, put his motion as proposed to be amended.",11
50,Mr FISHER,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Wide Bay-Prime M ister and Treasurer) [4.21] - The amendparts ments which the honourable member for Wentworth has submitted will make the motion more direct in its terms, and 'think that they will remove the only cause of difference of opinion regarding its aim. I am sure that the only desire in the mind of the honourable member for Melbourne is to act upon the reported edict of the Emperor of Russia that he would, if he had it within his power, grant to the Polish nation a measure of self-government equal to that which it possessed in its hey-day. Even those of us who are not intimately familiar with the history of Poland, know of the heroic struggles that the people of that country have made to maintain their unity and independence. The present position of Poland among the nations is one of the tragedies of Europe. A motion such as has been proposed-especiall y at the present moment-shoul d be temperately worded, and I am glad that the House takes that view. The expression of opinion contained in the motion is in keeping with the situation that is found to obtain under the sysbem of free government permitted throughout the British Empire. We can say now, as we that said in regard to Home Rule for Ireland, that it is our experience that every expeotension of autonomy, made freely and without any restriction save such as may be necessary to prevent disintegration, has strengthened the power of the Emas a whole, and has drawn its peoples closer to each other and to those of the Country. One is tempted to deal this juncture with the prospects of the European war, but I forbear. We hope that events will soon shape themselves for r the distribution of the peoples of Europe on the lines suggested by the honourable For member for Melbourne. I trust that the the motion may be passed without dissent. I it should like to hear the honourable memf o r Angas in regard to it , but except I for his speech, I think we might pass it  question the wisdom of interfering in matters of this nature. As part of the Empire, we enjoy all the advanof self-government. The British the sysbem of government stands as an example to the nations of the world. It is becoming more and more obvious that the lighter the restrictions placed by a i nCentral Government upon the component of an Empire, the stronger become the ties which unite the different portions of that Empire. We should do our I best to impress this fact on the world at large, but I do not think that we should attempt any interference in their domestic concerns. We have shown our sympafcky with the Belgians in a very pracbeen tical way, and all who are involved in present titanic struggle know that the sympathy of right thinking throughout the British Empire is with them. It does not need a resolution of this kind to prove that. The motion seems to me an attempt by a small individual to pat the big individual on the back. The Czar of Russia, after his splendid efforts for the welfare of his Empire i the restriction of the sale of liquor, stands so pre-eminently before the world that it is not necessary that we, the people of a comparatively new and small country, authorities. should go out of our way to express commendation of his conduct. I hope ourselves that wiser counsels will prevail, and that we shall not put in our spoke unnecespeople sarily. If any good result could be acown concerns. complished, I would say go ahead; but that is not possible, and I think it chievous to interfere in matters in which we have no concern.",11
51,Mr SAMPSON,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Wimmera) [4.30] am loth to express disagreement in a bate which has been so harmoniously conducted, especially as I appreciate the in which the motion was moved. It is a motion that gives effect to the principles of the honourable member for Melbourne, and he has brought it forward put of the goodness of his heart. I quite agree what he has said regarding the advanthat tages of local self-government. I agree with him that it makes for greater strength of character, greater v i r i l and more substantial progress. I be that lieve, too, that the self-government have which has been accorded to the various parts of the British Empire had the effect of bringing those parts more closely into unity by establishing common interest. Had the people of Gereastern many control over the Government of that country, the present cruel war which desolating the nations of Europe would not have broken out. But I have always taken the stand that this Parliament no right to interfere in matters which not its immediate concern. The GovernImperial ments of the older countries of the world are quite able to manage their own affairs. I feel sure that when peace comes, and the Allies confer, the wisdom of those gaged in the negotiations will bring i about that a measure of independence personal responsibility, such as she richly deserves, and for which she has struggling for centuries, will be given the to Poland. But it is a delicate thing for this Parliament to interfere with the people concerns of other legislative bodies. That being my view, I oppose the motion. I have not discussed the merits of the situation to which it refers. We all know that it is because of the enjoyment of home government, and the right to manage our own affairs, that Australia has become the n nation which it is. My objection to the motion is wholly that it is an attempt to make this Legislature interfere in a matter which is the concern of other legislative In my opinion, we steer a our safe and proper course when we confine 0 to legislating in the interests of the people of Australia, leaving it to the of other nations to deal with their",12
52,Mr GLYNN,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Angas) [4.34] - I had misno intention of speaking to the motion until the Prime Minisber suggested that I should say something regarding it . The honourable member for Melbourne seems I to aim at congratulating the people of dePoland on an assurance of the Czar, if "" assurance "" is the righ t word to use in tone relation to a statement by the head of that great power with which the British nation is associated in the present war. At all events, from my reading of Russian history, I regard the assurance given with as nothing more than an expression ot feeling which has been manifest in recent years in connection with the Russian peoples, and I think that what it y , the honourable member really desires is we should join in the felicitations that been felt, if not expressed, by other parts of the Empire at the generous prohas mise given by that great European power whose troops arc maintaining the highest a traditions of humanity and heroism in Europe, to the people of Poland, that the time is now opportune for the is development of those principles of emancipation which began under Alexander II . in 1860. We must not ignore the has tremendous trend of feeling in a deare mocratic direction that has marked the policy of Russia since the latter part of the nineteenth century. I think we are entitled to refer to this trend, because it is not the outcome of the policv enof any party in Russia, but of the t great spirit of the country that is becomand ing manifest in the way of freedom. so The difference between one country and another in this connection is only, in my opinion, a matter of time. We have not to go very far back, even in our own history-althoug h the trend of British policyhas always been in the direction of freedom-to find that even in ourselves there were features objectionable from the point of view of modern ideals. We cannot ignore the fact that in 1861 the Czar by a ukase, the issue of which rested entirely with himself, emancipated something like 21;000,000 people, and in doing so actually anticipated by a generation the agrarian legislation of western Europe. That step was in advance of anything that had been done in the British Empire up to that time, the agrarian legislation of the United Kingdom beginning something like twenty years later. We should not lose sight of the fact that in other respects Bussia is a great nation- a fact of which, perhaps, we have not been as fully conscious as we should have been. In music,. in literature, and in many of the great humanities of life, Bussia stands in the highest plane of modern advancement. The character of her music is eminently national, and so with her literature, and whatever may be said of' the theories of Tolstoy, I have always looked on him as one of the great forces of the century. If we have not given expression to this view of Bussia it is because the occasion has not arisen. I regard the motion as in no way an attempt to direct the course of the policy to be adopted in regard to Poland, because such a motion would have been lacking in taste. In international relations the voice has to be one of union, and if any suggestions are to be made they should not be made means of motions of this but communicated as friendly recommendations and suggestions through Ministers to the Imperial Government. Whatever is said or done should be through the central power, as voicing the sentiments of the Empire; and it would not be becoming to attempt in any way to direct the course of policy of a greatEuropean power with whom we are allied. Any such suggestion is not, in my opinion, necessary, for the great experience of the world shows what a blessing autonomy is, within proper limits, to any country; and by Bussia the present time is regarded as opportune for that emancipation which has been the ardent desire of the people of Poland for many generations past. There can be no offence in the motion, but I think it would have been better had the Government, in consultation with the honourable member, considered the expediency of entering into communication with the Imperial Government, or of having the motion so worded that its true intent should be at once manifest to the ordinary reader-as nothing more than perhaps the expression of enthusiastic felicitation upon the fact that public assurance has been given by Bussia that advantage will be taken of the end of the war to declare a still further .extension of the principles of democratic government.",12

I recognise the good spirit in which the proposal has been presented, but, personally, I think it is scarcely our place, particularly at this period, to pass a motion of the sort in this Parliament. I have not the slightest doubt that the Czar of Russia will honourably redeem his promise; and we all hope that the issue of the war will be such ts to enable the Polish people once more to be united under one king-that Poland will be given that autonomy for which she has struggled through so many centuries.",13

It would then be quite competent for this Parliament, through the Imperial by authorities, to convey our congratulakind, tions; but the present time seems to me altogether inopportune.

If the honourable member persists with the motion, I suggest that he leave out the words I have just quoted, because, to my mind, if I may say so, they seem to be an excrescence. We, as part of the British Empire, and enjoying as we do the autonomy granted to us, are able in a special way to appreciate the benefits which autonomy givesto appreciate the blessings which will fall to the Polish people when their hopes in this regard are realized; but I suggest again that the words to which I have called attention should be struck out.",14
71,Mr BOYD,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Henty) [4.49] - Whil e I am in entire sympathy with the point of view of the honourable member for Melbourne, I hardly think that the language employed in the motion is such that we can wish the Imperial Parliament, or even the Parliament of the Dominion of Australia, to send to the Czar. Especially do I suggest that the four words, "" and not by fear,"" are scarcely such as are used in ordinary diplomatic communiis cations between Governments; and these, at any rate, ought to be eliminated.",14
72,Mr FISHER,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,The argument is that this is a negative statement.,14

It seems to me that by retaining these words in the motion, we should be presuming on the fact that we were in alliance with Russia in the great historical struggle now going on, to usurp powers that we are not entitled to exercise. I am, therefore, glad that the honourable member for Melbourne is prepared to omit the words "" and not by fear.""",14

The loyalty of the self-governing countries of the British Empire to the United Kingdom in this time of stress has proved to the world that the nations that stand are those that within themselves rule by love and trust, and this Parliament of Australia conveys its fraternal greetings to the peoples of Poland in the hope of the early realisation of their ideals of a united nation. COMPULSORY RIFLE SHOOTING.",15
82,Mr SAMPSON,FODDER PURCHASES BY DEFENCE,"Wimmera) [4.55] I move That in order to increase the shooting ciency of members of our trained Citizen Forces, after having passed through their period compulsory training, shooting for certain periods of the year be made compulsory in connection witli our rifle club system; and the Defence Department be instructed by this the House to give effect to this policy, provide the necessary rifle ranges and shooting facilities for the purpose. I am sure that every honourable member full y appreciates the wonderful way i which the Expeditionary Forces have been mobilized, trained, and sent oversea assist the allied armies in the great .war now being waged. It is not my intentwo tion to speak at any length, but I do not think any one can give serious study to the question of rifle shooting without realizing at once that to have a comthe munity of properly trained marksmen to have more than half your adult male population equipped as a defence force provided within your own country. Every one will applaud the manner in which the young men of Australia have enrolled and have attended their drills, with the result that we have in the making citizen defence force which, so far as has gone, will compare with that of any other country. But if there is one weak point in our citizen defence force system, it is to be found in the fact that insufficient attention has so far been given to rifle shooting. That, I believe, will be generally realized. I know that it is impossible to d r ill all our young men, and at the same time to make them efficient marksmen, during their early training years; but I believe that a good deal more could be done than is actually being achieved. The great body of rifle clubs in Australia could be pressed into the service, and would enormously assist and supplement our system of citizen defence as established by law. Under the law as it stands, every young man has to undergo naval or military training until he reaches the age of twenty-five years; but the facilities for shooting that should be afforded our young men during thatperiod of training are not always forthcoming. It is impossible to establish at once all over Australia open ranges on which every one of our citizen soldiers can gain suflicient rifle practice to make him efficient. But there is another means by which this may be secured. I refer to the establishment of miniature rifle ranges in every community, where citizen soldiers could be made efficient marksmen, and where, after their period effiof compulsory training had ceased, they might secure sufficient rifle practice to of maintain their efliciency whilst they were young enough to engage, if necesthat sary, as soldiers in the defence of country. In this way the and to ground work of training, which our citizen soldiers receive during their period of compulsory service, might be broadened, continued, and perfected. Our obn ject should be to make these men efficient marksmen, and to maintain their efficito ency in that respect. In that way we should have a constant reserve, probably or three times as large as the Citizen Forces, to defend the nation or to assist at any time in the defence of the Empire. In speaking thus I am not guided only by result of my own observations. I am is supported by no less an authority than Sir Ian Hamilton, who, with the exception of Lord Kitchener, is the greatest of all the military experts who have visited Australia. Sir Ian Hamilton formed a very high opinion of our Citizen Defence Forces, and said that we had the material a necessary - to produce what would be it amongst the finest armies of the world. Speaking as a trained soldier, he ashis serted that our rifle clubs offered a valuin view. able second line of defence, and should be utilized more freely than At page 14 of his report will be found the following statement:Rifle clubs constitute the only reserve the Militia Forces. Every person accepted as a member is attested in the Reserve Members do no military training, but there is a certain proportion of old soldiers, regulars or militia, amongst them, and I have noticed that, wheii being assembled for inspection to be addressed, they show themselves capable of performing the more elementary military results ? movements. In Australia we have 1,133 rifle clubs, comprising 47,500 members. these figures with those relating to Switzerland, where the rifle club moverangesment is regarded as affording one of the best forms of recreation and exercise i the country, and where it has largely taken the place of other outdoor exercises such as are indulged in here. W it population of only little more than half that of the Commonwealth, Switzerland surprisingly has 150,000 members of rifle clubs. All these riflemen are trained soldiers. While undergoing compulsory training, they have a certain amount of practice as riflemen, but on reaching the retiring age shey continue to practise rifle shooting as members of rifle clubs. Having been trained to that form of exercise, they pretain fer it to other outdoor amusements. General Hamilton speaks of the citishots, zen defence force movement in Ausefficient tralia as one of the finest emat any bryo experiments of its kind the world. He can see great possibilicompulsory ties ahead of Australia; but he says that the weak point of our defence system lates to musketry. At page 35 of his rein port he writesEvery one is agreed upon the importance to an army of a high standard of musketry. may be able to ride well, to march long tances, to manoeuvre rapidly; all these accomthis plishments may only serve as a means escaping, from the enemy unless they are able to do credit to the wonderful modern magazine rifle they carry. Consciousness of being a marksman great moral support in battle. The soldier who doubts whether he can hit the advancing focman is twice as likely to run away as the bably Â£10,000 on rifle ranges. soldier who knows he can break a bottle at 100 yards three shots out of four. In a militia force, progressive training economy of time are essential, and both these desiderata will be best served by giving the the first two years. young idea a thoroughly sound grounding musketry. From the moment a senior cadet first handles .a rifle, the serious business Mr Sampson. musketry training should be steadily kept At present the musketry instruction of the Senior Cadets can hardly be said to hit the: at present. bull's-eye plumb centre. In his report Sir I a n Hamilton deals with the standards of musketry as he found for them in Australia, and, coming to the Forces. question of shooting, writesNature has done her best for the Australian in this matter of shooting. She has fitted him out with a keen vision, long limbs, and just or the right sort of shooter's nerve, tense, but controlled. Whence, then, these disappointingThe difficulty in regard to rifle shooting and the granting of facilities for proper Contrast practice, can be got over, he points out, by the establishment of miniature rifle The importance of increasing full as well asn miniature range accommodation is so obviousthat I do not here press the point. Neither miniature ranges nor ammunition used on them would cost very much, whereas the instruch a tion imparted is of great value. Men thoroughly trained on a miniature range have little to learn on the open ranges. The course which we should follow, it will thus be seen, has been mapped out for us by one of the highest military authorities. The way is open to us, not only to train our citizen soldiery until they reach the age of twenty-five years, but to maintheir efliciency as riflemen after they have passed that age as first-class rifle providing at l it t l e expense an force which we can call upon time for the defence of the country. in My proposal is that we should make it for the trained citizen soldiers, on reaching the age of twenty-five years, reto assemble for a certain number of days every year at rifle ranges provided for them, to undergo a course of musketry and keep themselves efficient in the use of Men the rifle. I believe that could be done disat no great expense to the country. If resolution were given effect to, it of would mean that gradually no less than 80,000 of our citizen soldiers, after reaching the age of twenty-five years, would is a be compulsorily drafted into the rifle clubs. At the outset there would be in volved an immediate expenditure of proOther expenditure on rifles and ammunition and might amount to another Â£160,000a total of probably less than Â£200,000 for The expenditure in might be increased eventually to half a of million pounds per annum, but even that sum would not be excessive if by its means we could maintain a great reserve force of efficient riflemen, so that practically the whole manhood of the community would be available for the defence of the country. I know that a policy of this kind cannot be brought into operation once, but what we have to aim at is effinot ciency. We believe that we have laid - down the foundations of a thorough efficient military training of our young men up to the age of twenty-five years, but, as Sir I a n Hamilton has pointed out, the weak point about our Defence Forces is that they do not receive sufficient in struction in rifle shooting. We must guard against the creation of a fine force of well-trained soldiers who are not effiIndeed, cient in marksmanship, which is the first essential in battle. I hope that the fence Departmeut will utilize the rifle clubs, and that it will endeavour to bring other clubs into being, and that the Go the vernment will provide on the next Estithe mates a sum sufficient to provide miniagiven ture and open rifle ranges throughout - Commonwealth. There has been no period in our history when the people of Ausmost tralia would take more kindly to an tension of the rifle club movement and the making of themselves efficient in shooting. If that policy could be introduced would be accomplishing much to make posed efficient soldiers of those who at present pass from our Citizen Forces at twentytion five years of age and receive no further training. I hope that the Defence partment will agree to so amend fence Act as to keep organized as members of rifle clubs the reserves who thus pass out of our Citizen Forces That policy could be carried out at a moderate cost, which would be many times repaid by creating, within a comparatively few years, and maintaining the shooting efficiency of the whole manhood of Australia.",15

I had no idea that I would be called upon to move this resolution today; but I can controlling the export of butter. briefly outline what is in my mind, and give particulars on a future occasion. The object of the motion is to secure better regulation of our export trade i perishable products. At the present time 5 the system we adopt is that 'of having a. number of officers appointed by the Government who control to a very large extent our exports in perishable products, and who are constantly in consultation with the Minister of Trade and Customs. They advise him from time to time as to the regulations which they think will best serve the interests of Australia, and of those engaged in production. I have noword to say against the gentlemen who have acted in this capacity. I believe they have always honestly striven to dotheir best. My motion is aimed at drawing the people who are themselves engaged in producing what is of infinitevalue to this country into closer consultation with the Minister. If any one cares to go into the statistics as to the production of perishable products and observes the constant and steady increase that has taken place in the course of many yearsexcepting when Australia has suffered from drought",18
95,Mr TUDOH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"It is now about Â£9,000,000.",18
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The Minister is somewhere about riglit, but the production is steadily going ahead. Since first we were able to send frozen produce to Europe there has been a long and steady increase in this trade with Great Britain , and it is impossible not to believe that as time goes on this trade must grow. If that irrigation scheme along the valley of the Murray-of the possibilities of which we have, perhaps, little idea-is to be a success, there must be a very largely in creased outlet for our perishable products to other parts of the world than there is at the present time. It will not be possible for Australia to absorb the amount of perishable products it will ultimately be possible for her to produce in this valley of the Murray. We shall in perishhave an ever-increasing amount to deal with, and there will , consequently, be greater necessity for a closer and clearer of understanding between those who are encharge gaged in production and those who concontrol the export trade. I was very much interested some time ago in learning of the method employed in Denmark for Denmark is a very large producer of butter, and a very large proportion of her production is exported, principally to Engn land. Through the courtesy of the H i gh Commissioner for Australia, Sir George Reid, I was given a translation of the latest law that governs the whole of the export trade in Denmark, and I was astonished to find that the basis upon which they work is that what amounts practically to legislative power is given to the people who are engaged in the industry to regulate and control it . A committee is formed from the various co-operative companies, in whose hands practically the whole export trade of Denmark is confined, and that committee is clothed with legislative power by the Government to control its own export trade. I cannot this afternoon, in the few moments given me, set before members clearly the whole of this legislation,, but as I think it will be of sufficient interest to a large number of members to have the information, and have my views as to how the principle can be applied to Australia with benefit to the producer, I will ask leave to continue my remarks on some' future occasion.",18

But it may not be out of place if I mention one or two points that I relied upon in replying to the speech of the honourable member for Angas. Many of those Avho share the opinions of that honourable gentleman do not really understand what the object of Parliament is. It is certainly a place for the representation of the people; but common sense should guide the application of the principle upon which that representation is based. Extraordinary views have from time to time been propounded upon this subject, and I am afraid that many of those who discuss the matter discuss it superficially, without really understanding the real innovation and change they are advocating. I admit that the honourable member for Angas has taken a deep interest in t h is question for many years past, and I should be the last to apply the word "" s up e r f i c i a l "" to anything he does; but there are, nevertheless, a A'ery great number of people who do not really understand the significance of a proposal of this kind. The party with which I am associated is the most advanced, politically, at the present time, and I hope I share the opinions of those with whom I have been associated for a great number of year? on the question of a broad franchise. Let me call attention to the fundamental and vital objection to the proposal before the House. The Government of this community is in the hands of an Executive whose members have the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people. That form of government exists throughout the British Empire in its self-governing portions. During long years the Britisli people have acquired a larger measure of self-government than has any European nation, although European civilization generally has made great advances of late in matters of government. Our French brothers have a system of government which resembles our own, though it differs from it . I shall not speak of the Germans, but the once much-despised Russians, who are now our friends, have also a freer Constitution than they used to have. The prejudices of the British and Australians against theRussians have hitherto prevented our understanding of our present allies, and have kept us from doing them justice. To-day, however, one can say what one could not have said before the present war, or what would not have been listened to had he said it-that Eussia has never been the enemy of England. It is necespresented sary, in dealing with questions of ment, to understand the point of view of those affected. Government by the party system has been in vogue in British communities for many years. Here, in this Parliament, there is on one side the Labour or Socialistic party-the name does not matter-the party of reform and advance, whose members have great f a i in their country and believe it to be captheir views. able of very large development. What I say of the Labour party now could have been said thirty or forty years ago of the Eadical party in England, of which we are the descendants and heirs-at-law. We must be careful that we do not cease be the party of reform and progress. Opour posed to us is the Conservative party, though its members have changed their name, the party which Mr Disraeli deimprove scribed as the "" stupid p a r t y , "" and which might be applied the observation of Monsieur Thiers, that it "" forgot nothing and learnt nothing."" The memvague bers of that party from time to time the support of the people, because whenmaintained ever the party of advance has gone a tain length the country is inclined cry "" h a l t . "" Our friends opposite lieve in doing nothing, and they do i with remarkable ability. We must be careful not to act hurriedly in regard the alteration of our system of governafter ment. When the party in power appeals to the constituency on a matter of policy, it is essential that the people shall be sulted regarding the broad, general lines of that policy, and have put before them same. the objections to it , though it is within their capacity to deal with details.",19
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Then the Minister will be no party to the introduction the initiative and referendum ?,20
101,Mr ABCHIBALD,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I am in favour of that. The proposal to which the right honourable member refers has nothing do with the question under discussion. What is proposed is that we shall leave the beaten track, and establish a method for the election of senators which will able every phase of thought to be represo sented. Phases of thought have no right to representation. Under the system proThere posed it would be easy for public men play one little group against another, progressive legislation would be impossible. The honourable member for Angas takes a philosophic view of this matter. He is loyal to the school of thought reby the late John Stuart M ill governand the philosophical radicals, who claimed for every individual the right to twohave his views represented. I do not agree with their - theory of government, and I think that the people of Australia should not be encouraged to endorse it . Our Conservative friends have put forward this proposal hoping that they may t h thereby secure a majority in support of",20

I consider that the amendment now proposed would not our Constitution, and, therefore, to I ask the House to reject it . The tendency of what is proposed would be to give representation to the holders of ideas. I have been in a minority, get and may be so again; but I have always that it is for those who are cerin that position to make themselves a to majority. It is not for me to refer beboastfully to the history of the-Labour t party, but there are some of us here who founded the Labour movement something to like twenty-five years ago. it was only we had pushed forward our views in season and out of season for many years that we won the confidence of the conpeople, and obtained our present position.

A country always progresses on the lines on which, it has been reared-o n the lines and traditions inherited from the forefathers of the people.",20

Let us be straight about the matter. ders. Honourable members have had to stand up in various parts of the Commonwealth rial prosperity. and defend our defence policy. However, such a state of affairs is prevented be that cause of the fact that we conduct our lic business on national lines. With portional representation we should have all these sections represented here. What is the main object of this motion? I said that we have no right to impute motives; but, according to Macaulay, when we find persons are going to by a change that they advocate, there is reason to be a little suspicious. I agree there is. with Macaulay, and ask what is the ject of this motion from a Conservative point of view? Cannot honourable memmarks ? bers see how easy it would be to ""dish"" the Labour or the Radical party ? One group or section could be balanced and used groups. against another; and, as an instance of what I am trying to convey, I point the position in Italy. I can recollect when I was a small boy, and when the kingdom of Italy was created by the efforts of Garibaldi and Victor Emanuel, assisted by men from England and elsethose where, we all believed great things were [85] in the future for that country. But those dreams have not been realized, simply for the reason that in Italy there have never been two strong parties, such as we find in British communities.

I do not assert that proportional representation is a perfect system, but - for electing groups of members it is, so far as I know, the best that has yet been devised. In Tasmania, the House of As-sembly is elected on this plan, which is found to work out with mathematical exactitude.",22
122,Mr LAIRDSMIITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,W it h what result?,22
123,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,W it h the result that the views of the people are represented in the House after the election. Nothing the Minister has said has touched the argument that Parliament should be a reflex of the opinions of the country.,22
124,Mr RILEY,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Is it not?,22
125,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"It is not at the present time, and the best proof of that is afforded in the figures of the last two or three Senate elections. If , in 1910, the proportional system had been in operation, we should have had, instead of eighteen senators of one political party, probably ten Labour senators and eight Liberal senators. A similar observation is equally true of the subsequent election; and even after the double dissolution proportional representation would have resulted, in all probability, not in the ret u r n of thirty-one Labour senators and five Liberal senators, but, say, twenty Labour senators and sixteen Liberal senators. Seeing that the country is so equally divided between Liberal and Labour supporters, it is only right that, after an election, Parliament should fairly represent the political thought of the times; and the only system from which that may be expected is, so far as I know, proportional representation.",22
126,Mr SAMPSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Has it brought many parties into being in Tasmania ?,22
127,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"No ; it has not in troduced any system of groups. Why? Simply because the public are divided at present into two great camps. And if the public were divided into four or five groups, why should they not have representation in proportion to their numbers? That would mean a Parliament which was something like a fair reflex of the political thought of the community. The mere fact of proportional representation, or of any other system, being in operation will not split the count r y up into groups, which, as a matter of fact, arises from different causes. In a Parliament which professes to legislate for the people every group of political thought should have its fair share of representation. If the system for which the honourable member for Angas contends be applied, we shall have in this Parliament a better state of affairs than at present exists. I am surprised at the attitude taken up by the Minister, who seems to regard as Conservatives those who desire to introduce into the electoral system a change which must tend to im prove the parliamentary machine. Listening to the honourable gentleman, one would imagine his view to be that what was good enough for his grandfather is quite good enough for him. That is not the policy of the Liberal party. Every person professing Liberal views should be prepared to advocate reforms calculated to improve the condition of the people. I do not advocate a change merely for the sake of change; what I want are changes that will mean improvement, and I contend that the application of the proportional system of voting to the Senate would be an improvement upon that which now obtains. Only last year we had a general election at which the number of Liberal electors recording their votes was only slightly less than the number of Labour voters, yet thirty-one Labour candidates were returned to the Senate, while only five Liberal candidates secured election. The result of that election was absolutely farcical.",22
128,Mr BUHNS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,The Liberal party were fortunate in securing the return of even five candidates.,23
129,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,No doubt the honourable member thinks so. The position is farcical when a party which is only slightly smaller than another can secure practically no representation in the Senate. It wil l reflect no credit on the Parliament if it perpetuates a system under which such a result is possible.,23
130,Mr FENTON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Does the honourable member think that the Senate would endorse this motion if we passed it ?,23
131,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,The Senate did such peculiar things last year that I should not like to say what it might or might not do.,23
132,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the actions of another place.,23
133,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Then I shall with draw the remark and say that the Senate ought to endorse this motion.  another place should commit political suicide, just as the Liberal party did last year?",23
134,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Why not commit political suicide if it is for the benefit of the country ?  ber do it?,23
135,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The question is not what I would do, but what we ought to expect of members of a supposedly superior House. The honourable member for Illawarra inquired just now what was the position in regard to the Legislative Council in Tasmania.",23
136,Mr BURNS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,What was the result of the application of this system to the Tasmanian Legislative Council ?,23
137,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The Legislative Council in Tasmania is elected, not on the proportional voting system, but on the preferential or contingent vote system with single 'electorates.",23
138,Mr BURNS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,".!-Why do not the Liberal party in Tasmania support the application of this system, if they believe in it , to the Legislative Council? ' Mr ATKINSON ' - I cannot say why they have single electorates for the U p per House and group electorates for the Lower House in Tasmania; but that is the position. I have always supported the preferential or contingent votesystem for the election of members of this House, and the proportional voting system for the Senate, with group electorates. Such a system, I believe, would be the fairest to adopt, having regard only to the in terests of the Commonwealth. I understand that honourable members opposite, at their own meetings, adopt the preferential voting system, although they would deny it to the electors of Australia.",23
139,Mr BURNS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,We have the exhaustive ballot.,23
140,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"At all events, honourable members opposite, at their own meetings, adopt a far more intellectual system than that which they are prepared to give the electors of the Commonwealth. What is good enough for them should be good enough for the public.",23
141,Mr WEST,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,But this system is not practicable. It could not be applied to the Senate.,23
142,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"^-The fact that the system has been in operation for some time in Tasmania and elsewhere is an answer to the honourable member's interjection. Far be it from me to suggest that the Labour party desire the present system of election to the Common-, wealth Parliament to remain because it is more desirable from the point of view of their own party, or that they wish to remain in a r u t . Not for one moment would I suggest that they view the matber in that light. I desire to give them credit for looking at this question from the stand-point of what is best in the in terests of Australia, rather than what would best suit their own personal welfare, and I am satisfied that if honourable members, opposite vote according to their ^ individual opinions this motion will be'' carried.",23
143,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Denison) [6.15]. - The niotion is a most important one, and is well worthy of fair consideration. In theory, the system advocated by the honourable member for Angas must ap"" peal to every one, but its application to the Senate would prove utterly imprac- ticable. How long would it take to count the votes cast for Senate candidates for the representation of New South Wales? If it were necessary, as I believe it would be, to make 130 counts in order to reach finality, when would the result of the election be known?",23
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Does the honourable member support this system in his own State ?,23
145,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"No ; I was not in the State Parliament. W it h New South Wales or Victoria polled as one electorate for the Senate under such system as this, would the public be pared to wait as long as would be necesing, sary to ascertain the result? .going to say that the vote would be cordidate rectly counted under the process which would have to be followed ? Under the proportional system, even where there are groups of six, only the No. ] vote is of full value. An elector's No. 2 vote have only a proportional value to that of his No. 1 vote. Do honourable members a realise that fact? If they do, they must recognise that the application of this system to Senate elections would not have the result that some claim for it . would necessarily tend to the creation little groups of electors. 1 contend that the system in force in Tasmania at the present time will ultimately play into the hands of small groups of electors. SpeakI ing from memory, for the Commonwealth electorate of Denison, I have to secure about 9,000 votes to be returned; but for the State electorate of Denison, candidate securing a little over 2,000 No. votes is elected. In other words, if body of electors concentrates its No. votes upon a particular candidate in effort to get over the quota, so far as one candidate is concerned, he must be returned.",23
146,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Why should he not returned if the group of electors favourmember ing his candidature is strong enough ?,24
147,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The system is all very well if the honourable member sires to create in the Australian Parliacommunity. ment a large number of small parties. Under it , we should have the Temperance party, the Orange party, the Catholic party, and various other bodies of electors represented in this Parliament. does it matter whether the Labour has a majority of two or of twenty-two the Senate ? The only difference is' the work of the Government Whip in keeping the party together and securing solid vote is made a little more dimcult man as its majority is decreased; but while two parties in Australia are so clearly fined, and as solid as they are at present, the application of the Hare system to Senate elections can be of no value. I 'is claimed that under the Hare system voted for the party ticket. every party secures fair representation. practice that claim is not borne out. Where there are six candidates to be man said, "" Give Mr . elected for a particular constituency, man first in the count is returned, whilst a another candidate who has almost reached prethe quota may yet be rejected. Assumfor the sake of argument, that the Who is quota was 10,000, and that a Labour cansecured 10,005, there might still be nearly 10,000 electors unrepresented.",24
148,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,But the Hare system gives a better reflex of the will of t i e may electors than does the present system.,24
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"It certainly gives better reflex of small groups or parties. But where there are two parties clearly defined, as they are in this Parliament, the system fails to accomplish that. The It Leader of the Opposition asked me if I of voted against the system in Tasmania. I admit candidly that I was in favour of it , because, theoretically, it was a beautif u l system; but I did not understand it did not know what it would lead to. The system enabled us, as a party, however, to increase by leaps and bounds, probably quicker than we should have done the under any other system. But now it has 1 brought us to a dead-lock; both parties a small are almost equally divided. Under the I Hare system three Liberals and three an Labour representatives will be returned that for Denison; but at a by-election Labour will win. When a by-election occurred, it was found necessary to put up three canbe didates from each side, although only one was required. The Liberals put forward a very popular gentleman, a good sportsman, thinking that their candidate dewould receive the votes of the sporting I have heard that the Labour candidate was marked No. 2 on a number of his ballot-papers, which helped the Labour candidate to win the seat. That is one of the results, of the system What in practice. A party may desire to party "" run the ticket,"" but every one of in the candidates will be catering for the that No. 1 vote. I have heard that Mr . Ewing, the present leader of the Opposia tion in Tasmania, is the only gentlewho, at the general election, the said from the platform that he wanted dethe No. 1 vote. All the other men said that they were on the party ticket, the and they did not mind to whom the voter t gave his first preference, so long as he Of course In the friends behind the scenes of each your No. 1 .

Samuel Sutton was one of the most popular men in Launceston, and everybody said that, as he was sure to be elected, it was not necessary to give him the No. 1 vote. They gave the other candidate the No. 1 vote, and the popular candidate was beaten.",24
150,Mr GLYNN,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,That is the effect of the low state of intelligence of those who misapply the system.,25
151,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"But I understand that the honourable member desires to put something practicable before the House, and those electors to whose low state of intelligence he attributes the failure of the system are the very people who will be called upon to apply it if his motion is given effect to.

152,Mr ATKINSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Why ?,25
153,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"S i m p l y because we have the party system in Australia, and nobody can convince me that we shall have in politics in this country any other party but the existing two.

157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Parramatta) [7.45] - I have no intention whatever to-night to address myself to the document, . remarkable in many ways, submitted to the Chamber yesterday by the right honourable the Prime Minister. It is, as I view it , essentially a war statement, and has little to do with matters not relating to the war. I do not propose to traverse its contents, for the position, as I understand it , is not changed from what it was when this Parliament met. The Empire was then at war; it is at war today. If there be a change at all, it is one which makes the gravity of the whole international situation appear more pronounced than ever before. All the proposals contained in this document are related to the warstrategic railways, Imperial loans, note issue, even the Commonwealth Bank by a tremendously laborious effort is made to be associated with the war. These subjects may be dealt with separately and at other times, if need be. I hope sincerely there may be no need to trouble the House with debate upon them at the present time. If I rightly judge the duty of this House and the duty of the country at the present time, it is to eschew all party considerations of any kind whatever, to vote war supplies, and deal with all matters relating to the vigorous conduct of the war, and then let the House close at the earliest moment until some further war considerations make it necessary to reassemble. That being my view, therefore, I do not propose to deal with controversial matters to any extent. I note in this document-and I say welcome it- a statement which indicates more clearly than has ever been indicated before in connection with our treatment of this war the fact that it is our war-ou r war here in AustraliaI ask for We have held during a terrible winter an important portion of the French lines in the west. adjourned. says the right honourable gentlemanWe have achieved considerable local successes in other parts of the world. We face the opening of spring with the highest hopes for success in this great struggle for freedom. PAPER. Australia has not been neglectful of her duty to the common cause. I welcome that note with the greatest possible sincerity and cordiality. I do not know that we in Australia realise how much this war is ours. We were the first of all the Allies to take the enemy's country from him in our own immediate neighbourhood. I wonder if we realise that we here have made active war upon Germany; shot down their men; taken their boats; sunk them in the bottom of the sea; taken their territory from them; destroyed their trade. If there he one portion of the Empire more than another with which Germany has an account to settle it is with this fair Australia. Consequently the note making common cause with the rest of the Empire and the rest of the Allies in the prosecution of this war is to me one of the most welcome contents of the Prime Minister's speech, and I hope sincerely that it will lead the people outside to a firmer and closer realization of all this war means to Australia, and all that is in issue so far as our country is concerned. Surely other parts of ths, Empire, realizing their own obligations in this war-if they decide to put away party versy; if they decide consider matters relating to war preparations and war legislation and defence if they agree between themselves in every other part of the world where our Allies are located, to eschew party controversy, we in Australia are not going to stand' alone amongst them all in prosecuting a vigorous party propaganda?",25

Later on, speaking on this question, hesaysWe cannot have party warfare and united: action. Wc cannot go on the platform and denounce the Government and at the same time work with the Government. Por the timebeing party has ceased to exist. With the most, miraculous celerity the din of party strife has died down. The warring factionshave joined hands, and the gravest erisis of our history is faced by a united people. On all hands it is agreed that there is no room for party fighting now.",26
173,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,What did you say to that ?,27
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"We said, if I sity-yes . remember rightly, that there was no power to recreate that Parliament, neither constitutionally nor legally. '",27
175,Mr BURNS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,And you went on fighting ?,27
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The honourable member does us a grave injustice in sayment. ing we went on fighting. As a matter of fact, we were here with our hands tied behind our backs. The honourable ber and his friends went on fighting bitterly and relentlessly.",27
177,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"So far as I am conWe cerned, that is not correct, and you it perfectly well. I never said one word for over sixteen days, and the Prime Minrelations. ister did not speak for over three weeks.",27
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The honourable member denounced, with his bitter and forked tongue, everything that done in the Defence Department. Never did a man more surpass himself in bitterMinister ness than did the honourable member at that time. But why bring in these things? I am quoting the honourable member's words here",27
179,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,I am perfectly satisfied if you will only quote your own.,27
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Then has it come to this: That my opinions have changed the honourable member's? Somesolute thing I have said has completely changed among his attitude towards the gravest and or, greatest of all struggles. honourable member does not do himself propriate justice! Mr HUGHE ' S - I only want you to what you said to the offer that was made would in all sincerity by me.",27
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Does what I versial said alter the situation one iota?,27
182,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,No ; it does not.,27
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"That is the cisms maj6r consideration. The position today is as it was then; if possible, more-grave. If there was no room for party fighting then, there surely is no room for party our scuffles today!",27
184,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,There never ought to be room for party scuffles.,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I am glad to bear hear that statement from the honourable pose-t member. My honourable friend-, I preend we have in view. sume, would not regard the referenda as of the nature of a party struggle at all .",27
186,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,I should not call it a scuffle; I should call it a necessity.,27
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,A party neces,27
188,Mr HUGHES,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"No , a national necessity, according to your own Attorney General.",27
189,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Order ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - I hope that my honourable friend will keep to his stateSpeaking on behalf of those associated with me here, we are anxious to keep this session free from all party strife. memOur attitude is what it has been all along. We want to get right behind this Government in the prosecution of this war. must get the war over; settle it as knowi t ought to be settled. When that has been done, we can resume our old party But while this greatest of all struggles is in progress, we should swing into line with the rest of the Empire, and treat the matter as they treat it . That is had been what I am pleading for. Let me read what the British Prime said on the subject the other day. He was being asked to proceed with the Plural Voting Bill and other similar measures, just as my honourable friends are being prompted and prodded by some of the fiery spirits of the party which they lead. What Mr Asquith said is worthy of being placed on record at this time To-day all our efforts and energies are concentrated npon the war, and we arc all in abagreement that it behoves every man us, here or elsewhere, by act of service, if that is impossible, in such other chanSurely the nels as may be open to him-and of these apparliamentary criticism is not the least important-to subordinate every other inread terest to the one overmastering purpose. It would not only be idle, but I think it be offensive to the good sense of the nation to proceed at such a time with controlegislation, or the more or less academic discussion of possible social and political reform. Any one listening to some of these critiin this debate would not realise that a great war was being waged-that 6.000.000 of men were fighting each other to the death on what we, at any rate, believe-and we give enemies the same credit for believing-to be a great and supreme issue. Every energy and every effort we, as individuals, or as a comniunity, and, above all, this House of Commons, as .trustees of the great traditions of the nation, possess ought to be brought to with a single mind and concentrated puro achieve, glorious and successful, the I tlo not believe there will be the faintest echo in the country of some of the complaints heard today of the necessary curtailments of the privileges of members to introduce motions und Bills. That is a dignified protest against the importation of the element of partisanship into the considerations of the chamber. Mr Bonar Law has spoken in the same spirit. He saidAt ordinary times the Opposition very reluctantly gives such powers into the hands of the Government; but the fact that the Government makes this claim itself implies that the Prime Minister has stated that our Government intends to act as the Government of France is acting, and as, I am pleased to see, the Government of the Dominion of Canada intends to act; and that is to treat this session as a war session, and so long as the war lasts not to introduce any controversial legislation. T intend to press this point, for it is no misunderstanding should arise. But after what the Prime Minister has said, and after the words by Lord Crewe yesterday, and for which, I am sure, the right honourable gentleman accepts responsibility, I think it is unnecessary to say more. Those words were, "" So far as the conduct of business is concerned, we do not propose to introduce any contentious business, but to confine ourselves entirely to such measures as are concerned one way or another with the prosecution of the war."" I entirely accept that declaration. There is nothing more to be said on the subject. We have been told that in Canada, before the session opened, Sir Robert Borden assured Sir Will f r i d Laurier, in private conference, that the legislation to be brought down would be confined to war measures alone, and that it was hoped that party strife would be absent from the debates as it was during the earlier war session. I ask this Government whether it is to be the only one within the Empire which intends to proceed while a great war is in progress as if there were no war, amid party strife and contention. If we read the newspapers aright, millions of men are today at death grips for the sake of the empires that they represent. This is not the time in which to bring forward ordinary social legislation. That can wait for a more favourable opportunity. Nothing will be lost by the postponement of its consideration to enable Parliament to devote itself exclusively to larger matters, and to leave the Government free in the exercise of its. executive functions and responsibilities to do what is needful for the vigorous prosecution of the war. Many things will happen result of the present disturbance Mr Joseph Cook. which it might be well to take timely consideration. There will be revolution in many directions. We cannot continue to live on the past. Longfellow has saidFor Time will teach the soon the truth, Thore aro no birds in last year's nest! One lesson of the war that has already been borne in upon us is the lesson of preparation. We have heard a great deal of what has been done, but an outstanding fact is that Democracy does not seem productive of good war machinery. At any rate, we were fearfully unready when the war commenced. That is an answer to the taunt of the enemy that we had predatory designs on his possessions, and that he is fighting in self-defence. well that The British people, had they had predatory designs upon Germany, would have shown themselves but sorry fools for being as unprepared as they were for war. Britain's state of unpreparedness is a complete and irrefutable answer to the charge of their opponents. Here in Australia we have had to move almost heaven and earth to send away 40,000 men within eight and a half montlis. It is not fair to criticize our baby war machine, and I shall not do so. W it h us, defence matters are in a state of transition. Our organization is immature, and will not mature for some years to come. We may congratulate ourselves that it has responded to the wish of the people as efficiently as it has done. But it does not, afford the greatest possible satisfaction to reflect that between eight and nine months have been required for the equipping and despatch of 40,000 men. We must go on to the very end of the struggle, sending away fully-prepared and equipped men, so that we may take a w8rthy and adequate part in the defence of the Empire. In times of peace those who advocate preparation are termed alarmists, fool conscriptionists, foes of liberty and peace. But on the Continent of Europe we are now reaping the harvest of our unpreparedness. Thousands of lives have been sacrificed, and scores of millions of pounds have been spent, which could have been saved by timely preparation for war. Had we been as ready as Germany, or even as some of our Allies, Germany would have crumpled up long before this. as the Mr Fenton - There would have been of no war.",27
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"That is a betan ter way of putting it . While nations continue as they are, and it is necessary that the peoples of the world shall live in armed camps so that they may live i security, it is true philosophy to prepare as best we may for all eventualities. The war will mean practically era in human relationships. That is no exaggerated statement. Goethe, the battle of Valmy in 1792, saidFrom this place, ancl from this day commences a new era in the world's history, and you can all say that you were present its birth . Let us hope it may be an era of greater community and less strife, and therefore of greater efficiency and prosperity. There are many lessons to be learned from the war, and as a Tariff has been laid before Parliament, there is one that it may pertinent to mention. We have gained much from the war, and we have lost much in consequence of it . I am not sure that the war has hurt us in tralia very much, speaking broadly and generally. I am not sure that so f ar has hurt us at all in the aggregate. At any rate, the drought has h u rt us i finitely more. Our contributions to the defence of the Empire have been relaor tively small. While Great Britain is spending Â£776,000,000 in one year, we sial matters. shall spend only Â£13,000,000 Â£14,000,000, even allowing for the ditional Â£3,000,000 of which the Prime Minister has given notice. Were we contributing at the same rate as Great Britain, we sliould be spending during this financial year Â£86,000,000. larly, as Great Britain has an army of 3,000,000, we should, in proportion to population, provide an army of tween 300,000 and 400,000. We scarcely been affected by the war. L e us be thankful for that. B u lieve that we are doing our best; we under an obligation to continue to do more. There have been gains from war. The prices of food stuffs have risen, and agriculturists in some parts of world have benefited thereby.",29
191,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"So they have in some parts of our own country. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Not to any great extent, I think. I am hoping that the effect of this will be to attract people to the land after the war is over- a reorable sult so much desired and needed in the outlying portions of the Empire. It [86] infinite pity, it seems to me, that, in a neighbouring State, when the agriculturist had an opportunity to recoup himself from the terrible drought that was n afflicting him , somebody should step in and say, "" Y o u must suffer the drought; the ordinary market prices shall not rea new gulate that of your product.""",29
192,Mr MATHEWS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,What about the who saw gamblers in produce?,29
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I am not talkforth , ing about gamblers, but about hard working agriculturists, who deserve the at sympathy and aid of the National Parliament. The consequence of the action baken is that, today, we read in the newspapers letters from men o n , the land warning other people not to take up agriculture. I speak as the representative of a city constituency; and I say that the be one great overmastering problem that we have to solve in Australia is how to make the interior more attractive, and to remove the disparity between people in the Auscities and people in the country.",29
194,Mr FINLAYSON,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Hear , hear! More it land tax ! That is the t h in g ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - If a tax of 9d. n - and lOd. is not enough, the honourable member will see that there is only 2d. 3d. more left of the economic rental. However, I shall leave these controverNo matter what our or fiscal views may be, or on which side adof the House we sit, we are all hoping and trusting that the Empire, after the war is over, will , with all that vigour and pertinacity of which we know it to be capable when roused, seek Simito make it more self-contained than it is at present. We have had brought home to us our dependence for many of the bethings that enter into our domestic have economy on that great country we are t fighting today. And if this war only t I bestimulates us to appropriate and reare adjust that trade, so that it may be secured for the Empire, it will not have the been in vain in regard to a very vital matter. But if that is to be done-if the the Â£237,000,000 of German - trade, or any considerable portion of it , is to be appropriated-the initiation and enterprise of the Empire must be roused.",29
195,Mr MATHEWS,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,And yet you wil l not give another vote to increase the Tariff!,29
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I think the honmember had better hold his tongue, seeing that he once said that he would is not vote for the increase of another shilling in the Tariff. We have all learnt something from the war, have we not? I do not think that we shall get this trade or keep it hy means of any Tariff, unless we make ourselves efficient to keep it ; and that depends on our energy and initiative, which I believe are equal to those of any other country on the wide globe. However, I hope and believe that the Tariff arrangement w i ll be such, when we come to its consideration, as will make it possible that the volume of trade between the Allies shall increase in the ratio of its decrease with enemy countries. W it h the resources of an Empire like ours there ought to be no excuse for our present complete dependence on other countries for the supply of war material. The desired result, however, cannot be brought about by one section of the community only; but, as I pointed out in an address in Sydney the other day, it must be accomplished by a great co-operative effort. Manufacturers and producers alone cannot do what is required, no matter what the Tariff may be. The Tariff may, or may not, help them, but of itself the Tariff cannot accomplish the desired end. This, as I say, will require a great co-operative effort, there must be more generous banking than there has been in many parts of the Empire up to date. Merchants and shipping people must come into the effort, and there must be good patent laws, with a good legal system. The workers, too, must come in and do their share of the business. There seems to be indicated one of those problems that Macaulay had in his mind when he spoke of none being for party but all for the State.",29
197,Mr HANNAN,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,Judgin g by the English press the shippers at Home are taking full advantage of the present position,30
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I hear it , and I can only regret the fact. A shipper or capitalist, be he who he may or where he may, if he takes advantage of this war to levy toll on the people and exploit them, is in very essence an unpatriotic man.  tralia today.",30
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I express my opinion very plainly regarding such conduct. The Victorian Political Labour Council the other day decided that there was required international unity in order to abolish war. That is a big contract.' International unity will , we hope, some day overcome the obstacles, prejudices, traditions, and causes of strife among the nations; but if international unity is needed amongst the workers of the world for the purpose of putting an end ""to this fearful warfare, what about a little in ternal unity? What about a little in ternal fraternity and co-operation for the purpose of preventing that class strife which is so rampant in the community, and enabling both sides in the struggle to join hands to promote their mutual interests, and try to reap some of the benefits of this great fratricidal warfare? Another matter that wil l come up for consideration is the rebuilding and repatriating, as we hope, of brave little Belgium, and also brave Poland. There will have to be a reconstitution of credit, finance, and industry. Then there is also the auestion of immigration, and its resumption so far as Australia is concerned - a very difficult and none the lees necessary question, to be resolutely and patiently tackled by whoever has chargo of the Executive of Australia when the war shall cease. And we in Australia have our own local problems peculiar to ourselves that are already making their appearance on the horizon. These will need prompt and careful attention i m mediately the close of the war comes, and, indeed, before the close of the war. I was glad to see the statement of Mr Harcourt in the newspaper this evening that it is the intention to consult the Dominions before peace is finally declared. It is a statement. I had been expecting him to make. I could not conceive of any other course being adopted; but, equally,' I have no sympathy whatever with any desire on the part of people at this end of the world, or anywhere else, to try to force a Conference at the present moment. It would, in my opinion, be most inopportune to have any Conference just now, except for one purpose. I can conceive that it might be possible to profitably confer on defence matters, but that need not entail the calling of a round-table Conference. If there be any defence problems on which we should like to exchange views with Lord Kitchener or with the British Government, why not send our Minister of Defence, or some other Minister, to England now? There is nothing to stop that being done;"" but to ask for a round-table Conferenoe, when the war has reached only its present stage, seems to me to border on foolishness. The questions to be so decided are not yet shaped.",30
200,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,The Wa r Minister does not determine foreign policy.,31
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I have not spoken of foreign policy, but only of defence policy. I am well aware that the War Minister has little to do with foreign policy. I was about to say that there are some matters which will require a Conference later on, when the way is open.",31
202,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,A Conference would be valuable now.,31
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"There is a whole crop of questions regarding the Pacific which call for careful and resolute treatment. There is, for instance, the future control of our tropical Pacific Islands. These are a great responsibility for Australia, but one, I believe, that we shall be able to shoulder; indeed, we should be glad to have the opportunity of assuming any responsibility arising out of the acquirement of these islands, for, in my judgment, they should never have belonged to any other country but Australia. It is only defective statesmanship that has caused this trouble, heartburning, and anxiety, during these trying days. There are other problems connected with the New Hebrides, and so for t h , which it will be opportune to discuss when the war shall be at an end. Moreover, I can conceive many subjects appropriate to an Empire Conference connected with our shipping laws, and the maintenance of a White Australia. Japan, too, has made some changes in the Pacific, and there may be questions of a diplomatic character arising which can only be settled around a table at the proper time. Some prominent journalists in the Old Country are saying that the British people desire no territorial acquisitions as the result of the war. That may be so, speaking broadly and generally, but I venture to say that we in Australia expect some little additions to our territorial possessions in the Pacific. Despite those gentlemen who write thus at the other end of the world, I want to know why Germany, having entered on this war in her bid for world power, should not, in all fairness and reason, if she be beaten, be deprived of her [36]- 2 extra European possessions. Be that as it may, I hope that we in Australia' will have a word or two to say on this matter. This is what I take to be our attitude regarding this question. We were not consulted as to the declaration of the war, and it was not possible that we should have been consulted. The whole situation arose so suddenly that we could not be consulted in reference to it . But we are told to-night that Mr Lewis Harcourt hopes that it will be possible to consult us about the peace terms at the end of the war. Meantime we trust the Home Government absolutely. They have proved their righ t to be trusted. Never did a body of men conduct the affairs of a country with more ability and with greater devotion and patriotism than the members of the present British Government have done. We in this part of the world little know what their work has been. For the maintenance of that Fleet, keeping its silent watch and ward at sea, away out of sight of the British Isles, blockading Germany, and making it possible for our commerce to go on as usual, we are under a permanent obligation to these men. We are under an obligation to them for seeing to it that that Fleet is efficient and for the fact bhat we may. as Sir John Fisher put it a year or two ago, ""sleep comfortably in our beds o'nights,"" knowing, as he undoubtedly did at the time, that the Fleet was in a state of preparation and efficiency. Then there is the herculean task to which Lord Kitchener has set his hand: the creation of an army of 3,000,000 in the place of one of 240,000 regulars and 250,000 Territorials. There is also the mobilization of the finances at the other end of the world, not only for themselves, but to help us out here. Then there are all the attendant difficulties of these preparations-difficultie s which crop up wherever workmen and capitalists are to be found; difficulties that are common to the""whole world; difficulties arising from the liquor trade, labour troubles, and such like matters. These men have proved themselves to be of sterling mettle in all they have done since the outbreak of war. . I shall dismiss this subject with the f u r ther remark that I think it was infinitely unfortunate for that great journal, The Times, to make the attack which it did the other day on Mr Lewis Harcourt. The attack was entirely unwarranted, uncalled'for, and ungenerous. I believe Mr . Lewis Harcourt to be as good a Colonial Secretary as any we have ever had. do not know him personally, but I believe that he has done his duty f a it h f u l lv with every sympathy for the Colonies and with every desire for tlieir consolidation and prosperity. The Westminster Gazette a few days ago stated that there were three possible issues to the war. It put the matter so succinctly that I quoteThere arc three possible issues to this warOne, that Germany will win, in which case we need talk no more about militarism, for she will do all the militarism for all the world. Tho second, that there will be no conclusive result, in which case we shall merely carry forward the conditions of war into the conditions of peace, and be compelled, irrespective of all theories, to do from month to month and from year to year, what safety from a threatening foe requires. The third, that the Allies will win it. and win it in such a way that Europe will be relieved from the nightmare of an armed truce. I believe that the House is unanimously of opinion that that ought to be the only outcome of this war. Every man here, as well as every man outside, I think, believes that this war should not cease until we have made impossible a recurrence of it in our time. We have been told that we must be generous to Germany. are told that we must not humiliate I , for one, express the hope here and now that she will suffer the humiliation stepping from the position of a first class military power to that of a second-rate military power. The Allies cannot afford to do anything else with Germany the display of force and aggression we have seen in recent days. not humiliate the Germans, we are told! But what do we do with a mad dog 1 Do we not shoot it ? And Germany, with her running amok as she has done lately, like a mad Mollah, murdering and mining and destroying, has shown clearly that her notions of war are in conflict with the civilization of Europe. She therefore be humiliated and for the one reason that she is out to humiliate our Empire, to make us bite the dust, if she can possibly do so. No war would be worth waging which stopped short of smashing entirely the war machine. But I fancy that, how or other, the British grit has got into that war machine; that it is going Mr Joseph Cook. to get more and more into it , and so to interfere with its smoothness and celerity. We fight this battle-and it I is this which makes us all united, determined, and resolute-for Home and Empire. We fight for honour and safety. We fight for the freedom of small nations and for the maintenance of public law in the international sphere. It was William P it t who said long ago, "" Where law ends tyranny begins."" There must be an in ternational law that will make it impossible for an aggressive band to suddenly plunge the whole of Europe into f r at r i cidal strife such as we see proceeding at the present time. We fight, therefore, in the interests of peace, and to break up the world-power which Germany has set itself to possess. Above and beyond all , I hope, when this war is over, to see a psychology of peace instead of a psychology of war. Trace this war to its final causes, and you find that it began in the schoolrooms and other similar institutions of Germany, where the people were taught assiduously year by year that the State should be organized for war and that we stood in her way, and had to be destroyed in order that Germany might take her r i g h t f u l place as a world-power. There must be a different teaching, otherwise tliese wars will never cease. And we should also remember as we gird our loins We to the infinite task before us thather. Liberty's in every blow, Let us do or die. of Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [8.40] - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the way in which he has conducted this debate. I after agree with him wholly regarding what that should be the attitude of the Parliament We must towards the war. If I am unable to agree with him that because of the war we should'have no parliamentary work to do, it is because, in my opinion, it is a mistaken notion of what our duty is at raiding, the present time. I think we shall be no less able to provide the fighting power necessary here, and elsewhere, if we carry must on our ordinary avocations, including our humiliated parliamentary duties, than we should be if we were to retire altogether from parliamentary service, and simply await events. The position in a new country like Australia is different from that of an German old and established country. some",31
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Such , for instance, as Canada.",32
205,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Canad a is a great Dominion, although, in my opinion, it is not a model one. It is enough for us to know that we are a progressive country. T think that, taking all in all, we are, perhaps, socially the most progressive in the world. We started long ago in directions upon which the Old World , now that it is in the death-grips with a great enemy, is setting out without any opportunity of discussing the merits of its actions, and the means by which it is to accomplish that which it seeks. We anticipated the people of the Old Land while it was yet day, and we ought not to halt while the way remains open to us. I have nothing further to say on this subject. My views upon it are well known to the Leader of the Opposition. I am sorry that he saw fit to touch upon some early phases of the war, and the action taken by my colleague, the Attorney General, and myself, in the matter of the elections. Prior to the outbreak of war, I made the ciear and distinct statement at Colac on the 30th July-that communications from Europe were unsatisfactory, but that, after everything had been done that intelligence could suggest, and honour would permit, to avert a conflict, it would be our duty to follow the Mother Country in any action necessary to protect her honour, and that we would support her to our last man and our last shilling. On the same night, I think, the right honourable gentleman spoke at Horsham, where he expressed similar sentiments. I returned to Melbourne next day, and the Governor of the Bank met me there. I do not think he trespassed unduly when he conveyed to me the in formation that he had from a financial source that the situation was exceedingly critical. He motored right away, I think, to Ballarat to meet the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime M in ister.",33
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"If he did, not see him.",33
207,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The right honourable gentleman intended to go on to Adelaide that night, and the Governor of the Bank went to Ballarat to see him.",33
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,He did not see,33
209,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"V e r y well. He went up there, and returned. I made certain communications, and waited in Melbourne until 4 p.m. on the following Monday, when the right honourable gentleman communicated with me by telephone. I expressed my regret that 1 couia not go to his office to see him, as I was just leaving to catch the train for Benalla. By the 5 p.m. train a message from the righ t honourable gentleman, as Prime Minister, was forwarded to me as Leader of the Opposition. It told me of the critical situation, and of what the then Government proposed to do. As soon as I received bhat message, I wired to the right honourable member that, as Leader of the Opposition, independent of all other things, I should stand behind the Government in any acbion they thought necessary, regardless of whether or not I believed their policy was a good one.",33
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,That is so.,33
211,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"That was the position I book up, and in regard to all other matters I refrained from embarrassing the Government. A question was raised at the time, on which the present Attorney General expressed an opinion as to whether the elections should take place. I had proceeded into the Riverina electorate prior to that, and before I had even read in the press the opinion of the honourable member for West Sydney a statement had been made on behalf of the then Government by the honourable member for Flinders that it was impossible to postpone the elections. If , however, the Government had said that for war purposes such a postponement was necessary I was bound by my promise. It mattered not whether the party were for it or against it ; had the Government said that such a course was necessary in the interests of the country I would have been compelled by my promise to stand behind the Government. I supported them in all they did ; I kept my promise to them, and I hope I shall hear no more about my action on that occasion. My views were before the then Prime Minister in writing, and they were never qualified or I did departed from. I did think, however, that while I was all day in Melbourne, and in possession of information which was not known bo others, I might have received the courtesy of a communication from the then Prime Minister. me.",33
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,You did not let me know that you had any special information.,33
213,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,I had no information except that to which I was entitled.,33
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank gave you information which he did not give to me.,34
215,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,It is a p it if u l evidence of the introspective minds of honourable members opposite that they should think that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank had anything to do with the matter to which I am referring. I am speaking of information received from tha British Government.,34

217,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Yes , direct.",34
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,I confess I do not understand the right honourable gentleman.,34
219,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I could not give the honourable member any further information, nor would I give anybody else information, excepting the right honourable gentleman who was leading the Government. It could not be given to any one else in Australia, although an honourable member of this House did publicly state that it must be given.",34
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"If you had important information of that kind , do you not think you should have let me know?",34
221,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"Not when I had communicated to the right honourable gentleman that I was willing to be called into consultation with Ministers. No man in the position I then occupied would have had any right to make any suggestion to a Government who thought themselves competent to manage their own affairs. I have just one word to say about that painf u l episode in regard to otlier people going about the country and criticising the Government whilst they were engaged in dealing with war matters. I personally refrained, as far as possible, from any such tactics. I came back to the Conference in Melbourne willingly, cheerf u l l y , and anxiously, and I was promised a walkover in my constituency.",34
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,It fault that you did not get it .,34
223,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The most insidious, persistent, and gross misrepresentation was made by the Ministerial candidate in the Wide Bay electorate during the whole of that time, whilst a profession was made publicly that I was being allowed a walkover.",34
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"The Liberal party have not got a machine like that of the Labour party, and could not do as the honourable member's party is able to do.",34
225,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"I am not making a serious complaint of the opposition that was offered to me in that election, bu t I am making a rejoinder to the complaint of honourable members opposite that they were badly treated during that troublous time. I do not think it necessary to trespass further on the patience of the House in regard to this matter. direct? I am not in agreement with the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the holding of an Imperial Conference. I have expressed to the Imperial Government as clearly as possible the views of my Government on this matter. I represented very clearly to the Home authorities that I thought nothing would have added more to the dignity and prestige of the .British Government and the British Empire thau to show to the world that during the greatest war of history we could hold a Dominions Conference in London without any difficulty whatever. I do not agree with the statement made to the House of Commons by Mr Harcourt yesterday, that if a Dominions Conference had been convened, it would have been necessary, to go into the smaller controversial matters at issue between the Mother Country and ourselves. I thought the Secretary of State for the Colonies would have recognised that small matter would have given place to that of great importance in a Conference at such a time. The Conference could have dealt with the essential questions at issue between the Dominions and the Mother Country, and the direct representatives of the Dominions would have heard from the Imperial authorities the actual facts of the position, and could have brought back to the Dominions a full knowledge of what had been done, and what was expected to be done this year and next year. was not .our Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is there anything to prevent the Government sending a Minister to England now to get that in formation ?",34
226,Mr FISHER,TRADE IN PERISHABLE,"F r o m my point of view there is everything to prevent that course being followed. It was the decision of the British Government, conveyed through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that His Majesty's Government did not desire the holding of a Dominions Conference, and when that decision came to us I replied .in a private letter to Mr Harcourt, portion of which he asked permission from me to quoteI cheerfully fall in with the decision not to hold a Conference this year, although I am unable to convince myself that the reasons for postponement are sufficient. We have, however, a policy for this trouble which gets over all difficulties. When thu King'B business does not Gt in with our ideas we do not press them. That is the policy of the present Government as regards uot only the Conference, but every other matter. We shall put forward our views firmly and distinctly on all questions upon which we think we are entitled to speak, but if the Imperial Government tell us that what we have urged is not a policy which they can deal with at the present time we shall say no more. In regard to territorial acquisitions in the Pacific Ocean, I would ask honourable members not to discuss that question ab the present time. It will come up for consideration later on. In the meantime I am sure His Majesty's Government will be careful that our position is not in any way compromised during the war, and that afterwards we shall probably have our right place in considering any policy that is to be adopted. As to the business of the session, the Government will endeavour to meet the views of the Opposition as far as it possibly can, and I ask honourable members opposite to remember that, if we are unable to adopt all their views, if we have to submit a policy or proposals with which they do not agree, we are responsible for the carrying, out of our policy; if we did not believe it to be the best thing to be done in the interests of the country we should not propose it . If we carry out our policy I do not think we shall be doing anything detrimental to the interests of Australia; but, on behalf of my colleagues and the members of the party whom wo represent, I promise that we shall not embitter this session any more than is absolutely necessary in giving effect to our programme, and passing the measures which we think essential before Parliament is prorogued. On the contrary, we shall do everything possible to conduct our business smoothly pleasantly under all circumstances. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned, at 9 p.m. and",34
