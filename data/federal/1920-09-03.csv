If so, will he inform the House of the circumstances connected therewith. It has",20
11,Mr HUGHES,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable memis ber was good enough to give me notice of I his intention to ask this question, and I desire to furnish the following reply:1. Yes. 1I have received some cable communications from the manager of the lines in ' reference to it. 2. It appears that the Conference Lines some time ago decided to grant deferred reof freight on shipments by vessels of their lines, provided the shippers did not ship by vessels not controlled by the Conference. The shipping agents employed by the Victorian Agency-General forwarded certain shipments account of the Victorian Government by Conference steamers during the half-year ended 30th June, 1919, and when in due course the rebates on those shipments,, in common with shipments made by them for other principals, it was necessary for them to slightly amend the customary certificate required by the Conference, as they were unable declare that they had not effected shipment by lines outside the Conference, owing to the fact that they had also shipped by vessels of the Commonwealth Government Line. The Conference Lines intimated that they could not accept declarations which contained any amendment of the printed form. The Conference Lines eventually paid the rebates on the other but excluded the Victorian Govern-. ment items. The Victorian Agent-General addressed a circular-letter on 211th April, 1920, to the Conference Lines concerned, of inquiring whether it was their considered policy to penalize the Government of Victoria solely on account of its action in supporting the Commonwealth Government Line. The reply received was from Messrs. Birt, Potter, and Hughes, wbo stated that they could not recognise any claim by the Victorian Government for rebates, as the condiunder which such rebates were granted not been complied with. In order that the Victorian Government shall nut be penalized through its action in shipping by the Australian vessels, the Commonwealth GovernLine has agreed to refund the amount by the rebates which the Conference Lines bave declined to pay.

12,Mr LIVINGSTON,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH,"Will the Minisgest ter for Trade and Customs invite the Cabinet to consider the advisableness of regard to the question encouraging the cultivation of beet sugar in Australia by giving a bonus duction ? It has been abundantly proved that sugar beet can be grown without i r r gation in the southern parts of Australia, and I am satisfied that by offering a I bonus the Government would encourage the cultivation of sugar beet on a large scale, and thus make Australia indepening dent of outside supplies of sugar.

""WOOL SCOURING. - Mr HUGHES - On the 25th' the August the honourable member for August:Parkes (Mr Marr) asked me a question in regard to making wool available for scouring. I then' furnished him with ceived certain information, and promised to response make inquiries with a view to seeing what could be done in the direction desent, sired by him. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that the dock, Central Wool Committee received a 42,000 cablegram from the. British Government space some months ago in the following terms:Scoured wool generally is selling in proportion to greasy even worse than when we last telegraphed you on this subject, not only because prices are so much lower in proportion, but because frequent withdrawals occur for want of buying demands for scoured qualities. We impress on your attention that under conditions of peace the continuance of scouring in Australia on anything similar to its present scale is very bad business, and it would be much more economical to stop your operations, paying up the necessary compensation. In response to a recent cablegram, to the British authorities, the Central Wool Committee have just received the following reply:With reference to your telegram No. 1318, regret to say supplies of scoured wool in stock are already disproportionately large and are least saleable portion of our stock. We most decidedly discourage further scouring of old clip wool for the scoured product will be of lower schedule value than the greasy wool. I do not agree with that view. The policy of this Government, and I hope of the Parliament, is to do everything' possible to encourage local industry. I am calling a conference of representatives of all sections, of the.industry at a very early date, in order that we may consider what should be done. LONDON DOCKS. .with.. .REPORTED CONGESTION OF. FOODSTUFFS:",22
26,Mr HUGHES,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH,"On Wednesday last the honourable member for Hindmarsh1 question' which he had placed on the notice-paper on the 22nd July, in regard to the reported congestion at the London form docks of foodstuffs exported from Australia. I was under the impression that I had already furnished the honourable member with the following reply, which' I had prepared on receipt of a cable from High Commissioners' Office, on 4th I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that a cable has just been refrom the High Commissioners' Office, into my inquiry, from which it appears that the reported congestion relates only to meat. The cable states that there is at predifficulty in finding space for frozen meat cargoes; that the Naldera has gone into dry with a. portion of mutton cargo;, that the. Port Albany, which carried, approximately,. quarters of beef, is unloading, but. that has only been found, so. for. for 12,000quarters; that the British Ministry of Food, states that thei'e is nothing alarming in the meat storage position, and has promised to furnish a statement regarding the matter. The cable adds that there is plenty of room at the dock-sheds for canned and other goods."" The High. Commissioners' Ofiice subsequently cabled that the Ministry of Food had reported that all necessary arrangements for the speedy discharge of meat were being made, and that space had been provided for 19,000 quarters of the Port Albany beef. TAXATION COMMISSION.",22
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH," I wish to announce to the House that the Government have appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of taxation. It is tended that the Commission shall inquire into and report upon the in cidence of Commonwealth taxation and any amendments which are necessary or desirable with a view to placing the system of taxation upon a sound and equitable basis, having regard generally to the public interests, and particularly to-(1 ) The equitable distribution of the burden of tax at i o n (2 ) the harmonization of Commonwealth and State taxat i o n ; (3) the giving to primary producers of special consideration as regards the assessment of income tax, particularly in relation to losses resulting from adverse weather conditions; and (4) the simplification of the duties of taxpayers in relation to returns and in relation to objections and appeals.'",23
28,Mr EYAN,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH,"That is a sop to prevent further action by the primary producers. Sir JOSE PH COOK - The honourable member always suggests something sinister in connection with anything proposed by the Government. The chairman of the Commission will be Willia m Warren Kerr, CBE., and the other members, John Joseph Garvan, John Jolly, John Gibson Farleigh, Willia m Thomas Missingham, John Thompson, and Stephen Mills, C.M.G. It will be seen that the Commission is being made as widely representative of all interest? as possible. We hope that it will search this question thoroughly with the greatest possible advantage to the taxpayers as a whole.",23

30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENALIZING SHIPPERS BY COMMONWEALTH,"I very much regret that we have not been able, as we desired, to secure a representative upon the Commission of organized labour in Australia. Those representing organized labour were approached, but they refused to take any part in this inquiry. NA BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 2nd September, vide page 4187) :",23
31,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Gwydir) [11.18]. - I move- ' That the following new clause be added:The following section is inserted in the principal Act:"" Independent Industrial Inspectors shall be appointed whose duty it shall be to see that the terms of awards are completely and satisfactorily carried out."" in - My object in submitting this proposal is that awards of the Arbitration Court, having all the force of law, are not now properly carried out, because there are no inspectors appointed to see that their terms are observed by employers. This is not a new proposal, because under certain State Arbitration Acts provision, is made for the appointment of industrial inspectors, whose duty it is to visit factories and other places in which persons are employed under arbitration awards and see that the terms of the awards are properly observed. It is in the interests of industrial peace that this should be done. If industrial inspectors are appointed, as I desire, their work will do away with a good deal of friction that exists today in various industries arising from the fact that the employees have to police the awards themselves. Representatives of labour organizations are thus brought into conflict with employers, and so far fro m an award of the Arbitration Court being of advantage to them, it is often a source of hardship, because they are penalized for desiring to have the award carried out. Under existing conditions, there is a feeling of uncertainty because of the in ability of employers and employees to-properly interpret the terms of an award. No employer can be expected to properly interpret the terms of an award unless he has an intimate knowledge of the whole case in connection with which it was made, and knows what the Court aimed at in making it . Employees suffer because no provision is made for competent inspectors, who will thoroughly understand the terms of an award and be in a position to give a correct interpretation of them. In the pastoral industry I have known misunderstandings to arise between employers and employees because of a difference of opinion as to the proper interpretation of an award of the Arbitration Court. The pastoralist appeals to the Pastoralists Union and the employees appeal to the Australian Workers Union to know how an award should be interpreted. The organizations, may give different interpretations, because they will consider the award from different points of view. Independent inspectors are needed who, in such cases, may be appealed to for an impartial decision as to what was the intention of the Court in making the award. To-day, in the pastoral industry, there is a feeling of dissatisfaction amounting almost to disgust at the way in which many of the employers have failed to observe the terms of awards of the Arbitration Embodied in the award affecting the pastoral industry there"" is a provision for good and sufficient accommodation for employees. In New South Wales that is taken to mean provision in accordance with the Shearers' Accommodation passed by the State Parliament. police administer the provisions of that Act, and, as I have mentioned on previous occasions, that is unsatisfactory the employees for a number of reasons. It should not be the duty of the police to look after these things. They already have too much to do, and the employees in the pastoral industry suffer as a consequence of the false position in which the police are placed with the employers in the industry. To-day the policing of awards of the Federal Arbitration has to be carried out by the organized body of unions at a cost of thousands of pounds. It is - in the interests of the community generally that this policing of awards should be carried out effectively, and as the awards represent the will of the people as expressed through the Arbitration Court, the community, whole, should bear the cost of seeing that they are properly interpreted observed by the employers in order that the employees may receive the full benefit which the Arbitration Court intended that they should receive. At present, because of the lack of independent tors to see that the terms of awards are properly observed, the employers reap a decided advantage which it was never Mr Cunningham. .intended they should be given. Where only five or six men are employed in some remote place, they can secure no redress from their employer as they are not strong enough to go to law with him if the employer put a wrong interpretation on the award. The employees in many of these cases are practically nomadsthey may be here today and 200 miles away tomorrow, or as soon as employment ceases at the particular place where a dispute may occur. Where small bodies of men are employed at places distant from centres of population they suffer because no one is appointed to police awards of the Arbitration Court. I hope that the Minister in charge of the Bill will accept the proposal I submit, because I am confident that the appointment of independent inspectors would prevent friction and would bring about better understanding between emCourt. ployer and employee. . Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.30] - I cannot see my way to accept the proposed new clause which introduces an Act, innovation into this legislation by seeki ijr The to build up an army of inspectors throughout the Commonwealth. There r? no necessity for such a staff. Sect'on 41 to of the Act provides- 'The President and every person authorized in writing hy the President or Registrar may at any time during working hours enter any building, mine, mine working, ship, vessel, place,- or premises of any kind wherein or in respect to which any industry is carried on or any work is being or has been done or commenced, or any matter or thing is taking or has taken place in relation to which any industrial dispute is pending, or any award has Court been made or any offence against this Act is suspected, and may, to the extent and for the purposes named in the authority, inspect and view any work, material, machinery, appliances, or article therein. An amendment which the Committee has already made gives power to inspect also books or documents. Therefore, under as a existing legislation, any person who wishes to inquire as to the carrying out and of an award may get the necessary author it y from the President or Registrar, and make an inspection.",23
32,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,But he must obinspec- tain an authority first.,24
33,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,Yes . Why should the honourable member have a right to enter business premises and demand to see the employer's books?,24
34,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,I do not wish to do that. I ask for the appointment of inspectors to police the award.,25
35,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,But the honourable member said so. There is no necessity for that.,25
36,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,iWh y are they appointed under the State laws?,25
37,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"The honourable member is confusing the Arbitration Act with the ""Factories Act. Under the latter a whole series of duties is imposed, but the conditions of an award are not statutory; they are conditions imposed by a Court, and affect only the parties concerned. Section 41 is similar to the provision in the Acts of New South ""Wales, New Zealand, and Western Australia, and is for the purpose of giving power to see that awards are complied with. Therefore there is no necessity to create a whole army of inspectors to travel all over Australia for the policing, of awards.  [11.35] - I can see no objection to the proposed new clause. The Minister's statement evaded the real issue. Under the State Arbitration Acts provision is made for the appointment of inspectors, whose duty it is to police awards.",25
38,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Queenslan d has inspectors under the Arbitration Act.  . not under the Factories Act, as the Minister stated. I will state a case which illustrates the necessity for policing awards. Inspectors one day entered the premises of a big city firm, whose employees were covered by an Arbitration Court award, and found that no seats had been provided for the female .shop assistants. They were not aware that they were entitled under the award to that accommodation, but when the inspectors pointed out to the employer and to the assistants that the award required seats be provided, that was immediately done. That instance shows that very often employees aTe not aware of the conditions of an award.",25
39,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Eve n if 'they were, and made complaint, they would probably be discharged.  so. There is a necessity for the appointment by the Commonwealth of paid inspectors, whose duty shall be to see that effect is given to the provisions of an award.",25
40,Mr LAVELLE,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Calare) [11.39] - I support the proposed new clause. Last night, when I proposed to insert a similar provision, the Minister (Mr Groom refused to accept it on the ground that it was not constitutional, but his reason for opposing the amendment now ""before the Committee is that the necessary provision is already contained in the Act. If the proposal was unconstitutional last night, it is extraordinary that it should be constitutional this morning. We all know the necessity for having awards policed. It is not fair to throw upon the employees the responsibility of seeing that the awards are observed, because we know - that the employee who calls attention to the 'breach of an award is victimized.",25
41,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"West Sydney) [11.40] The Minister (Mr Groom) in his weak reply to the case made out by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Cunningham), avoided the real issue. The object of the amendment is to secure the appointment of Commonwealth inspectors who will have a full knowledge of the requirements of an award, and be also in sympathy with the workers. The Minister stated that the responsibility of making these appointments did not devolve upon the Commonwealth, because inspectors should be appointed by the States under the Factories Acts, which provide for proper accommodation in industries. In the awards of the Commonwealth Court, there is usually a condition that the accommodation for the employees shall be up to the standard prescribed by the State laws. If the accommodation is not up to that standard, there is a breach of the award, and it is right that such to breach should be followed by a prosecution by a Commonwealth official. The police, who do their ordinary work very efficiently, and are a capable body of men, are too busy to supervise the operation of awards, and should not be expected to do so. The proposed new clause is a reasonable one, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider his refusal to accept it. - Sir. GRANVILLE. RYRIE - Does not the honourable member think that the in spectors should be impartial men.?",25
42,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,Certainly .,26
43,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,The honourable member said that they should be men who were in sympathy with the workers:,26
44,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"They should be in pathy with the spirit of the Act under which they are working. In the pastoral industry, for instance, inspectors should . be in sympathy with the great body of the men engaged in the industry, and with the spirit of the Arbitration Act. The Minister would have no difficulty in selecting suitable men. for policing awards, men experienced in the industry. Does the Assistant Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) object to the principal underlying the amendment ? the Minister would be the judge of the competency and suitability of the men appointed.",26
45,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"It would be very difficult to police awards in the Northern Territory and ""Western Australia. In spectors could not inspect every shearing shed.",26
46,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"The honourable member's suggestion is that we cannot insure that awards are carried out in those remote parts. We are not asking that there should be a paid, inspector in each, shed.",26
47,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,But the would have to travel about.,26
48,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Yes ; he might not be able to visit every shed in each season, but he would cover a good deal, of ground, and in time would visit all sheds. The fact that there are difficulties in the way of. administering a particular law is no argument why an effort should not be made to have it properly administered. I am glad to see that some honourable members opposite are interested in this proposal, and perhaps we may have the support of the Assistant Minister for Defence who, by implication, is in favour of the proposal. Perhaps that honourable gentleman will use his influence with his more recalcitrant colleagues to see that this amendment is adopted.",26
49,Mr LAZZARINI,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Werriwa) [11.46]. - I desire to support the proposed new clause moved by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), as it is a necessary provision to include in such, a measure and would enable awards to be made more effective. In many country industries where arbitration awards apply, there is always a possibility, owing in some cases to ignorance and in others to deliberate intent or carelessness, for some of the provisions of an award not to observed in their entirety. It is i m sym- possible to eSpect State police officers, who operate, under different Acts and authorities, to devote the attention that is necessary to seeing that Commonwealth arbitration awards are full y observed. If the amendment is embodied in the Bill , it will tend to make arbitration more effective and will enable workers to have more confidence in the awards. I cannot speak from actual experience, but I have heard from time to time that an unreasonable burden is Of course, placed on unions in. .the country when they have to undertake this work. In connection with city industries, where in spectors are operating under State awards, it is necessary to have organizers making inquiries, but unfortunately they have to perform their work without authority and in a secretive manner. An effort should be made to avoid that, and the unions should be relieved of the burden by haying properly appointed officials to police the awards. If the amendment is accepted it will be the means of increasing efficiency, and creating more confidence in arbitration generally. In view of the in* dustrial upheavals that occur. from time inspector to time; it is the duty of the Governmenb to accept any amendment which will be 0 the means of creating harmony. The proposal should commend itself to all fair minded people, and I trust that it will have the support of honourable members opposite, because I believe it is one that would be generally acceptable.",26
50,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Dampier) [11.50]:- I rise to draw attention to the fact that it would be difficult to have inspections at shearing sheds, particularly in the back country of Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. I am satisfied that the workmen of Australia are sufficiently intelligent and alert to take care that any award under which they are working is full y observed by the employers. I know the Australian workmen fairl y well, and I rose more particularly to direct attention to a statement made last night concerning 'the remark which I was supposed . to have' made; concerning the Australian workmen. I know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) would not wilfully misrepresent any honourable member in this Chamber. He must have been misled by a statement made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH), who usually expresses himself in a somewhat breezy way, might I say with a breath of "" Ozanne."" That honourable member said that I had slandered the Australian workmen, but after carefully perusing the Hansard report of my speech in reference to a statement made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) that a reduction of hours did not always mean a reduction in outp u t ; I find that there was not the slightFoster, Eichard est justification for such a statement. I referred to the women who worked in factories in England during the war period, and how they had doubled the output of the men.",26
51,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION," Order ! The honourable member is not discussing the proposed new clause, but is making a personal explanation.",27
52,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"I was merely re- Nicholls, S.

I am satisfied that satisfactory inspections could be made in places by the State police, but it would, of course, be impossible for them to visit the remote portions of Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. I desire to refute the statement made last night that I had slandered the Australian workmen.",27
53,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Y a r r a ) [11.53] - Al though I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), it is not my intention to discuss it at this juncture.

Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the Bill be now read a third time.",27
54,Mr CHARITON,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Hunter) [12.5] This B i ll emerges from the Committee stage with amendments, several of which were requested by the organizations concerned, and also by the Arbitratio n Court itself. It had been proved during the operation of the Act that to facilitate matters and insure smooth running, these amendments were necessary. But I desire, as briefly as possible, on behalf of this side of the House, to enter a protest against two of the amendments that have been incorporated in the measure. The first is the amendment of section 8, which provides that any one who instigates or incites any member of an organization to do anything in the nature of a strike shall be Bubject to penalties. The amendment considerably increases the scope of the section in the Act , which we hold was ample for all purposes. It may be held by honourable members that, as the amendment applies to both lockouts and strikes, there can be no objection to it. There is, however, a vast difference between a strike and a lockout; and it i$ most difficult to prove a lockout, as I recall from my experience of industrial arbitration from its inception. In the early day9, under the first Arbitration Act of New South Wales, when I was associated with the late Mr James Curley, organi- general secretary of the Miners Federation, awards were given, but it was found that the conditions of ' work were altered. This alteration of conditions was held not to constitute a lockout, on the ground that the proprietors declared that the mines were open and the men were not stopped from working. Although the men were working undeT an award, they were, told that they ought to return to work, and submit their grievances to the Court. I merely mention this to show the difference in the two positions. We hear much about strikes, but many so-called strikes are only short stoppages of work for reasons such as I have indicated. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act has prevented many big industrial upheavals, and has done much good generally, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary. The amendment of section 8 may involve, not the whole of a union, but, perhaps, only some section of it , and bring about a stoppage of work which will be regarded as a strike, and subject the whole organization to penalties. For that reason we take exception to the clause as it now stands. Now I come to another clause which is even more far-reaching than that to which I have referred. I mean the clause we debated yesterday, which, for the first time in the history of arbitration, makes it imperative that the question of hours shall be determined by at least three Judges. Hitherto one Judge hac been regarded as sufficient to deal with all industrial matters in dispute, and I can see no difference between the question of wages and the question of hours-the two most prominent features of all industrial conditions. In the one case, however, a single Judge is deemed sufficient, while in the other there must be three. We on this side take strong exception to that amendment of the Act. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) last night made it clear"" that the new section wil l not apply to the case now before the Court, and, in my opinion, he did the right thing. I disagree with the new provision altogether; but, in any case, it would have been a wrong procedure, even if the majority of the House considered it necessary, to incorporate a clause of the kind and permit it to apply to a case now being heard. To that extent the debate yesterday did good; it cleared the atmosphere, and, I suppose, has much relieved those concerned in the case before the 'Court. They know now that that case, which they have been fighting for some time, will not be affected by the change in the law. In view of those two amendments, we on this side of the House cannot support the measure as we should have liked to be able to do.",28
55,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"West Sydney [12.10] The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) has made some observations with which I entirely agree, so far as concerns the sins of commission on the part of the Government with regard to certain amendments; but I should like to say a word or two on their sins of omissionwhich are greater than their sins of commission-in connection, not only with the Bill before us, but with the Industrial Peace Bill.",29
56,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,I am afraid you will have no time to do that this session.,29
57,Mr RYAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"I dare say not, but there is one outstanding sin of omission, namely, the failure of the Government to deal with the real cause of most of the industrial unrest in Australia today. The. Government have failed to grapple with the question of profiteering; they have failed to exercise their .powers under the Constitution to deal with what is ths real cause of the dissatisfaction with the decisions of Arbitration Courts and such tribunals. There is no means by which the purchasing power of wages may be kept constant. The Government failed to base the Industrial Peace Bill on all the powers they possess under the Constitution, and hinged it on one .single power. That is like building a superstructure on a narrow foundation of a foot wide, when tliere is a broad base of twelve feet available; and the same remark applies to the Bill now before the House. For those reasons I cannot congratulate the Government on the manner in which they have faced the problem that the people of Australia desired to see faced. They have faced the position ineffectually; and although some of their measures may afford temporary relief, I cannot expect they will result in complete and permanent relief for the future. The Government should have exercised all the powers they possess under the Constitution. There is one power particularly under which the Government may conduct a comp'.ete investigation, and that is the power over taxation. The Commonwealth Parliament has complete power over taxation, and complete power of investigation under that power of taxation. The investigation we have been asking for from this side in regard to profits fiom the point of production until commodities reach the consumer, could be conducted under the taxation power, and the information received could be used under the arbitration power. But the Government have consistently and persistently refused to exercise the power they have, and I forecast that some of the provisions of the measures we have passed, or, at all events, some of the decisions under them, will be held to be unconstitutional. It has been suggested that some of the organizations will be driven out of Arbitration Court because of certain of the amendments that have been introduced into the present Bill by the Government, and will have resort to the Tribunals to be established under the Industrial Peace Bill. That may be, but, if it is so, we shall find that these Tribunals or their decisions will be held to be unconstitutional, and the organizations, driven from pillar to post, will get no complete relief. Therefore, I enter a protest, and a very definite protest, against the persistent, failure of the Government to exercise the powers they possess under the taxation provisions of the Constitution. Until they do exercise those powers we shall not have complete and effective legislation to deal with industrial unrest.",29
58,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Batman) [12.14] There is only matter of principle to which I wish to refer in sending this Bill on its way. As a result of the very vigorous debate that took place in this Chamber yesterday, and consequent on the partially successful efforts, at least, made by members on this side of the House, with the assistance of some members on the other side, we have this result: Those unions which have had the good fortune to be engaged in disputes that have come into issue before the passing of this Bill find, happily for themselves, that the question of the standard of hours is being determined - by an altogether differently constU tuted Tribunal from that which will determine the regulation of hours in future. This circumstance will create inconsistency and, perhaps, heartburning. ' I wish now to direct a final word to one of the fallacies underlying the arguments df some of these vigorous champions of longer hours who addressed themselves to this question yesterday. There can be no doubt in the mind of anybody who listened attentively last evening to the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who entered the chamber at the eleventh hour for the purpose of dragging the Bill out of the difficulties in which some of his own supporters had landed it, that his contention was that in the future the workers sliould work longer hours than they have been accustomed to work. That deliberate challenge to the working classes will not make for industrial amity. it will clear the air by making known what is the policy, not only of those who have consistently opposed Labour, but of those who have rallied to the support of that policy a6 the result of their leaving the Labour ranks. One ' of the fallacies underlying the speech of the right honourable gentleman was the sup-' position that 'the power which the Judge now possesses, .and has possessed for the past sixteen years, in regard to the regulation of hours, necessarily. means that a reduced number of hours will be worked. It means nothing of the kind. It simply enables the. Judge of the Arbitration Court, having regard to all the circumstances of 'the case, and to the special conditions under which work may be performed, to say what, in his view, consti? tutes a fair day's work from the standpoint of the hours of employment. does not prevent employers from enlisting workers t6 work in excess of that period so long as the rate of wages paid in such circumstances is based upon what the Judge assumes to be a fair working week. I think that these two points should be stressed at the conclusion of this debate. Obviously, the intention of the Government is to increase the number of working hours in order that the huge cost of the colossal and tragic war through which we have just 'passed may be borne by the working classes. The second fallacy underlying the statements of honourable members opposite is in supposing that the power which we desired to give to the Judge Mr Brennan. would result either in a reducton of the hours of labour or in a diminution of the output.",29
59,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"Yarra) [12.20] - There is just on'e point to which I directed the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) yesterday, namely, whether it is not possible to simultano; ously convene special conferences in the various States-conference s which would be presided over by Deputy Presidents of the Arbitration Court. I was speaking to the secretary of the Carters and Drivers Union in Melbourne quite recently, and he pointed out that during the influenza epidemic the union desired a special conference to be summoned. The Judge of the Court, however, was reluctant to summon it , because by so doing he would have had - to bring men from States, which were free of influenza, to a State in which But it was prevalent. Had there been power to summon a compulsory conference in the various States, although those bodies might not have .arrived ,at finality, they would have got well forward in , their negotiations.",30
60,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"I am afraid that I have not clearly in my mind the conference 'to which the honourable member refers. , Mr TUDOR - The Bill empowers a special conference to be called, over which a Deputy President may preside. The question is whether ,more than oneconference cannot be called in the States at the same time. If that course could be adopted, we might be able to get to closer grips of the question in dispute. The Minister for Works and Railways proIt mised to consult the Grown Law authorities upon the matter, and stated that, if necessary, he would have the Bill amended in another place in the direction which I have indicated. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that the amendments to which he has referred will not make for that industrial peace which we all desire. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. PAPER. The following paper was presented:War Service Homes Act-r-Land acquired under, at Wollongong,- New South Wales. ARBITRATIO N (PUBLIC SERVICE) BILE. - SECOND READING.. . Mr HUGHES: (Bendigo-Prime - Minister and Attorney-General) [12.24] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is the third of that series of industrial measures which the Government have recently introduced into this Parliament. It has already .received consideration in another place. Its object is primarily to relieve the congestion in the Arbitration Court which has become of so serious a character as to menace the industrial peace of the community. The Bill will remove from the Arbitration Court some thirty-three cases which are now on the list, and-althoug h I am not speaking from the book- I think that will reduce the numiber of cases listed, by at least one half. It is prima facie a most desirable thing that those disputes which did menace the welfare of the country, and which could not be heard because of the congestion to which I haye Teferred, should have ampler opportunities for being dealt with. The Bill is intended to supersede the existing Public ServiceArbitration Act except asregardsthe - claims which are pending. ' It does not affect the claimsthat. have been part heard.: The existing law was enacted at the. instance of' a Government of which I had. the honour to be a member. As a matter of fact, I think that it was introduced by myself. It was introduced as the result of widespread' dissatisfaction in the Public Service against a system which did not afford any appeal from the Public Service Commissioner's decision, and which cut off public servants from those other avenues of redress which were open to the ordinary citizen in his capacity as employee. In practice, however, it has been found that the circumstances of the public servants of the Commonwealth, governed as they are by the laws of the Commonwealthj and regulated as they are most precisely by the regulations under the Public Service Act, render inevitable an eternal conflict between the awards of the Court and the regulations to which I . have referred, which, of course, derive their authority from the statutory law enacted by this Parliament. As honourable members are aware, the Public Service Act, dealing as it does with many thousands of men who are engaged in very many different branches of very many occupations, is a most complex mechanism. When an Act and the regulations thereunder govern the salary, the conditions of labour, the circumstances of promotions, &c, of every individual, it must be very apparent that a stranger coming into a dispute between public servants and the Commonwealth must be at a loss to thread his way through the ramifications of the statutory provisions and the regulations thereunder, and at the same time to understand the bearing which an award in respect of one section of the Public Service has upon another section. The Public Service is a homogeneous structure. The principle upon which it is based is that promotions shall be determined, other things being equal, by length of service. And the relations between grades A and B are such that the distances between them must always 'be observed; so that to lift up Grade A involves a similar increase for Grade B, and similarly for Grades 0 and D. It must be obvious, then, that a man who is not habituated to the Service would find himself at a great disadvantage when he came to deal.with it. That is one factor for consideration. The other is that the congestion in the. Arbitration Courtblocked, as it is, by Public Service claims - seriousl y hinders those - industrial disputes which menace the peace of the 1 community from being considered. The Bill, beyond proposin? the appointment of a person who is referred to as an Arbitrator, but who, for all practical purposes will be a Judge of the Public Service Arbitration Court, leaves public, servants in exactly the same position as art present. They will have this advantage, however, that their cases will be dealt with much more speedily than today, and by a man who will be thoroughly informed of the interests - and general conditions of the Public Service, for the reason that his business will be confined within the four corners of the Public Service Act. Theprinciple of arbitration, for the settlement of disputes in the Public Service by an appeal from Ctesar-that is to say, the Public Service. Commissioner-is one. which T took up many years ago at the instance of the public servants themselves, and they not only approved of that principle, but most heartily supported it . The Arbitrator now proposed to be appointed will differ from a Judge only in name, and if any honourable member cares to move for an alteration in that particular aspect, I be prepared to listen to him. If any honourable member were to move that the Arbitrator should not be a lawyer-and in this matter I look for support as well as consolation fro m my friend the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan)- I would be prepared to consider the proposition. The point is that the Arbitrator can be a layman, or he can be a lawyer. W it h the exception of this appointment of a special Judge, or Arbitrator, I emphasize that public servants will find themselves in exactly the same position as at present, only that they will be able to have their cases more speedily dealt with. Awards, as they are made, will be dealt with exactly as in the case of awards of the Arbitration .Court today. That say, they will be required to be laid on the table of Parliament for thirty days before coming into effect.",30
61,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,What is the procedure when Parliament is not sitting ?,32
62,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,It is necessary to wait until it does sit.,32
63,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"The last occasion when a position such as that arose was on the last day of our sitting prior to the recent adjournment in connection with the visit of the Prince of Wales. There were then some six or eight awards which would have become operative within a day two. In view of the fact of the adjourni ment of Parliament when those awards had not remained on the table 'for quite the full number of days, the Prime ter promised that the parties concerned Chamber. would be paid their increased wages from that period; that is to say, they would not lose by the fact of the adjournAnd, ment.",32
64,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"That is so. The vernment will be prepared to insert i this Bill such amendments as may deemed necessary in order to preclude the possibility of people concerned being shut out by some mere technicality. Still, this Parliament, too, has its rights. The Arbitrator might make an award to do with the Service. the effect that certain public servants should not receive the promotion which they considered their due; or he might institute a reduction of salaries owing to a decrease in. the cost of living. Parliament should see to it that it Tetains all its rights in view of such possibilities. There is little further to whioh I would will direct the attention of honourable members - I repeat that all the Bill proposes to do'is to create a.Public 'Service A r b i tration Court. Presiding over it would be one who could be either a lawyer or a layman, but who would be concerned in no other interests. Honourable members must admit that this will be a far better method of dealing with Public Service affairs than that which exists today, where a Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is required to give so much of his attention to a Public Service matter arising as he may be able to spare in the course of dealing with industrial problems emanating from any and every industry throughout the land. The tenure of office of the A r b i trator will be, for all practical purposes, to the same as that of a Judge. He can be appointed for a term of seven years, and w i ll be eligible for re-appointment. W it h respect to salary, no specific sum is stated in the Bill . In another place, however, the amount of £2,000 per annum was mentioned. The >Goverriment will listen to suggestions concerning salary, but the specific amount cannot be inserted u n t i l an appropriation shall have been secured. I a3k honourable members not to forget that we have now been giving extensive consideration to the subject of arbitration, or in varied phases. There is nothing new n this measure such as could invoke those thunderous denunciations, or those pathetic appeals, which, at various stages of Minisyesterday's debate, were heard in this This is a Bill which violates as no principle and introduces no innovation. It rests upon abundant precedent. further, it is quite right that the measure should take the form which it Gohas done; for, after all, we shall be n shortly considering a Bill to amend the be Public iService Act, when honourable members will be able, if they desire, to re-adjust the whole basis of Public Service salaries, or the system of entrance, or any other matter, indeed, having to",32

115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"He does not make many complaints; but the promotion of officers on the basis of seniority alone may lead to picked men of the Auditor-General's Department transferred to other branches of the Service. Under the process of seniority, men who have been trained there for many years may be transferred to a position in another Department for which they are quite unfit. In the same way, there may be sent to the Auditor' General's Department officers who, however competent to discharge the duties of other branches of the Public Service, are not skilled in the work of auditing accounts. The absolute independence of the Auditor-General, who has the checking of the whole of the accounts of the Commonwealth, is one of our greatest safeguards. This clause was deliberately inserted in the Bill in order that he might be made supreme in his own Department. As to the objection raised that under the clause as it stands officers of the Auditor General's Department would not be eligible for transfer to other Departments, and so would be deprived of opportunities for promotion, I would make the fullest provision for such cases.

We need a. much stronger reason than that for agreeing to this amendment.

121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,The Committee unanimously accepted them.,36
122,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND AEBITEATION,"But they were not discussed at length. As to the suggestion made by the honourable member (Mr . MCWilliams), that an officer who had been trained in the A u d it Office might be transferred to another Department, I do not think that such a transfer is made unless the officer concerned applies for it . One of the most notable cases in point is that of Mr Whitton , the present Acting Comptroller-General of Customs. Mr. Whitton , who is a very capable officer, was employed in the A u d it Department, and, at his own request, was transferred from it to the Department of Trade'and Customs. I fai l to see how we can make the A u d it office a "" water-tight "" Department. As a matter of fact, the Victorian Government complain that it has been necessary to increase the salaries of State public servants because the Commonwealth is taking away some of its very best men. The Auditor-General's staff should consist of trained specialists. In order that the work of the Department may be effective, the Auditor-General must have an ample staff. Where we are spending many millions of pounds annually, irregularities are sure to occur, and, therefore a careful and expert checking of accounts is necessary.",36

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's amendments) :",38
146,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.38] - I move That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. Certain amendments have been made by the Senate, at my suggestion, in clauses 5 and 6 of this Bill . Honourable members Or specialists will recollect that these clauses were put through in this House at rather a late stage of our proceedings; the work was hurriedly done, and, as a result, we - did not express exactly what we-intended, and, possibly, did something that we did not intend to do at all. In clause 5 cf the Bill , as we passed it , it was provided that the Institute should "" c o m p r i Bureau of Agriculture, a Bureau of I dustry, and such other bureaux as the Governor General determined. of the word "" comprise "" did not convey exactly what we intended to do. intended to provide for the establishment of bureaux. Then the use of the word "" In d u s try "" did not convey what intended. We intended to cover the estion tablishment of a Bureau of Industries, as distinct fro m Agriculture, and word "" Industry "" carries rather the meaning of work or labour. Senate, clause 5 has been amended by the substitution of the word "" establish for the word "" comprise,"" and. the subpaid stitution of the word "" Industries "" for the word "" Industry."" In dealing with clause 6, we agreed to an amendment providing that the Governor General might appoint Advisory Boards in each State to advise the Director. It is f u l whether that would not preclude from establishing a Central Advisory Board if we wished to do so. It was not our intention to prevent the establishand ment of a Central Advisory Board, and so clause 6 has been amended by the Senate to readThe Governor General may appoint a General Advisory Council and Advisory Boards each State to advise the Director. I know that that is what honourable memcould bers had it in mind to provide when the Bill was under consideration here. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. PAPUA BILL. SECOND READING.  Home and Territories) [2.42] - I.move That this Bill be now read a second time. This-might be termed a Bill for an do justice that has been long deferred. The facts with which it deals, are very simple. When they were brought under my notice I felt that an injustice been done, and submitted the matter the Cabinet, who approved of what is proposed in fhis Bill . In 1896 a lease was granted of a group of small islands called the Conflict Group by. the original Government of 'New Guinea, before the Commonwealth took over the Territory. In that lease there was provision right - to purchase - the -' land included s e"" a the lease at 5s. per acre: ThePapua n - Act,, passed by the; Commonwealth Parliament, came into foroe on the 1st SepThe use tember, 1:906. In August, 1906, Mr . Wickham applied to exercise his righ t of We purchase. The matter appeared to be all in order, the conditions of the lease had been fulfilled, and the local Execuwas tive of Papua approved of the preparaand issue of a grant in fee-simple. The grant and deed were prepared. It the was then discovered that there was a difference of opinion as to the area In the covered by the lease, and some little delay occurred in connection with that. "" Por instance the Government claim to be on 6,000 acres, but it was proved, after further inquiry, that the area in volved was only 1,800 acres. The delay caused in investigating these facts prevented the title being granted in the doubtterms of the lease. The Papua Act of us 1905 includes this provisionThe Lieutenant-Governor may make and execute under the public seal of the Territory"", in thename and on 'behalf of the King, grants dispositions of any land within the Territory which may be lawfully granted or disposed of in the name of the King, but so that(a) no freehold estate in any such land shall be granted or disposed of. . . . in Owing to the delays I have mentioned, that law was passed before the title be issued. There is only one case of this character in the whole of Papua. AB ill relating to the matter was introduced some years ago, but was crowded out at the end of the session; but Mr . Isaacs, the then Attorney-General, gave an opinion that, whilst legally there' was no power to grant the title, yet on moral and equitable grounds the lessee was undoubtedly entitled to get the fee-simple - in the terms of the original agreement. He suggested an amending Bill to enable Act to that to be done. There has been a good deal of correspondence in regard to this claim, and recently the lessee instituted legal proceedings against the Commonhad wealth. I and the Acting Attorneyto General (Mr Groom) investigated the matter thoroughly, and we were satisfied that, on equitable grounds, the lessee had a very strong case. We agreed that it was not right that the Government should take advantage of a technicality to prevent hi m getting his title. This Bill was fora introduced accordingly, and the legal in proceedings have been suspended pending the decision of Parliament. The measure has been already agreed to by another place. Debate (on motion by Mr CHABXTON) adjourned. CENSUS AND STATISTICS BILL . SECOND READING .  Home and Territories) [2.50] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The census must be taken next year, and the officials have asked for this amending Bill in order that their work may be facilitated. Most of the amendments are of a verbal character, and are designed to make the language of the Act clearer; they involve no new principle. The first amendment is merely consequential. The second aims at a more uniform collection of census information from the shipping on the Australian coast. The third amendment is for the purpose of simplifying the taking of the census in outlying portions of the State. At present, a justice of the peace is required to make affidavits in ' certain circumstances. The Bill proposes to simplify the procedure. Clause 4 substitutes the word "" buildi n g "" for "" d w e l l in g "" on the ground that the word "" b u i l d in g "" will equally well express the intention, and will not be open to the objection of inconsistency. All the other amendments are simple, in volving no principle, but merely altering the verbiage in the original Act, and I think they are essentially matters for discussion in Committee rather than on the second reading. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) adjourned. NAVIGATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 9th July, vide page 2683) : Clause 73Section 231 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in stead:""231. (1) Except as .prescribed, foreign-going ship, Australian-trade ship, or ship engaged in the coasting trado(a) carrying more than twelve passengers, or (o) being of' 1,G00 tons gross registered tonnage or upwards, shall be provided with a wireless telegraph installation, and shall maintain a wireless copy telegraph service, as prescribed, be provided with one or more certificated operators and watchers, as required by the regulations.

Motion (by Mr Ryan ) again proposed - That the clause be postponed.",38
147,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Hunter) [2.58] The clause empowers the Minister to exempt certain classes of ships if he is of opinion that the provision of a wireless telegraph apparatus is unnecessary or unreasonable. I assume that he will grant exemptions to small steamers engaged in carrying passengers on the rivers and elsewhere.,40
148,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"The exemption applies to all ships under 1,600 tons gross register.",40
149,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"If the provision refers only to vessels over 1,600 tons gross register, the small vessels to which I have referred will not come under this particular clause.",40

I have been informed its by the representatives of the Seamen's Union that the Minister has agreed to every introduce certain amendments.,40
153,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That is so.,40
154,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"That , of course, will mean that we will have to reconsider certain clauses. I have received from the representatives of the Seamen's Union a of the clauses which have and shall been accepted and those which have not been agreed to, and which they are desirous that I should move to amend. I know that the questions which have been considered do not affect this particular clause, and perhaps, strictly speaking. I am hardly in order in referring to them at this particular stage, because we are at present dealing with the provision relating to wireless telegraphy.",40
155,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"We shall recommit the clauses which affect the amendments to which we have agreed. Mr TTJDOB, - In connection with the clauses which the seamen desire to have amended-on e in particular, relating to penalties-wil l the Minister for Trade and Customs, when recommitting various clauses, give us an opportunity of recommitting those provisions which we desire to amend?",41
156,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"I hardly think it can be done in that way- I speak subject, of course, to correction from the Chair-because it would not be practicable to recommit clauses which are not in the Bill . The amendments could not be made in that way, but I presume it is open to the Leader of the Opposition to take whatever action he desires .at the proper time.",41
157,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Will I have an opportunity of referring to section 100 ?,41
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,We are dealing with this Bill and not the principal Act. But it will be possible for the honourable gentleman at a later stage to take whatever action he considers necessary in regard to any section in the principal Act.,41
159,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"T he representatives of the Seamen's Union have taken exception to the clause relating to shipwrights, and also the provision relating to protection for the wheel-house. I understand the representatives of the Seamen's Union have discussed the wheel-house question with the Minister.",41
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,J have agreed to deal with the wheel-house question.,41
161,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Then we shall have an opportunity later?,41
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"The Leader of the Opposition can make the opportunity, because he can move to insert a new clause if he so desires.",41
163,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,I cannot do that if the section has already been passed.,41
164,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"I am prepared to give this undertaking: In regard to any clause in the Bill before the Committee, and which we have passed, and in connection with which the seamen have brought up 1 any question which they are still pressing, or which we have agreed to amend, those clauses will be recommitted. But in regard to any other matter which is not in the Bill , and in connection with which we have not come to an agreement with the Seamen's Union, it is open to the Leader of the Opposition to take whatever course he deems necessary.",41
165,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"In view of the Minister's explanation, I am prepared to allow the question to remain for the present. The clause before the Committee deals with wireless telegraphy, and during the discussion on the second reading of the Bill I stated that I was afraid that the provision was not sufficiently wide or as favourable to persons travelling by sea as that contained in the principal Act . I have since been assured by the Minister that it is.",41
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That is so.,41
167,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"When previously discussing this question, I quoted from the report of the Maritime Conference which sat after the Titanic disaster, and said that I was afraid that the provision was not sufficiently broad. If the clause is to apply to vessels of 1,600 tons gross register it will include practically the whole of our colliers. There may be a - number of smaller vessels which do nob carry twelve passengers, and on which wireless telegraphy should be installed. The Department of Trade and Customs were in possession of a trawler which was built twelve years ago, and which did not have a wireless plant. The vessel to which I refer was lost on a voyage to Macquarie Island, and it is more than likely that if she had been equipped with wireless the disaster might have been averted. Quite recently a vessel belonging to the British Imperial Oil Company discharged a consignment of oil in New Zealand, and when on her way to Australia for a cargo of coal became disabled. In consequence of a mechanical breakdown the vessel was delayed at sea until her coal supplies were depleted, and it was some time before relief was forthcoining. There are many instances which couid be quoted to show the necessity of vessels which carry less than twelve passengers being equipped with a wireless plant. It is unnecessary to slavishly follow the recommendations of the Maritime Conference.",41
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,We have gone further.,41
169,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) is a wireless - expert, doubtless he will give the Committee the benefit of his knowledge and experience. Since we passed the original measure in 1912 considerable advance has been made in connection with wireless telegraphy, and it should be made compulsory for small vessels, whether owned by the Government or private companies, to be fitted with wireless. Apar t from the limitations regarding the number of passengers and the gross tonnage of a vessel, the route and the distance to be traversed should also be considered, because some of the routes taken, even by Inter-State vessels, are not frequently traversed. Vessels passing Wilson's Promontory are frequently in fairl y close proximity, whereas those trading between Melbourne and Launceston or Burnie are usually some distance apart. It is possible for a vessel to .be in Bass Straits, and although comparatively near the mainland, to be in an unfrequented "" lane.""",42
170,Mr GABB,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,* I desire to draw attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum .formed..],42
171,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Parkes) [3.15] - Like the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor), I am placed at a disadvantage, owing to the fact that it is a considerable time since we dealt with this measure, and my notes are not exactly at hand. This clause may not have had. given to it the consideration which it deserves and which I hope it will receive. Under .the present Act , as it is proposed to amend it , much power is given to the Minister in the matter of exemptions, with which I do not altogether agree, because I fancy the result may be somewhat harsh in the case of vessels that are dodging about the coast from port to (port in Queensland or New South Wale's. I agree with the honourable member (Mr Tudor) that we must differentiate between vessels which go a considerable distance, and do not come into contact with other ships, or get in touch with lighthouses.",42
172,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,I mean lighthouses and signalling stations; all lighthouses are not signalling stations.,42
173,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That is owing to the fact that many of the lighthouses are being made automatic.,42
174,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"That is the trouble. As I say, the measure may act harshly in the case of small boats on the coast.",42
175,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That is what the power of exemption is given for.,42
176,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"It is provided that all vessels proceeding twenty miles or more should be provided with wireless, as stipulated by the Convention held after the Titanic disaster. Another matter to which we should give consideration is connected with . the provision of wireless sets. In very few cases are these sets, sold to ship-owners; they are rented at a minimum rental of £250 per annum, and, in addition to that, must be reckoned the cost of £250 per annum for an operator. These sets can be obtained practically only from the Marconi Company, and, as they are compulsory, shipowners aTe forced into the hands of that company. There is no doubt that this cost will be passed on to travellers, and this will operate very hardly in the case of small boats on the coast that carry passengers at cheap fares."" These passengers will either have to pay a prohibitive rate or find some other means of travelling. The small boats, on the coast should not be compelled to carry wireless unless one of the crew can be got to work it , and that may prove difficult. The exemption clause is rather vague, and I regret very much that I have not the report of the Convention with me in order to refer more f u l ly to this matter. However, there are occasions when it is necessary to give a decision promptly, and, therefore, the clause may be necessary in order to clothe the Minister with the necessary authority. Paragraphs 4 and 5 are a duplication of the provisions in the Wireless Telegraphy Act. No ship ought to be permitted to proceed to sea unless in possession of a certificate; but, as the Bill stands, inspectors may be appointed by the Director, or they may not. The Wireless Telegraphy Act makes provision for the appointment of inspectors, and for every officer in charge of a land station to be made an inspector under the Act. As the matter stands, if the wireless authorities say that it is necessary for a ship to do a certain thing, they cannot compel the Navigation Department to act, and there should be some Department with authority to see that orders are enforced.",42
177,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Are . we using standard wireless here?,42
178,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Do you mean, are we insing the Marconi system?",42
179,Mr TTJDOK,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Are we using the system general throughout the world?,43
180,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"At one time, the Marconi and the Telefunken people had a monopoly, but recently American vessels have used the continuous-wave telegraphy, and no other ship can take their messages..",43
181,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,What has happened to the Balsillie system?,43
182,Mr MAER,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"That is owned by the Commonwealth, and is a conglomeration of all kinds of systems. The Commonwealth stations are simply receiving stations, such as might be set up in this House, for instance, with a very limited radius. The Wireless Telegraphy Act and the Navigation Act require co-ordinating, so as to give the control of the telegraphy into the hands of one Department. ' At the present moment, the Navigation Department can snap its fingers at the wireless telegraphy authorities. When an inspector goes on board a ship in port, he finds there is no steam up, so that it is impossible to test the wireless set; and', moreover, he finds that the capoffices, tain, as is usual, has gone ashore with his papers. A vessel may not clear a port until the papers are cleared, and a wireless certificate should be attached: for every trip.",43
183,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Then you think it is a.= necessary to inspect the wireless set as it is to have fire and boat drill?,43
184,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"I do. Paragraph 4 of the clause .provides for a surveyor, "" or other person authorized by the Minister,"" to inspect installations; but the Minister may not authorize a surveyor.",43
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,The Minister would not authorize an incompetent person.,43
186,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"That , of course, is the common-sense view. Many of the suggestions I am making can be covered by regulation, and I hope that they will. There is nothing in the Act stimulating what kind of set shall be provided, how many spares shall be carried, where the wireless shall be situated, or what provision shall be made to safeguard the operators. These are matters that clearly ought to beprovided for. On some of the big ocean liners, not once, but dozen times, I have seen the aerials so situated that they could not be worked efficiently. I have even seen - hem tied to life-boats in order to keep them from fouling the funnels; so that in time of danger, when the boats are cut loose, the wireless is rendered useless. Every ship, I say, should carry a specified number of spares.",43
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That can be done by regulation; and I am very glad of the suggestions of the honourable member.,43
188,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Then , again, volt meters are required to register the pressure of electricity, and they should be on the engine side of the switchboard, for the convenience of the inspector. Perhaps the most important times on a vessel are represented by the two hours after leaving port and the two hours prior to entering port; and at present there is nothing to compel the operator to be on the wntch during those periods. At such a time, when approaching port, the vessel is reporting when it will be enterine the Heads, and may be expected .°t the wharf; and in this resrardat Rvrluev. wireless has meant auite as much to the Waterside Workers Federation as to the ship-owners. Without wireless, the workers have to go to the various postconsult the charts, and make their own calculation as to the time of arrival, only to be told, on arriving at the wharf, that the vessel is only_ reported at the Heads. Wireless is also of advantage to the owners, inasmuch as it gives them the, right to send the noon position and the midnight position for 6d. in any part of the world. The Arbitration Court comes into conflict with the working of vessels in regard to the hours during whic ^ n 1, may be on watch. It is not possible for the Arbitration Court to lay down a hard-and-fast rule that a man shall' be on watch during certain hours, as the ship may be irr a position in which wire-' less will be of no use to it . In my opinion, the Arbitration Court ought not to interfere in that direction as much as it has done. Mr Riley: - But the Minister has agreed to embody new suggestions in the regulations which will be framed under the Bill.",43
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,And the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) is merely making certain suggestions in order that half-a- I may have them before me.,43
190,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"There is another matter to which I desire to refer, namely, the emergency wireless set. As most honourable members are aware, it often happens that, at the very moment when the wireless set upon a ship is most needed, the engine-room is flooded, so that the wireJess operator on board is compelled to fall back upon the emergency set. This set is usually located upon the highest point of the vessel. It consists merely of a coil and batteries, and has no range worth mentioning. I suggest, therefore, that there should be an emergency means of driving the proper wireless set.",43
191,Mr RILEY,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,How can that be accomplished ?,44
192,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"By means of an auxiliary method of driving the main rotary. I suggest that a small oil-engine should be installed in the wireless room, so that it can be thrown into gear for the purpose of working the main wireless set, in the event of that set which is usually driven from the engine-room becoming suddenly isolated from it.",44
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,That would make the wireless installation very expensive.,44
194,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Yes ; but if it is going to save life at sea the expense is justifias able. Mr Laird .SMITH -'Canno t secondary batteries be used?,44
195,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Secondar y batteries are very unsatisfactory in operation, and usually require a lot of attention. I suggest the incorporation in the regulations of a provision that the licence shall specify the apparatus in detail, and enumerate the list of spares which are to be carried, including a spare aerial and jury aerial. The wireless cabin is another thing which closely affects the ship's safety and the safety of the operator who is confined within its walls. Usually it has only one means of ingress and egress. Almost invariably when the ship is in danger the door of the cabin cannot be opened, so that it is impossible for the operator to get out. I consider that the wireless cabin should be placed as near to the navigating bridge as possible, and that it should be fitted with two doors, one upon either side, so that, no matter drills). from what quarter danger may threaten, the operator will always have a means of escape. There should also be direct means of communication between the wireless cabin and the navigating bridge, either by telephone or by a speaking tube. I further suggest that where power is not available when ships are due for inspection, it should be made available. No doubt we should hit the smaller ships pretty hard if we compelled them to pay operators high salaries and to carry two operators. But this difficulty might be overcome in the way that it has been overcome upon the Commonwealth line of steamers, namely, by training men to act as pursers and also as wireless o|)erators. Of course, that wculd be in addition to the ordinary wireless operator.",44
196,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,Is it difficult to acquire the art of working wireless?,44
197,Mr MARR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"It takes time. A young man can learn to operate in six months if he is smart. Anybody can work a wireless set while everything goes right, but it takes years of training to enable a man to locate and rectify faults when things go wrong. If , however, we provide that vessels shall carry a good wireless operator, the purser might be trained to assist him, and in that way he would gain valuable experience. Personally, I would rather see a man trained as an operator first and a purser afterwards. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), in discussing this measure on the 9th July last, suggested that any vessel carrying twelve men, including passengers and crew, should be fitted with a wireless installation. I agree with him that if a ship is about to voyage to the South Pole she should be fitted with wireless, but if she is merely engaged in trading along the coast of New South Wales to the northern rivers of that State, I am of opinion that the installation of wireless would not be necessary. I would rather see these small vessels exempt from such a provision than hit hard the people who travel upon them by causing a considerable increase in the fares at present being charged, and thus forcing them to forgo the trips along our coast which they are now enjoying. Motion withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 74 agreed to. Clause 75 (Boat, collision and fire",44
198,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Yarra) [3.44] - Since the outbreak of war, and owing to the submarine campaign, fire drills have been made much more effective upon vessels than they were previously. Formerly they were practically a farce. I know that upon the vessel by which I voyaged to America and England there was never a fire drill carried out. Before the war the boats were practically fastened to the boat-chocks, so that i i an attempt had been made to swing them out from the davits, they would surely have fallen to pieces. I trust that in the future the Navigation Department will see that all boats are swung out from the davits at least once a month. A home port should be provided for each vessel, and it should be the business of the inspector there to see that this procedure is followed. Clause agreed to. Clauses 76 to 79 agreed to. Clause 80Section 246 of the principal Act is repealed.",44
199,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,I should like to know the nature of the section which we are asked to repeal.,45
200,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.45] - - Clauses 76 - to 80 deal with the one subject, namely, that ..of gear. The reason for the. repeal of certain sections of the principal Act is that, for purposes of convenience, all tbose portions dealing with the subject matter of gear and the like have been re-arranged in the amending Bill ; and - that has entailed various deletions and alterations. Our navigation legislation will now be more satisfactorily compiled and consolidated. Originally, section 246 made it indictable to use gear of a character considered to be unsafe and a source of danger to life and limb. That reference has now been transferred under sub-section 3 of section 236, which is typical of the re-arrangements to which I have referred.",45
201,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"F r a n k l in) [3.46]. - I desire to call attention to a .matter regarding provision for unloading. Something ought to be done to facilitate the unloading of vessels. Visiting Newcastle the other day, I was informed that certain modern provision had been made, by the use of a shoe, for the protection of wharf labourers when engaged in unloading; steel rails. The rails were fitted into the shoe, and about, six at a time were lifted . However, objection was taken to this method of unloading. The men would not use it . .Probably they regarded it as doing the work too quickly. Therefore, the use of the shoe had to be abandoned. The method of unloading now is to lift one rail or two rails at a time, in the most dangerous manner imaginable; that is, by the antiquated' fashion of employing slings. What is the good of making provision, by the institution of modern methods, for the protection of life and limb if the men engaged refuse to handle such gear and prefer to return to the more dangerous and the antiquated way, simply because work under the modern method is being done too quickly ?",45
202,Mr GABB,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,What cause has the honourable member for saying that that is the reason why the use of the shoe was abandoned ?,45
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,"I was on the spot and secured my information first hand. The process of discharging coal is about as slow and antiquated as can well be imagined. One of the reasons why there is such a scarcity of coal in Melbourne today is that, owing to some dispute in which the State Government and the Federal Government, and the Harbor Trust and the ship-owners have been involved, an out-of-date system of unloading exists. The result is that vessels, which should be discharged in twenty-four to thirty hours, are not discharged in less than five or six days. That, very largely, accounts for the shortage in coal in Victoria today. I emphasize that, while insisting upon the use of proper gear, our legislation should also see to it that, when modern methods are installed, they shall be operated. Clause agreed to.

205,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTEOF SCIENCE AN D,I cannot answer that question offhand. I understand that the Act and its regulations are gradually petering out of themselves. Why not let them die a natural death? Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.55 p.m.,45
